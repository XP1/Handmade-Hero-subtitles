1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,400
Start, there we go.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,300
Okay.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero day.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,400
46.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,300
This is, of course, the show where we code complete game from scratch

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,600
live on the internet's using nothing.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,400
But our own little typing finger is no engines.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,500
No.

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,300
Libraries basically as an educational process project and as sort of a

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,900
just a fun project, because there's something pretty fun about kind of

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,900
learning how absolutely everything works and being able to have

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,800
control over thing, you know, through the entire pipeline.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,300
That's very satisfying and kind of all those things.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,700
I think everyone should do at least once.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,600
So anyway, without further Ado, we have we kind of left off on Friday,

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,900
implementing some Collision detection stuff and I want to get back to

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,100
that.

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,700
But before I do, I should point out that if you pre-ordered the source

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,100
code on handmade hero dot-org.

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,400
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,100
If you pre-ordered the game on him a hero, org, you have full access

22
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,100
to the source code.

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,400
So you should have got the link in your email in that link.

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,800
There will be a zip file and that zip file has Zips for every day.

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,000
So we're on day 46.

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,400
So you want to unzip day 45 source code from inside that zip file.

27
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,200
I'll so that you can be exactly where we are as we start coding right

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
now, because that'll put you exactly where I am.

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,700
If you want to follow along at home, which I highly recommend you do

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,600
because that's the best way to learn is kind of being able to follow

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,000
along and play around with things yourself and, you know, keep on

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,100
going after the show ends to kind of, see if you can play around with

33
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,200
stuff and make sure you really understand everything that we did.

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,100
So that's said, let's take a look at where we were so if you remember

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,700
correctly.

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,900
We were at the point where we were trying to fix basically are

37
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,600
sticking problem, which is that right there because we didn't really,

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,600
we didn't really have a really good Collision Loop and we need to

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,400
start working on that because we started to do our character motion

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,600
and it was getting a little bit of a better feel to it.

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
But we need to start working on that Collision problem.

42
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,400
So before we do that, we have to address something, which is actually

43
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,300
pretty hilarious that nobody noticed except for one person on the

44
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,400
forums, and I didn't even notice it because I actually

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,300
Thought I mean it was something that we were going to get to

46
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,400
eventually, but I didn't think we need to quite get to it yet because

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,000
I actually thought something was happening that was not happening.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,300
So this will be pretty interesting and I'll show you, I'll give you

49
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,100
the full walk down here.

50
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,400
So if you remember correctly, we basically have a our little, our code

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,700
here, that processes controller input.

52
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,800
And basically, it does controller is analog, it would do some stuff.

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
And if it's not then it uses digital movement, right?

54
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,100
And I was under the impression that, oh, yeah, right.

55
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,200
We're only going to call this once rolling.

56
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,400
It.

57
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,100
This Branch once because as we Loop over all the controllers, there's

58
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,200
only one digital controller at the moment, right?

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,700
There's only one digital controller, which is the keyboard, right?

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,300
So I don't have to worry about the fact that this would happen

61
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,600
multiple times if you had multiple digital controllers in their blah,

62
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,400
blah, blah, but what actually happens at least or so sayeth, the

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,100
forums, and I believe them because I hadn't looked at it yet.

64
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,200
Whereas my, let's see.

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,800
Let's see.

66
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,700
Let's go to.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,200
Handmade dot CPP.

68
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,800
There we go.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,900
So I believe what actually happens is, that's not how they're actually

70
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
set at the moment.

71
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,400
So when we come in here, right, I'm going to set a breakpoint and take

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,900
a look at what happens in this Loop.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,700
If we look at controller index, I'll go ahead and add controller index

74
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
to the watch window here.

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,300
Controller index.

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
Let's take a look at what happens.

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,300
So, we're on controller index 0.

78
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,600
We're going to go through here and do the player movement code, which

79
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,300
is what we want to have happen, because that's the keyboard.

80
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,600
And then

81
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,700
Unfortunately, we still have on the on the analog sticks.

82
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,500
They are not have not been set to controller is analog.

83
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,000
And so actually, we're going to do this player movement code, five

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,600
times.

85
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
Now, that would be fine.

86
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,300
If it wasn't for the fact that that basically means the player, the

87
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,400
the little guy will move five times.

88
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,200
This the distance he supposed to move and it will not be using the

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
controller input properly.

90
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,900
So really, we did not want to be doing this at all.

91
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,200
Like, that's totally bogus and not at all, right?

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,600
And somehow, we all missed it.

93
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,900
Myself included.

94
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,200
And like I said, that was just a pure on pure sort of oversight on my

95
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
part because I just assumed, oh, right?

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
We were setting, the is analog.

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
But now that I think about it, I believe what was actually happening

98
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,899
in our win32 layer is we only actually set is analog, once they

99
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,899
actually use that stick at all.

100
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,800
And if they don't ever use the stick, it'll just be default to be not

101
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
in log, which is totally fine.

102
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,500
It just means that this is not okay at all.

103
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,600
So at this point, we have to sort of think about what we

104
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,700
Actually want to do here and it's something that I didn't really want

105
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,800
to have to deal with quite yet.

106
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
But at the same time it's not really any there's no reason we can't

107
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,700
deal with it right now.

108
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,000
It just doesn't fit in our Collision detection, sort of stuff.

109
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,000
But so I kind of want to just think out loud a little bit about how we

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
want to handle this going forward.

111
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,400
Because here's the thing that we actually want to be able to do and to

112
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,200
some extent, we don't really know whether we actually will ever need

113
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,100
this in handmade hero, but we should think about it regardless of

114
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,600
whether we need it or not because it just it's it's it's something

115
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,500
that can be done as far as an abstract abstract thought experiment.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,700
So basically there's some number of controllers attached to the

117
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,800
machine, right?

118
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,900
There's, you know, a keyboard there might be an Xbox controller or a

119
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,600
PlayStation controller or something like this that are attached to the

120
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,400
machine and even if there's only one player, you kind of have to think

121
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,100
about which of those controllers maps to that player, right?

122
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,900
One school of thought would be all of the controllers always map to

123
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,400
the player.

124
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,800
If it's only one player, right?

125
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,500
So, it's like, it doesn't matter what controller you pick up, you can

126
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,000
switch between the keyboard and the and the controller freely.

127
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,000
And

128
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Just kind of always takes the input from whichever ones are doing

129
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,000
something and that's what it does.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,500
Right?

131
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,300
And we can Implement that pretty easily and maybe that's something

132
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,800
that we should do but a wrench starts to get thrown into this if

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,300
Start saying what if we support two players on one machine like,

134
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,500
suppose, we want to be able to and we find that the game can support

135
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,100
having the main hero character.

136
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,800
Get joined by a second character.

137
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,700
For example, if you want to plug in a second controller and you both

138
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,800
play or one person plays on keyboard, when participating the

139
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,500
controller, then you actually have a problem.

140
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,500
And that problem is you don't know which controllers map to which

141
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,000
people

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,400
If there's two characters on the screen and there's three controllers,

143
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,200
the keyboard and to gamepads let's say which one maps to the hero and

144
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:45,500
which ones map to the sidekick right now with game pads themselves.

145
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,700
There's a little bit of a hint, we could make it so that you push

146
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,500
start on a Gamepad to join in on that Gamepad, right?

147
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,800
And that's a fairly common and easily understood thing to have happen.

148
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,800
And so, you know,

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,100
Could barely very transparently, sort of implement that in the game,

150
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,300
but there's still a catch and the catch is what happens with the

151
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,900
keyboard because the keyboard doesn't really have a predefined start

152
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,200
key.

153
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,400
And a player who is perhaps unfamiliar with convention or anything.

154
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Like that doesn't necessarily know what to do when they're presented

155
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,200
with one of, you know, with a keyboard and said, you know, when you

156
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,300
want to start the game, what exactly do you hit?

157
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,400
And so, you kind of need to introduce.

158
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
If you want to go the start button route, you need to introduce some

159
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,800
concept of what is

160
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,000
The start button on a keyboard and it's not as simple as just saying.

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,300
Okay, maybe we, you know, have the keyboard, any any key you press on

162
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,100
the keyboard joins as a keyboard player because what if the person was

163
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,200
trying to, you know, get back to the main menu and they didn't

164
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,300
necessarily know what to hit and they just hit a key and now they're

165
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,100
playing and they just, you know, there's a bunch of things that could

166
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,900
go wrong there.

167
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,100
And so it's really a very touchy problem.

168
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,800
It's a problem that I kind of wish, you know, again people like

169
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,200
Microsoft, if they actually thought things through ever which they

170
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,800
pretty much don't

171
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,500
You know, they would have had some convention for setting up

172
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,200
controllers in Windows such that this was not something that each game

173
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,900
had to deal with in an ad hoc fashion.

174
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,300
And that players would have to learn separately for every game.

175
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,200
You just have a concept of what the controllers are in your system.

176
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,900
And which ones you wanted to use that you could remap per game if you

177
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,500
wanted to or all those are just up, really?

178
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,400
The operating system is the right place to do that, because it allows,

179
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,400
you know, players to configure things once for the most part and only

180
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,500
really mess with that configuration on a per game basis, if they

181
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,900
really need to for some specific.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,299
Game, instead of having to do all of this configuration worker, all of

183
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,799
this learning in every single game they play.

184
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
But what are you going to do?

185
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,799
You know, we have not had a Good Shepherd of the operating system for

186
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,200
gaming, pretty much ever.

187
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,500
And so we're just in a position where we have to compensate for

188
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,000
ourselves.

189
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,100
And so, what I want to do is I want to have something in handmade hero

190
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,200
that is very easy, and transparent for people to use.

191
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,900
So they're not going to be very confused by how they have to do

192
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,500
things.

193
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,700
But I may also wish to support having

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,800
Four controllers.

195
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,000
so,

196
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,700
I would say what I think we should probably do for now is say, let's

197
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:19,400
assume that the way that the game works is that at any time, you can

198
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,900
push, whatever the start button is in your controller and will Define

199
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,100
where ourselves for the keyboard and you will join the game, right?

200
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,800
And I don't think that there really should be anything more

201
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,100
complicated than that at the moment.

202
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,400
So we'll just simply say that every controller.

203
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,300
That pushes a start button basically joins in and any controller that

204
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,900
pushes the start button again comes back out, right?

205
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,000
So it's basically just free to join free to leave and we'll see how

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,100
far that gets us because it's very very simple and easy to understand

207
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,600
and if we find that, we need to start introducing something more

208
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,300
complicated than we can do.

209
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,200
So later since we don't really know whether we're going to have two

210
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,400
players or not, it the final game whether the final

211
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm will really support two different players the same time or not.

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,500
I don't want to overthink it too much now, but I want to do something

213
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
somewhat reasonable.

214
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,100
So what we need to do then is we need to move our controller code such

215
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,400
that.

216
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,000
When we process controllers.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,800
We have an idea of which controller maps to which character, right?

218
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,300
And I just kind of said how I basically want that to happen.

219
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,300
I want to basically use the start button as the thing that determines

220
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,500
that feature.

221
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,400
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull this movement code out

222
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,600
entirely basically,

223
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,900
I'm going to put that in a separate place where we will execute it per

224
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,700
player basically, so I'm going to pull that up temporarily just to get

225
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,200
it out of the way.

226
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,400
While I do some surgery on this particular piece of the code.

227
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,100
So I'm just going to make a little holder here for it.

228
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,300
And I'm going to go ahead and say that basically everything, that

229
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,400
happens from this player speed stuff down.

230
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,700
Like all of this, basically is all going to be code.

231
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,100
That's in the player movement stuff now, right?

232
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,300
So, here's the player movement stuff.

233
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,600
It's gets out of the way and then, let's go ahead and take a look.

234
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,800
At what happens with these controller indexes.

235
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,200
So, for each controller when we go through and and do what we're going

236
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,000
to do with it.

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,300
We now essentially need to figure out

238
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
How we're going to map controllers to players.

239
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,400
And so what I want to do for that is I would like to go ahead and say,

240
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,000
OK, let's for now.

241
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,100
Let's just say, since we don't have the concept of entities, yet.

242
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's at least say that we have.

243
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, I'll just call it an entity for.

244
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,400
Now.

245
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Let's say that we're going to take this, this player, stuff here, this

246
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,800
player P, and D player P.

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,600
Right?

248
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,300
Let's take those two and let's go ahead and say let's pull them out.

249
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Out into this structure so that we can have multiple players if we

250
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,000
want to.

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,800
And we don't have to

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,900
Just have one, right?

253
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,700
Because this is all the state that we were using for the hero, right?

254
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,500
That was all, we actually needed.

255
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,400
So, if we want to, we could now have more of them, right?

256
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,000
So, if we wanted to have one per controller, we could certainly do

257
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,300
something like this, where we basically said, okay, there can be an

258
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,500
entity per controller.

259
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,300
And I guess I'll just call these players for.

260
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,600
Now.

261
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,500
We can have as many as we wanted there and I guess I need to actually

262
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,500
be able to check what that array count actually is.

263
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,300
Hold on a second.

264
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,200
Don't actually remember, what, what we call that a rake out there.

265
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,200
That's not it.

266
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,700
It's handmade platform at H.

267
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,100
So, where is that?

268
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,900
There it is, game, controller input.

269
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,300
So, what I want to do basically is just see what the

270
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,800
The bat is so I can basically say all right, I want to do the array

271
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,300
count of, you know, essentially one of these things like so I don't

272
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,500
know if this is kosher but I'm going to try it anyway, basically, say

273
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,000
the array count of one of those, whatever it is that is that legal.

274
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,300
Are you okay with that?

275
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,600
Oops?

276
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,700
Mister compiler.

277
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,400
See here.

278
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,300
that now,

279
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,800
And right, we will have to deal with this as well.

280
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,100
But it looks like it passed just fine.

281
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,000
So that's just fine.

282
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,800
So, we now know that we've got as many players as there are

283
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
controllers for now.

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
And so that's totally fine.

285
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,500
And then the other thing that I might do for now is I'll just say,

286
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,700
okay, let's go ahead and assume that we have some kind of a player

287
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,400
count here, so that we know when we've got any of them, right?

288
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,800
And so all I'm going to do is now all the stuff that we used to do for

289
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,000
individual players.

290
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,800
I will

291
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,900
Do that for each player that currently exists, right?

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
And so, this was the initialization for the player.

293
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,200
And so we want to do that initialization any time.

294
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,600
There's a new player, right?

295
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,300
So, instead of initializing, it just at startup, just for that first

296
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,700
player.

297
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,800
I'll go ahead and say, let's let's initialize.

298
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,300
Those will basically have a thing here, which will say, you know, add

299
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,600
player or something like this.

300
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,400
Seems like a totally reasonable thing.

301
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,800
So we'll do an ad player up here and what we'll do with that player.

302
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,400
ER is we'll just assert temporarily that that we've got.

303
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
You know what?

304
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,500
You know what?

305
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,300
I don't even think that's.

306
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,600
I don't even know if I wanna do that.

307
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,900
I'm gonna do it actually this way.

308
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And I'm just going to say that we've got the, the players here, and

309
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,700
then we've got however, many controllers.

310
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,000
There are actually.

311
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,800
I'm going to say that we have player index for controller like so and

312
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,300
we'll do that.

313
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,100
And I'm actually going to say that we've got sort of a generic entity

314
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,600
right here.

315
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
I'm going to I'm going to back off.

316
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,200
I want I said previously and I don't know how many of these were going

317
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,800
to have.

318
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,300
I'm not going to do anything specific there for now.

319
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,800
I'm just going to say we've got a bunch of them.

320
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,400
So what I would like to do then is say well we've got entities and the

321
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,600
entities themselves are going to basically have some kind of concept

322
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,700
of whether or not they are actually existing.

323
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,700
Maybe we'll call this exists, right at the moment and then I'm going

324
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,100
to say, all right, we've got we've got a notion that for any into get

325
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,100
individual player, any individual controller.

326
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,200
We have a player index that's sort of assigned to that controller, you

327
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,500
know, for the time being

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,800
And so if I go ahead and do that, I could then say whenever I do add

329
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,400
player basically what it would actually be is just an initialized

330
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,300
player and initialized player would say whichever entity index you

331
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,100
wanted to initialize.

332
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,400
So based, if I had an entity like this, then I'm just going to do

333
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,100
whatever that that code was.

334
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,500
That I was doing to initialize the single one that we had.

335
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,000
Right.

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,300
And instead of this being player P.

337
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,600
Obviously, this is now just p and this is just d p.

338
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
So that's basically the time that position and

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,400
The velocity right?

340
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,900
And so I'll go ahead and change that stuff here.

341
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,400
And of course, we may be reusing an entity at this point.

342
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,200
So what I'd also like to do is I'd also like to initialize it to zero

343
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,700
to clear out the entity structure, 20 anything that wasn't actually

344
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,700
there before and then I will set its exist.

345
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:18,900
True.

346
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,700
So now we've got an empty, whatever you want.

347
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,200
Initialize a player we can initialize it like so.

348
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,300
So again, not thinking too hard about this, just want to start to pull

349
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,200
it out a little bit.

350
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:29,900
Not

351
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
Doing anything particularly Fancy with the entities at all?

352
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:33,700
Right.

353
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,100
Now.

354
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,900
I just want to be able to have more than one of them.

355
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,800
So if I do that, then at the outset, of course, all of the entities

356
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,500
will not exist.

357
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,300
So that's fine.

358
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,100
When we go to actually draw them.

359
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,600
What is what?

360
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,000
What is?

361
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,600
Right?

362
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:55,000
Boyd, we go when we go to actually draw them here and I guess this old

363
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,800
player P is similarly going to be moved up to

364
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,300
Here we go.

365
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,700
Let's do that.

366
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:10,800
And this should also be moved as well because I might want to move

367
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,300
that other one to keep the think about where I want to process the

368
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,400
camera code basically, but what I'm doing here is just moving all the

369
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,200
code out that used to be best based on player movement.

370
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,000
Now that I know that I'm going to do it multiple times.

371
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,900
Okay.

372
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,100
So now, when I need to do is say, all right, we have a notion of the

373
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,800
camera.

374
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,400
Right.

375
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,700
And the camera has to follow the players around, but for our

376
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,400
particular game, we won't probably allow split screen or anything

377
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,400
because I don't really want to start shrinking the game world into

378
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,100
corners of the screen or stuff like this.

379
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:47,600
At least.

380
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
I don't think

381
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,200
maybe I do.

382
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,500
I've never seen a game do that this type of game.

383
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,200
Do that before.

384
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,800
I've never seen a zelda-like game have a split screen mode, but

385
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,300
Now that I think about it.

386
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Is there really any reason not to do that?

387
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,900
That's something to think about.

388
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,400
All right, I you know, I mean I'm going to have to, I'm gonna put it

389
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,200
to do in there, how to put it to do in here and say, should we allow

390
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,200
split screen?

391
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,500
I don't know.

392
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,100
Maybe we should.

393
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,300
If this ends up being two player.

394
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,500
Maybe we should allow split screen.

395
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,300
That's a good question, two players.

396
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:28,500
Something.

397
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,900
I haven't thought at all about.

398
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,300
I'm thinking about this, mostly as a one player game for all the

399
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,200
design stuff I've done and but, you know, I like playing games with

400
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,600
friends.

401
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,100
So, you know, at some level, if it turns out to be interesting to have

402
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,700
more than one player, you know, maybe

403
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,200
Maybe that is something we should do.

404
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,800
I'm not sure.

405
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,200
I think it's maybe more interesting, if we don't because it keeps the

406
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,300
game play together and keeps people working together.

407
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,700
And that's usually a little more interesting, but I don't know.

408
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,400
Who knows.

409
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,200
So, what will say for now though is, we won't allow split screen and

410
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
so we need to do for camera.

411
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,200
P is Will basically say, all right.

412
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,600
We have a camera following entity index.

413
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,000
So basically just say the cameras going to follow whatever entity this

414
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,400
is set to, right.

415
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,000
And so if that is set to something that's not zero, right?

416
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,100
If that's basically, I'm going to say that if the camera flowing into

417
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,700
the index is not equal to 0.

418
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,800
Basically, so if it's valid, just based on what this is, then let's go

419
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,200
ahead and grab that entity.

420
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,900
Whatever that entity is.

421
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,600
Right.

422
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
Get entity.

423
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,700
And in fact, I guess I could do this a little more cleanly even.

424
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,200
So let's call camera following entity like that will say, let's get

425
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,900
entity.

426
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
And here's the entity that we want.

427
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,800
I'll pass it, the game state.

428
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,400
And then we'll say if that's actually a valid identity.

429
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,100
Then we will just use that entities P following tile the app Styles

430
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,000
eat, right.

431
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,400
And that seems pretty sane again, really nothing particularly

432
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,200
interesting going on here.

433
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,300
I'm literally just doing this most straightforward simple mechanical

434
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,600
work of pulling out some of this code.

435
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,300
Like I said that I like to do.

436
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,400
I like to wait till I've actually got some code and then I always pull

437
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,700
it out into things that are cleaner as

438
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,200
I sort of go further.

439
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,400
So when I do this, this allows me, why did I put this function here?

440
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,800
It just allows me to do range, checking or any other kind of checking

441
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,600
that I want to do.

442
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,100
I'd also like to reserve slot zero to basically means zero.

443
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,200
So, basically, what I will do here is say, if index is greater than

444
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,200
zero and index is less than game State, whatever the entity count is.

445
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,600
And so for now, that's just a ray count of a lot to think about what

446
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,300
we want to do with that little later on.

447
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,200
and,

448
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,400
Yeah, and so what I want to do here is say also probably well.

449
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
I don't really need to assert that.

450
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,300
So then we'll just do this and we'll say that if it's within that

451
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,900
those bounds, then the entity is just going to be equal to the

452
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,800
entities that

453
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,100
At that index in the array, right?

454
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,500
So that'll get the entity for us.

455
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,200
We now have a way to initialize the player as well.

456
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,300
And so now, what we can do is say, alright, let's go ahead and take

457
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,700
the stuff where we were going to.

458
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,300
Let's see what is going on here.

459
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Okay, so that if the cameras following entity, then we also need to do

460
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,000
this stuff.

461
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,900
And all of this stuff that we do here, that used to be on the player.

462
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,800
P is actually going to be on the camera following entity, right?

463
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,700
So that's basically going to be this.

464
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,700
And, and yeah, that's really all we need to do.

465
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,100
And what that diff is that diff.

466
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't know if that actually happens again.

467
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,700
Yes, it does.

468
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,800
So that's going to be used for drawing here.

469
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,600
So basically what we need to do is say if there is this will probably

470
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,400
have to do again because we were sort of reusing it here and that's

471
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
not going to work because we're going to actually have to have a loop

472
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,400
here where we draw all the entities like all of the heroes that are

473
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,900
Basically, right?

474
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,000
So if I go ahead and do that here, it's I've got to have to do the

475
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,400
difficuit so we might as well just put it there.

476
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,100
All right, so I believe the D.

477
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,300
The diff is a V2.

478
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,700
Is that right?

479
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:10,800
Now?

480
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,700
It's Tom app difference.

481
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,400
So let's go ahead and grab that.

482
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Tom app difference.

483
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,700
What was Tom app difference?

484
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Handmade tell .h, tilemap difference.

485
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,700
So tell map difference is basically just a vector, we can replace this

486
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,000
entire thing with a 3D Vector eventually.

487
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,800
So replace this.

488
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,900
This with a V3 once we get to B3 which by the way, is what I wanted to

489
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,700
do this week.

490
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
So hopefully we'll get there.

491
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,300
So anyway, all right, all well and good.

492
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,700
We'll take one of these tilemap differences for now, but eventually

493
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,800
will change those into V3.

494
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,400
It's because there's really no need for this class anymore.

495
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
So now we've done that.

496
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,000
And basically all I'm going to do here is I'm going to Loop over all

497
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,800
the entities that we are simulating for.

498
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,900
Now, again, dumbest way possible.

499
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,200
So, this is not supposed to be code that you're thinking about right

500
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,400
now.

501
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,800
If you are thinking,

502
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,700
About this.

503
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,700
That is bad.

504
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
You want to be doing, just the most straightforward thing.

505
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,800
So basically, we're going to go ahead and say, entity index, equals

506
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,500
zero into the index is less than array count entities, you know, I

507
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
don't really love doing a re-count entities.

508
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,100
So I think I'm going to do, enter the account like so.

509
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,900
So I'm going to say game state, entered account, and then we just go

510
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,700
ahead and do that.

511
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,900
Now, I don't actually know if I want store entities, an array like

512
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,100
that.

513
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,800
Exactly.

514
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,600
Yeah, but for now, I think that's actually totally fine because

515
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,700
there's nothing there's nothing particularly odd going out.

516
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,900
Its this is going to March through them in order.

517
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,900
I'm just going to go ahead and say that this is going to be a straight

518
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,700
ahead Loop.

519
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,700
So basically say that this is entities like that and each time through

520
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,600
the loop.

521
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,200
I know why that just turned green.

522
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,900
We will go ahead and increment The Entity pointer as well.

523
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,300
So this is just going to go through all the entities, if a particular

524
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,800
entity.

525
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,900
Exists, then we will just go ahead and draw and right now we only have

526
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,500
hero bitmap.

527
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,600
So we're going to draw it as a hero, but in the future, we would start

528
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,800
to do stuff where we look at, see, what kind of entity was and draw in

529
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,400
a different way.

530
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,100
So what I need here is a need the entity P to figure out where it is

531
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,400
and then everything else, I believe should be just about fine.

532
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,600
Now.

533
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,900
We've got this hero facing Direction, which will have to put in the

534
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,000
entity for now, but I'm not sure how we want to actually deal with

535
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,800
that long term.

536
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,500
So we'll just call this facing Direction.

537
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,900
And then we'll go ahead and say entity Arrow facing Direction here.

538
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,600
And that may be just about it for the stuff that we need to do.

539
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Okay, so in here, this actually is probably better done, not where it

540
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,300
is right.

541
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,100
Now.

542
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,200
This is really what direction they were pushing which is not really

543
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,100
what we've quite want it to do.

544
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,200
So, I think what we'd rather do is when we process the actual

545
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,800
movement.

546
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,900
For the character and figure out what is velocity actually is.

547
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:10,800
I think maybe then what we'll do is say okay, take a look at that at

548
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:18,500
that movement and say, you know, if if maybe if DD player why you

549
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,300
know, trying to think of how to do it.

550
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,600
If basically we want to basically take, we want to take D&D player and

551
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,800
use the direction because remember D&D player was basically

552
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,200
Ali, the velocity of the player.

553
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,900
So we have D&D player is pointing in some direction and that's the way

554
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,600
that is going.

555
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,700
And what you want to do now is you want to say, which quadrant is this

556
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,400
Vector in, right?

557
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,900
So we want to see which of these quadrants he actually falls in most

558
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,500
heavily.

559
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,100
And so, you know, essentially what we could do is say, well, you know,

560
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:57,800
if if his why, you know, if is y direction, if the magnitude, if is y

561
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
is greater than the magnitude of his ex, right?

562
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,900
Then he's going up or down and if the magnitude of his X is greater

563
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,300
than the Y, then he's going left or right and then we just check it

564
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,800
sign.

565
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,900
So I feel like that's probably the simplest way to do that now, but so

566
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,200
I think I'll probably just do that.

567
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,800
So what I'll say is, you know, if absolute value

568
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,700
Which is an intrinsic that will also have to Define.

569
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:31,500
But if the absolute value of D&D player, Y is greater than that of X.

570
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,900
I think I might actually do less than so.

571
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,300
I will check X first because I'd like it if they're equal.

572
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,500
I'd like him to use his.

573
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,600
Why facing Direction.

574
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,300
Just, I think that's a little more sensible.

575
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,500
All right.

576
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,300
So if the absolute value of the x is greater than the absolute value

577
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,500
of the Y, then I'm going to say,

578
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,800
So the hero is up or down in this case, right?

579
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,500
That's a, this is up.

580
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,900
So if the D&D player Y is greater than 0, then it'll be, it'll be

581
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,600
and we'll say greater than or well say greater than zero and then if

582
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:13,900
Right, if the if the, where is that, if the heroes moving down, then

583
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,700
we'll do this.

584
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,100
There we go, and then I could do the same thing here.

585
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,700
So and so if he's moving left, which is that case and if he's moving

586
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,800
right, which is that case, I believe that should do it.

587
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,600
So that will determine is facing direction from his velocity.

588
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,700
And in the case, where his velocity drops to zero, he'll just point in

589
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,200
the direction down now, I guess, you know what we could actually do we

590
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,500
could do something a little fancier to we could say well will only set

591
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:49,800
it.

592
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,700
In the case, where he it actually isn't zero, right?

593
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,500
So if they're actually zero, we'll just leave it the same if we can't

594
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
tell which direction he's going.

595
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,400
So it's whatever it last was that might be a little singer.

596
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,600
And so, we could say something like, you know, if D&D player.

597
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,600
Yeah.

598
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,200
If well, yeah, you know, if they're both zero so I don't know.

599
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
That's just do it.

600
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,600
Sure.

601
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,400
Let's say that that's what it is and then we'll go from there.

602
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,500
So we'll do that for now.

603
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,900
And of course, we'll have to go test that.

604
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,400
I just kind of

605
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,800
That in there, but that means we need an absolute value intrinsic

606
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,600
which is basically say, what is the magnitude of this value without

607
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,200
the sign bit?

608
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,600
Right?

609
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,600
And that again, is something that the compiler will actually generate

610
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,000
for us.

611
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,900
I believe absolute value is just F ABS normally, and and that should

612
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,400
give us the absolute value directly.

613
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,200
And it should not actually have to call any C library functions.

614
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,400
It should be a direct copy thing, where it outputs direct to.

615
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,400
To the code stream.

616
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,700
We'll check that later.

617
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,400
All right.

618
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,500
What is the right that supposed to be a real friend to we go?

619
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,700
So, let's take a look here.

620
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,400
So now when we do our this stuff we can get rid of this.

621
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,600
And we haven't wired anything up yet.

622
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,700
So really what we should expect to see is nothing on the screen by

623
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:09,800
this.

624
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,900
Want to get all this stuff compiling.

625
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,400
First.

626
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,900
We've got camera following entity.

627
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,500
That should be happy there.

628
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,400
There we go.

629
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,200
And the entity that we go needs a parenthesis.

630
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,700
And so now I think if I go ahead and restart this guy, we should have

631
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,400
nothing which is exactly what I would expect.

632
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:30,800
Yes.

633
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,300
So now we have to actually add an entity.

634
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,800
And so what we're going to do here is we're going to say, all right?

635
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,000
For a given controller.

636
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,500
If that controller maps to an actual player, then we will route the

637
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,000
control to the player.

638
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And if it does not, then we will just sit there waiting for it to hit

639
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,800
the start button, right?

640
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,600
So but will say is, we'll say controller start ended down, right if

641
00:29:59,600 --> 00:29:59,800
they

642
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,300
Touchdown.

643
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,700
On the start button, I believe that's what are our definition Hoops

644
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,600
platform.

645
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,200
There we go.

646
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,500
Start button.

647
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:07,900
Yeah.

648
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,700
So if the start button went down then we will go ahead and and create

649
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,700
a new player right initialise player.

650
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,400
But if not, then we will just assume that.

651
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,500
Well, I guess I like I said, I gotta check it will soon that.

652
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,700
We don't have to do anything.

653
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,500
And then if we actually are mapped to a player, then what we will do

654
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,900
is actually do the player movement and what

655
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,600
We can kind of do here is say well if we got this DVD player stuff now

656
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,100
we could also start handling is analog.

657
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,100
What we could do is say we've got DVD player, which is the sort of the

658
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
movement direction for the player.

659
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,100
Like so we could just now say if the controller is analog, then let's

660
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,400
go ahead and actually use that stick average X, stick average y, if

661
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,000
that makes sense.

662
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Okay, so stick average X.

663
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,300
Stick average.

664
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,700
Why D&D player equals that.

665
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,500
There we go, and so in theory, that should get us.

666
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,200
Oops.

667
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,200
See, I don't want to do that yet.

668
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, legal mess without asking.

669
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,200
Okay, so we're all good there.

670
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,700
So what we now need to do, is we need to re-enable, the player

671
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,200
movement code by calling it, but first, let's actually do the thing

672
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,700
that actually initializes the player.

673
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,500
If this ends down, then what we'll do is say, okay, what we need to do

674
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
is basically get

675
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,100
That controller index.

676
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,600
So, where is that controller index?

677
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,500
That's not where it is.

678
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Handmade that H.

679
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,800
So, we've got this array right here, which is what I'm going to do in

680
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,000
this array is store for every controller.

681
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,400
What player it maps to, right?

682
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,300
So what I want to do is say what I guess I want to do is just say

683
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,700
entity controller, entity, or controlling entity, and then I want to

684
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,900
say, get entity.

685
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,700
Player impex for controller of whatever controller.

686
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,800
This is, right.

687
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,900
So, there's a controller index.

688
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,400
There we go.

689
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,400
When I get the entity based on that, if I get one back then I know I

690
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,800
guess I should actually have this, this a little bit inverted to make

691
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,700
it a little cleaner controlling entity.

692
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
If I get one back.

693
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,900
Then I know that I just need to control the entity that I already

694
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,200
have.

695
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,500
If I don't, then I need to wait for the start button and potentially,

696
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,100
if it went down, I need to actually go ahead and create that new

697
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,400
entity right, which I can totally do like, so actually don't know if

698
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,700
that needs to pass anything, but the entity at the moment.

699
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,600
Yeah, I guess it doesn't.

700
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,400
Need that.

701
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,200
So really all it needs is for me to do that.

702
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Like so and then player in this for controller.

703
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,700
It's always there.

704
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,800
And then in theory that should allow us to create a new player by

705
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,300
pressing the start button on any controller that we want to.

706
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Now, in theory.

707
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,800
We already mapped start to

708
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,700
An arbitrary thing for the keyboard, but I don't actually know what it

709
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:04,800
was.

710
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,500
And of course we never actually rotate this down because we haven't

711
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,700
actually made like a little screen.

712
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,600
Says press spacebar, press anything.

713
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
So let's take a look.

714
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,900
It's Escape is the start button.

715
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,500
That's not useful.

716
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,600
I think Escape should be the back button.

717
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Don't you doesn't really make any sense.

718
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,200
Not sure why I picked that I suspect, I wanted them this way.

719
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,800
So you'd push back to do a sitting back is like, Escape that go

720
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,400
backward yet.

721
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,800
I don't know.

722
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,100
Doesn't matter not important right now.

723
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,900
These are all decisions will make quite a quite a bit further down the

724
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,300
road anyway, so if I hit the spacebar, well, we should just you know,

725
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,500
I mean obviously what you should do at that point is Crash because you

726
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,900
definitely want to crash immediately upon hitting spacebar.

727
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,800
So what did I do here?

728
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,600
Oh duck.

729
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah.

730
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,400
That's that's totally.

731
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
Yeah, again.

732
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,900
Not particularly good on a Monday people.

733
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
It is not.

734
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,500
It is not it's not going smoothly here on our Monday.

735
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,400
So, when we initialize the player I need to actually, that means, you

736
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,500
know, if there was no index, the player means I need to make a new

737
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,400
index for the player, right?

738
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,300
I need to like, add an entity.

739
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,100
That's kind of obvious.

740
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,600
I don't know why I didn't think of that.

741
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,000
But anyway, so what we need to do here is actually say add entity,

742
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,600
right?

743
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,100
So that we can actually get a new one that we can.

744
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,500
Flats because it's coming back.

745
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,300
Null to say that there wasn't one assigned.

746
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,699
I can't just go ahead and call it that way.

747
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,300
So let's go ahead and do that like this.

748
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,000
And for now, this is not actually how I really want to do it

749
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,199
eventually but like I said, we don't have to super careful now because

750
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,199
we're not really trying to do the entity system at this point.

751
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,500
We're just trying to put something in so we can start to be a little

752
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,300
more realistic about what's going on there.

753
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,600
So when I add identity here, all I really have to do is just increment

754
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,100
The Entity count right, entity count.

755
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,600
And say that whatever the game State entity slot is that's next.

756
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,100
We will go ahead and grab it, right.

757
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:14,300
So that's basically that and maybe what I can do is say, you know, I

758
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:14,600
don't know.

759
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,800
Maybe I don't want to clear this.

760
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,000
I think, you know, I could clear it in a density.

761
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,600
Maybe that's the best place to do it.

762
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,000
I don't know.

763
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,400
We'll see.

764
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,100
Maybe, you know, maybe I want to do this.

765
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,300
Something like that.

766
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah.

767
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,900
Yeah, yeah.

768
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,100
Yeah.

769
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,000
Yeah.

770
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,600
Well, anyway, so there was another bug that I just saw two, which is

771
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,400
that that I think this was like that originally.

772
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,800
I don't know, maybe it wasn't, which would mean that this would set

773
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
that to zero and then we'd immediately right to a null pointer.

774
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,600
So that's no good.

775
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,300
But that's beside the point for now.

776
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,900
So let's go ahead and see what's going on here.

777
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,000
We're going to get that guy out there, which is good.

778
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I want to assert here that we're not out of entities which would be

779
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,500
good.

780
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,700
So I want to start the end of the count is less than

781
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,800
the array count of the

782
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,000
The array please.

783
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:09,100
So we go and the yeah, that's actually not called entity.

784
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,100
It's called entities.

785
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,100
So there is our entities array and let's take a look.

786
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,500
If we maybe crash a little less than we used to, there's our guy, so

787
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,300
that's good.

788
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,900
And now we just need to actually hook him up so that we can, you know,

789
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,900
Control him again.

790
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,400
So then we've got a thing here, which is move player, right?

791
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,000
Or something like this, or move here.

792
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,100
Oh, I don't know what we want to call that.

793
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,700
Exactly.

794
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,200
Let's call it move player.

795
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,700
So for move player, all we need to do is take whatever the entity is

796
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,600
that this player that we're actually trying to move and then we take

797
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,500
the the acceleration that he's supposed to have, right?

798
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,300
And so I guess we'll call this accelerate player.

799
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,100
Something like this.

800
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,500
Now, I guess it's really moved player because you're passing in

801
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
whatever you want the acceleration to be this Frame.

802
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,300
And so really, it's going to do the movement as well.

803
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,800
It's going to actually do that work there.

804
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,600
So we want to do here, is say, alright, that entity p is now going to

805
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
be the thing that we're working on.

806
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,400
And so let's go ahead and go through here and see where we're at.

807
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,500
Yeah controller.

808
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,000
Okay, so that's just that right.

809
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,300
There is just actually a speed modifier will have to think about how

810
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,400
we want to do, that will get rid of that for now.

811
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,000
Got the Deep layer P.

812
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,600
So that's also in the entity now, which is fine.

813
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,800
So just use the entity that we are on new player P.

814
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,700
So, let's see.

815
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,400
This, you could just do together, the old player.

816
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,900
P equals entity p, and the new player P.

817
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,100
Just equals the same thing look.

818
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,300
So not sure why we need to do that.

819
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,000
Let's think about why we're even doing that.

820
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,200
And then, of course, we need the time step.

821
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,000
We need that DT as well, because that's what we need to.

822
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Control everything.

823
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,900
So, however, much time we want to advance will do.

824
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,000
It's like so we'll take that derivative from The Entity structure

825
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,100
instead of from the game State.

826
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,600
Again.

827
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,400
Again, this is really just there is, there is nothing really all that

828
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,300
interesting about what's going on.

829
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,500
Here.

830
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,500
It is straight forward transformation just to basically pull the stuff

831
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,000
out.

832
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,500
Now that we know that we're going to have multiple.

833
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,900
So we need to basically ya know exactly what we're doing as far as

834
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,600
that's concerned.

835
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,200
So now we're going to need that tile map as well.

836
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,400
The tile map that it's moving on, which I guess is, it's not

837
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,200
necessarily.

838
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,500
So we've got the game state, which we could pass directly, which I

839
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,800
think we probably just want to pass the game State, and let it get the

840
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,100
tile map out of the game state that seems like a more sensible thing

841
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,600
to do.

842
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,100
So, basically, out of the game state will get the world down.

843
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,400
Maybe we don't need the game State per se.

844
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:50,600
It's

845
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,800
All that we could do just past the world and have things just use the

846
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,500
world, but I'm not sure about that yet and it doesn't really matter at

847
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,500
this particular point in time.

848
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,400
So

849
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,300
Let's take a look.

850
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:01,600
Here.

851
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,800
We've got our player with player height stuff, which is how we were

852
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
drawing him before.

853
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,700
And technically, that's really a property of the player at this point.

854
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,000
It's not necessarily one that we're going to keep, but I'm going to go

855
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
ahead and move that out because really stuff like what the size of the

856
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,300
Collision is for the player will be part of the entity eventually will

857
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,500
not necessarily the empty, but part of the entities type at the very

858
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,800
least, depending on how we choose to implement that.

859
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,300
And so player with the heights should get moved out as well.

860
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,600
They should not really be things that are

861
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,800
And here, right?

862
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,400
They should be things that are actually assigned in initialize player.

863
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,500
So you can have players that are different sizes, seems like a pretty

864
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
reasonable thing that you might want to do.

865
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,900
So let's go ahead and do that.

866
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,600
So we'll say with the height for now.

867
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,700
So, and there we go.

868
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:53,600
So then inside the entity, we need to put those width and height that

869
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,900
there we go.

870
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,000
And now everybody who uses those basically has two

871
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,600
To Pasta.

872
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,900
Now, use the entities within the entity site.

873
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:10,000
So player width is now entity with like so and hey, look at, we need

874
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,800
to do it there too.

875
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,600
So that's fine.

876
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,000
Oops.

877
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,600
That's not what I wanted.

878
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,600
And then we'll also do player.

879
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,900
Height will go entity height.

880
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,700
So now we've pulled that out.

881
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,000
Like, so.

882
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:22,700
Okay.

883
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,500
Let's keep going almost there.

884
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,200
Let's see here.

885
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,800
We need to do these.

886
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,000
It's

887
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,900
Entity P.

888
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,900
So I guess we should just pull so place.

889
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:39,400
This game State player P becomes empty P, that it's a bunch of those,

890
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,800
what's get all of those guys.

891
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,900
And then, deep layer P.

892
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,900
Same thing, gamestate deep layer.

893
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,400
P becomes empty DP.

894
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,500
There we go.

895
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,500
And here are facing direction is now entity facing Direction.

896
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:59,500
And now again, you know, I say there's nothing special about what's

897
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,000
going on here.

898
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,400
But you'll notice, there is sort of something a little special going

899
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,800
on here, which is just that, we're not overcomplicating things.

900
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,200
This is why I don't like doing any stuff, you know, pre design, or

901
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,000
pre-audit orientation, or any of that stuff.

902
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,700
I just like things to get created as they go.

903
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,100
Because you'll notice all the all of the code is basically telling us

904
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,900
what we need to do.

905
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,100
I'm not having to think real hard about this stuff.

906
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,800
We're just waiting till we get to the point where it's clear that we

907
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,000
need something to happen and then we do it right.

908
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,400
Right.

909
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,600
And so, you know, it's like, okay, we at the point where we're I

910
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,700
started want to think about the fact there was controllers and

911
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,200
entities be controllers and players that were map together.

912
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,400
So I just need to have those now.

913
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,300
So we just made them.

914
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,600
And if he's each step of the way, you just keep it simple like that.

915
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,700
The code and the needs of the code will always guide you.

916
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,700
And really, the only way you can go wrong is By ignoring what the

917
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,700
needs of the code are and like trying to keep shoehorning stuff

918
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,900
together when it's clear that you need a new abstraction or something

919
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,500
like that.

920
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,800
But you know, like I said, it is really

921
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,800
If you can, if you can always try to code this way where you always

922
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,000
get, let yourself get in a situation where you need something before

923
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,500
you write it rather than pulling things out.

924
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,200
And so now we're, at least, pretty sure that we've got entities that

925
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,100
have stuff in it.

926
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,400
That is actually what we need.

927
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,400
Okay.

928
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,900
So the last thing we need to do is we don't actually have a call.

929
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,300
This the move the movement code.

930
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,700
And so, we want to do that.

931
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,900
What we want to do is for each of those controller from each of those

932
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,000
controller index guys.

933
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,400
What we do want to do is if a controller is ever controlling an

934
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:32,900
entity.

935
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,700
We do want to actually move them.

936
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,300
I don't know that.

937
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,400
That's where we're going to necessarily, do that move right now, but

938
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,800
eventually, we'll think about how where we want to wear.

939
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,400
We want to do that.

940
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,700
But for now, this is totally fine.

941
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,200
We'll pass that Duty player that we computed will pass the controlling

942
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,500
entity.

943
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,000
That's supposed to be controlled and there we go.

944
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,200
So now we should actually be able to control our guy again by hitting

945
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,800
the spacebar.

946
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,300
He should come in and then we should be able to control him.

947
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,200
However, I do not seem to be able to control him.

948
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,700
Why do I not seem to be able to control them?

949
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,600
Clearly?

950
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:08,100
I have forgotten something, go ahead and and stop us here.

951
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,800
Well, you know what?

952
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,300
Let's stop us actually here.

953
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:11,900
There we go.

954
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:18,600
So I come in and I push down and we're not actually getting that

955
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,400
passed to us.

956
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,100
Why am I not ever seen?

957
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,100
That initialize player.

958
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,500
Oh, yeah, we forgot one more thing.

959
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,800
We actually have to remember when we initialize the player.

960
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,300
We need to actually set What entity it actually was so that's a that's

961
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,200
a good point right there.

962
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,100
So let's let's go ahead and do that as well.

963
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm not sure how.

964
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,900
Hmm, I'm not sure.

965
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,700
I'm not sure what I want to do about this.

966
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,400
Exactly.

967
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,900
I'm not sure about this.

968
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,500
I want these pointers right now.

969
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,000
I don't think I really do.

970
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,600
Mmm-hmm.

971
00:43:59,300 --> 00:43:59,800
We'll see.

972
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,400
So, what I'm going to do here is just say that, that Ed entity

973
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,500
function would have, you know, it's going to have to return the index

974
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,300
of the entity and I'm not sure how if I want to introduce like entity

975
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,200
handles or anything like that, at this point yet.

976
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,700
So I'm just going to kind of do something pretty basic here.

977
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,200
And this is something that I definitely want to think about a little

978
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:18,800
later on.

979
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,800
But anyway, there's the entity index like so it'll clear it out.

980
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,900
Like that and we'll kind of leave it, leave it as such.

981
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,100
So the controlling entity goes ahead and does the identity call.

982
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,900
Now it has to actually do a get entity.

983
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,700
So what we'll do is, we'll say entity index, so and then we'll do

984
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:44,800
this, get entity and game State, and to index.

985
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,600
And there's a, there's a bunch of things.

986
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,100
I don't quite like about this, but that's okay for the moment.

987
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,000
And then what we need to do is just kind of store back.

988
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,800
That that in that player initial controller because the reason that I

989
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,800
couldn't control the guy is we never actually stored back.

990
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,200
What entity it ended up initialising for him, right?

991
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,900
So now that we've actually added him, we can actually start

992
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,200
controlling him because we won't have this problem where we add them.

993
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,900
And then we never, mark the fact that the controller is linked to him.

994
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,900
So there what happened there, break.

995
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,800
Let's see here.

996
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,100
Oh, yep, got one more bug boy.

997
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,200
It's been a buggy Monday.

998
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,700
I don't know if anyone else feels that way, just been a stupid Monday.

999
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,000
So the other thing that

1000
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,200
That we do have to do too.

1001
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,000
Is I said, I wanted to reserve entity slot 0 as like a null entity

1002
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,500
slot.

1003
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,800
And the reason I like to do that is I just like 02 mean uninitialized.

1004
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,200
So if someone has a handle to an entity and the end of the handle is

1005
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,300
zero or something, it should mean that there's no entity there.

1006
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,900
But if you'll notice, we're actually not, reserving, entity slot 0.

1007
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,000
So what we really want to do is we really want to do something like

1008
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,100
this, when the game actually starts up the first time as soon as it

1009
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:57,900
starts up.

1010
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:03,200
What we want to do is say, Okay, Reserve, entity slot, 0, basically

1011
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,300
for the nullity, right?

1012
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,600
And so this is the null entity Index, right?

1013
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,700
Empty index and it's not actually used.

1014
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,300
So I'm just going to say no Casey Reserve entity slot zero for the no

1015
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,000
entity which will just be an entity that you should never really right

1016
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,800
to or get.

1017
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,000
All right, so, that's fine.

1018
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,700
And now I'm hoping that will actually be able to control this fellow.

1019
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,300
Let's see, where is what?

1020
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,000
I was trying to do.

1021
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,100
Okay, so we set up.

1022
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,000
Wow.

1023
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,300
The typos today.

1024
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,300
Maybe if I don't have my almond milk, it seems like that's entirely

1025
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:41,900
plausible.

1026
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,300
I don't know.

1027
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,300
Maybe it's not, but you see that typo?

1028
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,400
Don't know if you guys saw it to you.

1029
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,500
Probably already did on the on the thing.

1030
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,800
Why can't I find it?

1031
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,400
Controlling entity?

1032
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:53,800
There it is.

1033
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,400
I still didn't actually assign the value, I cut and pasted the thing.

1034
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,800
And I didn't actually sign it.

1035
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,300
All right.

1036
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,600
So finally, we hopefully will be able to control it.

1037
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,000
And of course, I still can't control it.

1038
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,800
Wow, just

1039
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,000
You know, some days you have to fire yourself, you know, if it's just

1040
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,600
like what's going on people.

1041
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,400
So yes, we're still not getting any control input there.

1042
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,000
What is the problem here?

1043
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Let's find out.

1044
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,600
So I come in here and I am actually doing this.

1045
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,400
So why do I never see a

1046
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,400
Down control.

1047
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,800
What's go?

1048
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,100
Why do I never actually, why do I never hit any of these cases, if I

1049
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,400
actually did create the entity and am actually now calling that code?

1050
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,400
What's what's going on with that?

1051
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,500
That's very strange.

1052
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,800
What I'm going to do here is I am going to go ahead and follow through

1053
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,000
the pipeline, get controller controller.

1054
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,000
So yeah, let's see what happens here, get controller.

1055
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Interesting.

1056
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,700
So it wasn't controller zero that which I thought was the keyboard

1057
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,800
that actually got initialized.

1058
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,200
Man, it's like all these typos on one line.

1059
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,800
How is that even possible?

1060
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,300
How you know, it's just, I guess that I'd like to talk to that up to

1061
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,700
the fact that I'm streaming but that may just be because I'm just dumb

1062
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,200
today.

1063
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,600
I don't know if you can really chalk that up to streaming.

1064
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,700
You know, with that many typos.

1065
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,800
I feel like at some point that ain't the stream.

1066
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,000
That's just your brain.

1067
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,800
Not not actually operating.

1068
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,200
So I think we've finished our typo, our Festival of typos.

1069
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:53,800
And now hopefully we will actually have our dude and so now I think

1070
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,400
we're actually working properly and of course, our guys movements

1071
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,400
going to be a lot more swimming because he's only having his routine

1072
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,800
one, once run.

1073
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,600
Once instead of five times.

1074
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,100
I'm see that's a little

1075
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:10,300
Oh, you know what to when we're now doing that facing Direction

1076
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,000
calculation.

1077
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,300
I realized we're using the acceleration for that, and we really want

1078
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,000
that to be his his velocity now, right?

1079
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,400
And so, let's see here.

1080
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,100
There we go.

1081
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,500
Deep layer.

1082
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,900
And so we really want that to be as velocity possible.

1083
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,900
So we're going to go ahead and do that.

1084
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,700
And oops, and that's just a DP now, so I should also probably change

1085
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:35,900
that.

1086
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,400
D player to just be DDP.

1087
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,400
So DVD player is DDP that and there we go.

1088
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,100
So now we've got all of that stuff.

1089
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,500
Worked out.

1090
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,000
Okay.

1091
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:58,200
Now if I go in and I create my dude, see how the facing Direction

1092
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,600
works.

1093
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,000
Still busted.

1094
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,200
What did I do?

1095
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,800
And I do so DP.

1096
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,000
Let's see.

1097
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:08,300
Oops.

1098
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,200
Still got it in here.

1099
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,400
Ya gotta do this guy.

1100
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,500
Let's go.

1101
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,800
And now I think the facing direction should be correct.

1102
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,000
Hopefully, yes, it does appear so and

1103
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,200
There we go.

1104
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,200
I don't know if I actually want it to be based on the velocity like

1105
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:31,400
that.

1106
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,400
I think, well, we're going to do an animation controller for him and

1107
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,200
that'll probably have more an opinion about that.

1108
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,200
But anyway, our constants now need to be retuned certainly because

1109
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,000
that's just a little too swimming to say the least.

1110
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,000
So I'm going to go ahead and crank those values up a little higher

1111
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,100
than what they were before.

1112
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,400
Our acceleration so on.

1113
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,200
So let's go ahead and make our you know, sort of faux drag here quite

1114
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,000
a bit higher and we'll make this quite a bit higher and we'll just see

1115
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,500
how that is.

1116
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,800
Oops.

1117
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,900
See how that is.

1118
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,400
He's a little too fast now.

1119
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,900
So let's turn that down a bit.

1120
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,000
Let's see.

1121
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,200
That feels a bit better, but I'm going to I'm going to stiffen him up

1122
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,800
just a little bit.

1123
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,600
Yeah, yeah.

1124
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,600
Think we're getting somewhere.

1125
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,100
I think we're getting somewhere.

1126
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,500
Yeah.

1127
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,400
That's much better.

1128
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,500
Yeah.

1129
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,200
Okay.

1130
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:29,500
All right.

1131
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,100
Now we're feeling pretty good and are sticking problem.

1132
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,500
Should be much exacerbated.

1133
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Now it, I'm a thinking that now that we've gotten rid of the fact that

1134
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,600
we were calling the loop five times, which would have helped are

1135
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,600
sticking problem quite considerably, because it meant that only the

1136
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,700
first time would actually try to move into it.

1137
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,600
And then the other four times it would try to move directly down and

1138
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,700
imagine we should stick.

1139
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:49,400
Yeah.

1140
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,200
Like right away.

1141
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,900
Okay, so that's what I would have expected.

1142
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,800
That's what I would have expected to see the first time and now it all

1143
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,300
makes sense.

1144
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,500
I wasn't seeing because that's what you should have been seeing.

1145
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,400
You should have been seeing crazy sticking Behavior.

1146
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,500
And the fact that we weren't was kind of actually bizarre to me.

1147
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,100
I was like, it didn't feel right.

1148
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,200
And so that's the reason why.

1149
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,100
And so now we fixed it.

1150
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,700
So that's good.

1151
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,500
So now tomorrow, we can get back to doing our player moving stuff, and

1152
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,300
now, we can also have multiple players in the game.

1153
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,200
So, that's kind of fun.

1154
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,000
We could, I suppose if we wanted to, also, do something strange where

1155
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,800
we actually use different colors for the, for the different players or

1156
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,600
something like this.

1157
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:25,600
I don't know.

1158
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,200
Haven't thought about that.

1159
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,600
Much, but anyway point being now, we've actually got that straightened

1160
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:29,700
away.

1161
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,900
That's that's just 11 bug.

1162
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:32,200
That.

1163
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,400
That is out of our way for later and we are just about out of time.

1164
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,800
So I'm glad that that was like right on time.

1165
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,200
So maybe it was good that we had those typos in there because

1166
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,400
otherwise we would have finished much too early and had to start

1167
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,100
something new and then not been able to finish it.

1168
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,300
So we lined up quite good.

1169
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,000
And so now we've got multiple layers.

1170
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,900
I probably should have brought a Gamepad in here, so I could actually

1171
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,500
test multiple players, but I guess we'll save that for tomorrow,

1172
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
although, how much time do I have two minutes?

1173
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,300
That's long.

1174
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,200
Enough to get controller.

1175
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,800
I'll be right back.

1176
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,000
Probably should just leave a controller in here.

1177
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,000
Let's see here.

1178
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,300
Okay, mr.

1179
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,000
Controller.

1180
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,500
I guess, we'll just plug that right in here.

1181
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,400
Let's see.

1182
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,800
Actually, no air.

1183
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,000
Hey, look, it's all good and the d-pad works.

1184
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,400
So does the analog stick?

1185
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,300
How about that?

1186
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,300
All right.

1187
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,400
We're in good shape people which reminds me at some point.

1188
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,800
We need to get back to do our Dead Zone work, because there's some

1189
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,900
stuff that we never actually do with the dead zone.

1190
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Yeah, a multiple, handmade Heroes.

1191
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,800
They're pretty cute.

1192
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,800
Look at how cute they are.

1193
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,700
They're like twins.

1194
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,800
All right, with that, we have gotten to the Q&A ladies and gentlemen,

1195
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:38,000
so if you could, please prefix your questions with Q: so I can see

1196
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,500
them and try to keep it to things.

1197
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,500
We've done on today's stream or on a previous stream.

1198
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,800
If you want to ask off-topic questions, that's totally fine for before

1199
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,300
the stream.

1200
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:52,200
But please do come about 15 minutes early to the to before when the

1201
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:52,800
stream supposed to start.

1202
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,500
If you want to ask those off topic questions, I will answer them all

1203
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:55,700
then.

1204
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,500
But if for the

1205
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,700
For the official qas.

1206
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,200
Please try to keep it on topic because these are the ones that are

1207
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:01,900
recorded.

1208
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,100
On multiple players.

1209
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:10,600
Split screen.

1210
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,900
What kind of screen resolution are you going to be working with, for

1211
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,500
each one?

1212
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,100
You may not have enough available on all platforms.

1213
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,900
Well, I don't know if we're going to do split screen.

1214
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,200
That was just I mean, I think I was like I've never seen as lde

1215
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,300
split-screen game before.

1216
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,500
I don't know if I want to do that or not.

1217
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,600
That's just total conjecture.

1218
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,700
We'll cross that bridge much, much, much further down the line.

1219
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,100
When we actually start thinking about, if we actually want any

1220
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,800
multiplayer gameplay in here or not.

1221
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,500
Look at the game.

1222
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,000
May just not make sense that way, or it may make a lot of sense.

1223
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,400
That way when we actually go to play it.

1224
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,500
So you can actually see something else happening here that we'll talk

1225
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,500
about later, which is you notice.

1226
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,100
He should be in front of the guy but he's behind the guy and that's

1227
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,300
because we're just drawing them in whatever order the entities are.

1228
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,200
And so that's kind of interesting thing like to think about because

1229
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,200
obviously, when we're doing the renderer, you know, this is a little

1230
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,100
teaser almost for like, well, we have to have a solution for that.

1231
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:58,600
Right?

1232
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,500
So what are we going to do?

1233
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,500
And, you know, and so we'll be looking at some stuff about how we want

1234
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,200
to do that sort of thing in terms of sorting and all that sort of

1235
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,600
stuff.

1236
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,000
You once said that visualizing problems is never weird wasted thing.

1237
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,900
So wouldn't it be very helpful to run to the question section for

1238
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,100
better?

1239
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,800
Understanding of what actually happens?

1240
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,200
Yes, but we haven't gotten to the point where we can really do

1241
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,300
visualizations because we don't have any rendering code.

1242
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,800
So basically we're kind of in a, in a state where we're just going to

1243
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,300
do basic versions of things.

1244
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,300
And then once we actually Implement our full Collision detection, or

1245
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,600
we will do all of that work after we have the render in place, which

1246
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,600
can do things like text on the screen and lines and stuff which is

1247
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,200
What we would need for for actual visualization.

1248
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,700
Randy is just four players was going to handle all game objects.

1249
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,400
Well, it'll handle all game objects eventually, but right now, it's

1250
00:56:59,400 --> 00:56:59,800
only

1251
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
As because we actually haven't gotten to the point where we're

1252
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,100
thinking about entities for real.

1253
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,000
We're just right now thinking about we're just thinking about having

1254
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
guys that move around.

1255
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,900
So we don't don't think about objects at the moment.

1256
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,400
We haven't gotten anywhere near objects right now.

1257
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,000
How will input be handled when two players trigger an action at the

1258
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,800
same time?

1259
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,300
Well, I don't think we're really going to have much problem with that

1260
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,300
because it's not a versus game.

1261
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,200
So it should be relatively fine if they both trigger the same time.

1262
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,100
It's just whichever entity is the, the main is probably, the hero

1263
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,000
entity will probably take precedence.

1264
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,200
Who is the camera following with multiple players?

1265
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,400
If you leave the screen without and then follow with the other, will

1266
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:52,900
it work as expected?

1267
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:58,000
So I'm thinking, I mean, like I said, these are questions that don't

1268
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
really make any sense to ask right now because they would depend on

1269
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,300
the game.

1270
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:06,200
So we have to decide what we want for these sorts of things right now.

1271
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,900
I think we just want the camera to follow an entity.

1272
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,600
And in fact, what I probably should do since we set it up to do this,

1273
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,700
but we never actually used it.

1274
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,800
Is we

1275
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,300
I have the camera following entity thing, right?

1276
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,800
We should probably set that to whatever player gets added first.

1277
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,400
So when we do initialise player, what we should probably do is say

1278
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:34,700
something, like, if, if there isn't a following entity right, then

1279
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,000
then, you know, there is now right?

1280
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:42,300
Or something like, if get empty, right?

1281
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,000
If there isn't a valid entity that the cameras following, then the

1282
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,400
camera should follow this entity, right?

1283
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:56,200
And yeah, and so again, we kind of want this to be.

1284
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:02,000
We want this to be this, and actually pass a game, State game state.

1285
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:10,600
So, right, and entity

1286
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:12,600
Entity.

1287
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,400
Yeah, so let's let's just do that because now that way the camera will

1288
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,700
follow, whoever joins the game first.

1289
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,600
It's, you know, probably the easiest thing to make sure that we still

1290
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,400
have our camera actually working to some degree.

1291
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,500
So, there we go.

1292
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:36,900
Oops.

1293
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,300
So let's check that.

1294
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,200
Make sure that works.

1295
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,900
Let's say I come in here and I go off the screen.

1296
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:47,300
Now.

1297
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm on the second screen and I go off the edge and I go here.

1298
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,400
Now this guy, if we have another entity who comes in, he should still

1299
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,800
be back at the start, right?

1300
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,600
If he

1301
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,800
They're okay.

1302
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,200
That's pretty funny.

1303
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,200
But why are we still drawing him?

1304
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,100
Why is why are we drawing him?

1305
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,500
Still on that Z?

1306
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,600
That's pretty odd, don't you think?

1307
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,200
Oh, because we don't actually check.

1308
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,100
That's why that's pretty interesting.

1309
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,600
You'll notice that right here, when we draw entities.

1310
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,400
We don't check to see if they're on the same.

1311
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,400
Z is the camera.

1312
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,000
We just draw all the entities, who would be in that zone.

1313
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,300
We just we would just draw them.

1314
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,500
Yeah, so we actually need, we want to do a check here.

1315
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:29,800
I mean,

1316
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,500
It is basically calling, right?

1317
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:36,400
So you want to do to do culling of entities.

1318
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,000
Based on Z camera view, right?

1319
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,700
Because otherwise, yeah, that's pretty funny.

1320
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,200
When you decide to have multiple players you decide to make these

1321
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:47,700
entities.

1322
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,500
Why didn't you just call it character or player will just be used on

1323
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,700
other things as well.

1324
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,300
Yeah, I mean, I just don't know what I want to do with that yet.

1325
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,000
Because the reason I didn't call a player's was because I don't even

1326
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,800
know when I did that.

1327
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,200
If the players are all playing the same kind of thing.

1328
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,200
Because like I said, I've only really been thinking about this as a

1329
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,200
single player game.

1330
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,500
So I don't know if the entities are all controlled even if the all the

1331
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,600
players are all controlling the same kind of thing.

1332
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,900
So I just decided it's entities.

1333
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:14,200
It's

1334
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,000
They're controlling and I don't even want to know what it actually is

1335
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,500
at this point.

1336
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,600
I know one of them's the hero but I don't know what the other ones

1337
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:20,800
are.

1338
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,500
So I just called it entities, just I didn't have to think about it.

1339
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,000
Let's see.

1340
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,300
Where did all the doors, go?

1341
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,600
They're all still there, aren't they?

1342
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,300
I was walking in and out of them.

1343
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,300
How do you make the characters not to run through the trees?

1344
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,900
Well, we haven't really talked about Collision detection.

1345
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:09,700
Much those that stuff back there isn't actually isn't actually part of

1346
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,100
the game.

1347
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,600
That's just a bitmap that we had.

1348
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,600
Put back up there.

1349
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,200
It's this test background bitmap, which is not even really supposed to

1350
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:16,800
be in there.

1351
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,300
Right?

1352
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:22,700
And so really, we've got instead of this, this drawbitmap.

1353
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,200
We had a thing in here that would clear it.

1354
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,800
We were just using that to basically clear our screen.

1355
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:31,000
And so, if you take a look at it here and I come on, right?

1356
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,700
We were just using that as a backdrop to clear the area where the

1357
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:40,200
player, what the player was standing on but actually the tile map is

1358
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:44,800
only is only the actual white and sort of black areas.

1359
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:50,100
I can show you if we get rid of this, right?

1360
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:57,800
This is actually what we actually have drawn and so, you know, we've

1361
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,300
only really got a tilemap here.

1362
01:02:59,300 --> 01:02:59,900
That's got some.

1363
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,400
You know, it doesn't have any, any sort of other things to collide

1364
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:03,600
with.

1365
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,100
It's just, you know, pretty basic.

1366
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,500
And so once we actually get to doing our world generation, those trees

1367
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,600
will actually represented in the map.

1368
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:17,500
And so, yeah, it's, it's just a, it's those, those trees are not there

1369
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,100
right now.

1370
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,500
Is I guess what I would say, they're not, they were just a pretty

1371
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,700
backdrop to leave on there.

1372
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,300
Well, we had it on, it was, it's prettier with it than without it.

1373
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,500
So that's why it's there, but that's not actually part of it.

1374
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,700
So yeah, let me go ahead and I like having a bitmap there.

1375
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,700
It's just kind of pleasant.

1376
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,900
So I'm going to leave that in for now.

1377
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,500
Why are we doing physical base movement?

1378
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,600
Controlling the players with forces instead of just controlling the

1379
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,200
velocity.

1380
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,700
Doesn't this add unwanted lag in the player controls?

1381
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,700
It adds wanted lag in the player controls.

1382
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,100
I like to the player to have a little startup.

1383
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,000
I don't like it.

1384
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,300
If the thing to starts moving at full velocity right away and I feel

1385
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,000
like there's a lot of precedents for that.

1386
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,700
Like, I feel like a lot of games that feel good.

1387
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:19,000
Have a bit of that slop in them, that you don't just go full speed

1388
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
when you immediately start.

1389
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,800
And so that's why we have in there because it actually feels much

1390
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,000
better when it's in there.

1391
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,700
It just feels a lot more natural and it's more enjoyable.

1392
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,500
We will be doing any image manipulation with code.

1393
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,000
Yes, we will be doing lots of image manipulation with code.

1394
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,700
Any reason to catch failing to load art assets?

1395
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,200
Yes, eventually we will be fail.

1396
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,300
Well, we will be doing that very specifically.

1397
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,600
That was kind of a weird.

1398
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,500
I didn't wait a minute.

1399
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,500
That was kind of a little weird.

1400
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,100
I want to make sure I've got these ifs, right.

1401
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,700
Sorry, I got distracted by the movement of the guy.

1402
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,400
That looks correct.

1403
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:17,600
If DPX, it's not quite correct though.

1404
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,700
Is it because they could be equal and just not zero.

1405
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:28,100
So, what we actually wanted to do was do this, right if entity DP x

1406
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,400
equals 0,

1407
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:32,700
and,

1408
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:37,800
At the entity DP, y equals 0.

1409
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,700
Then we don't set it, right.

1410
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,100
so note, Casey

1411
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:54,800
Oops, leave facing Direction, whatever it was.

1412
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,900
Otherwise, then we go ahead and enter.

1413
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,400
At it based on the other two because otherwise, if you're moving

1414
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,600
diagonally, wouldn't set it, which is not at all what I wanted.

1415
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,500
All right.

1416
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,700
So now we're good.

1417
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,400
Yeah, much better.

1418
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,000
Okay.

1419
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,000
But anyway, any reason to catch feeling to let artists, it's yes,

1420
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:18,600
later on.

1421
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,100
We will be doing a lot more of that because will sort of be showing

1422
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,700
how to do more of an asset loading pipeline.

1423
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:29,100
That's not really just a load bitmap call, right?

1424
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,600
And at that point, we'll have a lot of stuff where we may have written

1425
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,100
things in code that haven't been drawn yet.

1426
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,600
And so it won't even be failing to load our deficit so much as the RS

1427
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,900
don't even exist at all.

1428
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,700
And so we need to handle that because we need to be able to develop

1429
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,900
without having art assets yet for particular things.

1430
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,900
So we'll want to have like fallback art assets and stuff like that,

1431
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:48,100
even.

1432
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,000
So we'll be talking a lot more about that when the time comes.

1433
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,900
Is the notion of having all the entities in the same array.

1434
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,100
Just a simplification for an hour, that actually sign that will stick

1435
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,700
for long.

1436
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:06,000
The way we're adding and referring to entities, probably won't stay

1437
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,500
around for long, but the concept of having a big block of entity or

1438
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,100
entities in an array, probably will be possibly even what we ship

1439
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:13,400
with.

1440
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,000
Why do I not use an auto compiler?

1441
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:29,600
Well, it's a little bit tough to do an auto compiler because if we did

1442
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,100
Otto assume you mean that it compiles.

1443
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:37,400
Any time I save or whatever, it may actually run the code in a state

1444
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,400
that I don't want to and break are currently running game.

1445
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,800
So, I don't know that, I necessarily want that, but it's not

1446
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,100
necessary.

1447
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:44,500
A bad idea.

1448
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,600
I just don't know if I want it.

1449
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,600
How would this connector controllers mid-game be gracefully handled?

1450
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,600
Well, really?

1451
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,000
I don't think we have to do much to gracefully handle them because

1452
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,000
it's a controller gets disconnected.

1453
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,600
They can just plug it in again.

1454
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:05,300
Right?

1455
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,200
So all we would really have to do is just put something up on screen

1456
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,800
saying, please reconnect controller, right?

1457
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,900
We're not doing anything right now.

1458
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,600
That would cause any kind of breakage if a controller was

1459
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,399
disconnected.

1460
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,600
I guess the controller ran on the batteries.

1461
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,000
You might need a way to.

1462
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:33,899
Uhn stop, using that controller and start using the keyboard, but what

1463
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:37,200
we could do is just anytime, a controller gets disconnected, then that

1464
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,200
player is just in kind of limbo for a bit and anyone who pushes start

1465
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,000
could like, take them over.

1466
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,200
For example, there's a lot of ways we could handle it will see.

1467
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,200
Again, when the game is up.

1468
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,100
We don't really know.

1469
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,600
When comparing a float 20.

1470
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,899
Shouldn't you be checking your within a tolerance instead?

1471
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,899
No, because we don't actually care if

1472
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
These values aren't exactly zero, then we can just actually use

1473
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
whatever the small velocity is to determine the facing Direction.

1474
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:12,500
But if they happen to be exactly 0, then we literally can't determine

1475
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,000
the facing Direction because that's the only time that the hero isn't

1476
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,600
facing some direction.

1477
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,000
And so, at that point, we have to kind of just leave it alone.

1478
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,300
Will there be diagonal movement Sprites for the hero doubtful?

1479
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,700
I do not expect so.

1480
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:41,100
Not very many questions tonight seem to be question free.

1481
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,000
And if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

1482
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,399
Probably a good thing.

1483
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:48,800
Maybe that means we can end early.

1484
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,100
Everyone could go to bed for a sleepy.

1485
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,800
Monday, can go to bed early tonight.

1486
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,700
I'll stay up for I'll say on stream for a couple more minutes.

1487
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,500
So just to see

1488
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,700
if there's any more questions.

1489
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,300
Let's see.

1490
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,100
Now, that looks like it.

1491
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,800
That looks like the end of the queue and a up.

1492
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,100
No, let's see.

1493
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,700
Since small velocities were brought up.

1494
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,800
Are we going to account for small inputs IE controller, dead zones.

1495
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,100
Well, you actually already do clip to the controller.

1496
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,300
Dead Zone a little bit.

1497
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:45,600
So in win32, handmade, when we actually prepare the input to send to

1498
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,200
the game, you'll notice that we actually do.

1499
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,700
We actually do DeadZone processing.

1500
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:58,700
Right here, right here with the win32 process process.

1501
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,700
X input.

1502
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:04,100
stick value, you can see that we basically have here a thing that

1503
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:08,300
Clips values to The Dead Zone and

1504
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,500
some people were kind of grumpy because they were like The Dead Zone

1505
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,500
should be circular but I actually thought about this quite a bit and

1506
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,000
I'm 99% positive that you definitely don't want the dead zone to be

1507
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,200
circular in this game.

1508
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,400
So I'm pretty sure we actually do want a square Dead Zone, but it's

1509
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,500
also on my list to write some Dead Zone, visualization stuff on stream

1510
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,300
so you can kind of see and that will explain a little bit, maybe more

1511
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:37,300
why I think that the dead zone should definitely be square, but I'm

1512
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,500
pretty sure not only that the dead zone is actually physically Square,

1513
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,800
meaning that it's Square on the

1514
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,300
Stroller.

1515
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:46,600
And that's the part that will visualize but even if it's not, I think

1516
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,500
even if the dead zone is physically, circular, I still think we

1517
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,700
probably want it to be handled Square.

1518
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,200
About storing entities in an array.

1519
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:05,500
Again.

1520
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,300
It seems like there are possibilities for easily having massive

1521
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:09,900
operations on all the entities.

1522
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,200
Will this be exploited?

1523
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:15,200
I don't think that probably will be able to be exploited.

1524
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,100
I mean it might be but I'm not thinking probably that it would be.

1525
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,200
And the reason for that is I suspect that most of our work will

1526
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,900
actually revolve around.

1527
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,900
Not processing all entities every frame because, you know, if we have

1528
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,900
10,000 entities in the world or something.

1529
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,700
You don't want to be processing all of them.

1530
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,300
Reframe if they're not on the screen.

1531
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,200
And so we're going to have a bunch of stuff to do there.

1532
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,600
And I don't think that, I don't think that will end up optimizing for

1533
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,700
bulk updating of lots of entities.

1534
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:50,200
I think will optimize for updating entities in different time

1535
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,800
intervals, based on what they need to be doing at that time.

1536
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,500
Let's see.

1537
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,100
Caught up quick with the YouTube archives.

1538
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,200
A couple of things that weren't completely clear the indirection for

1539
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,400
function calls.

1540
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,600
Can you be more specific on that though?

1541
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,600
I'm not sure what you mean by that and why we didn't use the bitmap

1542
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,000
masks directly.

1543
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,000
Well, I'm not sure how we could use the bitmap masks directly.

1544
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,700
I'm not sure what you mean by that because the problem with the bitmap

1545
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:32,700
masks is that they don't tell us how to get things into the location

1546
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,500
that we actually need them to

1547
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,000
A right.

1548
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:41,900
So the bitmap mask does, in fact, tell us what we would mask to get

1549
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:42,400
the value.

1550
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,100
But doesn't tell us how to shift it, to get it to where we need it.

1551
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:48,700
So we need to call finally significant set bit to do that.

1552
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,200
Right?

1553
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,700
And then once we have that since there's no such thing as a rotate in

1554
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,200
C.

1555
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:58,200
We have to shift it down and then shift it back up again.

1556
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,400
Anyway, so we don't actually need the masks at that point because it's

1557
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,500
free for us to just do the

1558
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,000
The Mask after we shifted it down, I'm not sure if everyone followed

1559
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,100
that originally, but I'll just say it again.

1560
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,300
So what we need to do is we need to shift the value from where it is

1561
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:18,200
to where it should be, but we don't know because we don't know what

1562
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,700
the values are here.

1563
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,500
Red green, blue Mass.

1564
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,200
We had to solve for, we had to ask for them by doing finally

1565
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,000
significant bit.

1566
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,100
We don't really have any idea.

1567
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:31,100
Whether the redshift will be up or down, from where the red is.

1568
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,400
So we don't know whether to shift left or shift, right?

1569
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:38,200
So what we need to do is we need to shift it all the way down first

1570
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,700
and then shift it all the way back up doing a left.

1571
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,700
Stand a right shift.

1572
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:45,000
Basically, because we have to do a left and a right shift already.

1573
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,100
I'm sorry.

1574
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:48,300
Well, right shift first, and then a left shift, right?

1575
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,200
If we had a rotate.

1576
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:55,500
So we could just, say shift, either positive or negative Direction.

1577
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,100
Then then we would just, then we'd be able to use the mass directly.

1578
01:14:59,100 --> 01:14:59,800
We use the mask.

1579
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,900
Then shift the difference between where we, where it is and where it

1580
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,600
needed to be.

1581
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,200
But since we don't have one, it's free for us to just use 0xff, which

1582
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,900
allows us to mass directly with the same value every time and not have

1583
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:15,200
to use any of this stuff right over that make sense.

1584
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,900
Are there any games that you have personally developed that are

1585
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,600
available to the public.

1586
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:32,200
Are you talking about games that I like designed and made myself know,

1587
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:37,000
there are thousands of games with my code in them that are available

1588
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:37,800
to the public.

1589
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:45,000
If you if you want to find them you can go take a look at for example.

1590
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,200
Here.

1591
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,300
Is some?

1592
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,800
Relatively, I don't actually know if there's a comprehensive list, but

1593
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,400
this is all of the games.

1594
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,100
That are on this page.

1595
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:05,400
Anyway, well, use my code in them because they use the animation

1596
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,400
system that I wrote.

1597
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:12,800
But yeah, but I don't generally, I do not design games for a living.

1598
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,100
I'm not a game designer.

1599
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,600
I'm a game programmer.

1600
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,800
So you're not likely or even really.

1601
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,600
It would not be possible to find any game out there.

1602
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,500
That I have designed only games that have my code in them.

1603
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,800
Oh, and also, I guess there's a lot more now that I think about it,

1604
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,200
too.

1605
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,600
It's I did a bunch of work on big to, I don't know.

1606
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:35,300
I don't just I wouldn't count this as much because I was more like

1607
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:40,000
just the person who did a bunch of like, Tech research for Jeff on it.

1608
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,300
But I also let's see.

1609
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,800
I don't know if this list is segregated by Bink.

1610
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,900
One in big too.

1611
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,000
Because a lot of these would be big one games.

1612
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,100
So but yeah, anything that uses this for video also has obviously my

1613
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,300
code in it to at this point.

1614
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:02,200
Although I think wouldn't actually have a lot my code in it per se

1615
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,500
because I suspect that.

1616
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,400
Well, I don't know, maybe it would, I'm not sure.

1617
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,300
I'm not sure since I did a bunch of research work on this.

1618
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,900
I'm not sure how much actual code is still in big to that.

1619
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:19,200
I wrote, Because, as they refine it over time, I'm assuming that they

1620
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,600
replaced stuff that

1621
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,500
Did with with more optimized stuff, but I'm not sure.

1622
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,400
But I did do a bunch of work on this product and defining how it work.

1623
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:31,600
And also, I wrote the tools, the, The Village tools that they still

1624
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,800
use internally to develop it.

1625
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,500
So there's that.

1626
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,900
Okay, so clarification on what the person is asking for indirection

1627
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,100
for function calls.

1628
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,500
So you're talking about why we use the macros here.

1629
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,700
So the reason that I do these macros is because I like to make it so

1630
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,900
that I don't have to change.

1631
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,600
I always do this for function, pointers because that means that anyone

1632
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,800
who defines a thing of that type,

1633
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,700
Always gets the same function signature.

1634
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:03,900
That's why you the macros.

1635
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,500
It's not particularly necessary here.

1636
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:09,300
If you didn't want to do it here and be totally fine because there

1637
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,400
just aren't that many.

1638
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,600
It's a you know, it's a one-off sort of thing.

1639
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,700
So it's not a big deal.

1640
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:21,800
But when we do stuff where there's going to be potentially a lot more

1641
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,300
functions that have to have the same signature, then it becomes a lot

1642
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,100
more important so you don't have to do it.

1643
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,300
It's but it's how I write that code.

1644
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,400
Well, I'll be waiting for John to complete his presentation tomorrow.

1645
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,200
I set the start time for handmade hero to 8:30 tomorrow to give him an

1646
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:43,100
hour and a half of time instead of an hour to complete.

1647
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,900
But no will be starting at 8:30.

1648
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:48,500
So I won't hold it over after that, but I did try to move it so that

1649
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,300
both that hopefully we won't conflict too much if we do.

1650
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,900
Can you explain what you mean by Dead Zone on the controller?

1651
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:58,100
Yes.

1652
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:04,800
So basically what happens is these controller guys here, these analog

1653
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,900
sticks the way that they actually work is there's a thing in there

1654
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:13,000
called a potentiometer that I don't really, since I don't understand

1655
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:13,900
Hardware hardly at all.

1656
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,700
Like, I'm not a hardware guy at all.

1657
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:19,200
Like, if you handed me a soldering iron, I'd probably just burned

1658
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:19,800
myself with it.

1659
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,000
But basically there's some things in there.

1660
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,500
I guess called a potentiometers.

1661
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:32,000
Which are designed to read off where the analog stick is and obviously

1662
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,500
there are Springs in there as well that are designed to pull the

1663
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:35,900
analog.

1664
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,000
Stick back to the center.

1665
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,100
When you let go of it.

1666
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:43,200
Now, apparently neither of these processes is quite perfect.

1667
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:48,100
As you might expect the spring make Springs, maybe don't quite pull.

1668
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,500
The stick back to an exact center position every time.

1669
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,000
I mean, it's physical, you know, maybe it can't be made to be that

1670
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,100
good or that accurate and also the potentiometers may have drift and

1671
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,400
they may not be calibrated.

1672
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,700
It calibrated properly or all sorts of other things.

1673
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,000
Right?

1674
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,500
And so what ends up happening is in order to

1675
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,600
Herman, whether the stick is actually been moved away from the center

1676
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,400
because remember, the six of the center, we don't want to do anything.

1677
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,300
We only want to move the character when the stick moves away from the

1678
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:20,400
center in order to determine whether sick has been moved away from the

1679
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:20,900
center.

1680
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,700
We can't just say, well, if it's not equal to zero, then it must not

1681
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,500
be in the center.

1682
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:31,600
We have to actually use a range of values from negative, something to

1683
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,300
positive, something, basically that all are considered being in the

1684
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,600
center and that's what's called the Dead.

1685
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,500
It's basically a Zone that's considered effectively that the stick is

1686
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,100
not moving.

1687
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:45,300
Even though the stick is returning values that are not zero.

1688
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:51,600
And if you want to see a demonstration of this, actually you can see

1689
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,000
this probably pretty clearly.

1690
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:59,700
If we go ahead and say set a breakpoint inside win32 handmade and we

1691
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:05,100
Okay, let's go ahead and see what though the value is.

1692
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,200
I'm not even touching the controller sitting on the table.

1693
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,200
Right?

1694
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:12,100
So let's go in there and take a look at what the actual controller

1695
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:12,900
values are.

1696
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,500
I'll just set a breakpoint.

1697
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,100
Right?

1698
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:20,800
So in here, will say, go ahead and set the break point and see what

1699
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,600
this actually are.

1700
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,600
So the value that came back from Windows when we said, give us the

1701
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,500
state of the controller, right?

1702
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,800
Was this pad thing and

1703
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,200
and what did actually had is it actually has these these values here?

1704
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,700
Well, actually those those are pretty good.

1705
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:38,200
That's all actual zeros.

1706
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,800
That seems crazy.

1707
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,400
Is that actually true?

1708
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,200
I don't know if I believe that.

1709
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,400
That seems kind of hard to believe, doesn't it?

1710
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,100
Which controller are we looking at here?

1711
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,500
Is it just me or is that kind of hard to believe?

1712
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,300
So I guess you can't have a demonstration of it because this

1713
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,900
controller is like dead on which is pretty awesome.

1714
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,800
Let's see, if that's let's just verify, that's true.

1715
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,800
I'm going to hold it over to the side here.

1716
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:07,900
Stop it.

1717
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,700
Yeah, that's pretty good.

1718
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,600
And then I Let Go.

1719
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,200
Well, okay.

1720
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:14,900
So there you go.

1721
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,900
Now, you can actually see it in action.

1722
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:22,100
So I have I'm putting the controller down the table and you can see

1723
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:28,000
that value is for the left, thumbstick, sex position, right?

1724
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:32,700
If you actually look at what it is, it's 420, but I'm not actually

1725
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:33,500
moving the stick.

1726
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:38,300
So, you know, that's what you're trying to guard against there and you

1727
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,800
can see that it kind of drifts around actually.

1728
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,600
It's it's unreliable.

1729
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:43,800
What that number is?

1730
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,200
Yeah, so that's that's what we're trying to do when we when we talked

1731
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:48,800
about the dead zone.

1732
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,500
We're trying to make sure that that isn't a problem.

1733
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,800
Do controllers have an outside dead zone?

1734
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,200
I don't think so.

1735
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,300
I mean, well, you know, they, well.

1736
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:11,600
You know, for certain types of games, it may be true that controllers

1737
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,700
with the values that they returned around the circle is not perfectly

1738
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:20,100
circular and you might want to try and deal with that for our

1739
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:20,500
purposes.

1740
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,100
We don't really care super much about that.

1741
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:29,500
But yeah, I mean we once we actually go to do the, The Dead Zone,

1742
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,600
visualization stuff.

1743
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,200
It's definitely something that we can look at just to see to make sure

1744
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,800
that what we're getting is relatively clean, but I

1745
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,400
Another will have to really do much about that.

1746
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,700
That's typically less of a problem than the center stick dead zone.

1747
01:23:59,100 --> 01:23:59,800
Try.

1748
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,400
Rimmer of Rufus or trireme Rufus is asking you and with the 32-bit

1749
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,800
value, then use what you get.

1750
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:09,800
So, okay, he's still talking about the bitmap loading code question,

1751
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,600
where I was trying to explain it.

1752
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,500
I'm not sure how to explain it other than how I already did.

1753
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:16,900
So,

1754
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,100
Try to imagine right?

1755
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:22,200
What happens here.

1756
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,600
We load this bitmap file.

1757
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:25,100
Now.

1758
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:28,800
We know that we need to output something that looks like this.

1759
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,600
This is actually the this is what we have to do.

1760
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,600
Right?

1761
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:37,800
So we load this and we get back, a red mask, that is some random

1762
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:38,400
value.

1763
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,000
If we and with the red mask, right?

1764
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
So we've got the, you know, we got the bitmap color and it with the

1765
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,200
red mask is what you're saying, right?

1766
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:52,400
We now know that we have just the 8 Bits of red that works.

1767
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,000
Just fine.

1768
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:56,700
But how do we get it to be right here?

1769
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,600
How do we move it to this location?

1770
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,700
Right, how would you do it?

1771
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,400
You can't shift it, left to move it to that location, because you

1772
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:11,900
don't know that it's actually to the left of where it is in the bitmap

1773
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,900
color and you can't shift it, right?

1774
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,500
Because you don't actually know if it's to the right, where the bitmap

1775
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,100
color is.

1776
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:23,300
So there is no actual way to write this code.

1777
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:28,200
Such that, you just did the the and, and then to shift, unless you had

1778
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,700
a shift that could go by positive or negative.

1779
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:34,500
Which we don't have or rotate, right?

1780
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:37,100
We don't have that.

1781
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:41,500
So what we have to do is the mask is not important.

1782
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,700
The mass doesn't matter at all.

1783
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,100
No one cares about the mask.

1784
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,900
What matters is the shift and what we have to do, in order to make

1785
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:51,600
sure we shift to the right place is shift down so that we align it all

1786
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,600
the way at the bottom.

1787
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,200
So that we know that it's been shifted all the way to the bottom,

1788
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,200
which we can do by just using whatever the least significant set B, is

1789
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,600
that we find in the mask and then we can shift it back up to its

1790
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,000
actual location since we're already doing that.

1791
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,300
We might, as well just use unknown mask because we can't it's free for

1792
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,500
us to do it and it, avoids us having to, even bother doing anything

1793
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,000
with these guys.

1794
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
They can be reused, they don't have to stay in registers.

1795
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,600
They can just be reused, right?

1796
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,100
So just be less efficient frankly to use these masks at that point.

1797
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,100
Can you ever talk about the code?

1798
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,000
You made that shipped 2000 plus X.

1799
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:37,700
Sure.

1800
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,700
So it's just, it's a, it's an animation.

1801
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,500
It's a runtime animation package.

1802
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:46,900
And it's basically like, you know.

1803
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,900
You can actually see up here.

1804
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:55,400
They've got a bunch of random marketing stuff.

1805
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:55,900
Right?

1806
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,200
Like it's just, it's a runtime animation system and a thing that

1807
01:26:59,200 --> 01:26:59,800
export stuff.

1808
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,100
Of Maxima and stuff like that.

1809
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:05,100
So basically like, you know, I wrote like all this stuff for our

1810
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:05,500
pipeline.

1811
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,800
So basically like pull data out of Max and Maya and like condition it

1812
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,700
and then play it back at runtime and provide access to it and that

1813
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:14,400
sort of stuff, and, you know, do, animation blending, and that sort of

1814
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:14,800
stuff.

1815
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,300
So that's that's basically that's what it is.

1816
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,700
Pink is a video playback engine and I worked on the second version of

1817
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:22,100
it.

1818
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:27,000
I was basically the second programmer on it for for Jeff because he

1819
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,100
just had a lot of work to do on it.

1820
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:28,800
So I

1821
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,900
What sort of doing a bunch of the code gen stuff and just stuff that

1822
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,000
need to be done on the project.

1823
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:36,800
So,

1824
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,200
What about stun hamsters?

1825
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,100
Yeah, there is stunning upstairs there.

1826
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,800
Stun, hamsters, and there's also the owl flying game, but those are

1827
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,000
not like actual released games.

1828
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,100
Those were game Jam games.

1829
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:04,300
Will we use a component system mapping smaller, Focus trucks, like

1830
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:07,400
collision and Graphics entities to allow looping over more of each per

1831
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:07,800
frame.

1832
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:13,200
Yeah, but I would say let's wait wait till we get there.

1833
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:13,900
There's a bunch of stuff.

1834
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:16,700
We have to talk about with entities and that's like the least of our

1835
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,300
concerns.

1836
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,700
Anticipation for when gooeys will appear?

1837
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,600
Well, I'm not sure what you mean by that.

1838
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,400
Exactly.

1839
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,100
We won't have any gooeys in this game.

1840
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,200
It's strictly going to be an action game.

1841
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,100
There's not going to be like menus and stuff.

1842
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:55,800
Mamizou Zuko or MMOs Echo.

1843
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,900
So those rotate instructions that you're talking about.

1844
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,100
He was posting that, you do have rotate instructions and you're

1845
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:03,700
supposed to like them unless I'm very much mistaken.

1846
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:07,700
Those are only 16 bit rotates, so they don't help you, but I'll

1847
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:08,400
double-check.

1848
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,600
Oops, typed it in wrong.

1849
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:20,900
But maybe not.

1850
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:21,400
We'll see.

1851
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,200
Do these actually work.

1852
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,900
Wait, is this a 64 bit rotate?

1853
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,300
When did that happen?

1854
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,400
Does it actually work?

1855
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,700
Has anyone actually tried this?

1856
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,900
I did not know that you could do a 64 bit rotate.

1857
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:51,100
Where is this documented rotates B.

1858
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,400
Like, what is it supported on it?

1859
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,300
Is it not say?

1860
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,900
It's just like, you get to guess what it supported on, because yes, we

1861
01:29:58,900 --> 01:29:59,800
could totally use a rotating.

1862
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,300
If we had a rotate but I didn't know you could rotate more than 16

1863
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,100
because I know that they've got the wrote the old rotate instructions

1864
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,000
on x86.

1865
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,800
But in x64, I didn't know if they had ever actually put any of them in

1866
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,100
there.

1867
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,700
So that would be kind of cool.

1868
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:15,300
Does this work?

1869
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,100
Or like I just don't want to find out.

1870
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:18,800
This is only itanium or something.

1871
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:19,900
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1872
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:26,300
Why don't you give me any any useful things here?

1873
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:27,000
So let's

1874
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,000
oh wait, but these are serious.

1875
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,300
These aren't intrinsics.

1876
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:36,400
Though.

1877
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,800
So these are just these might not actually be instructions, right?

1878
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,800
So, I don't know, this is actually useful but we'll check it out.

1879
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,600
So let's let's find out.

1880
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:50,900
Let's let's find out.

1881
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:51,400
We'll see.

1882
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,500
if I want to call this,

1883
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,100
what was that one actually called their underscore?

1884
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:03,900
Raphael?

1885
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,900
Unsigned in value and inch shift.

1886
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:21,200
So I guess what I have to do is redshift so and then the value is just

1887
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:21,600
whatever.

1888
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,000
Who cares?

1889
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,500
If the value is, let's say that it's the green mask for some reason.

1890
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:27,500
Okay.

1891
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:28,900
So oops.

1892
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:34,800
So what I want to do here is I want to say, alright, I get a Unit 32

1893
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,600
back, which is my result.

1894
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:37,900
Let's see what happens there.

1895
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,700
Cannot convert argument to from B, go, right?

1896
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,900
I got to do redshift index.

1897
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,900
So let's see what that actually ends up doing.

1898
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,000
And then we'll have to check.

1899
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,100
We may have to turn on the optimizer, to actually get it to do what it

1900
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,200
would actually do for real.

1901
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,400
So this may not be a fair test.

1902
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:01,100
But I just want to see what it ends up doing here with that with that.

1903
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,300
And with that guy.

1904
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,600
Let's see there.

1905
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:08,300
All right.

1906
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,700
So let's open up the disassembly.

1907
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:12,400
See what's what's going down.

1908
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:14,800
There we go.

1909
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,300
So, does this actually work?

1910
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:24,800
Well, that's a full-on rol instruction.

1911
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:27,200
Does that actually work?

1912
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,400
This is going to be pretty darn exciting at this works.

1913
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:32,500
Whoa.

1914
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,900
Yeah, I did not know that you had those in x64.

1915
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:41,400
I mean, I don't I guess I hadn't had an occasion to go find out but

1916
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,400
that's pretty awesome.

1917
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:48,900
If that's actually true because yes, then if we have the rotate then

1918
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,100
we can totally do it.

1919
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:54,600
Because basically all we need to do if we have the rotate is we can

1920
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,800
just make sure that we know whatever the difference is between these

1921
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,200
two.

1922
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,500
Yeah, and and then we wouldn't have to do two shifts, right?

1923
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,000
We can do a single shift.

1924
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,200
So let's try that.

1925
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,600
So what we want to do here is if we have a rotate.

1926
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,400
Then, let's see.

1927
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,200
We have our red shift and the red shift, is where the red is

1928
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:18,800
currently.

1929
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,300
And we know where we want the red to be.

1930
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:27,100
And so, what we could do is say alright, we want to take where we want

1931
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:29,600
the red to be, which is 16 up.

1932
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,200
Right?

1933
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:35,100
And we want to subtract from that, whatever that index is what's, what

1934
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,500
is our B can result here.

1935
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:40,100
Let's see, handmade intrinsic study, H.

1936
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,500
What is our B can result?

1937
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,400
So, our B can result.

1938
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,900
Finally significant set B comes back with that index.

1939
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,200
They're okay.

1940
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:53,600
And so what we'll do is, we'll say all right, whatever that index is,

1941
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:57,200
we will subtract that index from 16.

1942
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:01,800
And if it's more than 16, it'll just basically be.

1943
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,000
It'll basically be a

1944
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,300
rotate in the other direction.

1945
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:09,600
So it'll be rotate right now.

1946
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,000
I want to make sure this is signed.

1947
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:14,300
So I'm going to go ahead and make sure that signs like that and will

1948
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:16,600
basically say that okay, we can rotate left now.

1949
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,200
Whatever that value actually is.

1950
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:25,300
So this is actually going to be our, our red shift is actually going

1951
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:29,300
to be something else that this is this is like the redshift search if

1952
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:34,500
you will, so this is the redshift or I guess we'll call this red scan.

1953
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:36,800
So we'll do red, scan, read, scan.

1954
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:41,100
That's can look so on and then that way we can still assert that they

1955
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:52,300
actually were found and then we can just do redshift equals this so

1956
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:59,900
right that and that way we now have all of the values that we have red

1957
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,300
green, blue, and Alpha.

1958
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:07,400
We will actually have the shifts where we want them to go.

1959
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,600
Right?

1960
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,300
And then,

1961
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,600
If I'm not misunderstanding how this function is meant to work, then

1962
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,500
we could actually use those rotates and that'd be pretty cool because

1963
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:23,500
that's the only reason that we weren't using the masks before.

1964
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:26,800
So now we actually can use the masks and we can say.

1965
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:33,100
Alright, let's do our our same calculation here.

1966
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,800
But instead of doing it this way, right?

1967
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:38,600
We'll do it.

1968
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,900
using a rotation, so

1969
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,900
Let's see.

1970
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,700
Let's see.

1971
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:53,900
I need to do rotate left.

1972
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,600
And I guess I purely arbitrarily picking rotate left, but we'll do

1973
01:35:59,600 --> 01:35:59,800
red.

1974
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,600
Gift.

1975
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:04,400
And I want to do see is the value.

1976
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:09,800
So I'm going to do see and red mask like so on.

1977
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,200
So basically, that's all I have to do.

1978
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:15,400
So, yeah, I think that's it, right.

1979
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,600
I think that's really all we need to do.

1980
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:26,700
We do see and green mask, blue mask, Alpha mask, and then we shift

1981
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:28,800
them by the different shifts.

1982
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:34,800
And then all we have to do is actually put those intrinsics in

1983
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:35,300
somewhere.

1984
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:41,900
So in here, we need to actually put in the rotate rotate left.

1985
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:53,600
And that'll take a value and a amount and it will return that rattle.

1986
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,000
There we go.

1987
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:59,400
And for good measure we might as well.

1988
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,500
Do a rotate, right?

1989
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:03,500
You know I'm saying.

1990
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:06,700
All right.

1991
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:11,800
So will this actually do what we want?

1992
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:13,000
I have actually no idea.

1993
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:18,000
Because like I said, I didn't even know those were in ecstasy for they

1994
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,700
are, which is pretty great.

1995
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,400
So let's go ahead and make sure that I'm actually doing any of this,

1996
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:22,900
right?

1997
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,100
so,

1998
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,400
Red shift, green shift, blue shift.

1999
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,600
Alpha shift.

2000
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:43,600
So, let's see if I agree with what it computed for those first blue

2001
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,200
mask, Alpha mask.

2002
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:50,700
So please hexadecimal me.

2003
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:51,400
There we go.

2004
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,600
So the red mask is there needs to be there.

2005
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,500
That is a negative 8 shift.

2006
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:57,900
So is that so is that?

2007
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,000
And that one is a 24?

2008
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,300
So yeah, I agree with all of those.

2009
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:04,900
Those are exactly what I would expect them to be, and let's go see

2010
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,500
what it actually generated here.

2011
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,400
Inside raw tell.

2012
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:19,500
Salt and value.

2013
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,700
Yeah, this is pretty cool.

2014
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:23,800
I'm pretty excited about.

2015
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,400
Whoa.

2016
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:25,900
Thank you.

2017
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:29,600
Visual Studio know what you were talking about there, but that's fine.

2018
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:35,300
All right, so hey awesome.

2019
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,900
So that answers to questions than answers.

2020
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:41,300
My question about whether you can rotate and x64 turns out you can.

2021
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,500
And that answer is trireme.

2022
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,100
Rufus is question about why we weren't using the mask.

2023
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,300
Well, we weren't using the mass because I didn't know that we could

2024
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:49,800
rotate.

2025
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:53,300
And so I didn't think I had that option, but we can rotate.

2026
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:54,300
So now we're all good.

2027
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:56,900
So that's totally great.

2028
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,800
And thank you Mo Z Co, I don't know.

2029
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,100
Bounce that but for pointing those out because I totally, I think I

2030
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:05,000
even searched for them at one point and didn't find them.

2031
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,600
So that's pretty cool that those are there.

2032
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:08,700
All right.

2033
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,600
I think I think

2034
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:19,700
Think we could just say that's done.

2035
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:21,900
Let's just let's just call it.

2036
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:22,600
There we go.

2037
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:23,800
Cool.

2038
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,900
All right, okay.

2039
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,000
I think that's it for questions.

2040
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,300
Let's take a look.

2041
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:51,200
Okay, so Matt D says that the rotate will work but it's micro coated

2042
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,100
so don't use it when you need performance.

2043
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:57,500
So maybe that wasn't such a good idea after all.

2044
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,500
Who knows though.

2045
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:05,900
It depends on whether the microcode version is faster than the shift

2046
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,700
than doing, two shifts, which it might be.

2047
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:09,400
I don't really know.

2048
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:20,200
Doesn't the rotate mess with XP compatible thing, you're watching.

2049
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:21,300
No, not really.

2050
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:28,300
Because the the XV compatibility for x86 code, it should still work,

2051
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:31,300
but it would just be like a slower version or something like that.

2052
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:36,000
I would think, because it looks like the 30, the 32-bit.

2053
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,700
No, actually, the 32-bit version is available in x86.

2054
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:39,400
I'm pretty sure.

2055
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,500
So that should be fine.

2056
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,400
It was only x64 that I wasn't sure about.

2057
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:56,600
Yeah, I don't know.

2058
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:59,500
So it's a good question, though.

2059
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,900
Just how fast it is.

2060
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:03,600
If it's my coated, I wonder what the actual speeds are.

2061
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:07,200
And one interesting thing to look at would be like, I wonder, if

2062
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:13,600
If the agner fog tables talk about what the actual speed is roughly

2063
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,700
like what you could, what you would expect it to be in general and I

2064
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:18,500
don't really know.

2065
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:20,800
So

2066
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,100
What what?

2067
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,400
I don't want to be on this.

2068
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:40,500
Yeah, so

2069
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:45,800
that's it.

2070
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,700
And wanted to show me more.

2071
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,000
I want I want I want to look.

2072
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:58,900
Down at more modern one of the more modern processors.

2073
01:41:59,200 --> 01:41:59,800
I guess I'll just do it.

2074
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:01,400
That'll work.

2075
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,400
so,

2076
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:09,800
how bad?

2077
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,600
Does it get?

2078
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,300
It's basically the question?

2079
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:30,100
Don't want to know about the Nano 3000, always have such trouble using

2080
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:30,800
these tables.

2081
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:34,500
I want them to be organized a little bit easier.

2082
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:38,000
Maybe just like a search or something that tells you like.

2083
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,100
Okay, here's here's the instructor.

2084
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:44,200
I want them like B all the processors listed next to the instruction,

2085
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:46,600
which is

2086
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,100
Just easier said than done.

2087
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,900
Someone needs to make the Uber agner.

2088
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:53,600
Fog, tables or whatever.

2089
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:58,000
I wonder if the if that other site has any of the information like

2090
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:58,500
that on it.

2091
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:01,400
I don't think it does but it's something we could check real quick.

2092
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:06,900
Oops, now, that's not going to have it.

2093
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:09,100
That doesn't help.

2094
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:10,200
Yeah.

2095
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:10,600
I don't know.

2096
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:15,300
I'd be interested to know across like a couple processors, how bad it

2097
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:18,300
was because it might be that rotate still better than doing two

2098
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:18,800
shifts.

2099
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,500
You know, I mean, I don't know.

2100
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:22,900
I don't know the timings of it.

2101
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:23,900
So be interesting to see.

2102
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:41,500
Yeah.

2103
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,200
It did look fast to me, pseudonym 73.

2104
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:47,400
It looked like it was going to be fast to me as well.

2105
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,800
So I think it's probably something you actually would want to do if

2106
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,200
you have to rotate like if you're going to actually do something

2107
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,000
that's a rotate operation.

2108
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,700
I suspect the microcode rotate would be faster than you doing.

2109
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:56,300
Two shifts.

2110
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:59,200
Because otherwise why wouldn't it just microcode to two shifts?

2111
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:06,000
Right, but I don't know, maybe not I guess because it wouldn't maybe

2112
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,600
be able to quite figured that out.

2113
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,000
I don't know, hard to say but

2114
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:12,400
All right.

2115
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:15,900
Anyway, I think we have well and truly overstayed our welcome, this

2116
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:16,400
evening.

2117
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,100
It is getting rather late.

2118
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:21,400
So let us call it a day.

2119
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:22,300
Tomorrow.

2120
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:25,900
We can resume our Collision detection stuff since we're kind of we're

2121
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:29,300
getting to the point where things are going to things are going to be

2122
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:33,100
starting to be a little bit more pressing in terms of us.

2123
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,900
Figuring out exactly what our

2124
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,900
Attack plans going to be like I was saying today, we really at this

2125
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:44,000
point need to start sort of consolidating and and figuring out how we

2126
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,300
want to do rendering stuff because we're getting to the point where we

2127
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:51,300
want to start having debug visualizations and let stuff like that.

2128
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:52,800
So we're going to have to kind of go.

2129
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,800
All right, what are the things that we actually need to figure out

2130
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:55,100
here?

2131
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:56,700
Let's go figure them out.

2132
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:58,900
So we can start to make the render a proper and kind of Leverage from

2133
01:44:58,900 --> 01:44:59,800
there and

2134
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,700
We've got our player movement thing kind of under control.

2135
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:04,700
We want to do the Collision detection and then the other big thing

2136
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:07,000
that I want to take a look at before we start to talk about the

2137
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,300
renderer though is seeing compositing.

2138
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:12,000
And so I feel like that's really something that I still want to do

2139
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,300
with, before we tackle, before we start, tackling the renderer or

2140
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,500
finalizing on sort of how, we're going about approaching things in the

2141
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,000
design.

2142
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:25,100
And so yeah, so I think for the rest of the week, I suspect that we

2143
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:28,000
will probably work on the character movement code, getting some

2144
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,900
animation in there and seeing how we want to

2145
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,100
Do animation of the character and, and what we want from the render in

2146
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:38,500
terms of that because I think that will be very important to know and

2147
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,000
how will want that to line up.

2148
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,900
And then the thing that I think will want to move onto after that is,

2149
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:44,100
how did you see in composition?

2150
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:47,700
So let's start actually taking tile Maps, building actual scenes, out

2151
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:51,100
of them, and seeing what we want in terms of that scene, composition

2152
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:51,300
stuff.

2153
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:55,600
And then that I think will probably put us into a pretty good place

2154
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,500
where we can sort of say.

2155
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:59,500
Alright now we can go build the renderer and

2156
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,900
The the final like sort of world store and stuff and get that working

2157
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:06,500
to a good place.

2158
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,300
And then that'll that'll kind of tie up all of our engineer start

2159
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:11,200
stuff that we need to do.

2160
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,100
We want to do sound at some point to.

2161
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:16,100
But again, this game doesn't have a lot of demands in terms of sound.

2162
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:18,100
So those will probably be a lot simpler than the stuff that we're

2163
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,200
doing here because, you know, we're just going to be doing basic

2164
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:20,400
stuff.

2165
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,100
You music, playback and sound effects.

2166
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,800
We don't have a whole lot of stuff that we need to sort of think about

2167
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,100
there.

2168
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:28,700
So that'll be a little bit easier than the graphics to say the least,

2169
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:29,800
but that's basically,

2170
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:33,400
Ali where we're at, so, we're feeling pretty good about it.

2171
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:36,900
Again, we're only just now we're about five hours.

2172
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:40,300
We're not even off of Monday on our second week of coding, If This

2173
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:44,200
Were mapped to the weekday, so we've made quite a bit of progress for

2174
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:45,100
how short of a time.

2175
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,200
We've actually been programmed for us.

2176
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:47,000
So, that's pretty cool.

2177
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:50,700
Anyway, I will be back here tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.

2178
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:51,800
To start work on the clothes and texture.

2179
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:56,700
8:30, not 8, Pacific Standard time because John Blow is doing his next

2180
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:59,300
compiler, Presentation tomorrow, and I would like to watch it.

2181
01:46:59,700 --> 01:46:59,800
So

2182
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,100
Me, come on the stream at the normal time, but I will just have John

2183
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:08,000
on my desktop and I will be watching him because I want to see what he

2184
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:08,600
has to present.

2185
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,900
So if you want to join me for that, that's cool too, but I won't be

2186
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:14,800
actually starting handmade hero until 8:30.

2187
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:18,600
So so that will be a slight difference tomorrow, but then we'll be

2188
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,200
back to 8:00 the following night.

2189
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:21,100
So I would love it.

2190
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,100
If you would join me.

2191
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:23,400
I hope to see you here tomorrow.

2192
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:28,200
If you would like to preorder the game and get access to the source

2193
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:28,500
code.

2194
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:29,600
You can as always.

2195
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,800
Do that at handmade hero dot-org.

2196
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,800
That is the site that has to handle People Order button on it.

2197
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,400
And if you want to do that, you will be able to follow along with

2198
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,400
source code because I upload it every night after we finished

2199
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:41,300
programming together.

2200
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:43,300
If you want Sports video series.

2201
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:47,600
We also have a patreon that you can go to and of course, for more

2202
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:48,600
educational resources.

2203
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,700
There's always the news and Forum site, which is great place to go.

2204
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:51,700
I highly recommend it.

2205
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,300
It's got the schedule for the week always posted on.

2206
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,600
It's got an episode guide so you can catch up on past videos.

2207
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:59,500
It's got coding resources where people have ported stuff to other

2208
01:47:59,500 --> 01:47:59,800
platforms.

2209
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,800
Already, even though we haven't they have so if you're looking to get

it running on Mac or Linux or something, that's great, place to go and

2211
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,300
there's a Code discussion board where you can go and ask programming

2212
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:11,100
questions, and if you want to discuss the series in more detail,

2213
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:12,000
that's a great place to do it.
