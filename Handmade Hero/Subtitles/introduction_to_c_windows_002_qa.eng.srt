1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,600
Okay, we are back with the Q&A session for the second day of the test.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,700
Stream, the intro to see basically this is the Q&A session for what we

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,700
talked about a little bit about basically, creating space for values,

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,200
how things are encoded as values and how Assembly Language works with

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,100
them, in order to set the stage for tomorrow, where we are going to

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,400
start looking in detail exactly how code executes on the CPU.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,400
So let's take a look.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,000
Alright, I am going to catch up on the chat.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,100
Let's see doo-doo-doo-doo.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
We're talking about rust here, a little.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
So that's C.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
2's compliment.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,700
He's going to read our flame War about compute.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,400
Our language is no I'm not gonna read your flame.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Are you know, what?

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,700
I will say that I really like doing this series even though I've only

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,300
done it twice.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,100
Now, it's I love doing it.

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,700
I'm hoping to get better at

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,800
Get better at explaining things and everything, but I'm always very

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,500
positive on it and happy because I'm so enjoying doing it.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,000
But I am just like everyone else when it comes to Flame Wars.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
I am sure that if I were in the twitch chat, I would be flaming.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,800
So I'm not going to read your flame where, but I totally, I know where

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,900
your I know where you guys are at.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,200
I know about the flame Wars.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,100
They happen.

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,800
What can you do?

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,600
So you said, okay, idiocracy says, Casey you mentioned earlier that

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,500
Windows requires with the line feet and a carriage return to probably

31
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:33,800
move on to the

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,300
This line and we can type this ourselves and source code with to

33
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,700
escape codes, back to Starbucks.

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,300
And if that's the case, how come I can use a printf statement windows

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,800
with back session without any mention of backslash R.

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,600
And the output is formatted correctly.

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,900
That is a fabulous question and it's something that I may never get to

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,100
in the mainstream because we may not need to know.

39
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,000
I probably will.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,700
But so I'm going to actually answer that fully right now.

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,200
It's not.

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,400
It's not that complicated.

43
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,800
Okay, so what actually happens and I don't actually, you know what,

44
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,000
maybe?

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,200
Maybe we can even go on a little Adventure here.

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,200
I don't know.

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
I don't know if you guys are in the mood for an adventure, but we

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,300
could go on a little Adventure if we wanted to.

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,700
So if I type in, he was asking about printf and printf is a thing in.

50
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,200
See that basically is part of the standard Library.

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,100
We're going to talk about the standard library, is later.

52
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,000
We're going to talk about why it sucks to, but we're gonna talk about

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,500
the standard library and the standard Library Define some things that

54
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,900
we can do printf is a thing that prints out to a console.

55
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,200
So, if you're writing a console application, which we are not

56
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,200
I talked about that at the very beginning of the very first one of

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,300
these.

58
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,200
I said we're building and not a console application.

59
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,900
But if you were building it and you were running it from one of these

60
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,800
guys a command prompt when you ran, it would basically print out what

61
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,500
you put in here out to the command prompt.

62
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
So it's kind of like output debug string but it's actually

63
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,000
user-facing.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
It comes out to the users command prompt.

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,800
Well I want to know is is this and

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,700
Library source.

67
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,200
Code installed, survey says,

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,300
Yes, it is.

69
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,200
Okay, so if we actually go into printf here.

70
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,600
And this is kind of Again, part of the emissaries always know what's

71
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,100
going on.

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Printf is something that someone else wrote and if we want to see what

73
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,100
it does, we should step on in there to it.

74
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,000
And so we can kind of see by going through the debugger is there's a

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,500
bunch of C code in here.

76
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,400
We're going to open the argument list.

77
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,900
We're going to do some stuff with.

78
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,100
Oh, it's going to try to do a tricep block to try and figure out.

79
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,800
If anyone's going to crash in there.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,600
It's going to do an output.

81
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,500
What's going on here.

82
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,200
I have Funk here.

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,600
We are in a crazy function.

84
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:38,800
This is

85
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,200
Probably the actual meat of printf, I would guess.

86
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,800
Is it actually going in here?

87
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Yes, it is.

88
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,300
Here we go.

89
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,200
It's doing all of the cases.

90
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,500
It needs to do for printf.

91
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
Yeah, you can see.

92
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,500
There's all kinds of good stuff in here.

93
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,200
Here's the different format codes.

94
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,000
All right.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,300
So this is basically the source code to printf in the Microsoft

96
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,700
edition of visual C++.

97
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,200
And what you can see in here is it's going to go through all the

98
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,600
string.

99
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,800
It's going to be tons of code to try and figure out.

100
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,800
What you typed in there, and I don't know if I want to actually try to

101
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,899
find it specifically in here because I don't actually know how it's

102
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,399
encoded in.

103
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,200
It might take a while.

104
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm just doing a quick scan to see if it jumps out at me.

105
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,600
It's a little hard to do that while I'm talking of course because it's

106
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,700
code that I've never seen before bet.

107
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,900
Basically.

108
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,600
I wanted to see if it showed what happened when it got to the

109
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
backslash n.

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
Because that would be relevant to us.

111
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,500
Now.

112
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,300
I didn't see it there and I suspect they've been coded it separately.

113
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah.

114
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,900
All right.

115
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,700
So unfortunately I can't pinpoint the exact code for you.

116
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,300
But well, you know what?

117
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,600
Let's not give up yet.

118
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,900
I said we were going to go on an adventure and so you know what an

119
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,100
adventure takes some time sometimes why Rush The Adventure?

120
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,500
I was going to print out just the backslash n.

121
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,100
So the very first thing that happens in our print f is going to be

122
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,600
that.

123
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
So let's see what it does.

124
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,900
Shall we?

125
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,400
I think we shall.

126
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,100
Let's go on in here.

127
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,000
And let's see what we do.

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,300
We are going to handle locales always good case.

129
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,900
You're at some kind of foreign locales.

130
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,600
We're gonna get some stuff formatted and we have gotten ourselves into

131
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,400
position.

132
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,500
Look at that.

133
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,800
CH the thing that they are processing in this Loop.

134
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,900
I'm covered Loops yet.

135
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,700
But hey think we're passing in this Loop sometimes in the Q&A.

136
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,200
When you go on an adventure you just gotta jump.

137
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,900
Jump forward, you gotta jump forwards.

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,900
There's that 10.

139
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,100
That's the backslash n.

140
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,200
We were talking about.

141
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's see how it handles it.

142
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,800
It's going into the switch statement about its current state.

143
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,800
Then it's going to check some things.

144
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,200
It's going to do a right care directly on that.

145
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,400
So our right care statement looks like where we need to be, what

146
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
happens in here?

147
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,800
It is going to call into yet another function.

148
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,500
Oh sweet Mercy!

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,100
Will we ever actually write a piece of code?

150
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,400
Let's see, written account.

151
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,900
I are right saying the flags.

152
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,300
Trying not to accidentally skip forwards as we go.

153
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,500
And it is going to set that if not Define Unicode.

154
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,700
It's going to set stream base and then

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,100
We are going to return CH and 0 now.

156
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,200
Okay, so I don't actually know why this is going to be a little more

157
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,400
complicated than I thought.

158
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,100
I had hoped, I might be able to point you to a very Smoking Gun there.

159
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,900
Which was basically like a place where it actually did the

160
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,100
translation, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to find it for you.

161
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,400
So, I'm sorry.

162
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
I want to go on an adventure.

163
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,100
I thought maybe we pay off but I feel like it might take a little too

164
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,400
long.

165
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,600
So I don't want to belabor that point too much.

166
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,100
I will simply tell you what the answer is if we continue to step.

167
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,600
This, we could find it actually doing where it translates out that

168
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,400
stream base, which, I don't know, exactly where in their code, they

169
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,900
actually do that because as you might imagine, I don't spend a lot of

170
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,100
time.

171
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,200
Looking at Microsoft's implementation of print out, the answer of why

172
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,900
you can do that is because see, tried to solve the problem for you,

173
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,300
the multi-platform problem.

174
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,300
So what I said was basically you've got Windows, you know, it wants

175
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,900
backslash R backslash n.

176
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,600
Unix operating system from Europe.

177
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,100
Just wants a backslash N.

178
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,500
I believe Mac just wants back sesh or, I don't know, Max, even

179
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,600
something else I think back in the old days, but nowadays, I think

180
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,100
since they're Unix underneath, they may, they may just adhere to the

181
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,000
eunuch standard now, so I said this and someone in the chat, actually,

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,700
idiocracy brought up the fact that how is he able to he programs in C

183
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,500
officer has tried program in C somewhat.

184
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
How is he able to put a backslash?

185
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,900
And when Windows wants a backslash are back session, which is what I

186
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,400
said.

187
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,900
Am I lying to you?

188
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,100
I would not lie to you.

189
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,500
It really does want to access our backsplash.

190
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,700
And the reason that that works is because see tried to solve this

191
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,500
problem for you.

192
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,800
It tried to basically make it so that didn't matter what problem

193
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,700
you're running on the same code, but still work.

194
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,299
So when you type this in, although it always gets translated into that

195
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:38,799
10.

196
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,799
The actual printf call when the stream itself is getting output to the

197
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,000
console under the hood in the code that you

198
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,900
Don't write the code that's in the C runtime Library.

199
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,000
That's actually the printf it will actually look for the Box.

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,600
/ ends the tens and translate them into backslash are back session.

201
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,800
Now, fun fact, this is why

202
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,700
If you go to look at and I'm just assuming that you know this because

203
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,400
you were asking me a question about printf.

204
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,000
If you go look at the signature for f, open the thing that opens a

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,600
file in the C runtime Library, you will note that it takes something

206
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,000
called a mode and that mode has some interesting aspects to it.

207
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,700
There's the thing called be that you can put on the mode, which says,

208
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,200
open the file in binary mode.

209
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,200
Hmm.

210
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,000
So why would I have to open a file in binary mode?

211
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,400
Isn't everything a computer binary with a difference between opening

212
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,900
and binary mode and not opening in binary mode.

213
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,500
Right?

214
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,400
Well, the answer is because see tried to solve the Line Feed problem.

215
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,900
And so what it did is it decided that it would actually go through and

216
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,800
it would translate all of those into the correct one for the platform.

217
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,500
So it's he's back size and it would translate it into backslash and on

218
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,800
Unix, just a pass-through or backs.

219
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,600
Us are boxed us.

220
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,500
And if it was on Windows, now the

221
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,100
With that is that if you were trying to write something in binary,

222
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,500
that was actually just data.

223
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,900
Like if you're trying to save data to a file and you tried to write it

224
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:11,200
out, the stream itself will actually translate the binary code.

225
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
So you might try to write the value 10.

226
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,900
You were nothing to do with the string.

227
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,600
Like you're trying to write out the fact that the guy has 10 hit

228
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,500
points and it will mess that up for you and it'll mess it up for you

229
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,400
in a really hard to deal with way, because it will actually insert

230
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,100
another character.

231
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,500
So now,

232
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,500
Your your data is all messed up.

233
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,900
And so what you have to do when you open a file that you want to

234
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,900
write, binary directly to that isn't supposed to be text and it's not

235
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,700
supposed to be text.

236
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,100
You have to tell the stream that you're writing in binary.

237
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,900
And so you may have encountered this bug where you accidentally forgot

238
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,200
the binary when you open the file that you were writing to and you

239
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,900
tore your hair out, you were like, I'm writing this stuff to the file

240
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,100
and then I try to load the file on.

241
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,800
It's broken.

242
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
What's going on?

243
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,100
Well, that's what's going on is translating for you.

244
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
And then you're like, oh, I forgot to add binary.

245
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,500
You had by now.

246
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,400
Everything works.

247
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,500
So that's what that is.

248
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,100
It's basically these functions have that built-in now output debug

249
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,700
string.

250
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,500
Also accepts backslash n.

251
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,200
So that's why I didn't have to put a backslash R backslash and here.

252
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,300
But if we were to write actual directly, if we were actually directly

253
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,000
writing to the console or actually directly writing to a text file on

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,600
Windows.

255
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,200
We would have to put the backslash R backslash n ourselves.

256
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,900
Hopefully, that answers that question.

257
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Okay, let's take a look.

258
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,800
Here.

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,200
Is it possible to write win32 apps assuming utf-8?

260
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,600
Or must you?

261
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,400
Always use why utf-16 to be honest with you?

262
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,500
I don't think there's really any way to write utf-8.

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,700
You can write your app and utf-8 which a lot of people do and it's

264
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,000
what I would do but then you always when you talk to Windows you have

265
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,400
to have a little piece of code that like shimmies it out that

266
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,500
basically like, you know Converse the utf-8 to UTS seems really

267
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,200
tedious and unfortunate, but that's the way it works.

268
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,200
They may have added some things with like Windows 8.

269
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,300
Eight or stuff to do, Native utf-8 or something, but I ain't Touchin

270
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,800
Windows 8, so I have no idea.

271
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,800
I don't.

272
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,200
If they added that there but no, for the most part under the hood.

273
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,800
You actually always have to turn back to utf-16, but you probably

274
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
don't want to write your actual code that way, you probably just want

275
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,500
to deal with that.

276
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,100
At the end of the day, since Windows is the only people who do that.

277
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,900
So I was asking why I use dot CPP, if I write in pure C.

278
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,800
Is there an advantage or are you used to it?

279
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,200
So the reason is because I might show some C++ stuff.

280
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,900
I might show how to do some operator overloading.

281
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,000
For example, the reason that I call it programming in c is because

282
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
mostly I won't be doing much in the way of C++.

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,300
So if you were trying to learn really learn C++, I don't want to do

284
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,200
false advertising and tell you you're going to learn C++, because

285
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
you're not, we're not going to recover templates.

286
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
We're not going to cover inheritance for not going to cover a lot of

287
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,900
the things that you would do.

288
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,300
In C++.

289
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,700
We're going to stick to basic C code, but I can pile is not to be

290
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,300
peace because a that's what most people use even when they program in

291
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,500
see.

292
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,600
A lot of people will use dot CPS just because there's some things that

293
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,900
they might want to use the C++ and also because really see is easy to

294
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,800
compile and CPP.

295
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,300
Most things you can do in C are accepted by the C++ compiler.

296
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,000
So it's pretty easy to do so, so yeah, I really am programming this

297
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,900
game in C++ and we might use some C++ while we program it.

298
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
It's just that I'm not really going to be.

299
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,800
Be teaching much of C plus plus.

300
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,500
And so I didn't want to give people the expectation that they would be

301
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,200
learning C++ because they really won't, they're mostly learning see.

302
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,400
Someone asked folks frequently, right unsigned care.

303
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,900
In addition to care and signed our their land mines there to watch out

304
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,700
for the answer is, no, not really.

305
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,300
And so what, what what was being asked there by dr.

306
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,200
G's was basically that, if I were to take this unsigned here and move

307
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,100
it to here that is actually still totally legal.

308
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,200
See, it does not actually care where you put the unsigned, qualifier,

309
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,100
the unsigned.

310
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,300
It's called a CV qualifier.

311
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
No, it's not nevermind.

312
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,600
That's probably take notes not see cost, volatile things go after

313
00:13:59,600 --> 00:13:59,900
that.

314
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,300
Forget.

315
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,600
I ever said it's not CD, qualifier.

316
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,500
See, Clara comes later.

317
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,100
It's just part of the type and the type can actually be in either

318
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,400
order.

319
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,700
I do not actually know, you know, I focus a lot on coding and what

320
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,500
actually works for coding and there were times in my life when I got

321
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,000
pretty intimate with things like the parsing of the language and

322
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,800
things like that and knowing stuff like where that came from

323
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,300
historically.

324
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,000
I've kind of Forgotten most of it now, so I'm actually a bad.

325
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Person to ask for like say the historical reason why that's true at

326
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,500
the fact that I even said CV qualifier just been just to tell you that

327
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm reaching back into part of my brain that I don't access very often

328
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,400
and I'll make mistake mints or say the wrong thing when I try to talk

329
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,500
about some of the origin stuff.

330
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,100
So I don't know.

331
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,200
The historical reason for that.

332
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't know the historical reason why you can say Karen sign, I

333
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,900
believe you can also just say, signed care as well, instead of just

334
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,700
care and that works fine, too.

335
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,400
I think that compiled properly.

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,400
Yes.

337
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,000
So, yeah, so

338
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,300
There's a lot of ways you can write the same thing and really all that

339
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,600
matters.

340
00:14:59,600 --> 00:14:59,900
Is that

341
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,100
Have signed or unsigned in there or nothing and that you have been the

342
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,000
type value and they all will bow down to the same thing.

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
So I don't think there's anything to watch out for their, it's

344
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,500
personal preference.

345
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,600
Whichever one you want.

346
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,500
There may be pedants out there who want to tell you.

347
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,000
One is right?

348
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,600
And what is wrong?

349
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,100
Or one's more convenient, or whatever.

350
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,100
If that's what you feel about, that's totally fine.

351
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,500
I couldn't care less which way they can.

352
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,500
Let's see.

353
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,600
Let's see.

354
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,900
Don't appear on your stream.

355
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,400
Oh, no, the tooltips don't appear.

356
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm going to write that down to something to see if I can fix.

357
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,600
I want to kind of get maybe an outboard recording box at some point if

358
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,200
one exists.

359
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,000
So that I know that that everything I see on the screen that you can

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,900
see because it's just using OBS right now.

361
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,600
And I don't know if there's some things that won't work, and I don't

362
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,500
want to get in situations where I'm like, running the game and people

363
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,200
can't see the game running or things like that.

364
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
So yeah.

365
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,100
So, let's see.

366
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,800
Casey.

367
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,100
Do you plan to mention talk about the effect optimizations can have in

368
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,200
the as amount for the compiler?

369
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,100
Absolutely.

370
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Boy 2 to 3.

371
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,300
We will absolutely be doing that.

372
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,400
And in fact, one of the things that I will be doing at the end of this

373
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,600
little interest stream, probably this weekend, the main show will be

374
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,400
weekdays only, but this stream is going to be this weekend as well,

375
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,000
because I want to really refine the stream and get really good at

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,900
doing excavations before.

377
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,500
The first official cast on Monday.

378
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,500
One of the things I'll be doing is showing you how to compile from the

379
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,200
command line, and I will start talking about what those options are

380
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,000
and what they do.

381
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,800
Let's see.

382
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Print up a to do, do, do do do get the debug menu, while debugging

383
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
resource that you recommend.

384
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,900
Do you have resource that you'd recommend for practicing learning more

385
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,900
about Assembly.

386
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Not really.

387
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Unfortunately, I will be going through most of it on the stream and

388
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,800
explaining most of it, to the extent that you will need to know in

389
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,599
order to Be an Effective C programmer.

390
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,900
Now, if you want to be someone who actually programs in raw assembly,

391
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Not just little spots of assembly.

392
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,200
Like, what I'll do is I'll write a few things in assembly, what?

393
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,599
I need them to be really fast and often times.

394
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,900
I can even do that by using things that the C compiler has built in.

395
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,000
So you don't actually really have to write assembly.

396
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:27,500
You can actually write in sort of a pseudo assembly that it will and

397
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,800
it will do something.

398
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,900
It's like register allocation for you and all this sort of thing.

399
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,400
So, I will be explaining what you need to know, but if you actually

400
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,700
want to go be a real assembly, dude, and and that, and that's not me,

401
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,000
right?

402
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,100
Like you're actually talking about

403
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,300
About being hardcore about Assembly Language.

404
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Are you not know the proper references for that?

405
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,200
If someone out there is a hard crust.

406
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,700
Somebody guy if Jeff Roberts is listening or Sean Barrett old-school

407
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,300
guys, who do the Assembly Language Coatings, if they want to send some

408
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,900
resources in,

409
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,500
I would love to post them but I am the wrong guy to ask and I would

410
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,100
probably just tell you the wrong thing.

411
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,100
Do do.

412
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,900
What else did we have helped?

413
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,200
Learn?

414
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,000
Same boost.

415
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Mac OS X is now Unix etcetera, Etc.

416
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,100
Sorry trying to I apologize for missing some questions here.

417
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,500
If you want to one thing that might be good is to put at senior ettore

418
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,900
before or at handmade hero one of the other before the if you have a

419
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,000
specific question, so I can jump to them really quickly and not miss

420
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,500
anything.

421
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,500
Let's see from scratch.

422
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,000
Do you mean starting with zero lines of code and making no use of any

423
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,700
other code other than what than a virus is provide.

424
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,100
Yes, that is correct.

425
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,400
So you're saying audio Graphics basic data structures.

426
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,100
Etc.

427
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,700
Yes.

428
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,800
So all of that is true.

429
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,600
We will not be using any libraries.

430
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,400
Every last thing that shows up on the screen that you hear through.

431
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,000
The speakers will be written by us.

432
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,800
And the only things that we will be using that exist out in the wild

433
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,500
are basically a little tiny bit of the C runtime library because the

434
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,500
compiler makes it very hard to get rid of it in the old days, I would

435
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:17,700
have

436
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,000
Actually gotten rid of it for you and showed you how to do it without

437
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,300
the C runtime library at all.

438
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,300
Even though, almost no one ever does that in practice?

439
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,900
I think I'm one of the only people who ever shipped a product that did

440
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
that, that's not true.

441
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,500
I'm sure there's tons of people who do, but in a modern error.

442
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,900
I was probably one of you people ever tried to do that Granny.

443
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,300
Could the 3D animation Library grad could compile without C runtime

444
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,700
library and the tools that get shipped compiled without C runtime

445
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,100
libraries well, but

446
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,900
Ignoring that we will only be using the facilities of Windows itself,

447
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,100
and we will only be using the most limited versions of those.

448
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,400
So we will not be using Windows Graphics API at all.

449
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,800
We will basically only being using Windows to get our B to the screen.

450
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,500
That's it.

451
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,000
So, I am with my goal with the series is teach you how to do

452
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,800
absolutely everything from scratch, except the operating system

453
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,400
basically.

454
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,500
And hey man, I'd love to do that part 2, but it's hard to do that on

455
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,300
Modern computers because there's so much left to do.

456
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
We'll see maybe on the Raspberry Pi.

457
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
I've been thinking about maybe doing it on the Raspberry Pi.

458
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,400
So when the series is over, it may be time for a slice of pie if you

459
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,000
know what I mean.

460
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,900
Anyway, moving on.

461
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,300
I think I answered the C C++ question.

462
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,900
You probably answer that.

463
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,300
But why are you using Windows .h?

464
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,200
So I think we covered why I'm using Windows that H, but at the risk of

465
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,600
spoiling something.

466
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,800
I will say that we are only temporarily using Windows .h Windows.

467
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:56,900
That H may go away sooner than you think, come maybe five or six days

468
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,800
into the stream, into the real official stream, Windows, Windows 8,

469
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
Disappear, but the reason I was using Windows that H, is because I

470
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,100
needed to call output debug string, which is a Windows function in the

471
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,200
way.

472
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,100
You call Windows functions.

473
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,700
As you include their prototypes, which are in Windows .h,

474
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
let's see.

475
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,100
We are going to use work.

476
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,000
Nah, I'll ask if we're going to .h r dot h PP.

477
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,200
I usually use .h, I don't know why I don't care if people use DHCP, if

478
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,000
they want to, that's fine too, but I always use .h,

479
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,100
Let's see using CP units, proceed.

480
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,400
If I'm participial sister Libby.

481
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
Okay, Johan.

482
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,700
Oh, first it probably pass that wrong.

483
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,100
Do you find any parts of the SQL?

484
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,900
Standard Library useful.

485
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,800
Casey like standard sort certifying the like know I love with the C++

486
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,700
standard Library.

487
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,600
It is the worst.

488
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,400
It is like the antithesis of how I would like code to work and I do

489
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,700
not.

490
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,400
That with a 10-foot Pole.

491
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,900
Now.

492
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,600
I admit that if you do not have your own standard library, that you

493
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,300
have built up over the years, that do things like sorting and stuff

494
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,100
like that for you.

495
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,400
Then I admit that it may be tempting to use it and it may actually be

496
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
more efficient to use it.

497
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,700
If you're just doing something really quickly and don't have time to

498
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,500
build something else.

499
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,700
It may be quicker to use a standard library because it does have a lot

500
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,300
of stuff in there.

501
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,100
But oh man, if you are serious about programming, do not touch that

502
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,500
thing.

503
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,000
It is a nightmare.

504
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,700
Everything.

505
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,200
It does just complicate your life in a number of ways whether it's

506
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,600
from bloating, your compile.

507
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,100
Time bloating.

508
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,800
Your executable being hard to debug, being hard to read causing tons

509
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,500
of extra typing that didn't need to be there.

510
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,600
It's just it's awful.

511
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,700
And it all goes hand in hand with the fact that I think C++ really

512
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,300
dropped the ball on metaprogramming.

513
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,100
The fact that they lean on templates to do.

514
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,200
That is just ridiculous.

515
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,100
And templates, are, they're just, they're designed poorly.

516
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,400
It's a nightmare and I'm a metaprogramming aficionado.

517
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I don't really even write programs.

518
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:58,700
And

519
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,300
Handmade here is going to be one of the only programs that I right

520
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,700
probably ever in the future, that is not a meta program.

521
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,500
I do a lot of metaprogramming nowadays when I write code and it just

522
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,600
breaks my heart to try and program and see what C++ with the standard

523
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,400
library because it's just it's the worst meta programming language

524
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,000
I've ever seen.

525
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,600
Yeah, I can't stand it.

526
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
So no, I don't touch that stuff with a 10-foot pole.

527
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,800
I don't really want to argue about it necessarily because you know,

528
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,300
honestly if you can make it work, effectively for you.

529
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Great, go for it.

530
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,300
I, I can't stand it and I really don't like code bases that use it.

531
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,800
So I really stand to stand to stay away from it, and I will constantly

532
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,700
be advocating against it, but that does not mean that there can't be

533
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,900
people who make effective use of it, and then does not mean they're

534
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,200
people who won't be comfortable with it.

535
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,300
So, you know, one of the things that's true is when I say something

536
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,800
sucks or when I say something that I don't like or don't use, that's

537
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
just talking about me.

538
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,100
Personally, what I found to be effective if you find up the opposite

539
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,100
to be true, then that's just a different way of programming that

540
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,800
you've learned.

541
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
and just be very sure that you're actually

542
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,800
Write about it for you.

543
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,400
Don't just believe something has somebody else does it?

544
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
But if you're sure that you're right about it for you, then you are

545
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,900
right.

546
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,700
What makes you effective and What Makes You efficient at coding?

547
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,600
Is the right thing for you to do and it's not going to be the same

548
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,600
even among very, very good programmers.

549
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,000
I have seen code from lots of different, great programmers.

550
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,600
In my lifetime.

551
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,000
I've been fortunate enough to work with great programmers and see how

552
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,800
they write code.

553
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,700
No two people write code the same way.

554
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,500
There are some things that seem to be true about going really great,

555
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,200
crook programmers.

556
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
That I've seen be like, yeah, okay, there.

557
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,100
Code seems to adhere to a couple things that are true, but on the

558
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,300
whole there's a lot of varying ways in which they work and so I

559
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,500
wouldn't get too hung up on anything like should use a standard

560
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,100
libraries, shouldn't you, whatever the principles that I'll be

561
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,100
teaching in handmade here as it goes, forward are more about how you

562
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,800
determine.

563
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,400
What works well, how you determine, if you should use a standard

564
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,900
library.

565
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,900
And I'm not going to tell you, whether you should use a standard

566
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,400
Library.

567
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,100
I'm going to say that.

568
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,700
I don't want to use it, but I'm not going to tell you, tell you not to

569
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,100
use it.

570
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,200
I'm going to tell you how to figure out that you shouldn't use it.

571
00:24:59,600 --> 00:24:59,800
And then

572
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,500
You go through those steps that I say, and, and you look at how I say

573
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,200
to analyze something.

574
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,100
You may come to a different conclusion, you know, because it's kind of

575
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,300
like, you know, it's up some level.

576
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,200
It's a bit of an art form.

577
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,500
Right?

578
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,100
Coding is, I may say, here are the steps.

579
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,300
I used to come to that conclusion.

580
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,500
You may do the same steps and go.

581
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,000
No, I found that I was efficient when I did these steps.

582
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
I tried to do things and it did result in code that I could read.

583
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,900
Well, it did do these things and so I will harp more on the steps that

584
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,100
I think are true and that are Universal that you should be going

585
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,700
through and the

586
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,400
The mindset that you should have but the outcome of those is different

587
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,900
and each person depending on how their brain works in, depending on

588
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,400
how they code, is going to have a different opinion.

589
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,500
So, and that's fine.

590
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,700
And I, and as blustery as I may ever get about code things in my

591
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,200
heart.

592
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,300
I always believe that someone should be able to come to a different

593
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,200
conclusion than me.

594
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,600
And they should be able to yell at me about it, and I should be able

595
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,700
to yell back at them about it, but that's okay.

596
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,700
Takes all types.

597
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,500
Let's see what we've got here.

598
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,700
All the code and debugging.

599
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,000
What do you find use for graphics?

600
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,200
If you're out playing using libraries, such as opengl.

601
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,300
Do you want me to spoil the surprise Pagan heart?

602
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,800
Do you really want me to pose for us?

603
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,000
I will basically be showing you how to program by doing all of your

604
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
own rendering calling.

605
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Absolutely, no windows whatsoever until you have done, absolutely

606
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,500
everything yourself, all in your own code at the very last minute.

607
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,400
We'll just be using Windows to basically say here is a block of memory

608
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,800
that we've put the graphics in that we wanted just

609
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,400
Just copy those colors.

610
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
Like it, literally a bitmap.

611
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
We will have in-memory copy that to the screen.

612
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,600
That is the only thing that windows will do for us.

613
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,800
The same is true for audio.

614
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,800
We will basically do all of the audio ourselves until we get to the

615
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,800
very end and then we will basically tell Windows take just that and

616
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,900
played out the speaker, please.

617
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,300
Let's see.

618
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,900
What type of game of this be?

619
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,400
What type of game will this be that I'm going to wait till the

620
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
mainstream to answer.

621
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,300
I will simply say that it will be a game about adventuring sort of an

622
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,600
action adventure game.

623
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,900
Let's see it's going to say the same thing fantasy.

624
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,600
Question is saturated addition, logically equivalent to clamp.

625
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,600
Well, so dr.

626
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:29,800
G.

627
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,400
It's yes, and no.

628
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,700
What I would say about saturated addition is, it is sort of, like,

629
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,200
clamp.

630
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,300
If you assume that the clamp can happen in a space that's bigger than

631
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,200
what you had.

632
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,100
So for example, if you remember here, I had to 55 and then I added 1

633
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,500
to it and it became zero.

634
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,100
So the problem there is if I were to try doing the clamp after this,

635
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,100
to clamp it to 55, it's too late because it already wrapped Rock back

636
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,700
to zero.

637
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,400
But if I do that computation like in the register, it was doing the

638
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,900
computation in a bigger space that can.

639
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
For bigger numbers.

640
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,700
Does the addition first then does the clamp 2255 that would work.

641
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,200
So it's logical equivalent in that sense, but you have to make sure

642
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,500
that you don't overflow the value before you do.

643
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,100
The clamp.

644
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,100
Otherwise are the same.

645
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Paul 6.

646
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,100
Willie be creating a scripting language that we don't have to write

647
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,600
crappy C++ headers, where you want to add objects to our game Paul 6.

648
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,500
We will not be writing a scripting language.

649
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,100
We will be writing everything in C.

650
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,300
And the reason that we will be writing everything in C is because we

651
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,100
are going to try and make everything just a little bit more Dynamic

652
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,800
than if you were to try and do a scripting language for it, but

653
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,600
If we get to a point where we really need something like that, I'd be

654
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,100
happy to show you how to code a scripting language.

655
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,300
It's just there's a lot of work involved there that I don't know how

656
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,800
relevant it is to the actual kind of program management each.

657
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,900
But if we find that we need to do that or somehow this goes more

658
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,100
quickly.

659
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,600
I'm imagining it will take months to go through all these things

660
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,300
because I have to teach each individual thing.

661
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,600
So, even something that I know, would only take me a day to implement

662
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,000
is going to take many days to implement because I want to make sure I

663
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,400
explain it.

664
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,700
So, I would probably like to avoid doing a scripting language if I

665
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,000
could just because that sort of a separate thing, but, hey, maybe you

666
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,500
know, eventually

667
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,100
We get there, we could do that.

668
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,500
Sure.

669
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,100
When we get into sockets, netcode no, I'm definitely not going to do

670
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,800
netcode again.

671
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
I'm just going to try and cut that out.

672
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,400
What I want to do is focus on something.

673
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,700
What's the minimum set that we can do to still make a great game but

674
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,000
not take too much time.

675
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,400
And so there's a lot of great games out right now that are 2D local

676
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,900
co-op only or local single-player only but that are still awesome.

677
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,900
And so what I want to do is focus on making game, that's awesome.

678
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,400
But within those constraints, and the reason for that is because I'd

679
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,400
rather go deeper then going wider, so I don't want to

680
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,500
Seven years of your life to listen to this series and which I could

681
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,300
cover all the stuff like that Canasta or scripting languages.

682
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,300
For example, I don't really want to force that issue, but certainly

683
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,700
based on the response, if, if this series keeps being as popular as it

684
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,800
seems to be already,

685
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,100
With the number of people who are showing up to watch these, then I'll

686
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,300
just keep doing them ad infinitum.

687
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,500
I mean, I can spare an hour, a night to just keep going or two hours a

688
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,500
night at this point, I guess with the Q and A sessions, and so we

689
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,100
could just keep adding stuff to it after it's done, if we're like,

690
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
hey, yep.

691
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,900
We finished.

692
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,800
It's a good game.

693
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,500
Let's add that code.

694
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm totally fine with that.

695
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,000
But I just think it'll take us so long to go through everything.

696
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,500
If I really do a good job explaining.

697
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,800
I think I'll take a so long ago through it that we need to Pare down

698
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,800
to just what's necessary to make a great game.

699
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,400
I like the old school games where, you know, there wasn't a surly

700
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,900
netcode in them, but they're still awesome.

701
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,800
We'll be creating languages.

702
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,900
Will you be getting a suck?

703
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,500
A snakehead?

704
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,000
We did that.

705
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,700
How much time to accept this anything with different as of notations?

706
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,100
None.

707
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,200
I don't think they actually spend with do much as a notation stuff.

708
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,000
I'll just teach you basically how to read what's going on.

709
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,700
So you can kind of be comfortable with it, but we won't really belabor

710
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,200
the point too much.

711
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,500
Are you going to make the music for the game?

712
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,400
No, I license music for the game.

713
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
I already licensed music.

714
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,600
The game.

715
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,800
Actually, the music is ready.

716
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,100
And I'm in the process of trying to get Art built for the game.

717
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,300
Unfortunately, there's no way to just license art.

718
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,900
Like, there is a way to license music.

719
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,600
So, I had to find an artist and I'm working with the artists now and

720
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,500
hopefully they will be interested in doing a fair bit of art for the

721
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,600
game, but I'm basically going to see how that goes.

722
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Obviously, it's expensive, but I really wanted us to have art to work

723
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,300
with and I wanted the game to look good so that you would see that

724
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,200
what we were doing.

725
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,800
Programming is as good as the best quality stuff that there is.

726
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,600
We're not, you know, kind of cars.

727
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:35,800
Anything.

728
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,100
And part of that is having nice art.

729
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,700
I mean, if your art looks ugly, it's pretty hard to show off the code.

730
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,900
Yes, the bottom lines.

731
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,100
Let's see and me and her.

732
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,200
Can you release any information about what kind of game it is?

733
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,500
Make Monday Monday.

734
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,300
We will talk a little more about that and on that live stream at the

735
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,800
beginning of that live show on Monday, when I officially start the

736
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,500
real stream.

737
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,400
I will give a little explanation of what the game is going to be like

738
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,200
Are there any books recommend to read along with the series know?

739
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,400
There might be good books out there, but I don't know what they are.

740
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,200
I apologize.

741
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
It's been a long time since I've read a programming book.

742
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
So I don't know what the good books would be.

743
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,500
And I'd be afraid to recommend something in case, there's like kind of

744
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
bad ideas in it.

745
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,800
The game won't use the GPU Willett.

746
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,800
Nudists wants to say, not at first, so I want to avoid the GPU until

747
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,300
potentially the very end because I want to show people how to do, all

748
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,500
the rendering themselves.

749
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,300
The GPU will speed things up quite a bit from what we can do with the

750
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,100
only the central processor, but actually like if you look at something

751
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,100
like say, for example, The Binding of Isaac, the original or rebirth,

752
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,600
I believe, we could pretty much do cpu-based rendering.

753
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,500
For that.

754
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,200
No problem.

755
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,000
And those are fantastically popular games.

756
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,600
Nobody seem to have a problem with those in terms of the quality of

757
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,100
the game that they were getting.

758
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,300
The Flash versions too slow.

759
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,700
We could definitely out do that.

760
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,300
But I mean, you know, the rebirth one where it's actually running 60

761
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,800
frames a second.

762
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,900
I think we can get, we might not get 60.

763
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,500
Maybe we'll get 30 and we might have to be a little lower res, but we

764
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,400
can do it on the CPU.

765
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,900
Now, later in the series.

766
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,700
I probably will show how to bump it up to GPU, rendering for Speed

767
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,300
purposes.

768
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,400
But I'm hoping that we don't have to do that because I really want you

769
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,300
to be able to see how all the rendering works.

770
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,000
And as soon as you go into GPU land, there's a whole bunch of stuff

771
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
that happens behind your back.

772
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,800
And now, I'm behind your back.

773
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,300
But there's so much stuff that happens that you can't even know

774
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,000
because it's confidential.

775
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,000
You can't even know how it works.

776
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,800
I can't even explain to you how it works because I might not even know

777
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,000
because they may not ever have been something that they could tell me.

778
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,600
For example, I know how the internals of some stuff work but you know,

779
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,800
there's a whole bunch stuff that I don't know.

780
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,700
So I kind of have to ask like someone from Nvidia when I want to know,

781
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,400
a really nitty-gritty detail about something because I don't know what

782
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,100
happens in those chips.

783
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,200
And so I wanted to keep this series to all things that we could

784
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,300
specifically see every pixel on the screen.

785
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,800
We put it there and we know exactly what happened to get it.

786
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,600
Not sort of but exactly.

787
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,900
Let's see.

788
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,500
Why would you prefer Visual Studio compiler?

789
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,000
So if you see since your plan is to create a standalone library in

790
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,500
pure C.

791
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,800
Well, I'm just, I'm used to using their debugger.

792
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,900
I'm used to using the visual studio debugger, because that's what the

793
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,699
industry uses.

794
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,199
And I wanted people to get used to using what the industry uses at

795
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,900
least for now.

796
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,500
Because I figure people who take this class might want a job in the

797
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,199
game industry someday and if they want a job in the game industry,

798
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,500
they won't be using GCC on Windows.

799
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,600
They'll be using this when we are on Linux, which I will do a platform

800
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:33,800
things.

801
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,000
You can see I use on Linux, you'll be using llvm

802
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,600
Which is sort of a newer better way to do GCC compiles.

803
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
So we will be addressing.

804
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,400
Open-source compilers.

805
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,600
Just not on the Windows platform.

806
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,500
Let's see.

807
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,400
What else we got here?

808
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,300
Running out of time.

809
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,900
It's almost two hours.

810
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,100
Do do do.

811
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,300
Looking through, and I'm not seeing.

812
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,200
Are we recording this Q&A?

813
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,600
Yes, the Q&A is always recorded and posted along with the video on

814
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,400
YouTube.

815
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,000
So if you go to handmade hero dot-org, in fact, I'll just demonstrate

816
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,400
it for you.

817
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,800
So, if you go to handmade hero dot-org, you will see these buttons.

818
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,300
I put the buttons here at the top that are the most important buttons.

819
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,300
You can get to the twitch stream quickly, by doing this, and you can

820
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,400
get to the archive.

821
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,700
You can also email me a question, which will help when you get into

822
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,100
things yourself.

823
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
If you go to the archive, you will see that.

824
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,100
That actually, the Q&A from day one is already there, so you can

825
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,100
always get to to it this way.

826
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,300
So, yeah, I highly recommend that you check out the q&a's if you are

827
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,300
looking for a stuff because I try to answer a bunch of the questions

828
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,100
that I think are important.

829
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,400
So

830
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,600
Paul sex as inheritance versus composition.

831
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,800
We are way.

832
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Not at that point yet.

833
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,600
Paul 6.

834
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,200
We are going to hold that till later on.

835
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,600
New to says, will you be the game designer?

836
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,300
I thought you'd given up on designed.

837
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,000
Yes.

838
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,100
And yes, actually are.

839
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,300
Those are both true and how can that be true?

840
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,200
It's a good question.

841
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,200
The answer is because I will be showing you how to make a game.

842
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,400
That is a very standard design.

843
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I am not a very good game designer in my opinion, but I understand

844
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,600
games.

845
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,000
Well enough.

846
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,500
I've been playing them for so long and I understand basic game design

847
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:43,800
stuff.

848
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
So, if you want me to make

849
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,900
Something that's like, you know, the Legend of Zelda or something like

850
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,200
that.

851
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,900
I understand the important aspects there and I won't mess it up.

852
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,200
So what I'm doing here is not so much novel game design.

853
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,000
It's more just like make a competent action adventure game, right?

854
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,500
Using the things that, you know, work and action-adventure games.

855
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,800
I won't be branching out.

856
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,400
Hugely.

857
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,900
I won't be doing a bunch of things that no one's ever seen before.

858
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,400
And oh my God, it's made me cry.

859
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,900
And I learned about my dog that has cancer, like, none of that stuff

860
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,100
will be happening because I

861
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,600
Game designer in that sense and I don't pretend to know how to do

862
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,200
those things.

863
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,000
So, I am just going with a very standard design and I will be

864
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,800
obviously, also, welcoming input from my game, design friends, who are

865
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,000
very good game designers.

866
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,400
I know, plenty of people who are much better game designers than I am.

867
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,000
So if I have any questions, they will be.

868
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,600
Basically, you know, the people who sort of decide things like that.

869
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,300
I will just ask for help if it a design thing.

870
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,000
So the focus will always be on the code.

871
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,100
Code and the design will be very straightforward and I will you know,

872
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:54,500
basically get get people's opinions who I trust to make any decisions

873
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,600
that I feel like are too hard for someone like me who's a game

874
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,000
programmer, not a game developer.

875
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,300
Let's see.

876
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,800
So you're not having fixed answer raise from your backup, is your back

877
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,900
right up to a window?

878
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,500
Yes.

879
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,400
I am scared of snipers and falling through the window, Sean neck.

880
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,300
That is true.

881
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,000
You know, the thing is, the snipers should get me walking down the

882
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,800
street to and I can get run over by a car.

883
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,500
So the way I rationalize it is like of a sniper's going to get me,

884
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,200
they're going to get me right?

885
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,300
And it's some sense.

886
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,600
Why even bother shooting me through the window, right?

887
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,300
Like, I mean, it's harder to shoot through a window.

888
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,700
No, that's what I figure is.

889
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,400
So yeah, it's totally true.

890
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,700
It is scary but it's not as scary as as every day.

891
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,100
Really.

892
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,500
It's a dangerous world out there.

893
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,100
Guns are dangerous is the way we are displaying Graphics faster than

894
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,800
using opengl.

895
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,100
As far as frame rates.

896
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,400
No, it is actually slower than opengl.

897
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,400
We will be taking a speed hit so that we can do it all ourselves.

898
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,600
And then later, I will show you how to also do it using.

899
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,100
The GPU Pipeline and you can compare the speeds obviously, but we are

900
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,700
basically going to be doing it the old school way.

901
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,800
So people can learn how to render before they start using something

902
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,600
like opengl.

903
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,500
Because I think it's actually pretty important to know how to render

904
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,100
before you start telling opengl how to do things that you want to

905
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,400
render, because it really helps your understanding of even how opengl

906
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:18,900
is working.

907
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,200
Kendrick Beckett, how complex will the game be the game is going to be

908
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,500
very complex.

909
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,200
Actually, most of what I want to spend time doing this.

910
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,300
I want to show you how to write an audio engine.

911
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,200
I want to show you how to write a video engine, but then the majority

912
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,100
of the code we're going to write for most of the series is I want to

913
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,600
show you how to write very intricate game code and manage the

914
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,900
complexity that comes out of it.

915
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,000
So the game will be a lot more complex than most of the things you can

916
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,900
buy in terms of the actual game.

917
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And that's in there.

918
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,800
It will not be, you know, like something like Assassin's Creed or

919
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,900
something or, you know, Call of Duty where there's tons of scripted

920
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,400
sequences.

921
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,500
It will not be complex in the art asset management and composition,

922
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,100
but in terms of like the actual complexity of what you can do in the

923
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,500
game, it will be vastly more complicated than something like Call of

924
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:09,900
Duty.

925
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,200
We're basically all I can do is shoot stuff, but they told you, you

926
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,000
could shoot.

927
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
So there will it is designed to be a.

928
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,900
The plan I have for the game is that it is designed to, to basically

929
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,100
Force us to mostly deal with hard item, interaction environment,

930
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,400
interaction, entity interaction, sorts of stuff.

931
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,200
So you can see how that code works because that is code that to me is

932
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,600
very Timeless and that are conceptually things that you have to do.

933
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,100
No matter what programming language, you learn in, and I want to show

934
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,100
how to handle those in good ways and and where the problems are and

935
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,900
all that sort of stuff.

936
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,400
Let's take a look here.

937
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,100
When will the game be finished a long time from now?

938
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,300
Because I have to explain everything.

939
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,700
I think it will take quite some time.

940
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,300
So even though it's a 2d game, which means we don't have to deal with

941
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,800
a lot of the 3D art pipeline stuff, which takes a lot of time.

942
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,600
And the art wrangling will be more straightforward because I'm

943
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,500
explaining everything as I go.

944
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,400
It's gonna take a long time.

945
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,300
I mean, expect expect several months before there is a interesting

946
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,800
game to play at all, and then expect several months after that, for us

947
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,200
to really

948
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,600
Aren't getting into all the complexity and stuff because I want to

949
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,300
take it slow.

950
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,300
Let's see.

951
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,700
Yes, I should change the stream title.

952
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,100
That's a very good point.

953
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,800
Thank You.

954
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,700
Ed's one Shah twitch title.

955
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Okay, Andy Boy, follow up on the back to Starbucks and question your

956
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:39,800
opinion.

957
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,300
Was it a mistake for them to implement it in that fashion?

958
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,600
That is do you think they should have left it the programmer to

959
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,100
handle?

960
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,300
Okay, so you basically want to know what I think of the fact that the

961
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,900
C runtime Lottery, just a string translation.

962
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,000
Well, honestly, I think the CHC runtime layer library is kind of

963
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,500
crappy.

964
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,800
I don't think it's crappy because the people who made it didn't know

965
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,400
what they're doing.

966
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,800
I think the people who are responsible for see in general.

967
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,300
Are pretty awesome and I think the C runtime library was probably

968
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,200
actually pretty darn good for its time.

969
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,000
I think nowadays.

970
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,300
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

971
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,900
A lot of the things that they did but those are all because the

972
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,600
circumstances have changed and we've learned a lot more about API

973
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,300
design and things like this and computers are a lot faster.

974
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,000
So the different things matter there.

975
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,300
There's so many things that are there, so I really would hesitate to

976
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,400
criticize something about.

977
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,900
The way the C runtime library is designed or what they did in there,

978
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,100
and I don't really know the circumstances when the backslash are back

979
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,500
session.

980
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,900
Think a

981
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,100
In obviously, the original see didn't run on Windows because Windows

982
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,000
didn't exist.

983
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,300
So that is a later thing.

984
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,800
Anyway, and may not have even had anything to do with the people who

985
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,900
originally designed it, but I don't want to second-guess them because

986
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,100
they, you know, they wrote a language that has lasted for, you know,

987
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,000
decades and it's pretty darn good even today.

988
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Let's see.

989
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,800
Let's see.

990
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,300
Hang of this bunch of doodoo.

991
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,800
Casey needs a mega timer.

992
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Yes, it is time for me to end.

993
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,200
So I'm going to try and just blow through these last couple questions

994
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,800
for you.

995
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,500
Share some of your tricks for doing meta, pregnancy.

996
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,400
Probably not.

997
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,600
That's way out of the scope of this thing.

998
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,500
Which, what should I say to?

999
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,200
My note, open our friends who say making gaming CSA?

1000
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,400
This is crazy.

1001
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,400
Tell them that's fine.

1002
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
Actually, if they think it's crazy.

1003
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,900
They should not do it.

1004
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,400
They should make it in C++.

1005
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,300
I don't think people should use things that they don't like I would

1006
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,300
basically say that hopefully the stream will prove that you don't

1007
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,900
really need the best place to make a nice good clean game that runs

1008
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,200
great reads, great and is easy to work with and so I guess if you

1009
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,000
really want to come back at them you could say well why don't you re

1010
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,600
Implement your own game in C++ as a live stream and we'll all watch

1011
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,700
and see how easy that is.

1012
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,100
I don't know.

1013
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,100
But no, I wouldn't, you know don't argue with people.

1014
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:53,800
One of the things that

1015
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,900
I learned a long time ago.

1016
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,000
Programming wise is arguing just makes you less viable in the job

1017
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,500
market.

1018
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,300
Basically, if someone else wants to program poorly, let them.

1019
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,300
That basically means you have more job security because you're the

1020
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,300
only person who won't be wasting all your time, typing in templates

1021
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,100
and classes and doing inheritance.

1022
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,500
You'll actually be writing code that actually does useful things and

1023
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,000
you will be more valuable to the company that you work for, or you'll

1024
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,500
be able to make a better game in less time.

1025
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,300
So, you know, you can politely tell someone that they're probably

1026
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:23,700
wrong about.

1027
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,500
Nothing, but at the end of the day unless you're just trying to let

1028
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,200
off steam which I do as well.

1029
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,800
If you're unless you're just trying to let off steam, don't bother

1030
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,300
arguing with them.

1031
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,300
Just let them continue to programming correctly and yeah.

1032
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,500
Easier life for you.

1033
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,600
How much variation will be possible with?

1034
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,000
Everyone's game is a project progresses.

1035
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm not sure what that means.

1036
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,100
Sorry, maybe send me an email and I'll answer it later.

1037
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,800
how complex require the math out of your, okay, so the math will

1038
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,800
That complex because we're doing it in 2D and I chose that silly to

1039
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,300
try and reduce the math load and the content load hopefully because

1040
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,700
it's 2D not that much math, but you will need to know things like

1041
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,200
Sines and cosines and we'll be doing some things with like ratios.

1042
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,500
And so there will be math involved and I'll try to explain it as we

1043
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,900
go, but it definitely will help if you understand high school math.

1044
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,000
I probably won't bust out too much college level stuff.

1045
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,300
Hopefully we will not have to do anything really related to two linear

1046
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:29,800
algebra.

1047
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,900
Or if accuse, and that sort of stuff.

1048
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,400
If I already know how to program but I'm interested in the game

1049
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,900
programming so stuff, where you're going to skip dressing that 17th or

1050
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:42,700
is there some?

1051
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,100
Okay.

1052
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,500
So basically what he's asking is, should they start on the 17th of May

1053
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,700
already know how to program in C?

1054
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,300
Well enough.

1055
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,600
And the answer is.

1056
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,400
It depends what you want to know the Windows startup process, the

1057
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,100
first week or two, we'll just be basically me showing you how to code

1058
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,500
to thing in Windows that gets you into what I would call kind of the

1059
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,000
old days, which is a place where you could just write to an audio

1060
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,200
stream and a video surface and have them display if you care about

1061
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,400
that.

1062
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
You should watch if you don't care.

1063
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,300
That you can skip it after that.

1064
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,900
Yes, we will be into the game code part of code.

1065
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,100
We will be doing stuff with rendering at various points, which you may

1066
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:15,800
not care about.

1067
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,300
If you don't care what run, if you just only want game code, but I

1068
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,600
will try to tweet things that let you know what's going to happen and

1069
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,700
maybe we'll try to come up with a good way of posting what's going to

1070
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,500
happen so that you can easily jump in and out.

1071
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,700
If you don't care about certain parts of the stream because I do

1072
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,300
respect the fact that there are people out there who only want to see

1073
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,700
parts of it and it's going to be a long Series, so I'll try to

1074
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,500
facilitate that

1075
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,400
The same could work for using Mac instead of Windows.

1076
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,900
Yes, although not for a little while.

1077
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,000
So basically, I the problem is I don't have a way to really stream

1078
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,600
from Windows.

1079
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,100
From other platforms at the moment.

1080
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,500
I only can stream from Windows from using the OBS thing.

1081
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,900
What I would like to do is I'm going to get a box and then I will do

1082
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,300
the startup code to show you how to do the same startup code that

1083
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,800
we're going to on Windows on a Mac and then all the same code will

1084
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:00,900
work.

1085
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,700
So they're basically just be a little shim that goes on each operating

1086
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,200
system.

1087
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,100
And so hopefully people will

1088
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,500
The Following on the Mac eventually but not right away.

1089
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,400
I'm sorry about that.

1090
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,800
Let's see, last couple questions.

1091
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,600
Looks like we are basically done with questions.

1092
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,400
So I will wrap it up for the night.

1093
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,200
Thank you very much.

1094
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,700
Everyone 200 people, that's twice.

1095
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,900
The people we had last night.

1096
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,900
That is crazy.

1097
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,900
Thank you so much everyone for for tuning in.

1098
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,600
I had a great time and I hope you enjoy the stream.

1099
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,100
If you have anything that you would like to suggest, please go ahead

1100
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,800
and email me.

1101
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,300
If you go to handmade hero dot-org.

1102
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,300
There's that email button.

1103
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,100
You can send me an email and I look forward to seeing you all.

1104
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,200
Again tomorrow night, when we will go into a little more detail on

1105
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,000
Assembly Language and C code and how it relates to each other.

1106
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,700
And then we will finally be free to just code some see and take a look

1107
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,100
at it which will get us in good shape for Monday start.

1108
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:03,600
Okay.

1109
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,600
Thanks everybody, and I will see you tomorrow.
