00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,439
hello everybody and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:09,679
here of the show recode a complete game

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:13,199
live on stream last week before we left

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,419
we were making some changes to how the

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,429
movement code in the game worked and in

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,679
general we were just starting sort of a

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:22,439
sweep towards building out a playable

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,268
game scenario so that we could start to

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,550
tune our lighting algorithms our camera

10
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:28,559
and start to get the art flowing and

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,320
stuff like that just trying to build a

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,030
working example of how everything in the

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,039
game should go because we're mostly

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,009
there in terms of game engine stuff

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,350
we've built everything under the Sun

16
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:42,119
that you might need and so now is really

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,820
the time to just start finishing things

18
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:48,599
to a specific state based on the game

19
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,159
because most of the stuff that we're

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,859
gonna want to do from here on out will

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,679
probably be dependent on what the game

22
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,939
needs specifically and so most of the

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,698
things that we know it needs generically

24
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,820
are accounted for there's stuff in place

25
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:08,118
for whatever those things are generally

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:11,040
speaking so we don't have any particular

27
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,989
sort of schedule or guide for what we

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,530
are doing there it's really just

29
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:19,109
freeform as we sort of work on building

30
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,019
things out we build them out and off we

31
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,539
go so as you can see here we've sort of

32
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:27,420
got the the hopping stuff that I changed

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,860
from the other day in place and one of

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,320
the things that obviously we have a

35
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:34,228
problem with at the moment is the fact

36
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,539
that we don't have the real art in there

37
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,159
yet and so that's one of the problems

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,650
that we probably need to address pretty

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,270
soon especially because stuff like the

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,920
way the hero is assembled right it's

41
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,810
just kind of three random sprites we've

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,189
stuck on top of each other here and

43
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,780
they're not drawn at the right

44
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:51,328
perspective from what we want and I do

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,759
have our from the right perspective and

46
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:55,500
stuff like that so there's a couple of

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,090
things that we can be doing there if we

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,989
want to start moving towards getting the

49
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,299
art in that's a big one but before we

50
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:07,468
quite get there I want to look at a few

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:10,819
other things which is getting the camera

52
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:14,009
and the world sort of construction stuff

53
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:15,658
sort of buttoned up because right now we

54
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,429
got a lot of weird stuff that we just

55
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:19,679
have to kind of finalize that's only

56
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,170
half in there we do have camera stuff

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:28,260
like for example if I come over towards

58
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:31,589
a a look what am I looking for

59
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,840
a overhead overhang right like this one

60
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,640
here and we wait you know the camera

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,590
does go and look down to further floors

62
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,149
in fact I can show that a little bit

63
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,729
more effectively if I actually kind of

64
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,870
come up some stairs although I don't

65
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:46,078
know if we have any here yeah we don't

66
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,509
have any here so we do have some stuff

67
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:50,549
in there for the camera but we changed

68
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:52,798
the way that we were doing rooms and

69
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,090
stuff and so the stuff that was meant to

70
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:56,370
like move from room to room with the

71
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,878
camera isn't correct and more

72
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,609
importantly the zooming like the way

73
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:06,239
that the camera determines how far out

74
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:08,129
it should be when it's like looking at a

75
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,250
particular room or things like that

76
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:13,590
none of that stuff has really been done

77
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,098
and a lot of the reason for it if I

78
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:20,128
remember correctly is that we need to

79
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:22,979
start having the notion of what is a

80
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:26,459
room because when the world generation

81
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,439
system generates a section of playable

82
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,189
region for the game it's gonna have to

83
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,829
say specifically what that is right

84
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:40,219
because only the world generation code

85
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:42,719
knows what it wanted the like sort of

86
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:45,900
visible region for a given set of

87
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:51,780
playable stuff to be like what a room is

88
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:55,650
is up to that system right so like if

89
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,259
the game decides to generate like a long

90
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,079
skinny room that connects to things only

91
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,989
it knows whether the idea behind that

92
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,790
when it created it was for you to see a

93
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,789
small section of the long skinny room

94
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:11,668
and scroll along with it or whether the

95
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:13,858
idea there was to have it be one large

96
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,329
view where it just zooms out and shows

97
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,180
you a long skinny room that you hopped

98
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:20,250
from one end to the other off right and

99
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,959
what we would like to do ideally is make

100
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,658
it so that whatever we are generating

101
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,668
for those purposes that generation can

102
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:29,889
just tell the camera system at the time

103
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:31,899
when it slaps tough room down that

104
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,749
here's what it wants to do so that's

105
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:36,489
what we're talking about here right and

106
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:38,889
furthermore we kind of have some other

107
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,718
stuff that we'd like to do you can see

108
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,460
here like if i zoom out in debug mode

109
00:04:40,718 --> 00:04:46,120
you can see that the camera system still

110
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:47,859
sort of it does nominal work you can see

111
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,718
the white areas or areas that are

112
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,610
outside of the viewing right if I come

113
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:52,930
in here we're kind of doing this is the

114
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,939
part thinks it's supposed to be doing

115
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,009
it's what gets lit these are parts or

116
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:58,150
not and that was just some approximate

117
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:59,439
stuff we slapped in there but you can

118
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:03,788
see that still sort of gives you that

119
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:05,229
impression so you can see the cameras

120
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:07,418
feel sort of nominally works but it

121
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:10,000
doesn't really work because this was

122
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:11,878
clearly a room and so what we want to do

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,990
is light that whole room and a

124
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,479
furthermore in addition to lighting that

125
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,360
room we want to make sure that that room

126
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:22,449
gets zoomed and looked at for the camera

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,490
right and stuff like that so yeah all

128
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,379
this stuff again pretty obvious stuff

129
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,718
it's just now is the time to start doing

130
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,218
it because we've got everything else in

131
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:32,468
place and we have to start finalizing

132
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:34,088
things now here is an example of two

133
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:36,550
rooms stacked on top of each other like

134
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:39,699
I was looking at before or talking about

135
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,939
before rather so if I bring the the

136
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:45,338
little Dube down here and I hop up the

137
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:46,300
makeshift stairway that we built this is

138
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:47,949
the thing I was talking about before you

139
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,838
can see that the camera is still doing

140
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,759
the look down part so if you want to

141
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:53,319
look down below you to see what's

142
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,658
happening right the camera still does

143
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,149
that stuff so the cameras we still do

144
00:05:55,658 --> 00:06:00,250
have camera control stuff in there and

145
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:02,649
it does work it's just it has to now

146
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,168
actually get wired up in some

147
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:06,879
intelligent way that makes sense and we

148
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:08,338
definitely don't have that at the moment

149
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,899
right we just we don't have any

150
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:11,889
conceptualization of that um so the

151
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:15,189
other thing that we're gonna have to

152
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:17,079
think about too is you know when you

153
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:20,560
want to look at a map we want to make

154
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,930
sure that you can you know we want to we

155
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,019
want to be able to see some kind of a

156
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,939
logical map that you can look at to

157
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:31,120
understand where you are in the game and

158
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:34,088
so that's another strong impetus for

159
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,639
having a notion of a room stored in the

160
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:38,399
system somewhere that's sort of metadata

161
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,110
that sits on top of the information

162
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,350
about the actual entities right like all

163
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,990
of

164
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,840
these entities here are obviously stored

165
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,439
in the game and and all that but you

166
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,819
know they don't really they don't have

167
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:53,079
any information about their real

168
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,490
structure they don't have any

169
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:58,269
information about like what constitutes

170
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:00,100
a region of play right and so another

171
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:02,229
region reason to have that region of

172
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,410
play information in there in addition to

173
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:08,950
guiding the camera and other important

174
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,080
aspects of the game is the fact that we

175
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,599
need some way of displaying a map and

176
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:17,680
without a notion of what a logical room

177
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,090
is it's gonna be hard to present that

178
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,340
information to the player because the

179
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:24,909
player needs to know the connectivity of

180
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:26,979
the rooms in the game and without that

181
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,560
we would have to write like some kind of

182
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,080
AI to try to determine what a good way

183
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,360
was to simplify a giant collection of

184
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,689
entities down into something that is

185
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,400
easy to read at a glance so again rather

186
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:41,410
than go that route and have to struggle

187
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,669
with it and oftentimes probably have it

188
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,780
be wrong or not what a human would do

189
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,699
what we want to do instead again is

190
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:50,889
create that metadata while we're

191
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,229
creating the entities so that it's

192
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,939
already in there when it goes time to

193
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:59,710
draw the map it just knows what was

194
00:07:54,939 --> 00:08:03,189
supposed to be a room and what wasn't so

195
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:04,810
that's what we want to do so I'm just

196
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:06,879
gonna go ahead and jump right in on that

197
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,530
task because I feel like we want that

198
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,870
either way let's look load up for a

199
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:16,619
coder here and get our project going I'm

200
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:21,939
gonna go ahead and switch over to the

201
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:24,040
world system and the world mode to sort

202
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:26,500
of take a look at how I might want to do

203
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,330
this now the interesting thing about

204
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,610
this right we've got this sort of world

205
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:35,860
information here and the way that the

206
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:37,840
world information works is it has a for

207
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:42,070
lack of a better term it has a giant

208
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:44,110
like world database almost that you

209
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,200
stuff stuff into and pull stuff out of

210
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:51,490
based on the location so there's a three

211
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,960
dimensional hash table well it's not the

212
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,759
hash tables in three dimensional it's a

213
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,278
one-dimensional hash table like all hash

214
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,730
tables

215
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:01,188
but the hashkee is 1-dimensional a

216
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,899
three-dimensional rather that we smack

217
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:06,318
down into something that can be used as

218
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:09,198
a as a hash so the question is how would

219
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:11,958
we want to put metadata on top of this

220
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:14,539
right because one of the problems that

221
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:18,349
we would have if we tried to make world

222
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:20,778
data a piece the Broom data be stored

223
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:25,540
along with the rest of the data is that

224
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:25,539
the queries wouldn't make sense right so

225
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:31,458
for example one of the things that we

226
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,759
would want to do let's say to draw the

227
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:37,518
map is we'd want to say show me all of

228
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:41,419
the rooms that are in this rectangular

229
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,149
region but we're completely unable to

230
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:46,818
answer that question here without going

231
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:50,480
through all of the chunks right and

232
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:52,878
pulling out all of the entities from the

233
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,879
hash table sequentially right and that's

234
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:58,249
not what we want to do so what what I

235
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:01,069
guess I'm arguing for here is that we

236
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:05,800
probably want some special structure for

237
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:08,719
the metadata that is separate from not

238
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:10,549
merged with the entity data because the

239
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,769
entity data is very specific it's

240
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:14,808
fine-grained we know we only pull tiny

241
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,629
regions at a time and we really don't

242
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:19,730
want to change that that's good but this

243
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,649
room data is a different beast right

244
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,709
it's it's something that wants to be

245
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:26,389
stored very differently I think and so

246
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:29,328
what we want to do is really have a

247
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:31,250
secondary structure for that now I'm not

248
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:33,769
gonna start out presupposing that I know

249
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,600
how I want to store that I will probably

250
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:38,990
just start out storing that fairly

251
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,178
linearly and then as we go I will add

252
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:45,528
more abilities to store it in flexible

253
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:47,058
fashion I suspect so we'll see but what

254
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:49,578
I'm gonna do here is again just augment

255
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:52,610
the structure I'm gonna say ok let's say

256
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:54,708
that we have a world room and world room

257
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,778
doesn't necessarily mean room in the

258
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:59,149
traditional sense like not semantic room

259
00:10:56,778 --> 00:11:00,730
in the sense that it's got to be a thing

260
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:03,740
with four walls and a roof and a floor

261
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,558
but I mean room as in a playable region

262
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,698
of the game so this might be outdoors it

263
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:09,948
might be

264
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:11,838
you know something that bears no

265
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:13,729
resemblance to a literal room

266
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,910
but it is a room in the gameplay sense

267
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:19,039
of the term room so it might be a forest

268
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:23,629
like Legend of Zelda had a lot of rooms

269
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:25,480
that were forest area right but they

270
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:29,659
still obey the trishal notion of a room

271
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:34,699
there's one screen and you know you did

272
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:37,068
stuff on it and left so if we take this

273
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:40,008
world room what do I want to know about

274
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:42,229
this room well I think the basic things

275
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:45,168
that I really want to know here is I

276
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,539
want to know some of the camera stuff

277
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:50,808
that we were talking about before we had

278
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:54,039
put that into the game entity system so

279
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:57,738
if you remember the entities had ways of

280
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:00,168
describing themselves as camera

281
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:04,548
information right so you can see here

282
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:07,009
there's a bunch of information about how

283
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:08,659
the camera should behave you can see

284
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:10,909
here like we've got all this camera

285
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:13,639
behavior stuff and this was things that

286
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:16,999
sort of said hey here's some information

287
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:23,629
we want to tell you about the camera for

288
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:25,850
a given area inside the room and this

289
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:27,859
again was for markups like if I stand

290
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,278
here I want to zoom in or something like

291
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:34,899
that right things like that and so I

292
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:38,509
don't think we really need most of that

293
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:40,879
stuff here I think all we really need is

294
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:43,249
some more basic stuff like the bounds

295
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:47,899
right so like for example I can take

296
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:52,459
this world position here and just say

297
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:55,068
okay let's just make a three dimensional

298
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:57,708
boundary so a right rectangular prism

299
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:59,918
like we talked about many times which is

300
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:02,659
bassists a three-dimensional rectangle

301
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:04,759
let's describe a three dimensional

302
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:10,448
rectangle that is meant to contain the

303
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,449
entire room okay and then from there

304
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:20,410
what we'll say is when we have this

305
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:24,159
entire room

306
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:29,169
to find we then want to know roughly how

307
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:33,250
you expect it to be viewed okay so we

308
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:36,399
need some hints essentially that the

309
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:40,600
system that the the game is going to

310
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,659
give to the camera system that says I

311
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,089
want the whole room viewed I want this

312
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:56,559
much of the room viewed you know

313
00:13:46,089 --> 00:14:00,100
whatever right and so I think I mean the

314
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,169
the I guess the most straightforward way

315
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,500
to implement that it's just to say what

316
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:08,438
the camera offset is supposed to be

317
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,539
probably although not really so because

318
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:12,129
if you think about it let me draw this

319
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:13,870
really quickly because there's a reason

320
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:16,028
why I think talking about the camera

321
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:19,750
offset is maybe not such a useful thing

322
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:22,438
to do in this case so I'm gonna bring up

323
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,438
Milton here

324
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:48,019
so the camera behavior per room wants to

325
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,149
say stuff like I was sort of alluding to

326
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:54,259
before where let's suppose I have a long

327
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:56,690
hallway like this and the player is here

328
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:59,958
and you know and they're hopping down

329
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:03,260
the hallway what I want to say is okay

330
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:05,899
did you want to view that sort of this

331
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:08,059
way where the camera seeing the whole

332
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,789
thing or did you want to view it more

333
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:14,000
like this and have it scroll upward

334
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:15,980
right and those are the two things that

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,509
I would think you might logically want

336
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,149
to do there aren't a whole lot of ways

337
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:22,569
the camera could shoot this you know

338
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:28,120
that seems like pretty much most of it

339
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:31,190
so you kind of need to versions there's

340
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:37,429
a room centric version I guess you might

341
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:39,620
say and a player centric version and so

342
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:44,899
what I suspect we would need unless

343
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:47,060
there's some other you know and I really

344
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:49,220
can't think of it unless there's

345
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:54,338
something else to be said here I think

346
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,339
we kind of just can make those be

347
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:11,588
so you know as I'm as I'm saying this

348
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:14,169
out loud - I guess I'm wondering maybe

349
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:22,329
this doesn't even need to be in the room

350
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:25,058
structure because those things could

351
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:28,138
still be done quite easily by just where

352
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:28,139
the player is standing

353
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,080
there's a lot of complexity here not

354
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,750
really in terms of code because the code

355
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,910
is not that hard the complexity in my

356
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:49,230
head really is about just what the game

357
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:50,189
wants to do and again part of the

358
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,690
problem there is I'm not a game

359
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:56,490
designers this is not my area of

360
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:58,140
expertise as I say oftentimes so you

361
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:01,019
know if we had a clear mandate from the

362
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:02,490
designer if there was one about what

363
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,920
should happen here then we just go write

364
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,880
that thing but thinking through what's

365
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,730
gonna happen here there's a couple

366
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:16,770
everything's so one thing that is worth

367
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:19,500
noting is that scrolling you know let's

368
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:21,629
say what if we do have a co-op mode in

369
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,309
this game because you know like I was

370
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,560
showing the other day we even from the

371
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:28,379
very beginning of the game right here's

372
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:30,269
you know one hero but if you just push

373
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,860
the start button on like a xbox

374
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:36,240
controller or you get another hero you

375
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:40,769
know and off you go so the question that

376
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:44,370
I have there is just if you were playing

377
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:47,879
co-op then it kind of makes sense what

378
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:49,709
you would do if you both you know maybe

379
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,570
you both stand on this Square and then

380
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,480
it leaves the room or something or I

381
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:56,730
don't know you both hop out and then

382
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,559
like I don't really know to be honest

383
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:03,450
with you exactly how you move from room

384
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:09,179
to room when you're co-op it it's a bit

385
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:11,039
confusing i i mean maybe one player is

386
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,890
just marked as the key player and that

387
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,079
player can leave the room or not and the

388
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,690
other players is confined to the bounds

389
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:21,869
of the room till they do you know i

390
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,340
don't really know it's tough to say but

391
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,179
there's a lot of ways we could handle

392
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,699
that let's put it that way

393
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,830
but one of the things that we need to

394
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,450
determine is if you were to support some

395
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:31,919
co-op play which you know I'll be honest

396
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,960
is kind of nice

397
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,220
I said we wouldn't do networking but we

398
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,480
could easily do co-op play right it's

399
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,769
just a question of whether we want to

400
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,329
take the time to generate be able to

401
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:45,750
generate co-op worlds because they're

402
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,759
different obviously then single-player

403
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,529
world

404
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,970
so if we ever decide to generate co-op

405
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,069
worlds then we definitely have this

406
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:56,610
other consideration to make which is

407
00:18:53,069 --> 00:19:00,178
that the camera can't zoom on a player

408
00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:01,500
it has to zoom on both players right but

409
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,640
you know again the reason I'm talking

410
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
about just to get it straight in my head

411
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,000
like I said if we had Adam and eight

412
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,950
from the designer twine let's just say

413
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,950
we do that I still think we have these

414
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,410
two concerns and so what that kind of

415
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:19,980
suggests to me is like maybe this stuff

416
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:21,870
is not as relevant I mean maybe it is

417
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,000
because you both of you can stand

418
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:26,099
somewhere and then it would do this but

419
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,289
you know as you might imagine it's

420
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:30,269
really just not that interesting to talk

421
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:31,829
about specific things that happen when

422
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,379
you're at particular locations in a room

423
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:36,418
if you're in co-op mode you're never

424
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,860
going to be at a specific location in

425
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,750
the room you're at two specific

426
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:43,949
locations in a room right

427
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:46,740
and that to me just kind of argues for

428
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:49,410
something that's going to be more

429
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,120
generic it's like we either are in a

430
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:54,410
room where we show the whole room or

431
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:57,000
we're in a room where we show two

432
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,558
characters who are focused on it you

433
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,789
know - two characters are focused

434
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,789
together kind of a thing right

435
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:44,790
so I don't know I mean that's all I

436
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:49,500
really have to say about that I wish I

437
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:51,839
had some more specific opinion about how

438
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,339
that should work but I don't really know

439
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:58,379
that I do and so you know if I was just

440
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:08,939
going to type in the sort of most basic

441
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:17,840
version of that probably something like

442
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:17,840
this right

443
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:38,660
and you know maybe we just eventually

444
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:38,660
get rid of this uh

445
00:21:45,369 --> 00:22:01,899
I wish I had a more sort of I wish I

446
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:03,069
wish I had a more coherent view of what

447
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,309
should happen there but I just really

448
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:08,819
don't so I'm just gonna say that that's

449
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:08,819
what that is

450
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:18,150
and we're gonna go from there so my

451
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:22,660
mouse is currently stuck beneath my

452
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:27,610
tablet so if I take a look here and I

453
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:32,019
just say alright so a world room has

454
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:48,459
bounds and a camera and then I just

455
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:50,740
again this is if I go ahead and just say

456
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,440
we've got some big set of these in here

457
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,819
that's all the rooms in the game I don't

458
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,590
know how many rooms that are going to be

459
00:22:54,819 --> 00:23:04,240
but let's just say we've got a lot of

460
00:22:56,589 --> 00:23:06,399
them some really giant number maybe

461
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,000
that's a little bit too many let's stay

462
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,340
a little bit less than that I don't know

463
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,779
so if I just say that I've got some big

464
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:15,308
old thing that just says how many rooms

465
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:16,480
in the game there how many rooms there

466
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:19,450
are in the game and there's just that

467
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,910
many rooms and I go ahead and have room

468
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,529
count in here I can just spam rooms into

469
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,330
this and then maybe I can draw those

470
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:26,889
rooms right so when you go to the map we

471
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:29,439
draw the rooms that there are in the

472
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:32,620
game and you know everyone's happy and

473
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,660
it's great and whatever so let's just do

474
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,549
that because we have an easy way to get

475
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,040
started down that path what you can see

476
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:40,569
right now is when I do this you can see

477
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,730
that we've got a region that we pull

478
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:45,279
entities out in but I can't see anything

479
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,079
else right so these test rooms that we

480
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,779
slap down here you know they're there

481
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,819
and I can go from one to the other and

482
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:53,769
when I do go from one to the other right

483
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:56,769
you can kind of see we scroll through

484
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:59,000
the world as we should in all that

485
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:01,309
nonsense but I can't

486
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,490
what actually got generated you know

487
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:06,919
what I mean I can't actually see the

488
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,599
rest of the world because those enemies

489
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,940
are all packed into the world thing and

490
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:12,319
I don't know like I have no idea what

491
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,900
other parts of the world there might be

492
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:17,419
so even just for our own like

493
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,370
edification debugging wise it'd be nice

494
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,990
to be able to see a map at this point so

495
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:26,389
we know what the heck we generated right

496
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:28,220
so I do want to kind of go ahead and get

497
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,020
that going as well so I think this might

498
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,339
be a good opportunity for us to do that

499
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:32,930
I'm gonna go ahead and hop up here just

500
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:36,669
because now I'm obsessed with hopping

501
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,670
around so that's fine

502
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:53,400
sorry this is one of the problems when

503
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,990
you actually have a fun movement thing

504
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,200
to do is you end up doing it all the

505
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,200
time

506
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:03,049
looking excited so I think I've reached

507
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:03,049
the end of the world I think

508
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:13,309
yeah so without traversing the whole

509
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,079
world like that we would have no idea

510
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:16,519
what the world actually was because even

511
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:18,559
we don't have the ability to draw a map

512
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:20,119
right now so that's kind of a bad thing

513
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,279
so one of the things I can do just to

514
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,779
start off with to get this system

515
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,710
rolling a little bit and I started to

516
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:27,319
play with it and see what I actually

517
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,819
want to do here is to just dump all the

518
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,529
rooms that we created into this room

519
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,539
structure so that I can actually draw

520
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,190
them and see what they look like so

521
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:40,149
that's my first thing that I would like

522
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:43,340
to do when I go into the world mode a

523
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:45,470
broom nonsense right we have this add

524
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:46,929
standard room think here and the

525
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:52,299
standard room comes back and all that

526
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:52,299
and so what I could do is inside the

527
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:59,540
code that adds this stuff here I should

528
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:02,329
be able to do something where I place

529
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:05,480
the world's information into one of

530
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:07,549
these as well right so when I do add

531
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,079
standard room here and it puts the room

532
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:11,269
in there maybe I just do it right in

533
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:13,159
here for now so we come through here and

534
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:16,700
we've got sort of an idea of where

535
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,620
everything is maybe in here I go ahead

536
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,830
and set up you know you can see here

537
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:24,439
like us setting up some of these Kent

538
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:26,179
cameras and stuff like that

539
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,710
maybe what I want to do here just say

540
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:31,759
all right let's go ahead and put a I

541
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:36,350
don't even know what this oh this is

542
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,740
just well this is the whole room right

543
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:39,439
here

544
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,940
yeah so this is the room information

545
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,620
right here actually right you can see it

546
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,360
so we actually have all this stuff

547
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:46,279
recorded it's just not in where we want

548
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:50,419
it to be recorded right here's brain

549
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:51,769
type room right so again we have all

550
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,930
this information like we were already

551
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:55,400
doing it like I was saying before we

552
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:58,039
just weren't storing it in a way that we

553
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:05,680
can pull out in any convenient way right

554
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:05,680
I don't actually know if we do anything

555
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:12,939
so you can see here right this is the

556
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,528
way we were pulling it out so once in a

557
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,419
while we would use it we would see

558
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:18,159
whether or not we had a room piece of

559
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:19,750
information and then we would look to

560
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,110
see what the camera behavior was

561
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,058
supposed to be in that room right so we

562
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:28,000
had the ability to do exactly what I'm

563
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:32,558
saying but not in any we didn't have the

564
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,058
ability to talk about those things

565
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:35,528
separately so that we could do stuff

566
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:38,408
like draw a map or anything like that

567
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:40,509
right and so we I think like I said we

568
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:43,690
do want to be able to do that and so

569
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:45,879
that's what I'm doing that anyway the

570
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,950
only question that I have right is just

571
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,330
whether this because we already have a

572
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:52,298
system that can do this based on

573
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:56,740
locations more specifically the question

574
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:59,710
is just do we want do we want this data

575
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:02,440
to still be handled on a regional basis

576
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,700
or or do we want to just like lean on

577
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,080
the room concept and say look

578
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,659
everything's got to go through the room

579
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:09,490
concept because especially with two

580
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:15,010
players at a time you're gonna have to

581
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:16,960
deal with that right all right so I in

582
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:18,759
update camera for entity movement SOI

583
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,890
person who uses that thing anyway and we

584
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:24,640
can leave that in place but now when we

585
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:26,679
have this information here the the

586
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,690
simple grounded collision stuff this

587
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:33,460
information is exactly the information

588
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:35,980
we need in order to specify the rest of

589
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:42,000
the world information so if I want to

590
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:42,000
say that we have a world room here I

591
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:47,579
should be able to tell it that

592
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,210
and maybe this has to take that all that

593
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,910
information so I'll just say that it's a

594
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:01,309
focus on room worlds for now a room for

595
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:07,670
now but I needed to know the minimum

596
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:09,079
position and the maximum position and so

597
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,110
what I think I have to do is I think I

598
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,669
have to do this stuff here where we do

599
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:19,849
make this simple ground and couch stuff

600
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:23,509
I need to do this effectively with the

601
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:25,039
trunk position stuff right so in order

602
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:27,980
to figure out where that's going to be I

603
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,920
need to do a chunk position from from

604
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:33,019
tile position and that'll give me

605
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,630
I believe that gives me a world position

606
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:43,549
a piece of world position that I need

607
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:48,140
let me just verify that yeah so once I

608
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:52,609
have one of these I just need I just

609
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:54,740
need some way to pass these down but I

610
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:57,409
know what they are right because I know

611
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:00,200
that the minimum like I created all the

612
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:02,690
entities in here you know so I know that

613
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,640
my offset was negative radius Y negative

614
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,900
radius x2 positive radius X positive

615
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,350
radius line so I know where exactly I

616
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,350
was

617
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:37,298
right

618
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:40,359
and so I know where I was the only

619
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:42,970
question is what's the Z range and I

620
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:46,029
don't actually know what that is because

621
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:48,579
the current way that we do it is not

622
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:50,408
right so you can see we do typical floor

623
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:53,259
height here and that's just because we

624
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:55,150
hard-coded that for the room but we

625
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:58,990
don't actually know that that's gonna

626
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:01,000
hold for certain in the case of this you

627
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,038
know going forwards so in reality we

628
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,819
should have a value here that's like how

629
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:09,190
tall is the room and in lieu of not

630
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:12,609
knowing how tall the room is we would

631
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:13,808
need something else here right for now I

632
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:15,099
can just do something like this and

633
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:16,029
we'll just adjust this manually to

634
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:18,788
figure out what we want it to actually

635
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:20,019
be but otherwise it should be fine now

636
00:31:18,788 --> 00:31:22,839
what are the problems that we have with

637
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:24,639
chunk position from top position is it's

638
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:27,308
gonna give us not quite the whole room

639
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,530
area that might be fine I'm not sure how

640
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:31,149
we want to do that exactly we'll take a

641
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:33,788
look at that later but point being it'll

642
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:35,169
go from centers of tiles which is maybe

643
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:37,480
what we want to talk him out for the

644
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:39,460
room maybe not we want to talk about for

645
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,380
the room it depends on how we want to

646
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:45,880
talk about rooms whether they have to be

647
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:50,980
a budding or whether there can be space

648
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,429
between them or who knows anyway it

649
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,679
doesn't matter

650
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:55,870
point being I'm gonna go over into the

651
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,470
world structure itself here and I'm

652
00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:01,928
gonna go ahead and specify what the

653
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,400
version of this function should be let

654
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:09,669
me get it out from behind my head there

655
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:13,120
so in here if I want to add a world room

656
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:14,830
I just need to well you know I mean it's

657
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,689
literally just gonna be recording one of

658
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:18,970
these right so it's literally just

659
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,650
saying pass me the parameters that you

660
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,690
wanted to fill in for the structure and

661
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:25,030
we'll fill them in now why am i doing it

662
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:28,080
this way the reason that I'm doing it

663
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:32,408
this way is because I don't actually

664
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,409
want to let the outside people change

665
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:35,300
the min Posen map

666
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,220
suppose necessarily because I need to

667
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:39,200
potentially insert this into a spatial

668
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:42,200
partition leader right so what I'm doing

669
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,210
here is just saying hey you got to pass

670
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,539
me these two in this one we could leave

671
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:50,390
out I just added it for convenience that

672
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:53,980
one we could leave out but we're not

673
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:56,420
going to for now so let me go ahead and

674
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,099
assert here that we haven't run out of

675
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,019
room and again like I said this is only

676
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:01,279
temporary but I always put the

677
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,990
assertions in even if it's only

678
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,069
temporary the reason that I put the

679
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,750
assertions in even if it's only

680
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:08,089
temporary is you never know what's

681
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,410
really temporary I mean a lot of stuff

682
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:11,439
happens in game development you never

683
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,269
have enough time to finish everything

684
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,490
it's always a rush and you're trying to

685
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:18,019
prioritize things we may get to the end

686
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,750
of the game and it's still this

687
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:22,639
hard-coded array right because it's just

688
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,190
it didn't end up being a high enough

689
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,620
prop a big enough problem to spend the

690
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,840
time on right and so that's one of the

691
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:31,699
problems that's why I say always put the

692
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:35,029
assertion in there always do the check

693
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:37,130
it takes only a fraction of a fraction

694
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:39,079
of second it takes only ten seconds to

695
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,480
put it in there that way you know if

696
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:43,309
it's starting to cause some weird bug

697
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,710
memory overwrite or something like that

698
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:47,149
you might as well do it because you

699
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,710
never know what's gonna stay in there

700
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,230
longer than you anticipated or perhaps

701
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,509
all the way until the end of the game so

702
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,460
it's just not a good idea to assume that

703
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:57,289
just because you know something isn't a

704
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,730
good way to do something that that won't

705
00:33:57,289 --> 00:34:01,460
end up in the game because some of those

706
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:05,150
things will they just won't end up being

707
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,500
enough of a problem oops for you to ever

708
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,079
deal with them and if you don't have to

709
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,789
deal with them then you don't and that

710
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,799
goes out in the product and you may have

711
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:14,300
a little lurking bug in there that

712
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,679
you'll forget about till the very end

713
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,260
and then it will come back to bite you

714
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,059
and that's never good so anyway here

715
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,990
I've I've gone ahead and I've added a

716
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:26,090
room and so now when we actually run the

717
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:27,409
game it should build up that room arrays

718
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,929
so we've got a certain number of those

719
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:31,639
there we wouldn't know because obviously

720
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:33,230
we're not using that room information

721
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,150
but what I'd like to do now is when I

722
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:38,119
when I'm doing this I'm just gonna go

723
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:40,340
ahead and be fatty about it I'm just

724
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,449
gonna go ahead and draw everything that

725
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,769
there is because again there's no world

726
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,869
partitions I'm just gonna loop through

727
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:46,940
them and just draw them so in the world

728
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:49,519
mode when we are looping

729
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,800
through all of like our sim region stuff

730
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,088
and doing the sort of well-behaved

731
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,849
things that actually do use a facial

732
00:34:53,088 --> 00:34:59,539
partition after that's done I am going

733
00:34:55,849 --> 00:35:04,550
to go ahead and render all of the rooms

734
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:08,869
in the game period right so you know you

735
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:14,539
can see here we're when we are where is

736
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:16,550
it but you can see here some stuff that

737
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:18,469
I don't have okay so you can see here

738
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:23,150
we've got like these volume outlines for

739
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:26,029
example I'm gonna go ahead and and turn

740
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:28,630
those back on what you can see is those

741
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:32,630
volume outlines allow us to draw stuff

742
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:34,338
like just debug information you know and

743
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,240
what I would like to do is I'd like to

744
00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:40,460
go ahead and draw that debug information

745
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:41,779
for the rooms this for example is just

746
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,059
some basic information that we were

747
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,740
drawing I to be completely honest with

748
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,929
you don't remember what it was or why we

749
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:50,000
were drawing it this is the sim region

750
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:52,489
the region that's getting pulled in and

751
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,199
all that nonsense that's all fine I

752
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:55,549
don't care about any of that I just

753
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:57,289
wanted to have it in there so I could

754
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:59,500
show you what I'm talking about what I'm

755
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:04,909
gonna do is take this volume outline

756
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:07,670
code which draws things for us and I'm

757
00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:15,108
just gonna go ahead and use that to draw

758
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:16,338
the rooms alright now I don't know

759
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:20,328
whether I need to do that inside depth

760
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:22,429
peel or not I assume that I should just

761
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:25,310
go ahead and do so because we might as

762
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:26,539
well get the depth sorting in there so

763
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,670
I'm gonna go ahead and say that we've

764
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:31,519
got a room index here the room index

765
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:33,409
runs from 0 to whatever the world says

766
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,690
the room count is so however many rooms

767
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:38,299
we've got that's how many I'm going to

768
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:41,510
draw so in here I'm gonna push the

769
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:45,170
volume outline and you can see here is I

770
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:47,780
need a way you know this is just a

771
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:50,088
hard-coded one here I need a way of

772
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,819
actually specifying what these should be

773
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:56,659
now the color here and the width are

774
00:36:52,818 --> 00:36:58,608
fine but I need this part to make more

775
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:59,339
sense I've got a recommend maxed and I

776
00:36:58,608 --> 00:37:01,860
just don't know

777
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,390
to pass up for these two parameters now

778
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,030
remember these are going to be camera

779
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:09,119
relative and so I'm gonna have to use

780
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:11,610
the sim region here to make sense of all

781
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,619
that in fact to be honest this should

782
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:15,269
probably be inside this bracket because

783
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:18,420
I kind of was looking at this bracket of

784
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:21,300
stuff that had to do with the sim region

785
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:24,900
so let's just go ahead and put it in

786
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:28,019
there so let me grab the room out here's

787
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:30,329
the rural room I'm gonna say that array

788
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:32,610
of rooms just give me whichever one I'm

789
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:34,710
on and then I know I've got a min

790
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:36,570
position into Max position the question

791
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,190
is how do I translate that and if you

792
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:40,380
remember this is kind of going back to

793
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,420
old handmade hero stuff from the old

794
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,390
days the sim region knows how to

795
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,909
interpret coordinates relative to itself

796
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:50,940
and I think that's all we really need to

797
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:52,829
do here right so what I need to do is

798
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:56,130
say okay wherever the sim region is I

799
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:59,549
need a way of mapping something in the

800
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:02,789
sim region I need a way to map something

801
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:04,590
out and so you can see that it I believe

802
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:06,690
it does this in kind of a compressed way

803
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,160
you can see here it does like a relative

804
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,260
thing where it does all right here's the

805
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:13,579
energy position plus the volume position

806
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:20,640
and you know it does some well actually

807
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:21,809
it's it's this stuff here right here is

808
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:29,849
it looking to see whether these things

809
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:30,329
collide with the region where are we

810
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,860
doing this

811
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:37,980
oh I'm in the wrong place

812
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:39,450
forget everything I just said where's my

813
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,760
cap this is what this is function I want

814
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:47,339
to be in so you can see here when we go

815
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:51,090
through this right we've got the the the

816
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:56,190
entity itself coming in and we use the

817
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:59,220
location that it is we use the chunk

818
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:02,909
Delta which is the thing that says where

819
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:06,629
this particular world block is relative

820
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:08,670
to the sim region and so that's the same

821
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:11,849
thing that we want to do here's the

822
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,680
trunk position x y&amp;z right it's a world

823
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,929
position

824
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,699
and we're calling this subtract now

825
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:20,368
that's the thing that we actually want

826
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:24,299
to do here we want to know the Delta

827
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:27,030
from the sim region's origin out to it

828
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:29,750
and so I want to just make that more

829
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:38,160
systemic because I don't actually think

830
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:39,630
I don't actually think we ever pulled

831
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:41,818
that out because if we did we would have

832
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:43,500
called it right you can kind of see it's

833
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:44,818
just not there so what I want to do

834
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,710
because now if someone's gonna be using

835
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:52,559
this outside is I want to make that a

836
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:53,789
little more systemic and so this what

837
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,750
effect we want to do here is say all

838
00:39:53,789 --> 00:40:00,210
right

839
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:04,500
make relative or get sim relative

840
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:06,329
position I want to be able to do that

841
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,088
and you know it's basically going to

842
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:10,680
pass this exact same thing except it's

843
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:12,690
just going to do it like that

844
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:15,750
so it passes the sim region in and then

845
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:20,420
it'll effectively do this operation so

846
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:30,809
in here we have an equivalent in line

847
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:35,039
that's just gonna return oops don't ask

848
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:37,559
me why I just did that my brains a

849
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:43,769
little bit fried today so if you take a

850
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:50,068
world position coming in here what I'm

851
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:51,929
just gonna do is say okay perform the

852
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:58,230
exact same thing we were doing to map

853
00:40:51,929 --> 00:41:00,389
all of our entities in but now you can

854
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,639
call it from outside so if this thing

855
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:04,559
wants to do a rectum in max now it

856
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:07,858
totally can all it has to do is just

857
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:10,159
call this thing twice on the world's min

858
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:10,159
pose

859
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:26,190
and the world's max pose and that should

860
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:26,190
do it

861
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:45,039
where is our sim region world sim that's

862
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:57,009
what I actually wanted except believe

863
00:41:45,039 --> 00:42:08,860
that's what I wanted try that one more

864
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:12,690
time a long time since I've touched this

865
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,690
part of the code there we go

866
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:21,329
all right so what you can see here is

867
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:23,070
we've got a little bit of a bugginess to

868
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:24,389
us here I would have to go through I

869
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,760
probably out of typos in there summer

870
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:30,719
we're basically correct but just not

871
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,630
quite so we're not getting one of our

872
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:39,389
one of our lengths is wrong so I'm a

873
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:44,340
guessing that when I added it in the

874
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:51,389
first place so add standard room I'm

875
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:58,860
guessing that that is typo'd and I'm

876
00:42:51,389 --> 00:43:00,779
correct and so all I really want to do

877
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,099
is just fix that and take a look at

878
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,730
these rectangles which now should be

879
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:07,679
correct um so what you can see here like

880
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:10,519
I saying is they run through centers of

881
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:13,139
tiles which is probably not what we want

882
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:14,759
but we now have exactly what I was

883
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:18,000
talking about which is the ability to

884
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,710
see where the rooms are now currently we

885
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,530
are clipping so you can see we clip here

886
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:28,079
we got near and far clip planes there

887
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:33,210
and so that's probably something it

888
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:35,099
would be nice to get rid of maybe just

889
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,809
set these to something a little bit

890
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:38,279
different we could use an infinite I

891
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:41,969
don't think we ever talked about

892
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,440
infinite for our clip plane we probably

893
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:44,909
should talk about infinite for our clip

894
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,400
plane at some point maybe set it to

895
00:43:44,909 --> 00:43:48,899
infinite for our clip plane because

896
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,650
infinite for our clip plane would let us

897
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:54,630
see the whole map where as now as we

898
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:57,920
zoom out right we're gonna fall out of

899
00:43:54,630 --> 00:44:01,700
the Far clip plane region right as we go

900
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,230
so there's that but oh well anyway

901
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:07,079
that's all I wanted to accomplish for

902
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,360
getting those room barriers in there and

903
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:13,529
so now once we have those room

904
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:15,900
boundaries in there we can draw a map if

905
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:19,769
we want to right so if we had a map mode

906
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:22,019
we could just draw the rooms and off we

907
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:23,759
would go now the question is just

908
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:27,829
alright since we have the room

909
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:31,100
information now I

910
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:38,719
yes there's there's a couple of things

911
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:41,509
we want to do with that I suppose and

912
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,909
again I guess this gets down to sort of

913
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:49,630
some design decisions about how we want

914
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:49,629
to make this stuff go so

915
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:06,000
I think what we want to say

916
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:17,230
I think I think we want to have an idea

917
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:20,530
of which room the players in at any

918
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:22,240
particular time and the reason that I

919
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:28,269
say that is just because I think we're

920
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:30,250
gonna want to have I think we're gonna

921
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:33,548
want to have stuff based on this a

922
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:35,949
little bit more well it's just such a

923
00:45:33,548 --> 00:45:37,869
hard decision right because it may be

924
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:39,308
that all we want to do is that like

925
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:41,410
literally what I just did

926
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:43,298
it might be the entirety of what we want

927
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:48,399
because all we're gonna use it for is

928
00:45:43,298 --> 00:45:50,048
the map for all I know right so maybe we

929
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,559
really just don't want to do any more of

930
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:52,298
it yet

931
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,599
we've got a way to put them in there and

932
00:45:52,298 --> 00:45:58,509
that's all we really want and everything

933
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,250
else will just be based on entities that

934
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,089
are regional entities because we've got

935
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,849
that ability

936
00:46:01,088 --> 00:46:07,630
maybe that's the smart thing to do you

937
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:09,700
know I really don't know but that's sort

938
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,650
of where we're at I just I just don't

939
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:13,480
know the right answer to that question

940
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:15,548
and so we may need to delay that a

941
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,650
little bit further let's just push that

942
00:46:15,548 --> 00:46:29,108
back a little bit let's go get the

943
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:30,338
camera stuff working for let's let's go

944
00:46:29,108 --> 00:46:33,608
make the camera stuff that we have in

945
00:46:30,338 --> 00:46:36,159
there currently work better in terms of

946
00:46:33,608 --> 00:46:39,519
zooming out and making sure that it

947
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:42,239
captures the entirety of whatever room

948
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:44,440
that you happen to be in at the time

949
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:47,229
because at the moment that doesn't work

950
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,568
so what we want to do here is is have

951
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:51,670
like those camera modes and and since we

952
00:46:49,568 --> 00:46:53,528
have those specified at the moment we

953
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:58,240
could just say look let's just make sure

954
00:46:53,528 --> 00:47:00,909
that those actually work like right now

955
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:03,939
they don't and we need to have some way

956
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:06,159
of making sure that they do so if we

957
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:10,079
come through the world's creation stuff

958
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:12,548
and take a look at how that's going I'm

959
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,099
interested in making a couple different

960
00:47:12,548 --> 00:47:17,818
things what I would like to do is I'd

961
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:17,818
like to make

962
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:24,520
I'd like to make different types of

963
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,260
rooms one that you roam around that's

964
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:29,679
bigger

965
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,870
that Scrolls with you a small one that

966
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:35,409
is oom xenon like like I want to make a

967
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:40,869
couple of these rooms and I want to make

968
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:43,359
them work reasonably so I'm gonna I want

969
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:44,710
to figure out how we're gonna start

970
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,840
getting the room building working a

971
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:49,090
little bit better so I'm just gonna grab

972
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,880
all the code that does this stuff and

973
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:54,280
I'm gonna put it into a file that I can

974
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:56,860
isolate and grind on for a little bit

975
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,740
right so I'm gonna introduce a new file

976
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:04,750
here in the code I'm gonna make

977
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:08,039
something that's about world building

978
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:11,150
right so maybe this is handmade

979
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:11,150
[Music]

980
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,489
something like that I don't know one of

981
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:26,320
the nice things about file names is you

982
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:26,649
can you're always free to change them

983
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,400
later

984
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,400
oops

985
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:44,710
here we go

986
00:48:41,219 --> 00:49:00,488
so I'm gonna go ahead and just see what

987
00:48:44,710 --> 00:49:02,048
I've got here in terms of code because

988
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:03,818
this stuff is gonna need massive

989
00:49:02,048 --> 00:49:06,369
upgrading because we've never done

990
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:08,909
anything real for it right it's all kind

991
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:08,910
of just garbage

992
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:21,160
it's simply you know we've simply spent

993
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:23,230
no time on this it's just a routine that

994
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:25,480
has been repeatedly just kind of tweaked

995
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:30,639
to do whatever random test stuff we

996
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:34,329
wanted and we've never done anything to

997
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:38,379
try and make it functional it's all

998
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:40,210
messed up and weird right so this all

999
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,099
this code is garbage we just know that

1000
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,179
going into it was all just test code

1001
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:45,400
that we were using because we needed

1002
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:47,018
some stuff to do all of our rendering

1003
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,269
and asset loading and all the stuff that

1004
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:51,578
we built for the engine and so now we

1005
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:53,348
have to do is actually think about how

1006
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:56,829
this stuff should work for real so I'm

1007
00:49:53,349 --> 00:50:00,539
just gonna grab out this code and and

1008
00:49:56,829 --> 00:50:00,539
see what we've got here right

1009
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:12,279
and you can see we've got sort of a

1010
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:14,980
begin world change and world change kind

1011
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,109
of idea here I'm going to wrap that up

1012
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,679
into this stuff because it seems like

1013
00:50:17,108 --> 00:50:19,679
it's relevant

1014
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:38,109
with the understanding that I'm probably

1015
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:38,110
gonna want to get rid of a lot of it

1016
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:50,960
okay so let me just build this year for

1017
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:52,670
starters and so what we've now done is

1018
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,349
we've room we've basically removed the

1019
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:57,369
roller code so if we run the game it

1020
00:50:54,349 --> 00:51:04,239
should just like Fault out immediately

1021
00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:07,849
and because the the initial player the

1022
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:09,409
hero can't stand anywhere so when it

1023
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:14,059
tries to add a player it's gonna be like

1024
00:51:09,409 --> 00:51:21,069
there's no world I can't um I can't be

1025
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:21,070
placed anywhere right

1026
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,940
and so we've completely exercised the

1027
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:27,440
world building code it will now assert

1028
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:31,730
I'll start up that like it cannot do

1029
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:34,659
anything it goes to get the location of

1030
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:37,969
an enemy there and can't do it and so

1031
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:39,289
the off you go right so now what I need

1032
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:42,759
to do is say all right

1033
00:51:39,289 --> 00:51:44,960
let's start trying to make this stuff

1034
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,430
let's try to make this stuff a little

1035
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,960
more systemic so I can actually build a

1036
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:49,639
little world in here let's start trying

1037
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,809
to fix the stuff that's rusted about it

1038
00:51:49,639 --> 00:52:00,619
and all that good stuff so I want to

1039
00:51:53,809 --> 00:52:02,150
make some understanding here just well I

1040
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:09,130
guess before I do that let me just go

1041
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:09,130
ahead and put that stuff in here

1042
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:44,009
there we go I and this is just gonna be

1043
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:46,969
three worlds there we go

1044
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:54,060
an inside world mode if I just call that

1045
00:52:46,969 --> 00:53:05,429
in theory I should be fine so back where

1046
00:52:54,059 --> 00:53:07,769
we were in here where we would have done

1047
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:14,609
it before I'm just gonna do it

1048
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:16,440
here and that should do it

1049
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:20,340
the only thing that this currently has

1050
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:24,059
in it is this one function you can call

1051
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:25,890
but that's fine so now we should be back

1052
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:29,929
to the existing rule that we had and we

1053
00:53:25,889 --> 00:53:34,219
are and that's fine and so here's the

1054
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:34,219
the basic starting point that we're at

1055
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:39,210
and so what I want to do is start to try

1056
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:42,000
and figure out how we're gonna actually

1057
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:44,220
build these things and so I feel like

1058
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:52,619
the first thing that I want to do here

1059
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:58,859
is actually try to I I kind of want to

1060
00:53:52,619 --> 00:54:00,599
try to make I want to be able to talk

1061
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,700
about stuff without thinking about how

1062
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:06,230
it's actually gonna happen right so I

1063
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:11,129
kind of want to just pie in the sky or

1064
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:16,559
you know pure whimsy if you will I want

1065
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:19,590
to just try to make calls that are

1066
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,420
fictitious like I'm imagining I often

1067
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,370
say you start with the usage code if you

1068
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,090
know what the usage code is in this case

1069
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:26,159
that's kind of

1070
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:29,059
what I want to do right I want to say

1071
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:31,829
let's pretend we have a system for

1072
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:34,349
generating stuff and placing stuff in

1073
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:36,960
the world that is whatever we want right

1074
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:38,789
so I don't have to think about what I'm

1075
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,530
actually doing I can just pretend to

1076
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:42,989
call functions that magically do what I

1077
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:46,610
want and then I'm going to look at that

1078
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:48,750
and see what implies for the API that

1079
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:53,730
should be in place for building the

1080
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:54,960
world because if you magically dream of

1081
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,969
an API that does everything you want

1082
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,849
well that's a pretty good spec for the

1083
00:54:56,969 --> 00:55:01,409
ideal API right and then you can deal

1084
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:02,909
with the realities of it later by going

1085
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:04,529
okay now what do I need to change to

1086
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:06,569
make this actually achievable and

1087
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:08,460
usually that change isn't that big on

1088
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:10,680
the other hand if you start by building

1089
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,170
a system for building worlds and then

1090
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:15,000
later you try to write to it using the

1091
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,950
API that came out of that you may be

1092
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,900
very misinformed because you haven't

1093
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:20,699
actually thought about what you actually

1094
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:24,389
are going to do in practice which tends

1095
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:26,730
to be subtly or significantly different

1096
00:55:24,389 --> 00:55:28,710
from what you imagine the API should

1097
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,929
have been if you're only looking at it

1098
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:35,820
from the perspective of this system

1099
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:44,069
itself so let's start out with the

1100
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:47,789
basics here the idea I'm literally just

1101
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:53,580
going to start with the most

1102
00:55:47,789 --> 00:55:55,079
straightforward stuff I'm literally

1103
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:58,019
gonna start just at the beginning and

1104
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,940
and go from there

1105
00:55:58,019 --> 00:56:04,679
so I don't even know if I want to do it

1106
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:08,340
this way but obviously this game starts

1107
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:10,049
at the orphanage for the the home for

1108
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:13,019
limbless children where all the limbless

1109
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:15,450
children are and so I want to create a

1110
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:18,119
little orphanage layout and the

1111
00:56:15,449 --> 00:56:21,750
orphanage layout should be something

1112
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:23,699
that like got the hand made heroes room

1113
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:26,159
where the hand made hit where where the

1114
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:28,739
hammy hero lives and then also rooms for

1115
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:31,529
all the other characters and there's a

1116
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:34,309
lot of other characters in the game who

1117
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:37,310
are little NPCs or whatever that you can

1118
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:40,219
rescue and stuff like that so

1119
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:42,349
the orphanage should be sort of a little

1120
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:45,109
hub area and then we need a way to get

1121
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:49,099
out of the orphanage and getting out of

1122
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:52,099
the orphanage would involve walking out

1123
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:55,400
the door in and into a path for the

1124
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:57,829
forest and then what going out the path

1125
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,230
before it should get you into the actual

1126
00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:02,690
adventuring area of the game or whatever

1127
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:05,900
so I'm literally just gonna start by

1128
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:08,300
trying to do something like that and I

1129
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:10,970
don't know how I want it to happen but

1130
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:15,650
I'm just gonna start typing things in so

1131
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:17,480
I need to you know I don't know I need

1132
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:21,700
to do something like this where I say

1133
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:23,389
look I need to create a room here and

1134
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:27,949
you know I'm gonna I'm gonna

1135
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:32,239
differentiate I'm going to try to

1136
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:33,559
differentiate between world rooms which

1137
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:36,409
are rooms that have actually been

1138
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:37,639
created and generation rooms and the

1139
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:39,199
reason that I want to differentiate

1140
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:41,569
between these is is fairly

1141
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:43,069
straightforward this is putting the cart

1142
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:44,809
before the horse a little bit but it's

1143
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:46,340
just because I know how these sorts of

1144
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:50,179
things go I've done lots of generative

1145
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:51,920
coding before so one of the things that

1146
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:54,619
you don't want to do when you're making

1147
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:58,099
a generative system is actually make

1148
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:59,569
anything before you know what everything

1149
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:01,400
is that you're going to make and that

1150
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:02,900
sounds a bit a little bit weird but let

1151
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,510
me just try to well you know what let me

1152
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:07,190
just draw it for you I find a diagram

1153
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:09,790
always helps because you know we are

1154
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:16,130
visual thinkers at the end of the day

1155
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:18,469
and it helps sue a room in the case of

1156
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:21,170
handmade Hiro implies a bunch of stuff

1157
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:26,869
there's like you know the bounds and the

1158
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:29,420
entities and where they are you know and

1159
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:32,389
what they are right there's all this

1160
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:35,389
information about what a room is in

1161
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:38,690
handmade hero so when I go to make a

1162
00:58:35,389 --> 00:58:42,699
room for the orphanage or a room for a

1163
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:45,980
dungeon or whatever in order to actually

1164
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:48,099
create the real room that's in the game

1165
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:51,079
I need to know all of that information

1166
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:54,858
but some of that information maybe dip

1167
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:57,890
pendant on things I don't know yet for

1168
00:58:54,858 --> 00:58:59,838
example if I need to create some rooms

1169
00:58:57,889 --> 00:59:01,759
that connect to each other I may not

1170
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:03,650
know what the room is that this room

1171
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:07,880
connects to because I have to create one

1172
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:11,150
of the rooms first right and so I may

1173
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:15,309
want to do some things that analyze the

1174
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:18,048
fact that two rooms are connected first

1175
00:59:15,309 --> 00:59:20,028
before actually making either room

1176
00:59:18,048 --> 00:59:22,190
because maybe it will determine where

1177
00:59:20,028 --> 00:59:23,630
those rooms are placed and until I know

1178
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,719
where those rooms are placed I can't

1179
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:28,670
make them so rather than placing down a

1180
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:29,509
room and saying okay I'm making this

1181
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,670
room

1182
00:59:29,509 --> 00:59:34,159
this is room a and then I'm going to

1183
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:37,099
make room B and room B goes here what

1184
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:39,858
I'd rather do is create sort of the idea

1185
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:42,019
that there is a room a and the idea that

1186
00:59:39,858 --> 00:59:44,748
there is a room B say that they're

1187
00:59:42,018 --> 00:59:47,838
connected and then later on I will

1188
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:52,518
generate from that the actual physical

1189
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:54,739
room a and B this directly models what

1190
00:59:52,518 --> 00:59:59,358
happens in say a compiler write a

1191
00:59:54,739 --> 01:00:01,400
compiler doesn't often read the exact

1192
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:04,748
line of code that you wrote and output

1193
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:07,160
some assembly exactly right away right

1194
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:09,108
usually what happens is it goes through

1195
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:10,848
an intermediate right this is basically

1196
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:14,058
the I are the intermediate

1197
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:15,680
representation for our world Jen and I

1198
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:17,390
RS are very important because what they

1199
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:19,998
let you do is they let you work with

1200
01:00:17,389 --> 01:00:22,578
something semantically first before

1201
01:00:19,998 --> 01:00:25,728
actually creating the concrete version

1202
01:00:22,579 --> 01:00:29,209
of it that you're going to use and this

1203
01:00:25,728 --> 01:00:32,028
allows from our facile flexibility for

1204
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:33,768
example I can create a bunch of these

1205
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:36,349
things that are related to each other

1206
01:00:33,768 --> 01:00:39,258
have hypothetical locations about where

1207
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:41,059
they might be shift them around run a

1208
01:00:39,259 --> 01:00:44,719
solver on them to figure out where they

1209
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:46,910
should be placed right all of those

1210
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:49,039
things I might want to do I don't want

1211
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:50,598
to move all their entities around I

1212
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:52,400
don't want to even have created the

1213
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:54,349
entities that are in them I just want to

1214
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,599
know what entities probably will be in

1215
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:57,780
them and go from there figure out where

1216
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:59,130
they go and then

1217
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:03,660
once I know everything else about it

1218
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:08,430
then stamp the room down right so I want

1219
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:10,829
to make a notion of a generated room but

1220
01:01:08,429 --> 01:01:12,960
that is not the same as a handmade hero

1221
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:16,739
room because it's sort of existing in

1222
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,449
this in imaginary abstract space I could

1223
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,529
call it an abstract room or something

1224
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:20,939
that but I feel like Jen rooms good

1225
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:22,800
because it says in the Jemez system

1226
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:26,130
that's kind of what I want to say about

1227
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:27,480
it I want to be able to say look let's

1228
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:28,710
generate all these rooms and then say

1229
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,150
other connect it up and then start

1230
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:31,710
placing them down and maybe make

1231
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:33,570
something happen I don't know we'll see

1232
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:34,860
could be dumb could not be them we'll

1233
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:35,430
find out later it doesn't really matter

1234
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,500
right now

1235
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:39,449
so let's say we've got that Hiro's

1236
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,579
bedroom here this may not be a very

1237
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:42,599
accurate way that an orphanage would be

1238
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:43,829
constructed because an orphanage

1239
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,900
probably trying to maximize the number

1240
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:47,429
of people they can keep in a particular

1241
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:51,180
space because they're trying to you know

1242
01:01:47,429 --> 01:01:52,710
accept some a children's they can but

1243
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:57,569
this is gonna be a very posh orphanage

1244
01:01:52,710 --> 01:02:01,800
maybe you know this is a this is this is

1245
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:04,010
the the Trump orphanage right it's a

1246
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:08,850
it's a it's an orphanage for luxury

1247
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:10,320
orphans and and it just it has like

1248
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:12,779
gold-plated stuff in it or whatever for

1249
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,160
some reason I really that reason is just

1250
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,920
gameplay I want there to be enough room

1251
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,269
for you to hop around but point being

1252
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,980
this is this is probably not

1253
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:21,630
representative of a real orphanage in

1254
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,490
any particular way because all of a

1255
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,750
sudden people have individual rooms or

1256
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:27,359
something like that which doesn't seem

1257
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:29,969
plausible to me but that's okay it's not

1258
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,470
very plausible that many children

1259
01:02:29,969 --> 01:02:32,849
hopping around with no limbs going on

1260
01:02:31,469 --> 01:02:34,349
adventures in a forest anyway so we're

1261
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:36,389
kind of in the realm of the absurd even

1262
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:39,000
when we just start walking down this

1263
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:42,179
path to begin with um so anyway I want

1264
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,639
to do be able to generate rooms here and

1265
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:49,889
I want to be able to generate rooms for

1266
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:51,690
a different for different orphans as

1267
01:02:49,889 --> 01:02:54,299
well as like you know a central room and

1268
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:58,220
then I want that path and so on I also

1269
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:00,060
wanted a garden there's a gardener

1270
01:02:58,219 --> 01:03:01,889
wasn't one of the in fact there's

1271
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:04,289
there's sort of a rough sketch that Anna

1272
01:03:01,889 --> 01:03:06,389
did a while back you can actually see

1273
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:09,590
these I don't have the art for these all

1274
01:03:06,389 --> 01:03:09,589
of these characters too

1275
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:20,829
on Mali rocket calm

1276
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:26,670
there is a yeah so the there's a

1277
01:03:20,829 --> 01:03:26,670
gardener orphan who does gardening and

1278
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:33,700
basically what happens there is at first

1279
01:03:30,909 --> 01:03:35,858
there's no garden but when you recover a

1280
01:03:33,699 --> 01:03:39,278
gardening glove for the gardening orphan

1281
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:42,900
she can then go garden in the garden and

1282
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:45,039
grow stuff right and most of these

1283
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:48,460
orphans have stuff like that like this

1284
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:51,250
is a tailor and the tailor can cook you

1285
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:52,929
know so there's a number of orphans and

1286
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:57,818
they have different things that they can

1287
01:03:52,929 --> 01:04:00,460
do and so in the fiction here I want a

1288
01:03:57,818 --> 01:04:03,429
couple different things as well as rooms

1289
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:05,559
so there's like your bedroom and then

1290
01:04:03,429 --> 01:04:08,108
there's the tailor room I don't know

1291
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:11,950
what you call the room in which a fabric

1292
01:04:08,108 --> 01:04:15,400
designer or a tailor works so I guess

1293
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:18,929
I'll just call it tailor room because I

1294
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:22,019
have no better way of stating it

1295
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:22,019
[Music]

1296
01:04:25,469 --> 01:04:29,579
and maybe I'll just have a couple more

1297
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:34,019
bedrooms here right because there's a

1298
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:36,480
lot of folks in here so we'll just have

1299
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:38,940
some rooms randomly some bedrooms and

1300
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:45,599
whatever and then some additional stuff

1301
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:51,929
here I want to have sort of a up that

1302
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:54,779
forest path right and then I want to

1303
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:57,480
have like the forest entrance or

1304
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:59,220
something and so that's a pretty good

1305
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,230
example like if we can make this work

1306
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:03,209
we can probably make most things work

1307
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,409
right I mean there's a little bit one of

1308
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:06,809
the things this doesn't have as a graph

1309
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:08,599
cycle in it and so we might want to try

1310
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:11,789
and figure out how to make a graph cycle

1311
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:15,360
and again let me let me sort of say what

1312
01:05:11,789 --> 01:05:18,019
I mean by that so if you take a look at

1313
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,019
what happens

1314
01:05:26,148 --> 01:05:38,728
so let's see that our orphanage looks

1315
01:05:28,438 --> 01:05:41,458
like this oops so here's the forest

1316
01:05:38,728 --> 01:05:44,568
entrance here's the path here's the

1317
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:47,698
garden here are some of the bedrooms

1318
01:05:44,568 --> 01:05:48,958
here a bedroom whatever suppose it looks

1319
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:51,688
based like this

1320
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:54,028
well what you'll notice here is that

1321
01:05:51,688 --> 01:05:56,509
there are no cycles in this graph if you

1322
01:05:54,028 --> 01:05:59,219
imagine each room is the note of a graph

1323
01:05:56,509 --> 01:06:01,409
and each of the connections between the

1324
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:02,909
rooms is an edge in the graph then if

1325
01:06:01,409 --> 01:06:06,289
you were to draw the corresponding graph

1326
01:06:02,909 --> 01:06:06,289
it would just look like this

1327
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:17,920
I should put em there for main room

1328
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:24,829
right that's the graph and what you can

1329
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:28,490
see here is anywhere that you start on

1330
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:31,190
the graph if you do not retread one of

1331
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:33,469
your edges so if I if I only allow

1332
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:36,019
myself to walk along this graph on edges

1333
01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:38,809
I have not already walked on I can never

1334
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:41,269
get back to where I started right if I

1335
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:44,239
start on E no matter how I Traverse this

1336
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:46,909
graph I can never get back to e it's not

1337
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:48,919
possible I would have to retrace a path

1338
01:06:46,909 --> 01:06:53,118
in the opposite direction in order to

1339
01:06:48,920 --> 01:07:01,670
get back to e right but let's suppose

1340
01:06:53,119 --> 01:07:04,940
there was a secret exit here and that

1341
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:06,680
secret exit went to a path that led to

1342
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:08,269
the forest entrance as well now I don't

1343
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:10,608
know why there would be such a thing but

1344
01:07:08,269 --> 01:07:14,420
let's just say that there was then the

1345
01:07:10,608 --> 01:07:17,389
graph looks like this and now that is no

1346
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:20,269
longer true there is now a cycle and the

1347
01:07:17,389 --> 01:07:23,269
cycle is that we come through here and I

1348
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:32,509
could start at E and return to E without

1349
01:07:23,269 --> 01:07:34,909
ever retracing my path right so we may

1350
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:40,300
want to artificially introduce something

1351
01:07:34,909 --> 01:07:43,088
like that simply because it helps

1352
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:46,369
guarantee that our graph system handles

1353
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:47,900
anything it might need to handle cycles

1354
01:07:46,369 --> 01:07:51,230
are the most complicated thing that will

1355
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:53,300
happen in a graph because well graphs

1356
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:54,260
just aren't that complicated but to say

1357
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,690
the least

1358
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:58,700
a graph that has no cycles in it is

1359
01:07:56,690 --> 01:08:01,730
simpler than a graph that does have

1360
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:03,578
cycles in it and I would like to make

1361
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:06,949
sure that we're starting with something

1362
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:12,740
that has the most complicated case so as

1363
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:14,769
I work through it I know I'm not missing

1364
01:08:12,739 --> 01:08:14,769
something

1365
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:20,369
okay so let's just do exactly what I

1366
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:23,880
said

1367
01:08:20,369 --> 01:08:26,309
maybe there's a secret path back here

1368
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:40,980
like that or something so maybe there's

1369
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:44,490
a back door and so maybe those things

1370
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:47,399
connect to each other right and so what

1371
01:08:44,489 --> 01:08:49,588
I want to do now is I want to have some

1372
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:52,409
way of saying that these things do

1373
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:55,170
exactly the stuff that I said they would

1374
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:56,519
do before so if I just go by this and

1375
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:58,680
say this is roughly how I want it to

1376
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,270
behave what I could say is like all

1377
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:05,069
right I would like these things to

1378
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:10,799
connect in a specific pattern right so I

1379
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:13,650
want to make sure that you know the the

1380
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:15,569
main room connects to the hero bedroom

1381
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:27,659
in fact the main room connects to like

1382
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:29,819
all these things right so the you know

1383
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:32,159
the the the main room needs to connect

1384
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:42,410
out to the hero's bedroom the ABCD

1385
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:42,409
bedrooms the tailor room the kitchen

1386
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:48,158
[Music]

1387
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:52,659
so that's all the stuff in the main one

1388
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:55,569
then it's got its exterior entrances so

1389
01:09:52,658 --> 01:10:00,129
that's the forest path and the backdoor

1390
01:09:55,569 --> 01:10:03,698
path right and then from then on I want

1391
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:05,859
to say like okay I've got the things on

1392
01:10:03,698 --> 01:10:10,619
the outside they connect in a specific

1393
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:10,619
way as well so I've got the forest path

1394
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,829
connecting to the garden oops

1395
01:10:17,289 --> 01:10:23,019
and connecting to the forest entrance

1396
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:23,020
[Music]

1397
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:29,050
I've got the backdoor path connecting to

1398
01:10:27,219 --> 01:10:34,079
the side alley

1399
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:39,239
and then I've got the side alley

1400
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:39,238
connecting to the forest entrance right

1401
01:10:47,529 --> 01:10:52,179
and again as you as we start to try and

1402
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:54,069
make this stuff work you'll see why

1403
01:10:52,179 --> 01:10:55,658
cycles are more difficult because as you

1404
01:10:54,069 --> 01:11:03,579
lay things out they become more

1405
01:10:55,658 --> 01:11:05,920
problematic certainly but that's

1406
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:07,510
basically what I want to do right

1407
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,949
and soon arrow what we need to do is

1408
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:10,690
specify some more information about what

1409
01:11:08,948 --> 01:11:14,198
these things are supposed to have in

1410
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:16,269
them right in terms of some kind of like

1411
01:11:14,198 --> 01:11:20,710
generation parameters right they need

1412
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:23,890
some stuff and that stuff needs to to be

1413
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:26,948
specified in a way that allows some

1414
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:30,699
future the hypothetical piece of code

1415
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:33,039
that generates things to be able to know

1416
01:11:30,698 --> 01:11:34,238
what to fill these rooms with or what

1417
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:37,289
they should look like how they should be

1418
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:39,849
shaped all that kind of stuff right so

1419
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:44,369
what I want to do now is introduce a

1420
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:44,370
concept of like a room spec or something

1421
01:11:45,158 --> 01:11:52,089
and the room spec should say how this

1422
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:54,310
stuff should be generated right and so

1423
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:57,400
you know like maybe there's just a

1424
01:11:54,310 --> 01:12:00,670
generic forest spec and again I

1425
01:11:57,399 --> 01:12:04,829
don't know exactly what that would

1426
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:04,829
entail here or anything like that

1427
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:20,429
probably want it more like that or maybe

1428
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:20,429
you know what maybe it's just like this

1429
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:35,409
and so what I need to do here is tell

1430
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,690
these things when I make the rooms I

1431
01:12:35,408 --> 01:12:42,309
need to tell them here's what you want

1432
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:44,369
to use to generate yourself so you know

1433
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:47,580
in this case I've got a base forest

1434
01:12:44,369 --> 01:12:50,019
basic forest

1435
01:12:47,579 --> 01:12:53,429
maybe these are all basic forests for

1436
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:57,900
now and let's tweak them a little later

1437
01:12:53,429 --> 01:12:57,899
so all this stuff is basic forest

1438
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,239
so maybe something like this where we

1439
01:13:19,869 --> 01:13:24,010
can just say alright we've got a few

1440
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:26,619
room specs here and these could those

1441
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:28,869
can be used to generate whatever these

1442
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:31,119
rooms have to be and they're basically

1443
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:33,069
prescriptions about what sorts of stuff

1444
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:37,409
he's allowed in the room and what sorts

1445
01:13:33,069 --> 01:13:37,409
of stuff isn't allowed in the room right

1446
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:56,819
so I think that's all of it right

1447
01:13:57,449 --> 01:14:05,699
bedroom main room Taylor kitchen garden

1448
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:05,699
done

1449
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:15,090
so again just kind of laying this out

1450
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:23,099
the way that I would imagine wanting to

1451
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:33,180
do it this is probably going to be

1452
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:35,039
something like this and that all seems

1453
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:38,730
fine so when I generate one of these

1454
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:42,060
specifications I'm gonna need a bunch of

1455
01:14:38,729 --> 01:14:44,039
information about how they work at the

1456
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,720
moment I don't know that there's much I

1457
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:47,310
want to say about them because we

1458
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:49,800
probably can get into that a little bit

1459
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:52,020
later but you can imagine the sorts of

1460
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,510
things that we might want to have here

1461
01:14:52,020 --> 01:15:01,080
they're gonna be stuff like saying hey

1462
01:14:54,510 --> 01:15:03,659
this is you know the type of stuff that

1463
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:05,100
can be on the ground and this is the

1464
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:08,220
type of stuff that can be on the walls

1465
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:09,690
and this you know what I mean

1466
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:11,640
so it's starters we will specify

1467
01:15:09,689 --> 01:15:13,199
anything and they'll just be generic

1468
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,640
rooms that have no character to the

1469
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:17,639
middle but so ever but eventually these

1470
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,990
specs will have to get information in

1471
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:22,230
them and that's how it knows what to

1472
01:15:18,989 --> 01:15:24,649
create now all of these things are gonna

1473
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:27,329
have to take some kind of a generator

1474
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:29,460
right and that's just basically a

1475
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:32,100
parameter where it's like hey where does

1476
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:34,050
the memory come from and what where are

1477
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,730
we storing all this information and how

1478
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:37,560
am i connecting it to other things in

1479
01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:40,349
the world it might be relevant and blah

1480
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:42,510
blah blah right so looking at the API

1481
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:48,680
here we can sort of start to see exactly

1482
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:56,030
what what needs to happen I think and

1483
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:56,030
honestly I think that's mostly it

1484
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:29,779
I guess if I'm being specific here let's

1485
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:30,769
just suppose I went the whole nine so if

1486
01:16:29,779 --> 01:16:33,079
we take a look at what I'm talking about

1487
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:36,020
here I'm just saying all right

1488
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:37,369
we've got an orphanage creation routine

1489
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:39,980
it specifies all the stuff that's

1490
01:16:37,369 --> 01:16:41,448
relevant to the orphanage now as you

1491
01:16:39,979 --> 01:16:43,939
might imagine the game can't just be an

1492
01:16:41,448 --> 01:16:45,948
orphanage but that's okay because when

1493
01:16:43,939 --> 01:16:53,899
we do this what we can do is when we

1494
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:55,099
pass this back right we can just say

1495
01:16:53,899 --> 01:16:57,019
that there's like a Jenner or an

1496
01:16:55,100 --> 01:17:00,260
instruct and the general finished struct

1497
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:03,230
has the outgoing connections right so

1498
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:05,539
the room that's the forest entrance is

1499
01:17:03,229 --> 01:17:08,389
the only thing that this thing actually

1500
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:10,609
allows you to work with although we may

1501
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:11,750
also want to do the hero bedroom because

1502
01:17:10,609 --> 01:17:13,908
that's where the player should get

1503
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:16,670
placed so what we can say is when you

1504
01:17:13,908 --> 01:17:19,759
call create orphanage you get app you

1505
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:22,100
know back from that you get the

1506
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,739
information you would need to connect it

1507
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,850
up if you wanted to and you're going to

1508
01:17:24,738 --> 01:17:28,309
want to write because you're going to

1509
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:30,260
need to connect it up stuff later um so

1510
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:33,380
we can say it's like okay the hero

1511
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:35,600
bedroom gets recorded the forest

1512
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,980
entrance gets recorded nothing else

1513
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,190
really needs to but we could we can

1514
01:17:36,979 --> 01:17:43,250
return anything we want here so when you

1515
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:48,198
create one of these with the you know

1516
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:50,689
world generator you get back the

1517
01:17:48,198 --> 01:17:53,809
information that you needed about what

1518
01:17:50,689 --> 01:17:59,599
was in you know how you might plug into

1519
01:17:53,810 --> 01:18:01,670
this thing that you made okay so that's

1520
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,020
pretty straightforward hopefully you

1521
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:08,539
understand what I'm talking about there

1522
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:09,770
so when I do create world here what I

1523
01:18:08,539 --> 01:18:15,019
need to do is first create one of these

1524
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:16,850
rural generators who knows how that's

1525
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:19,040
going to happen then I'm going to create

1526
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:19,679
the orphanage here and I guess I'll get

1527
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:22,219
back

1528
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,219
an orphanage

1529
01:18:31,948 --> 01:18:35,819
I'll create an orphanage then what I

1530
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:37,649
need to do is actually have that do a

1531
01:18:35,819 --> 01:18:40,799
layout to place where all these things

1532
01:18:37,649 --> 01:18:46,649
you know would be and then I need to do

1533
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:48,510
a world generate that would actually

1534
01:18:46,649 --> 01:18:52,498
take all the semantic information and

1535
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:54,420
produce the world mode result from there

1536
01:18:52,498 --> 01:18:56,158
now I don't really know that that needs

1537
01:18:54,420 --> 01:19:14,429
to take the world mode it could be that

1538
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:17,188
you can just take the world yeah that

1539
01:19:14,429 --> 01:19:22,319
that may not need the world mode it may

1540
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:24,840
be that that just just does world so I

1541
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:26,849
will say you know I'll I'll just I'll

1542
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:28,529
pass the world for now if it turns out

1543
01:19:26,849 --> 01:19:37,828
that we need the world mode later we can

1544
01:19:28,529 --> 01:19:39,478
fix that and that's fine I don't know

1545
01:19:37,828 --> 01:19:40,828
that we really need the transient state

1546
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:42,119
to be honest

1547
01:19:40,828 --> 01:19:44,958
I don't think I'm going to use it we'll

1548
01:19:42,118 --> 01:19:44,958
see why in a second

1549
01:19:55,079 --> 01:20:00,309
but I think that's it

1550
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:04,060
so what you can see now is again I did

1551
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:06,400
exactly what I set out to do I wanted a

1552
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:09,310
way to figure out where my API should

1553
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:11,439
sort of begin and this seems pretty

1554
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:13,360
logical to me this gives me all of the

1555
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,099
stuff that I wanted I can specify what

1556
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:17,109
kinds of rooms I want to be involved I

1557
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:19,720
can have a place where I can talk about

1558
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:22,089
things that need to be in them and then

1559
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:24,220
I can say how there should be linked up

1560
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:26,650
so that it will make a plausible version

1561
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:28,720
of that thing right now in the future

1562
01:20:26,649 --> 01:20:30,039
I'm gonna need to expand these I can you

1563
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,119
know I can already guess that this would

1564
01:20:30,039 --> 01:20:33,340
have to have constraints about

1565
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,630
directionality like maybe I always want

1566
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:36,069
the hero bedroom to be connected on the

1567
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:37,239
south side of the orphanage and they

1568
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:38,319
always want the forest pass to be

1569
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:40,750
connected on the north side of the or

1570
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:42,009
Freight or things like that but you know

1571
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:43,449
those are things that I can add over

1572
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:45,640
time and there's a clear place where I

1573
01:20:43,449 --> 01:20:47,829
would do them because I have every

1574
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,660
logical thing that I wanted to talk

1575
01:20:47,829 --> 01:20:50,800
about is being talked about there's the

1576
01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:52,389
specifications for rooms

1577
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,980
there's the rooms themselves there's

1578
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:56,410
connectivity between rooms and that's

1579
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:58,959
basically what I wanted so far in the

1580
01:20:56,409 --> 01:21:00,250
system and there it is so what I should

1581
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,029
be able to do now is I should be able

1582
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:07,119
start building this out and actually do

1583
01:21:03,029 --> 01:21:10,929
exactly that implement those api's and

1584
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:13,349
make them work so let's go ahead and get

1585
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:13,350
started with that

1586
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:24,579
okay and you'll see as we go yet

1587
01:21:22,289 --> 01:21:26,019
basically the the main thing here like

1588
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:27,939
this stuff is pretty logical the main

1589
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:32,050
thing that probably left you expanded at

1590
01:21:27,939 --> 01:21:34,119
first is the specs things like how big

1591
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:37,409
rooms should be generally speaking like

1592
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:40,899
what the flexibility is on that and and

1593
01:21:37,409 --> 01:21:43,470
just some basic parameters will have to

1594
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:46,989
be specified pretty early on I think

1595
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:48,909
because if we don't specify those we

1596
01:21:46,989 --> 01:21:50,319
won't have a lot of understanding in the

1597
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:52,569
generator of how it should start placing

1598
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:54,039
things so that part logic is failing

1599
01:21:52,569 --> 01:21:56,859
sooner the other stuff can be expanded

1600
01:21:54,039 --> 01:22:00,010
later like what actually gets put inside

1601
01:21:56,859 --> 01:22:02,289
rooms and all that needs its own sort of

1602
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:03,670
rich system of specification that will

1603
01:22:02,289 --> 01:22:05,409
go in here

1604
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:08,710
and that stuff I just don't care about

1605
01:22:05,409 --> 01:22:10,510
at the moment right that stuff that will

1606
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:13,000
sort of start to take on a little bit

1607
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:15,100
later as a secondary system that's sort

1608
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,369
of it's it's it's you want to look at

1609
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:20,920
this sort of as a meta multistage

1610
01:22:18,369 --> 01:22:23,349
process get the layout of rooms first

1611
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:26,079
and then find details of the rooms

1612
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:32,230
second so that you can kind of tackle

1613
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:33,340
the problem in in two stages so let's go

1614
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:36,779
ahead and talk about the types that we

1615
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:42,430
said we have we know that we have a

1616
01:22:36,779 --> 01:22:48,509
world generator we know that we have a

1617
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:48,510
general spec we know that we have a gem

1618
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:53,799
we know that we have a gem connection

1619
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:55,389
now we didn't talk about it explicitly

1620
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:58,329
but presumably that's what connect would

1621
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:58,869
return we just never need to talk about

1622
01:22:58,329 --> 01:23:01,359
it at all

1623
01:22:58,869 --> 01:23:03,519
so far so we know that we have one we

1624
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:06,369
just don't need to actually expose it to

1625
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,660
the users yet of the generator but we

1626
01:23:06,369 --> 01:23:11,460
know it's there so I'm gonna put it in

1627
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:15,250
there because it's clear that it's there

1628
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:18,069
and that's what we've got furthermore we

1629
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:21,819
know that we've got a certain set of

1630
01:23:18,069 --> 01:23:25,319
routines here right and what we can sort

1631
01:23:21,819 --> 01:23:28,239
of see is this will probably move out to

1632
01:23:25,319 --> 01:23:30,609
you know we've got we've got to have the

1633
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:32,260
system there's an API for building a

1634
01:23:30,609 --> 01:23:35,109
world and then there's actually like the

1635
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:36,789
game logic of what world gets built and

1636
01:23:35,109 --> 01:23:39,719
those are two separate things so

1637
01:23:36,789 --> 01:23:42,819
eventually we're looking towards right

1638
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:45,190
pulling out like create orphanage will

1639
01:23:42,819 --> 01:23:48,069
not live in the world generator for long

1640
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:51,460
once we get a significant amount of that

1641
01:23:48,069 --> 01:23:55,179
world generation stuff together we will

1642
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:57,520
make a hard split of stuff that does the

1643
01:23:55,180 --> 01:24:00,250
world generation work and stuff that

1644
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,200
lays out the specification for what

1645
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:06,850
world should be generated and those will

1646
01:24:02,199 --> 01:24:08,619
not be the same right so that's where my

1647
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:10,750
eye is out at the moment just you can

1648
01:24:08,619 --> 01:24:11,829
understand mentally you know sort of

1649
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:16,090
what I'm talking about

1650
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:16,869
as I go forward so we now know that we

1651
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:18,579
also in a

1652
01:24:16,869 --> 01:24:22,479
to these things we've got a bunch of

1653
01:24:18,579 --> 01:24:26,229
code that we've sort of said has to be

1654
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:29,409
there right we know we've got this thing

1655
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:32,799
that generates a spec we know we've got

1656
01:24:29,409 --> 01:24:35,079
a thing that generates a room or creates

1657
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:38,020
the semantic idea of a room to generate

1658
01:24:35,079 --> 01:24:39,789
right we know we have to get the world

1659
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:43,630
generator somehow we know we have to

1660
01:24:39,789 --> 01:24:44,890
have a layout called places worlds and

1661
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:46,569
whatever we need a thing that actually

1662
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:48,310
generates everything and then we need a

1663
01:24:46,569 --> 01:24:54,239
way to clean it all up right and just

1664
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:56,800
say we're done all right so here in my

1665
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:58,599
we've got the sort of gemspec thing that

1666
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:02,279
takes the world generator and that's

1667
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,280
just something that produces a spec

1668
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:29,259
we've got the general call there there's

1669
01:25:21,369 --> 01:25:32,859
something mixed connection I'm not gonna

1670
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:37,690
use Furman too because in our world we

1671
01:25:32,859 --> 01:25:40,420
don't really have one-way connections we

1672
01:25:37,689 --> 01:25:42,339
may add something like a one-way

1673
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:44,500
connection in the future which would be

1674
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:49,060
like a teleport or something that only

1675
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:50,829
goes one direction but that's not the

1676
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:53,440
same thing as we're talking about here

1677
01:25:50,829 --> 01:25:55,059
when we're talking about connecting here

1678
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:58,239
we're talking about the geographic

1679
01:25:55,060 --> 01:26:00,910
layout of the rooms and that is only

1680
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:03,460
mutual there's no way to have room a a

1681
01:26:00,909 --> 01:26:05,889
but room B but not have room B about

1682
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:09,640
room a they're a budding or they're not

1683
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:12,610
right so Connect is about the spatial

1684
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:15,430
relationship of the rooms connect them

1685
01:26:12,609 --> 01:26:18,159
physically not about the topological

1686
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:20,140
connection in a gameplay sense which is

1687
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:21,579
irrelevant to this part of the code this

1688
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,000
code is talking about where to put the

1689
01:26:21,579 --> 01:26:23,559
rooms

1690
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,659
it doesn't need to know whether the

1691
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:28,060
player can get between them or not in

1692
01:26:25,659 --> 01:26:30,130
fact we could have people calling

1693
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,520
connect with a parameter later on that

1694
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:32,829
says

1695
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:34,720
don't actually make a door I just want

1696
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:35,920
these two things next to each other but

1697
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,930
they you shouldn't be able to go through

1698
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,760
them right because that is something you

1699
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:41,260
may want to do for example let's say a

1700
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,430
room was on top of another room but you

1701
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:44,170
don't want to stare well you just want

1702
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:45,220
to be able to look down into it that's

1703
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:47,380
like part of the gameplay

1704
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,820
who knows that's an example of what I

1705
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:51,640
would want to say connect these two

1706
01:26:48,819 --> 01:26:53,619
rooms one on top of the other spatially

1707
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:56,950
but don't have a way for the player to

1708
01:26:53,619 --> 01:26:59,079
actually get between them right so again

1709
01:26:56,949 --> 01:27:00,519
connect in this case is talking about

1710
01:26:59,079 --> 01:27:03,609
the physical connection between the

1711
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:05,200
rooms not the actual semantic connection

1712
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:06,869
can the player get there and that's an

1713
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:18,579
important distinction for us understand

1714
01:27:06,869 --> 01:27:21,659
what we're trying to accomplish here so

1715
01:27:18,579 --> 01:27:21,659
we don't know yet what that takes

1716
01:27:44,689 --> 01:27:51,649
all right

1717
01:27:45,989 --> 01:27:51,649
I assume now we have sort of all of the

1718
01:27:52,640 --> 01:28:00,090
all of the sort of the husk the stubs of

1719
01:27:56,189 --> 01:28:02,399
what we actually need to do here and so

1720
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:05,850
let's start by implementing the basic

1721
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:07,829
stuff that we can implement right so

1722
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:09,570
when we go ahead and start doing this

1723
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:12,600
stuff we kind of know that we're just

1724
01:28:09,569 --> 01:28:16,920
going to be creating these arbitrary

1725
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:23,970
stuff that these yeah we're just

1726
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:27,569
creating this stuff here and fill in

1727
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:29,340
junk out so what I want to do is I want

1728
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:32,519
to have a good way to allocate this

1729
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:38,239
stuff and if you remember where's our

1730
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:38,240
arena stuff here yeah

1731
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,900
this is really good advice by the way

1732
01:29:09,269 --> 01:29:14,390
so I assume

1733
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:14,389
[Music]

1734
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:34,670
hmmm this is where not having worked

1735
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,409
with this code a long time makes it

1736
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:44,470
tough because I don't remember what we

1737
01:29:36,409 --> 01:29:49,840
had implemented yet so we have here

1738
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:49,840
allocation flags and it looks like to me

1739
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:11,889
so okay great

1740
01:30:10,179 --> 01:30:16,569
so it looks like we've already finished

1741
01:30:11,889 --> 01:30:23,949
this part so if you look here and you

1742
01:30:16,569 --> 01:30:26,518
can see this you can see this code just

1743
01:30:23,948 --> 01:30:29,319
grows the arena any time it needs to so

1744
01:30:26,519 --> 01:30:43,300
basically we can just make one of these

1745
01:30:29,319 --> 01:30:46,029
and go to town so I think we're

1746
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:51,099
basically good to go so here's all I

1747
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:53,469
want to do I'm gonna let this thing for

1748
01:30:51,099 --> 01:30:56,078
now and possibly for always one of the

1749
01:30:53,469 --> 01:31:00,368
things that's generally true these days

1750
01:30:56,078 --> 01:31:02,078
is especially lately this was not really

1751
01:31:00,368 --> 01:31:05,578
true when we started handmade here oh

1752
01:31:02,078 --> 01:31:09,248
it's starting to be kind of true now is

1753
01:31:05,578 --> 01:31:12,399
the amount of memory and machines is so

1754
01:31:09,248 --> 01:31:15,670
much larger then I would ever have

1755
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:21,189
expected it to be relative to what we

1756
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:25,090
create it's kind of nuts it's a little

1757
01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:27,759
bit weird so I'm not sure how much we

1758
01:31:25,090 --> 01:31:30,130
care about this stuff or not but in the

1759
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:35,440
future we may want to hardbound the

1760
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:37,650
world generation size at the moment any

1761
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:40,058
platform we're going to run this on is

1762
01:31:37,649 --> 01:31:43,689
more than capable of giving us all the

1763
01:31:40,059 --> 01:31:45,300
memory that we need to do so so I'm just

1764
01:31:43,689 --> 01:31:51,759
gonna let it take as much as it wants

1765
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:55,659
for the time being we'll see eventually

1766
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:58,239
if I need to walk that back for some

1767
01:31:55,658 --> 01:31:59,828
very constrained platforms I'm not sure

1768
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:04,868
what the most constrained platform would

1769
01:31:59,828 --> 01:32:07,569
be maybe a Raspberry Pi but even like

1770
01:32:04,868 --> 01:32:09,518
phones nowadays have like infinite

1771
01:32:07,569 --> 01:32:12,368
memory it's weird I mean not for the

1772
01:32:09,519 --> 01:32:15,130
crazy stuff that people seem to expect

1773
01:32:12,368 --> 01:32:17,978
now in you know like a Unity game or

1774
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:18,909
something but like if for a hand-coded

1775
01:32:17,979 --> 01:32:20,890
game the amount

1776
01:32:18,909 --> 01:32:22,479
to memory they give you is just

1777
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:25,210
absolutely nuts used to be that the

1778
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:26,859
iPhones were not so much but they're

1779
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:30,699
starting to get kind of absurd in terms

1780
01:32:26,859 --> 01:32:36,399
of how much memory they have it's really

1781
01:32:30,699 --> 01:32:37,630
bizarre but more power to them if those

1782
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:40,089
hardware manufacturers can keep putting

1783
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:41,560
it in there and I guess they're gonna

1784
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:44,350
have to you can't even run a web browser

1785
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:47,289
with like about multiple gigabytes these

1786
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:49,510
days it's like I just want to load the

1787
01:32:47,289 --> 01:32:53,079
front page of cnn.com it's like oh

1788
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:56,829
that'll be half a gigabyte of memory I

1789
01:32:53,079 --> 01:32:58,840
guess it's like whatever anyway um so

1790
01:32:56,829 --> 01:33:01,689
I'm gonna let this thing grow at the

1791
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:05,770
moment and so I'm going to use the

1792
01:33:01,689 --> 01:33:07,179
bootstrap push size thing that we were

1793
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:11,680
here to just create one of these world

1794
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:12,820
generators and so what I'm gonna do here

1795
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:15,659
is just say okay

1796
01:33:12,819 --> 01:33:19,329
when you go to start creating a world

1797
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:25,300
I'm gonna say I've got a the world Gen

1798
01:33:19,329 --> 01:33:27,159
here and if I remember correctly sort of

1799
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:29,199
the way we did this is you can say the

1800
01:33:27,159 --> 01:33:32,470
type that you wanted and the member in

1801
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:35,619
it that's going to be the arena so the

1802
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:39,310
arena is just gonna be right or I'll

1803
01:33:35,619 --> 01:33:42,010
just call it memory right so inside a

1804
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:45,520
world generator I have a memory arena

1805
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:49,090
and that memory arena is called memory

1806
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,740
on surprisingly and so this will just

1807
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:52,510
create us one of these rural generators

1808
01:33:50,739 --> 01:33:54,130
that has its own arena and off it goes

1809
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:56,140
and then we'll just create all of the

1810
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:58,000
stuff that we want for it we'll just be

1811
01:33:56,140 --> 01:34:00,789
in there and then we'll just discard it

1812
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:10,979
when we're done and be done with it so I

1813
01:34:00,789 --> 01:34:10,979
think we had a way to do that here oops

1814
01:34:13,819 --> 01:34:20,809
so in here we sort of have there is one

1815
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:25,210
nastiness we never fixed this in fact I

1816
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:34,880
think we have a bug logged against this

1817
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:36,920
actually don't we do we I need to log

1818
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,930
into github on the main hand main hero

1819
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:41,449
machine I'm I'm not I'm quite sure I'm

1820
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:43,909
not in fact but I have it on the other

1821
01:34:41,449 --> 01:34:51,050
machine here logged in let me see

1822
01:34:43,909 --> 01:34:54,739
yes bug in clear memory arena and what

1823
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:56,840
happens there this was reported by busy

1824
01:34:54,739 --> 01:35:00,469
beaver and thank you for reporting this

1825
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:03,650
it's true I will log that as resolved

1826
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:06,140
today presumably we'll see but what you

1827
01:35:03,649 --> 01:35:10,059
can see here is this was written before

1828
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:12,920
we used the bootstrap stuff which

1829
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:15,680
allocates the arena inside the arena

1830
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:18,350
itself and so what happens is when you

1831
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:21,350
do free last block and you do this the

1832
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:23,450
allocate memory on exit from the routine

1833
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:28,030
you come back to clear you check this

1834
01:35:23,449 --> 01:35:31,369
and this is now an invalid pointer right

1835
01:35:28,029 --> 01:35:34,969
so what we actually need to do there in

1836
01:35:31,369 --> 01:35:39,559
order to make this be safe is we want to

1837
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:44,690
check this as a prophylactic first to

1838
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:47,660
see whether or not we we are done if

1839
01:35:44,689 --> 01:35:50,239
this is the last block because if it is

1840
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:53,269
the last block then we want to break

1841
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:56,119
always so we can actually leave the loop

1842
01:35:53,270 --> 01:36:00,170
mostly the same but what we do want to

1843
01:35:56,119 --> 01:36:04,359
do here is like you can see where we do

1844
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:09,409
this arena preevning we can say you know

1845
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:14,049
something like exit or this is last

1846
01:36:09,409 --> 01:36:14,050
block I'll put a note here

1847
01:36:27,149 --> 01:36:32,319
so what we want to do here is say look

1848
01:36:29,649 --> 01:36:39,839
if this was the last block so you know

1849
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:44,469
if the if the the arena current block

1850
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:47,920
had the one before it which we're about

1851
01:36:44,469 --> 01:36:51,309
to say is a new current block if that is

1852
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,958
not valid so if there's if it's as null

1853
01:36:51,309 --> 01:36:56,650
right all right you know what I could do

1854
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:59,288
it this way if the if the one that we

1855
01:36:56,649 --> 01:37:02,888
will be moving to is zero then this is

1856
01:36:59,288 --> 01:37:07,408
the last block and so I'd say if this is

1857
01:37:02,889 --> 01:37:07,409
the last block break right

1858
01:37:09,269 --> 01:37:14,019
probably not the cleanest way to write

1859
01:37:10,988 --> 01:37:15,578
that loop but that'd work and like I

1860
01:37:14,019 --> 01:37:16,929
said that kind of has to be in there in

1861
01:37:15,578 --> 01:37:20,738
order to make sure that the clear

1862
01:37:16,929 --> 01:37:22,630
actually works because otherwise could

1863
01:37:20,738 --> 01:37:27,458
free the arena and then look at the

1864
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:29,969
arena which is obviously a bug so um the

1865
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:33,279
other way to write this I guess would be

1866
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:36,010
to just make this a four loop and do an

1867
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:41,590
if the rad doesn't matter all right so

1868
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:43,119
anyway I'm gonna call clear on this and

1869
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:44,800
that'll be the end of it that'll free

1870
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:46,089
all the memory that we use so then we

1871
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:50,559
don't really have to track the memory at

1872
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:52,748
all and we don't care we can just do

1873
01:37:50,559 --> 01:37:59,309
whatever we want so then for each of

1874
01:37:52,748 --> 01:38:04,859
these I can do a push struct on them and

1875
01:37:59,309 --> 01:38:04,860
just get them oops

1876
01:38:08,489 --> 01:38:16,289
and I probably want these to be zeroed

1877
01:38:11,810 --> 01:38:20,730
when we're doing it as well I don't

1878
01:38:16,289 --> 01:38:24,239
remember whether we said that's the

1879
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:44,069
default it is so it'll just get cleared

1880
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:58,139
to zero always so if you look at what

1881
01:38:44,069 --> 01:39:08,809
we've got here we have now implemented a

1882
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:11,730
stub version of basically everything and

1883
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:16,310
if I go in and now actually call this

1884
01:39:11,729 --> 01:39:16,309
which I don't think I'm actually doing

1885
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:23,450
so inside create world here for example

1886
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:23,449
I'll actually call this now

1887
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:51,219
I'm mr. debugger and that's a good

1888
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:52,960
stopping place - for today so that's

1889
01:39:51,219 --> 01:39:56,618
great tomorrow we can base start typing

1890
01:39:52,960 --> 01:40:07,868
that in how come I did not hit my

1891
01:39:56,618 --> 01:40:10,649
breakpoint what was taking so long do

1892
01:40:07,868 --> 01:40:10,649
you see how long that took

1893
01:40:20,319 --> 01:40:24,989
what how are we

1894
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:44,920
uh so the generate lighting pattern

1895
01:40:37,328 --> 01:40:54,639
takes forever in debug mode off to fix

1896
01:40:44,920 --> 01:41:00,250
that good how long that takes but anyway

1897
01:40:54,639 --> 01:41:03,460
here we go so you know that's not even

1898
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:10,359
the one I wanted got too many things

1899
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:12,789
called create world so just want to walk

1900
01:41:10,359 --> 01:41:15,639
through this here so when we do begin

1901
01:41:12,789 --> 01:41:18,039
world gen we do a bootstrap right and so

1902
01:41:15,639 --> 01:41:23,770
then what we get back is one of these

1903
01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:28,328
guys that just has the memory arena

1904
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:31,239
built inside it so then when we start

1905
01:41:28,328 --> 01:41:32,769
doing stuff we just can so then we come

1906
01:41:31,238 --> 01:41:36,279
through here we'd like to do a gen spec

1907
01:41:32,770 --> 01:41:38,170
right we just push one of those on off

1908
01:41:36,279 --> 01:41:42,340
we go right so this just basically just

1909
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:46,449
generates all that memory fills it up

1910
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:47,980
and good to go we then call these sub

1911
01:41:46,448 --> 01:41:50,049
functions that don't do anything yet and

1912
01:41:47,979 --> 01:41:52,089
then we end the world gen which does the

1913
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:54,010
clear right and now the clear there

1914
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:56,409
should only be like one block I think

1915
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:58,210
right yeah because we didn't use very

1916
01:41:56,408 --> 01:42:01,000
much memory right so then there's a

1917
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:02,920
previous that's that's set to zero so

1918
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,170
this should be set to one because it is

1919
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:06,609
the last block so when it frees it it'll

1920
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:08,460
see that that's the last block and leave

1921
01:42:06,609 --> 01:42:13,630
so that bugs gone

1922
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:16,868
and off we go so that's all good you

1923
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:19,179
know we're we're all happy campers there

1924
01:42:16,868 --> 01:42:28,479
and that's a good place to leave it for

1925
01:42:19,179 --> 01:42:30,840
today let me go ahead and close that bug

1926
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:30,839
out too

1927
01:42:31,529 --> 01:42:50,038
I today is what 444 so I'll just say

1928
01:42:43,979 --> 01:42:52,709
this should be fixed as of day 444 and

1929
01:42:50,038 --> 01:42:56,210
then I think we will go to the Q&amp;A let's

1930
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:56,210
close in comment

1931
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:02,668
[Music]

1932
01:43:14,449 --> 01:43:21,439
any thoughts on mic act enjoining the

1933
01:43:16,729 --> 01:43:24,309
unity dev team um I don't have a lot of

1934
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:29,149
thoughts on it other than it seems good

1935
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:31,490
to me unity is used by a lot of people

1936
01:43:29,149 --> 01:43:34,309
to make games now and it like the

1937
01:43:31,489 --> 01:43:37,849
quality level seems pretty low on a lot

1938
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:42,590
of those games in terms of the code

1939
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:45,079
quality I don't know whether that's

1940
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:47,090
because unities has low code quality or

1941
01:43:45,079 --> 01:43:48,590
whether that's because hey the whole

1942
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:51,110
point of unity is that inexperienced

1943
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:52,489
people in terms of programming can use

1944
01:43:51,109 --> 01:43:55,399
it to make games that's like the whole

1945
01:43:52,489 --> 01:43:57,050
point of icing an engine a lot of the

1946
01:43:55,399 --> 01:43:58,639
times and sometimes the point is to save

1947
01:43:57,050 --> 01:44:00,529
yourself the work but a lot of times

1948
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:02,210
it's because people who could not have

1949
01:44:00,529 --> 01:44:05,779
made an engine can now license one and

1950
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:06,560
use it and that's good I don't know if

1951
01:44:05,779 --> 01:44:07,550
maybe it's just because they don't

1952
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,470
really know what they're doing

1953
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:12,710
programming wise so it makes it appear

1954
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:13,820
like it's a lot more finicky and poor

1955
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:14,119
performance and all the other sorts of

1956
01:44:13,819 --> 01:44:17,329
things

1957
01:44:14,119 --> 01:44:19,369
I don't know right but I do know that a

1958
01:44:17,329 --> 01:44:20,869
lot of games I play that use unity have

1959
01:44:19,369 --> 01:44:23,750
a lot of problems that really shouldn't

1960
01:44:20,869 --> 01:44:26,029
be there and I don't know why that is

1961
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:27,439
but one of the problems may be that

1962
01:44:26,029 --> 01:44:30,500
there needs to be more attention paid to

1963
01:44:27,439 --> 01:44:32,000
how to make it be efficient given that

1964
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:34,520
you know that the people who are using

1965
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,930
it aren't necessarily expert programmers

1966
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:38,480
in fact a lot of times the whole point

1967
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:42,710
is that they aren't so it seems like

1968
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:45,559
having people who have a focus on sort

1969
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:47,659
of performance and code cleanliness in

1970
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:49,700
that sense not over complicating things

1971
01:44:47,659 --> 01:44:53,659
and making it be designed specifically

1972
01:44:49,699 --> 01:44:57,050
to do good CPU level processing he's a

1973
01:44:53,659 --> 01:44:58,579
plus and hopefully will lead to good

1974
01:44:57,050 --> 01:45:00,380
things because a lot of people make

1975
01:44:58,579 --> 01:45:02,239
games and unity so we're gonna get games

1976
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:05,420
made in unity there's no two ways about

1977
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:07,340
that the better unity is the better

1978
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:08,869
those games will be right because the

1979
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:11,180
more improvements you can make to unity

1980
01:45:08,869 --> 01:45:13,550
the more those games will be improved by

1981
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:15,380
it right same is true of the Unreal

1982
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:17,150
Engine the better you make the Unreal

1983
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:20,720
Engine the better the games are because

1984
01:45:17,149 --> 01:45:22,460
a lot of people use it you know if the

1985
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:24,440
Unreal Engine had better networking code

1986
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:25,850
player unknowns battlegrounds wouldn't

1987
01:45:24,439 --> 01:45:30,259
be such a pie

1988
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:31,460
I know sorry to be mean about it but the

1989
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:32,690
networking code in that game

1990
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:35,060
well the networking code a lot of Unreal

1991
01:45:32,689 --> 01:45:38,929
Engine games is just really bad and you

1992
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:41,539
know that's like hey if they make good

1993
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:43,039
significant technological advances in

1994
01:45:41,539 --> 01:45:44,569
some of those things then all those

1995
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:51,039
games get better and that's better for

1996
01:45:44,569 --> 01:45:51,039
everybody right so it does seem good I

1997
01:45:51,909 --> 01:45:56,930
don't know you know can he make

1998
01:45:55,069 --> 01:45:59,239
meaningful improvements to it he's only

1999
01:45:56,930 --> 01:46:00,980
one guy you know it's not like he gets

2000
01:45:59,239 --> 01:46:05,869
to go there and change the whole thing

2001
01:46:00,979 --> 01:46:08,989
or whatever so I don't know what will

2002
01:46:05,869 --> 01:46:10,760
become of it but it seems good you know

2003
01:46:08,989 --> 01:46:16,369
it seems like it could have a positive

2004
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:17,989
positive impact right if the parentheses

2005
01:46:16,369 --> 01:46:21,079
around the return values for debugging

2006
01:46:17,989 --> 01:46:24,099
or just a habit just to have it it

2007
01:46:21,079 --> 01:46:24,100
doesn't do anything

2008
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:36,260
so you're talking about this if you

2009
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:39,409
remove those parentheses nothing would

2010
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:40,610
change at all like any at all like

2011
01:46:39,409 --> 01:46:43,939
anywhere

2012
01:46:40,609 --> 01:46:52,579
I just always got used to reading it

2013
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:54,739
that way and I don't remember why yeah I

2014
01:46:52,579 --> 01:46:57,470
don't know I mean technically there is a

2015
01:46:54,739 --> 01:46:59,750
thing that makes a difference here which

2016
01:46:57,470 --> 01:47:02,510
is that if found task was a macro that

2017
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:07,789
included a semicolon this would make

2018
01:47:02,510 --> 01:47:12,050
sure that you got an error so there is

2019
01:47:07,789 --> 01:47:18,470
one safety reason why you might want to

2020
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:21,340
do that but I don't know that I've ever

2021
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:25,850
really relied on that to catch bugs so

2022
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:28,220
I'm doing it out of habit there I guess

2023
01:47:25,850 --> 01:47:29,930
is a reason you might want to do it but

2024
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:34,970
I wouldn't consider that reason

2025
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:37,579
particularly worthwhile because the

2026
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:41,750
compiler should most compilers will give

2027
01:47:37,579 --> 01:47:47,029
you an unreachable code warning in in

2028
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:48,859
release in optimize builds so chances

2029
01:47:47,029 --> 01:47:50,840
are you would eventually find it anyway

2030
01:47:48,859 --> 01:47:52,069
a debug maybe a debug build wouldn't

2031
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:55,279
tell you because it didn't do dead code

2032
01:47:52,069 --> 01:47:57,439
elimination or something but but a

2033
01:47:55,279 --> 01:47:59,300
release mode build almost certainly

2034
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:01,699
would find would realize that you had

2035
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:03,380
something after a hard return and it

2036
01:48:01,699 --> 01:48:06,229
would tell you so I don't think you

2037
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:09,440
would yeah I really don't think it's a

2038
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:13,429
much of an issue is it a good idea to

2039
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:16,189
use events you got to give me more

2040
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:20,720
context than that I mean yeah events are

2041
01:48:16,189 --> 01:48:22,489
a tool right there um it's like asking

2042
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:25,250
is it a good idea to use the

2043
01:48:22,489 --> 01:48:29,899
cross-product I for what right like I

2044
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:32,930
mean I don't know so events are useful

2045
01:48:29,899 --> 01:48:35,989
for certain circumstances and not useful

2046
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:38,360
in others if you need to be able to

2047
01:48:35,989 --> 01:48:40,909
serialize a set of things across

2048
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:42,829
multiple threads events are very useful

2049
01:48:40,909 --> 01:48:44,689
or distribute things across multiple

2050
01:48:42,829 --> 01:48:46,279
threads over useful you

2051
01:48:44,689 --> 01:48:48,500
you need to break up a control flow

2052
01:48:46,279 --> 01:48:52,488
pattern to avoid using a callback events

2053
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:54,500
are very useful if you're just spamming

2054
01:48:52,488 --> 01:48:55,759
in an event system for no reason and you

2055
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:58,430
could have just called a function that's

2056
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:03,860
kind of dumb so there's you know there's

2057
01:48:58,430 --> 01:49:05,329
a lot of different there's there's a lot

2058
01:49:03,859 --> 01:49:07,189
of different scenarios there and I

2059
01:49:05,329 --> 01:49:09,109
wouldn't say that you can just say

2060
01:49:07,189 --> 01:49:11,719
events good bad right you have to have

2061
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:13,909
some idea of like what you know what was

2062
01:49:11,719 --> 01:49:16,730
the reason and what are you trying to

2063
01:49:13,909 --> 01:49:23,029
solve does an event make sense here

2064
01:49:16,729 --> 01:49:24,289
right are we gonna see the new art

2065
01:49:23,029 --> 01:49:25,939
assets soon

2066
01:49:24,289 --> 01:49:28,130
today was exciting I can't wait for will

2067
01:49:25,939 --> 01:49:29,899
join should be interesting um I don't

2068
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:33,560
know like we'll get like everything else

2069
01:49:29,899 --> 01:49:34,939
I get to it when I get to it off topic

2070
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:36,680
if you run out other questions and see

2071
01:49:34,939 --> 01:49:40,250
is there a way to make something similar

2072
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:44,600
to function overloading I don't know I'm

2073
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:47,869
sorry I don't use straight C so I don't

2074
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:50,120
keep up with the C spec much the C spec

2075
01:49:47,869 --> 01:49:54,130
has changed considerably since I learned

2076
01:49:50,119 --> 01:49:57,769
it I mean I learned it in the 80s and

2077
01:49:54,130 --> 01:50:00,050
the C spec has been revised heavily

2078
01:49:57,770 --> 01:50:01,699
since then so whether there's something

2079
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:02,930
you can do nowadays that's similar to

2080
01:50:01,698 --> 01:50:07,698
function overloading I don't know I

2081
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:08,869
don't think so but there might be but

2082
01:50:07,698 --> 01:50:12,669
I'm the wrong one to ask because I

2083
01:50:08,869 --> 01:50:12,670
really don't keep up with it enough I

2084
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:18,770
read somewhere you can pound to find

2085
01:50:16,909 --> 01:50:25,238
return and log all your returns that

2086
01:50:18,770 --> 01:50:25,239
happen sure you can certainly do that

2087
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:35,880
what do I think of golang I have never

2088
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:35,880
used Galang so I don't know

2089
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:52,859
just as a side note on the Nvidia Fiasco

2090
01:50:49,469 --> 01:50:55,139
you had I found that in my case I can

2091
01:50:52,859 --> 01:50:59,279
get inside rabbits to crash in the same

2092
01:50:55,139 --> 01:51:04,380
way if I use raw input to get ps4

2093
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:06,179
controller data really as soon as I

2094
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:09,328
remove the call that registers raw input

2095
01:51:06,179 --> 01:51:11,940
controllers and site works any idea on

2096
01:51:09,328 --> 01:51:13,649
why that could happen maybe insight is

2097
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:21,738
using something for intercepting user

2098
01:51:13,649 --> 01:51:24,779
input so I guess my question would be

2099
01:51:21,738 --> 01:51:28,109
does it matter what raw input

2100
01:51:24,779 --> 01:51:30,899
controllers you register or not if any

2101
01:51:28,109 --> 01:51:33,598
raw input registration causes it to

2102
01:51:30,899 --> 01:51:36,049
happen then I think you're on to

2103
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:39,150
something there if it's only

2104
01:51:36,050 --> 01:51:41,520
registration of the ps4 controller that

2105
01:51:39,149 --> 01:51:43,288
caused it to crash I might ask whether

2106
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:45,599
you're sure you don't have some other

2107
01:51:43,288 --> 01:51:47,819
dependency further down the line based

2108
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:49,920
on the ps4 controller registration that

2109
01:51:47,819 --> 01:51:53,880
might be causing it because it doesn't

2110
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:57,210
seem like they would crash on a specific

2111
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:59,880
hid registration but maybe I'm wrong

2112
01:51:57,210 --> 01:52:02,309
about that I mean obviously they could

2113
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:08,279
but it just seems unlikely it seems less

2114
01:52:02,309 --> 01:52:09,449
likely I know you did a video on trip

2115
01:52:08,279 --> 01:52:12,149
relation do you know of any good

2116
01:52:09,448 --> 01:52:14,868
resources for cubic baselines what do

2117
01:52:12,149 --> 01:52:17,189
you want to know about cubic b-splines

2118
01:52:14,868 --> 01:52:21,859
you just want to kind of get better at

2119
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:27,658
understanding how these mines work or I

2120
01:52:21,859 --> 01:52:29,420
mean I guess I couldn't tell you off the

2121
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:34,729
top of my head that there's any

2122
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:34,730
particularly great B spline reference

2123
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:37,939
[Music]

2124
01:52:47,029 --> 01:52:53,880
yeah I don't really have anything else

2125
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:57,590
to top my head sorry

2126
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:59,998
I mean be splines and and Bezier curves

2127
01:52:57,590 --> 01:53:04,559
cubic B splines and cubic Bezier curves

2128
01:52:59,998 --> 01:53:06,688
are the same curve a B spline it just

2129
01:53:04,559 --> 01:53:11,820
has baked the parameters such that the

2130
01:53:06,689 --> 01:53:16,800
tangents of the tangent of sequential

2131
01:53:11,819 --> 01:53:18,808
bezzie as line up that's all a B spline

2132
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:21,689
is just pre solving the equations so

2133
01:53:18,809 --> 01:53:25,260
that instead of specifying two endpoints

2134
01:53:21,689 --> 01:53:28,229
and two tangents you just specify points

2135
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:30,530
and each point is the tangent of the

2136
01:53:28,229 --> 01:53:33,719
next point point right like you you

2137
01:53:30,529 --> 01:53:37,078
already say that this whole curves gonna

2138
01:53:33,719 --> 01:53:39,569
be continuous so every point implies the

2139
01:53:37,078 --> 01:53:40,679
tangent for the next point right or the

2140
01:53:39,569 --> 01:53:42,889
previous point however you want to look

2141
01:53:40,679 --> 01:53:42,889
at that

2142
01:53:43,498 --> 01:53:49,498
so I don't know of anything offhand but

2143
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:51,630
there's no other magic to it right it's

2144
01:53:49,498 --> 01:53:53,038
not like a b-spline is a different type

2145
01:53:51,630 --> 01:53:55,409
of curve it's the same type of curve

2146
01:53:53,038 --> 01:53:58,679
it's just a Bezier curve that's had the

2147
01:53:55,408 --> 01:54:00,509
tangents pre-baked because you want to

2148
01:53:58,679 --> 01:54:04,739
be able to have arbitrary numbers of

2149
01:54:00,510 --> 01:54:07,380
points so instead of specifying two

2150
01:54:04,738 --> 01:54:10,018
endpoints and two tangents and then for

2151
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:12,748
the next curve making the two tangents

2152
01:54:10,019 --> 01:54:16,530
force to be the same length and the same

2153
01:54:12,748 --> 01:54:19,819
direction you just pre say that those

2154
01:54:16,529 --> 01:54:24,469
are derived from the points themselves I

2155
01:54:19,819 --> 01:54:24,469
mean that's that's it

2156
01:54:27,078 --> 01:54:31,399
so I don't know I realize that doesn't

2157
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:33,319
help because if you want a full

2158
01:54:31,399 --> 01:54:34,670
reference and to see how they work you

2159
01:54:33,319 --> 01:54:37,189
work them through and all that obviously

2160
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:41,408
you need more than that basic

2161
01:54:37,189 --> 01:54:43,519
explanation that I just gave but that is

2162
01:54:41,408 --> 01:54:44,988
the first step to understanding them

2163
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:47,449
anyway it's just to realize that all

2164
01:54:44,988 --> 01:54:49,129
those curves are the same they're just

2165
01:54:47,448 --> 01:54:51,529
different ways of specifying the inputs

2166
01:54:49,130 --> 01:54:53,449
so with a Bezier curve you've taken a

2167
01:54:51,529 --> 01:54:55,340
cubic and you said I want to specify it

2168
01:54:53,448 --> 01:54:57,469
by two endpoints or two tangents with a

2169
01:54:55,340 --> 01:55:00,500
b-spline curve you're saying I want to

2170
01:54:57,469 --> 01:55:03,559
take a series of points and construct

2171
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:05,779
bezier curves out of essentially the

2172
01:55:03,559 --> 01:55:11,779
latticework of those curves going

2173
01:55:05,779 --> 01:55:13,809
forwards and that's all it really is you

2174
01:55:11,779 --> 01:55:13,809
know

2175
01:55:25,770 --> 01:55:29,100
I shouldn't really say going forwards

2176
01:55:27,449 --> 01:55:32,279
because there's actually two ways of

2177
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:34,079
constructing a b-spline you can have

2178
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:36,750
forward-looking not or backwards looking

2179
01:55:34,079 --> 01:55:40,829
not again this is like getting into the

2180
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:43,380
weeds and whatever but if you imagine

2181
01:55:40,829 --> 01:55:45,449
taking a series of points and you want

2182
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:50,850
to construct a Bezier out of them well

2183
01:55:45,449 --> 01:55:52,710
let me just it's been a while so I

2184
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:55,079
apologize if I get something wrong here

2185
01:55:52,710 --> 01:55:58,230
because I just I worked with these a lot

2186
01:55:55,079 --> 01:56:05,960
in the old days I don't work with them

2187
01:55:58,229 --> 01:56:09,389
much today so a Bezier curve right is

2188
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:13,170
going to take four points and it's going

2189
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:15,869
to draw a curve between them by using

2190
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:20,069
these as the tangents and these is the

2191
01:56:15,869 --> 01:56:24,720
end points right so you essentially have

2192
01:56:20,069 --> 01:56:30,389
like an end point and end point and then

2193
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:32,369
two tangent points right and there's

2194
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:33,780
your curve you tweak where these are and

2195
01:56:32,369 --> 01:56:35,369
you change the shape of the curve but it

2196
01:56:33,779 --> 01:56:36,689
always gonna hit these two you change

2197
01:56:35,369 --> 01:56:39,779
where these are and that changes where

2198
01:56:36,689 --> 01:56:42,269
the curve like starts and ends right so

2199
01:56:39,779 --> 01:56:44,670
that's a Bezier curve the problem with a

2200
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:47,130
busy curve problem I mean it's not

2201
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:51,569
problem but it's just aspect of it is

2202
01:56:47,130 --> 01:56:55,199
you get one curve right it's a cubic in

2203
01:56:51,569 --> 01:56:57,119
this case right if it was a Bezier

2204
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:58,289
curves can be arbitrary degree and what

2205
01:56:57,119 --> 01:57:00,479
that means is that they can have an

2206
01:56:58,289 --> 01:57:07,519
arbitrary number of loops in them right

2207
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:11,909
so if I have a zeroth-order bezzie a

2208
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:12,460
right all of a sudden we're talking

2209
01:57:11,909 --> 01:57:15,568
about

2210
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:15,569
[Music]

2211
01:57:16,939 --> 01:57:21,489
curves there's so much to talk about

2212
01:57:18,619 --> 01:57:24,260
with curves I should probably stop but

2213
01:57:21,489 --> 01:57:26,179
so if you're if you're gonna talk about

2214
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,170
a curve order then essentially what

2215
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:28,820
you're talking about

2216
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:30,109
it all gets just gets back to

2217
01:57:28,819 --> 01:57:32,420
polynomials

2218
01:57:30,109 --> 01:57:35,420
you know from math class right oh let me

2219
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:37,970
use it the standard notation here you

2220
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:40,159
know from math class that essentially

2221
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:42,560
you've got different degrees of

2222
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:44,389
polynomial right so if I have a function

2223
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:46,520
and there's a tea that I'm passing into

2224
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:48,230
the function then I can have a lot of

2225
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:50,780
different characteristics of an equation

2226
01:57:48,229 --> 01:57:52,939
if I want to have a zeroth order one

2227
01:57:50,779 --> 01:57:55,250
then it's just a constant it's like f of

2228
01:57:52,939 --> 01:57:56,960
C equals five what does that mean it

2229
01:57:55,250 --> 01:58:00,170
means that T is actually irrelevant

2230
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:02,720
right it's not really a function of T T

2231
01:58:00,170 --> 01:58:03,289
doesn't appear its T to the zero with

2232
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:05,720
power

2233
01:58:03,289 --> 01:58:09,649
it's five T to the 0 and T to the zero

2234
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:11,390
is one so it's just tea anything equals

2235
01:58:09,649 --> 01:58:13,969
five doesn't matter I didn't pass in any

2236
01:58:11,390 --> 01:58:25,220
number and I get back five right that's

2237
01:58:13,970 --> 01:58:27,940
zeroth order right first order I come in

2238
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:33,770
here and I say all right that's five T

2239
01:58:27,939 --> 01:58:40,129
plus we'll use something else for T 0 +

2240
01:58:33,770 --> 01:58:42,760
5 0 same term here but now we've added

2241
01:58:40,130 --> 01:58:46,010
another one and that's linear in T right

2242
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:50,119
T is to the first power it means that as

2243
01:58:46,010 --> 01:58:53,420
I increase T I get a smooth even line

2244
01:58:50,119 --> 01:58:55,819
increase at this slope you know for this

2245
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:57,590
this part of the parameter right so I

2246
01:58:55,819 --> 01:59:00,799
went from something and if i graph these

2247
01:58:57,590 --> 01:59:02,720
I get that right just a line constant

2248
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:05,180
line here I've got something looks like

2249
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:08,150
that right or it can go downward either

2250
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:10,640
way second order now I've got F of T

2251
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:12,979
equals you know 3t squared or maybe

2252
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:18,740
whatever you want like seven T squared

2253
01:59:12,979 --> 01:59:20,839
plus 4 T 1 plus 5 T 0 right and that's a

2254
01:59:18,739 --> 01:59:22,639
parabola right can be like that can be

2255
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:25,369
like that something like this right

2256
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:26,780
and then I got finally that third order

2257
01:59:25,369 --> 01:59:28,369
which is the one we're talking about

2258
01:59:26,779 --> 01:59:30,819
here which is cubic these can keep going

2259
01:59:28,369 --> 01:59:32,380
on but you know cubics were what people

2260
01:59:30,819 --> 01:59:36,460
normally use probably since what you

2261
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:39,609
were asking about so I got to T to the

2262
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:42,909
third plus 72 the second plus 4 to the

2263
01:59:39,609 --> 01:59:46,000
first plus 5 to 0 right or whatever and

2264
01:59:42,909 --> 01:59:49,710
that's a cubic curve right so that's

2265
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:56,109
something that looks anything like this

2266
01:59:49,710 --> 02:00:00,760
right Senate cetera I should write this

2267
01:59:56,109 --> 02:00:03,639
a little bit differently right and each

2268
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:06,400
one of these can include a shape of the

2269
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:09,400
one below them right so if I just set

2270
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:11,409
these parameters as I reduce the squared

2271
02:00:09,399 --> 02:00:13,089
parameter I get closer to a line as I

2272
02:00:11,409 --> 02:00:17,590
reduce the line parameter I get closer

2273
02:00:13,090 --> 02:00:21,750
to a constant right so a cubic because a

2274
02:00:17,590 --> 02:00:24,940
cubic can have a wiggle in it right a

2275
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:27,579
cubic can actually change direction in

2276
02:00:24,939 --> 02:00:29,710
and of itself right so a bezier curve

2277
02:00:27,579 --> 02:00:31,989
and all that garbage was just to explain

2278
02:00:29,710 --> 02:00:33,340
to you like oh hey if I set one tangent

2279
02:00:31,989 --> 02:00:34,630
going this way one tangent going that

2280
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:37,420
way I would have a curve that looks like

2281
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:41,289
that right but it can only have one bend

2282
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:42,609
in it that's all it can have so what you

2283
02:00:41,289 --> 02:00:44,560
end up with is if you want to start to

2284
02:00:42,609 --> 02:00:46,839
fit things that are more complicated

2285
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:49,390
right let's say I want to be able to do

2286
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:51,220
a shape that looks like this well you

2287
02:00:49,390 --> 02:00:53,220
know busy he's not going to cut it it's

2288
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:56,050
got too many you know no matter how

2289
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:59,530
imprecisely I fit this I'm never even

2290
02:00:56,050 --> 02:01:02,470
gonna get remotely close even that you

2291
02:00:59,529 --> 02:01:04,509
know which is all I could do with a

2292
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:06,310
cubic is just not gonna work right

2293
02:01:04,510 --> 02:01:08,949
I need a been here and have been here

2294
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:11,620
and a bent here right so I need more and

2295
02:01:08,949 --> 02:01:13,239
so the thing that you do with bezzie a

2296
02:01:11,619 --> 02:01:17,430
is like if you're Adobe Illustrator or

2297
02:01:13,239 --> 02:01:17,429
something like this is you line them up

2298
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:23,970
oops

2299
02:01:24,359 --> 02:01:29,489
so here's my first busy a and here's my

2300
02:01:27,059 --> 02:01:32,279
second busy a and what I do is I lock

2301
02:01:29,488 --> 02:01:34,468
the two tangents so I make this and this

2302
02:01:32,279 --> 02:01:36,179
be complimentary to each other so that

2303
02:01:34,469 --> 02:01:41,279
when the curve passes through this point

2304
02:01:36,179 --> 02:01:44,550
it is smooth right so I make this be the

2305
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:46,319
negative of this so that's how you daisy

2306
02:01:44,550 --> 02:01:48,269
chain bezzie ace together to make a

2307
02:01:46,319 --> 02:01:49,858
longer curves you just do Bessie a and

2308
02:01:48,269 --> 02:01:51,869
then the next as ei locks the two

2309
02:01:49,859 --> 02:01:58,399
tangent handles the so basically you

2310
02:01:51,868 --> 02:02:01,889
know if this is p0 p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6

2311
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:06,149
what I say is all right the first bezzie

2312
02:02:01,889 --> 02:02:08,458
a is p0 p1 p2 p3 the next busy a instead

2313
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:11,820
of starting at p4 it starts at p3 so I

2314
02:02:08,458 --> 02:02:16,559
duplicate the end point and then p4 is

2315
02:02:11,819 --> 02:02:20,128
equal to p3 plus whatever the negative

2316
02:02:16,559 --> 02:02:23,159
is of p2 - Pete right that this this

2317
02:02:20,128 --> 02:02:26,729
this vector here I set this point to be

2318
02:02:23,158 --> 02:02:29,069
equal to that displacement right so my

2319
02:02:26,729 --> 02:02:30,599
p4 you know is going to be locked

2320
02:02:29,069 --> 02:02:33,088
instead of it being whatever you want to

2321
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:42,149
be it's going to be locked and say that

2322
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:43,800
p4 equals P 3 oops - or we can do plus

2323
02:02:42,149 --> 02:02:46,050
doesn't matter which one we want to I

2324
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:50,788
want to go in this direction here right

2325
02:02:46,050 --> 02:02:54,649
so I'm gonna say whatever p3 is minus p2

2326
02:02:50,788 --> 02:02:54,648
there right

2327
02:02:58,368 --> 02:03:10,969
don't do that right we're on transfers

2328
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:14,899
so it's p4 equals P three plus P 2 minus

2329
02:03:10,969 --> 02:03:19,130
P 3 minus P 2 yeah yeah so effectively

2330
02:03:14,899 --> 02:03:22,098
we just get to P 3 minus P 2 that's our

2331
02:03:19,130 --> 02:03:25,190
new point and so P 4 is now not free

2332
02:03:22,099 --> 02:03:26,510
right so not only is there not another

2333
02:03:25,189 --> 02:03:27,738
point to start the curve because we're

2334
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:29,960
saying they started into the same place

2335
02:03:27,738 --> 02:03:32,209
but we also prescribed P 4 so there

2336
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:35,500
really is no P 4 it's just a fan fantasy

2337
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:38,840
right makes sense

2338
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:39,979
great ok and furthermore Adobe

2339
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:42,940
Illustrator does some other stuff like

2340
02:03:39,979 --> 02:03:45,709
if you want to have a discontinuity here

2341
02:03:42,939 --> 02:03:47,899
so they meet up but they don't have the

2342
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:50,510
same derivative then you let P 4 be

2343
02:03:47,899 --> 02:03:53,868
specified that's called a corner right

2344
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:56,810
in in their parlance right Bezier corner

2345
02:03:53,868 --> 02:03:58,309
and furthermore you can also say that

2346
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:59,960
well I want the direction to be the same

2347
02:03:58,310 --> 02:04:01,880
that the length can change and that's

2348
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:03,170
saying that the second derivative won't

2349
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:08,659
be give this continuous right because

2350
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:10,880
remember this is a cubic you know so

2351
02:04:08,658 --> 02:04:20,059
it's got different derivatives right

2352
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:22,940
there's a there's zeroth order just

2353
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:24,830
continuous and if it's zeroth or

2354
02:04:22,939 --> 02:04:28,219
discontinuous then we're not even lining

2355
02:04:24,829 --> 02:04:30,710
up the points that's one busy a here one

2356
02:04:28,219 --> 02:04:33,198
busy a here and the and there's a gap

2357
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:35,300
right so it's discontinuous all the way

2358
02:04:33,198 --> 02:04:38,118
up to its actual location there's

2359
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:44,420
first-order discontinuous that's if you

2360
02:04:38,118 --> 02:04:46,339
meet these two points right so I want

2361
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:48,109
these two points to join so there's only

2362
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:50,679
so it's always gonna meet it's gonna be

2363
02:04:48,109 --> 02:04:53,809
a continuous curve in terms of visually

2364
02:04:50,679 --> 02:04:55,368
but I don't care if this points in the

2365
02:04:53,810 --> 02:04:58,219
same direction so instead of looking

2366
02:04:55,368 --> 02:05:00,559
like that maybe it looks like that right

2367
02:04:58,219 --> 02:05:03,710
so when I actually draw the curve I get

2368
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:06,080
a hard bend there these two parts are

2369
02:05:03,710 --> 02:05:09,829
fully continuous but this right here has

2370
02:05:06,079 --> 02:05:11,409
a kink right finally there's

2371
02:05:09,829 --> 02:05:14,500
second-order

2372
02:05:11,409 --> 02:05:16,899
discontinuous now I'm gonna write that

2373
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:19,180
and that's the acceleration along the

2374
02:05:16,899 --> 02:05:21,759
curve so that means it will point in the

2375
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:24,250
same direction but the rate of curvature

2376
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:26,500
will change at that point so rather than

2377
02:05:24,250 --> 02:05:29,920
looking smooth like that it will look

2378
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:32,409
more like that so it'll have it'll have

2379
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:36,489
a kink but the kink won't be visible at

2380
02:05:32,409 --> 02:05:38,739
it as a instantaneous direction change

2381
02:05:36,489 --> 02:05:40,809
it'll just start curving much more

2382
02:05:38,739 --> 02:05:45,250
quickly and then there's third order

2383
02:05:40,810 --> 02:05:48,490
continuous third order discontinuous

2384
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:50,859
which is irrelevant for the purposes of

2385
02:05:48,489 --> 02:05:53,260
cubic splines because there is no fourth

2386
02:05:50,859 --> 02:05:54,519
term so you can't be third order

2387
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:58,570
discontinuous because there isn't

2388
02:05:54,520 --> 02:06:09,670
anything past there right if that makes

2389
02:05:58,569 --> 02:06:10,689
sense so all of that is my way of trying

2390
02:06:09,670 --> 02:06:12,699
to lay the groundwork for you to

2391
02:06:10,689 --> 02:06:17,079
understand what a b-spline curve is what

2392
02:06:12,699 --> 02:06:19,630
a b-spline curve is is solving pre

2393
02:06:17,079 --> 02:06:21,670
solving for how you want to interpret

2394
02:06:19,630 --> 02:06:24,430
your points such that a set of points

2395
02:06:21,670 --> 02:06:27,010
passed in is continuous everywhere on

2396
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:30,940
all degrees so there are no

2397
02:06:27,010 --> 02:06:32,650
discontinuities at all it is as if you

2398
02:06:30,939 --> 02:06:35,139
did the thing I said here where you lock

2399
02:06:32,649 --> 02:06:37,119
the tangents their direction and their

2400
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:38,890
length so that they always flow

2401
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:43,359
perfectly three order continuous the

2402
02:06:38,890 --> 02:06:46,660
whole way and the way this works is it

2403
02:06:43,359 --> 02:06:48,729
basically mix a bezzie a more-or-less

2404
02:06:46,659 --> 02:06:51,130
it's not exactly that way but it

2405
02:06:48,729 --> 02:06:54,299
basically makes a bezel bezzie a out of

2406
02:06:51,130 --> 02:06:57,819
four points and starch the interpolation

2407
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:59,500
but only goes a quarter of the way so

2408
02:06:57,819 --> 02:07:01,539
you can imagine it sort of starting to

2409
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:02,710
go like well maybe I should say a third

2410
02:07:01,539 --> 02:07:05,829
of the way I don't know how you look at

2411
02:07:02,710 --> 02:07:08,560
it we start going like this but as we

2412
02:07:05,829 --> 02:07:12,819
get to here we then change to

2413
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:18,130
interpreting the curve over the next

2414
02:07:12,819 --> 02:07:21,729
four points right and then we use the

2415
02:07:18,130 --> 02:07:24,560
next four points and so rather than ever

2416
02:07:21,729 --> 02:07:27,229
hitting a point we always move the

2417
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:32,690
framework for words so the only point we

2418
02:07:27,229 --> 02:07:33,799
ever hit is the first point or the last

2419
02:07:32,689 --> 02:07:35,629
point depending on whether you do

2420
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:38,000
trailing not you can do it the other way

2421
02:07:35,630 --> 02:07:40,520
you can say we start with four points

2422
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:44,000
behind us there's two different ways to

2423
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:46,880
do it right and so Abby's flying

2424
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,979
formulation is just that it's moving the

2425
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:51,710
frame of reference before you ever get

2426
02:07:48,979 --> 02:07:56,419
to one of the points so you are always

2427
02:07:51,710 --> 02:07:58,689
off of the framework the whole way that

2428
02:07:56,420 --> 02:07:58,690
help

2429
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:08,910
I really like the look of the lighting

2430
02:08:07,859 --> 02:08:10,259
you've implemented will the system be

2431
02:08:08,909 --> 02:08:12,210
working for any light points I guess the

2432
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:14,880
system right now does not require you to

2433
02:08:12,210 --> 02:08:17,970
say what's a light and what's not it

2434
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:20,039
it's just takes all of the light in the

2435
02:08:17,970 --> 02:08:21,869
scene and convex it so you can have as

2436
02:08:20,039 --> 02:08:24,630
many lights or as few lights as you want

2437
02:08:21,869 --> 02:08:27,119
it doesn't care it's not like a normal

2438
02:08:24,630 --> 02:08:29,340
3d engine lighting where you have to say

2439
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:32,010
this is a light this is not it doesn't

2440
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:33,810
work that way it just basically says

2441
02:08:32,010 --> 02:08:37,340
look everything's a light source in

2442
02:08:33,810 --> 02:08:37,340
their receptacle and off we go

2443
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:44,100
long boolean so if I on the same page I

2444
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:45,480
wanted to make sure that two rooms never

2445
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:47,250
touch each other we would still use

2446
02:08:45,479 --> 02:08:48,679
connect bus passing a flag of some kind

2447
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:50,939
or would you do something else I

2448
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:51,960
probably wouldn't quite have live that

2449
02:08:50,939 --> 02:08:53,489
way it might be a little that way

2450
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:54,810
internally but I would probably have two

2451
02:08:53,489 --> 02:08:56,849
different functions just so it's clear

2452
02:08:54,810 --> 02:08:58,289
when you look at like repel or something

2453
02:08:56,850 --> 02:09:00,360
or I don't know like don't connect I'm

2454
02:08:58,289 --> 02:09:04,769
not sure but I don't think we need to

2455
02:09:00,359 --> 02:09:06,359
say much about that because I don't know

2456
02:09:04,770 --> 02:09:08,790
that we're gonna care I don't know if we

2457
02:09:06,359 --> 02:09:11,759
care if two rooms abut or not because I

2458
02:09:08,789 --> 02:09:13,050
connect will say whether there's a door

2459
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:14,520
between them or not as long as I don't

2460
02:09:13,050 --> 02:09:17,610
say put a door here there should be a

2461
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:19,050
wall anyway even if they happen to line

2462
02:09:17,609 --> 02:09:22,170
up next to each other it wouldn't

2463
02:09:19,050 --> 02:09:23,520
actually put any way to get there so I

2464
02:09:22,170 --> 02:09:24,779
don't know that will necessarily care

2465
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:26,520
about keeping them farther away from

2466
02:09:24,779 --> 02:09:28,529
each other but we could we can put in a

2467
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:29,970
repel thing that's like keep these at

2468
02:09:28,529 --> 02:09:32,149
least this far away from each other or

2469
02:09:29,970 --> 02:09:32,150
something

2470
02:09:36,829 --> 02:09:39,890
are there any plans to write tools to

2471
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:41,570
author rooms or will everything be done

2472
02:09:39,890 --> 02:09:44,750
in code everything we've done in code

2473
02:09:41,569 --> 02:09:46,579
it's a fully procedural game so we won't

2474
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:49,119
be writing an editor where you place

2475
02:09:46,579 --> 02:09:49,119
stuff

2476
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:56,480
although someone's welcome to do that as

2477
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:58,490
an add-on if they want to write like you

2478
02:09:56,479 --> 02:10:01,549
can you've pretty much got everything

2479
02:09:58,489 --> 02:10:03,050
you need for it right because you can

2480
02:10:01,550 --> 02:10:05,090
just use the handmade hero source base

2481
02:10:03,050 --> 02:10:09,470
to make something that displays the

2482
02:10:05,090 --> 02:10:10,760
entities that you put them down right so

2483
02:10:09,470 --> 02:10:12,199
it's not it wouldn't be that hard for

2484
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:15,320
you to add one if you really wanted to

2485
02:10:12,199 --> 02:10:17,739
do so all right I'm gonna wrap it up for

2486
02:10:15,319 --> 02:10:17,739
today

2487
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:31,390
all right thank you everyone for joining

2488
02:10:29,890 --> 02:10:32,590
me for live so the hand made here it's

2489
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:34,660
been a pleasure coding with you as

2490
02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:36,969
always if you would like to follow along

2491
02:10:34,659 --> 02:10:38,710
the series at home you can always go to

2492
02:10:36,969 --> 02:10:40,270
handmade hero Network and pre-order the

2493
02:10:38,710 --> 02:10:41,770
game it comes with a source code and I

2494
02:10:40,270 --> 02:10:43,270
update it every time we finish coding

2495
02:10:41,770 --> 02:10:44,290
here so that you can keep up to date

2496
02:10:43,270 --> 02:10:46,719
with serious and try your own

2497
02:10:44,289 --> 02:10:48,310
experiments for example if you wanted to

2498
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:50,199
start building a little world builder

2499
02:10:48,310 --> 02:10:52,660
editor tool since that's not something

2500
02:10:50,199 --> 02:10:53,949
we're doing you could certainly go try

2501
02:10:52,659 --> 02:10:56,439
doing that yourself and make your own

2502
02:10:53,949 --> 02:10:58,840
little handmade hero worlds to explore

2503
02:10:56,439 --> 02:11:02,079
instead of the generated ones that are

2504
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:03,489
being generated again that's just

2505
02:11:02,079 --> 02:11:06,819
handmade here at Oregon so you need to

2506
02:11:03,488 --> 02:11:08,139
do we also have a bunch of resources you

2507
02:11:06,819 --> 02:11:09,039
can go to there like the episode guide

2508
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:11,560
and so on

2509
02:11:09,039 --> 02:11:13,800
I'll be back here tomorrow so if you

2510
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:16,150

2511
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:17,650
basic pass with me where we're trying to

2512
02:11:16,149 --> 02:11:19,869
just sort of get rudimentary stuff in

2513
02:11:17,649 --> 02:11:21,309
