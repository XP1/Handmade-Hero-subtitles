1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
and welcome to handmade hero show we

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,639
code a complete game live on stream we

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,960
are currently today

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,718
uh doing some cleanup on the collision

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,280
code uh i we we accidentally

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,960
um yet last week we were just trying to

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,480
add some ability to step through like

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,118
diagrams so we could analyze the

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,199
collision system uh when it went wrong

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,839
we accidentally fixed the bug

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,118
uh it turned out we once we had the

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,359
ability to like scrub through things and

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,278
see what was happening it became very uh

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,559
straightforward for us to find the bug

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,238
accidentally uh so we we actually fixed

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,399
it

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,000
uh and that's great but

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,600
um

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,600
i i wasn't totally satisfied with that

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,399
because it was very strange what the bug

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,320
was

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,359
uh it turns out there's like entities in

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,679
our system that are basically having

24
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,960
their they're getting created and they

25
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,399
have sort of

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,359
uh

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,640
rectangles that don't actually have any

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,640
area for

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,679
collision

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,280
and so

31
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,400
that may be fine

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,920
because

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,960
we we do

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,680
want to have that occur

35
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,079
but the problem is we need to

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,040
think about whether or not

37
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,840
we need to make sure that was

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,040
intentional and i think it probably was

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,320
but we need to make sure that that's

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,640
actually smart

41
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,199
maybe we want a bit field for that

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,079
because it's kind of expensive to

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,759
say like is this collision

44
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,599
uh we have to actually compare like

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,959
floating point values and all this crap

46
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,158
to know that there's no collision so we

47
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,519
may not want to do that so we may want

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,719
to add a bit field we had one in there a

49
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,640
long time ago that was like does this

50
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,719
thing collide or not and we decided it

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
was necessary uh but maybe it is

52
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,798
actually is sort of is that

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,680
what should be happening two are these

54
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,280
actually things that don't have

55
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,799
collision or is there a bug in the world

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,000
generator that's generating things that

57
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,960
should have had collision volumes and

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,239
don't

59
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,679
two

60
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,519
uh and three what we would like to do is

61
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,960
even if we find out there's no bugs in

62
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,478
here

63
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,798
what we would like to do

64
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,319
uh is finish up things that need to get

65
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,118
finished up on the collision system such

66
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,919
as

67
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:10,719
re-enabling the ability to move out of

68
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,000
uh starting collisions so if you start

69
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,439
embedded in an object because the

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,639
gameplay code just like moved someone

71
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,919
there or whatever

72
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,159
we want you to be able to get out of

73
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,919
that so we we want that

74
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,479
uh and then the other thing that we want

75
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,719
is the spatial partitioning

76
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,399
to avoid having to test all the entities

77
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,280
in the world when we do collision so

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
when we

79
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,640
when we check for collision

80
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,280
we don't right now right uh we're going

81
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
to

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,239
have to sweep through all like

83
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,319
everything

84
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,200
right we have to sweep through every

85
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,039
entity in the entire uh active set

86
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,318
which is quite a few i mean i don't know

87
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,679
how many it is but it could be on the

88
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,199
order of like 10 000 entities or

89
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,640
something because the active set is

90
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,439
quite large

91
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,518
um

92
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,639
so you know it could be very large it

93
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,239
probably isn't that large right now it's

94
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,399
like a thousand or something or two

95
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,759
thousand

96
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,760
but we're sweeping through all of those

97
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,318
entities for every check of every

98
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,239
collision it which is just ridiculous uh

99
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,839
it's

100
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,560
the game should be running at an

101
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,039
absolute crawl but it's not just because

102
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,479
um processors are so fast

103
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:20,400
so what we want to do is stop that

104
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:22,799
we want to when we um unpack people into

105
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,239
the world we want to actually

106
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,719
now have some idea about where they are

107
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,000
so that we only check entities that are

108
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,400
close by to the one that is moving now

109
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
this doesn't have to be perfect it can

110
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,439
be a fairly loose

111
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,519
boundary right

112
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,280
um but there are some difficulties

113
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,280
involved and it and there are some

114
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,158
decisions we have to make about how we

115
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,000
want this system to work because

116
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,959
we

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,360
when we produce the spatial partition

118
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,438
we will have the situation where as we

119
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,400
then move entities they will move where

120
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,919
they are in the spatial partition

121
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,719
so

122
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:08,479
it's not static like if you remember

123
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,318
look we did exactly this before

124
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,518
with the lighting

125
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,958
we take the current like things that are

126
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,199
within the view

127
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,358
at that time and we build a spatial

128
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,680
partition before we start doing lighting

129
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,478
for looking up ray tracing

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,600
um

131
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,279
and

132
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,360
that was fine

133
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,918
but it it assumed

134
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,879
that you did not have to move things

135
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,279
around

136
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,959
so we knew that we could just like pile

137
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,039
all the stuff in there

138
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,879
and the system could just be optimized

139
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960
for the lookup it doesn't have to be

140
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,639
optimized for moving things

141
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:46,000
this one will be different

142
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,478
in this one we have to have entities be

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,478
able to move

144
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,120
now there's a lot of stuff we can

145
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
consider doing here

146
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,240
um

147
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,240
and

148
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
my assumption is that because this is

149
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,680
running so fast already

150
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,840
that we don't have to be very fancy

151
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,478
because right now we have no spatial

152
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,519
partition and the code's still running

153
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,879
right

154
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:15,839
um so for example uh you know if we if

155
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,839
we open it up here

156
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,720
uh

157
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,199
so let me go ahead and just run the

158
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,400
program

159
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,560
uh and what you can see is uh even in

160
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,239
this circumstance where we're literally

161
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,560
doing ridiculous numbers of collision

162
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,639
checks for like the glove here

163
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,038
um it still runs in in a pretty

164
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,478
reasonable frame rate uh it's not great

165
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:43,519
i don't think like i don't know what the

166
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,279
frame rate is right now but it's

167
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,279
probably not fantastic right um

168
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,399
what's the quick way for that yes it's

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,519
uh it's 30 frames a second

170
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,879
right

171
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,719
um

172
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,399
but honestly like that's not really

173
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,520
significantly lower you can see though

174
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,599
as the collision moves around you see

175
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,758
how it spikes right it's spiking down to

176
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,039
like 15 frames a second

177
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
right

178
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,639
um

179
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,840
so you can kind of see like it has a

180
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,560
really negative

181
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,599
uh impact right so it's running fine but

182
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,439
it's bad and you it will get worse when

183
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,280
there's like several colliders like you

184
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,959
know there's gonna be 10 20

185
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,239
things on the screen at least that will

186
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,079
be undergoing collision right now

187
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,600
there's like only one or maybe there's

188
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,800
another one it depends i don't know if

189
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,080
any of those skull guys are in the

190
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,199
working set right now i don't think they

191
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,199
are

192
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,720
um but you can see why that's a problem

193
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,240
because that's horrible for just one

194
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,680
thing and the reason for that like i

195
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
said is that it's sweeping through

196
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,879
everything

197
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,319
so but the fact that still running at

198
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,639
interactive frame rates means we

199
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,720
probably don't have that much work to do

200
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,478
meaning we don't have to go crazy with

201
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,800
this we can probably just do something

202
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,439
fairly straightforward and not be in too

203
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,000
much trouble right

204
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,879
um so i'm guessing that just a simple

205
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,598
grid

206
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,120
uh like a simple voxel where we just can

207
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,719
move things around the voxel as

208
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,800
necessary is going to be all that we

209
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,400
really need um and so uh i probably will

210
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,360
just do something like that

211
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,038
but if we were seeing uh much like if

212
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,520
this were running at one frame a second

213
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,959
generally uh i would i would be more

214
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,519
worried and maybe would be trying to do

215
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:20,000
something more aggressive right

216
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,240
um so yeah and you can see there right

217
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,079
like so here's an example

218
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,478
i think

219
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:29,478
of these getting stuck

220
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,478
um

221
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,960
can i

222
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,960
look at this

223
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,240
here's an example you can see of these

224
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,598
objects getting getting stuck right

225
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,840
which is what we would expect to have

226
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,598
happen now because right now we allow

227
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,399
things to be placed

228
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,399
in ways that

229
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,399
will make them interpenetrate so that's

230
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,879
not actually strange uh but

231
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,359
one thing i do wonder a little bit

232
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,039
is why it allowed these these are two

233
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,800
colliding objects so i'm not quite sure

234
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,360
why they were allowed to do this in the

235
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,360
first place

236
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,680
but like i said we don't really right

237
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,279
now try to guarantee that meaning we

238
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,560
don't really try to guarantee that

239
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,318
things don't end slightly

240
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
interpenetrating after they've both

241
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,800
moved

242
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,639
um

243
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
like our refinement step is not

244
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,439
particularly careful about that so i

245
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,599
could also believe that this was fine

246
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,599
the point is uh

247
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,879
yeah you can see right here right

248
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,800
um

249
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,600
it's gotten into a situation where it's

250
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,919
like entirely colliding on step one

251
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,920
you know what i'm saying

252
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,639
here is the step before that let's just

253
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,639
take a quick look at it

254
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
so you can see that it allowed it to be

255
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,720
placed there it allowed this guy to be

256
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,560
placed there you know what the other

257
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,639
thing is we kind of need we need some

258
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,958
way to pick who we're looking at because

259
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,720
this guy moved second so he's the one

260
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,239
who was allowed to move into that

261
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,600
placement

262
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,919
right

263
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
um

264
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
so yeah

265
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:20,879
but

266
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
uh

267
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,679
i assume basically just what's going on

268
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,759
here is that we don't really require any

269
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,159
kind of symmetric

270
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,159
checking

271
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:40,480
so because these objects move

272
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,480
um themselves

273
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,079
i'm not sure there's really anything

274
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,599
smarter we can do let me let me try to

275
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,120
think about this for a second so when

276
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,440
two objects move

277
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,200
right now we do we move them in order

278
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
and we don't really do anything in

279
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,600
particular to try to ensure that they're

280
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,799
not going to interpenetrate

281
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,839
we could

282
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,838
so one thing we could do

283
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,560
is always check

284
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,239
only the lower

285
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,479
entity

286
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
so

287
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,519
i know what i'm saying it sounds pretty

288
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,680
weird but

289
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,440
collision checks are symmetric in the

290
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,799
sense that when we ask when two objects

291
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,640
collide or not

292
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,639
that's not a different question

293
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,199
semantically meaning

294
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,639
if i have two objects a and b and i ask

295
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,839
whether they collide

296
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:36,319
i don't semantically

297
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,279
want that to be directional i don't want

298
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,079
the answer to does a collide with b to

299
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,120
be different from does b collide with a

300
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,319
right

301
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,320
like that's not what i actually want

302
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:59,278
so what's interesting about that

303
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,320
is it means that maybe i should think

304
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,439
about the way the collider works

305
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,519
because right now that's not what

306
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,600
happens right now what happens is when

307
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,399
we do collision moves we are thinking

308
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,399
about one object and we ask if that

309
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,240
object could be placed at certain points

310
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,078
in the world

311
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,320
and have the collision query say that it

312
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,239
will not collide with a different object

313
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,959
right

314
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,959
and i'm not sure

315
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,399
no i can guarantee that that's not

316
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,399
correct

317
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,759
uh commutatively right

318
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,919
because

319
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,278
when you check the two collisions you're

320
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,159
checking the

321
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,200
the

322
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:50,240
corner points for one of the objects

323
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,759
against only this the actual position of

324
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
the other object

325
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,000
right

326
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,799
and so i think what you probably want to

327
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,078
do

328
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,719
instead

329
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:05,599
is you want to check to see whether or

330
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,079
not the other objects like you want to

331
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,399
pick one of the objects and say

332
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:13,120
uh if we were you i mean i guess you

333
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,120
could do it either way you could say we

334
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
want to check to see whether we collide

335
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,959
at the points or whether the other

336
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,120
object collides at the points right

337
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,958
um or you could always just pick the

338
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,519
lower object so you could say like look

339
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,599
whoever has a lower entity id it's just

340
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,240
a tiebreaker arbitrary tiebreaker

341
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,120
whoever has the lower entity id we check

342
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,278
their collision voxel

343
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,679
and we make sure that they are not

344
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:42,679
colliding in that case right

345
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,679
um

346
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,278
so

347
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,399
this is an interesting question

348
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,078
i feel like there's probably a smart

349
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,639
answer here but i've never really

350
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,638
thought about it before

351
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,639
there's a lot of ways that come to mind

352
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,519
so the simplest way that i can think of

353
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,240
actually is you don't bother doing that

354
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,278
um the simplest way i can think of is

355
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,278
actually just that you

356
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,198
you take

357
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,679
the point

358
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,439
where the entity is and you

359
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,159
snap it to the center of the voxel

360
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,160
before checking

361
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,120
that

362
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,039
might

363
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,679
be preferable

364
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,679
because then you're always asking the

365
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,559
same question

366
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,399
and i'm not sure that you need to be any

367
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:44,119
fancier than that

368
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,120
to make this work

369
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:51,599
so so i might i might

370
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,920
um well you know what first let me make

371
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,519
sure that this happens often it should

372
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,360
when you have two colliding objects this

373
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,679
should happen like all the time right

374
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,199
now

375
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,120
um

376
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,639
let me see

377
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,399
just to make sure

378
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,680
that this is something that can happen

379
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,759
often

380
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,519
and assuming that it is

381
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,000
i would like to propose a fix for that

382
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,159
which we can do right now again i'm the

383
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,078
reason i'm doing this before because the

384
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,319
unembed code would have just fixed that

385
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,759
problem but i'd rather just never have

386
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,639
that problem to begin with in the

387
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,039
collision

388
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
system first and if i fix the unembed

389
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,838
code

390
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,959
then i i won't be able to fix it because

391
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,920
i won't see it happen so there i think

392
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,119
that

393
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,319
is was it

394
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,560
right

395
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,000
um

396
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,000
that was the system detecting that fact

397
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,800
it's not as easy as i would like like it

398
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,799
does take a little while to make this

399
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,039
happen like i'm able to kind of like

400
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,838
muck around

401
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,879
an uncomfortably large amount of time

402
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,199
um

403
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,639
unfortunately

404
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,639
i don't know if that means i'll have to

405
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,000
create a situation where two things move

406
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,600
towards each other where i think it will

407
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,600
happen more frequently and just create

408
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,079
that circumstance

409
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,440
um because like man this takes a long

410
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,039
time

411
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,320
there we go

412
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,719
so like i can make it happen

413
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,720
but it

414
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,000
it's not as reliable as i would like

415
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:36,559
it's not as reliable as i would like

416
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,159
um so what i'm suggesting here right

417
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,239
is that for purposes of the collision

418
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,319
like everything is discrete that's what

419
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,799
i'm basically saying

420
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,879
so uh if for example i went and

421
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,399
let's go to move entity

422
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,679
and in the

423
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,039
uh when it calls collides at p here

424
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,359
if i

425
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,439
was to say okay

426
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,519
we know

427
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,680
when you look at this code we're passing

428
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,838
in an entity point here

429
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,838
right

430
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,000
and

431
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,159
we then test against entity points and

432
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,240
the entity points are

433
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,640
like

434
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,640
gonna be snapped

435
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,720
so

436
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:25,119
this right here would be snapped to like

437
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,640
the center of

438
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,958
a uh

439
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,959
of a voxel

440
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,160
and as i'm thinking about this i'm

441
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,160
wondering in my head as well

442
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,720
should we have done this system slightly

443
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,678
differently have i

444
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,960
have i over complicated things

445
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,120
if instead of choosing corners if we had

446
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,640
just tested the centers of voxels to

447
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,678
begin with

448
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,679
and then used

449
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,640
just

450
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,558
can i stand at the center of this voxel

451
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,640
as the thing

452
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,200
would i not be able to test like far

453
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,679
fewer voxels and get basically the exact

454
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,000
same behavior

455
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,000
um

456
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,879
and then you always consider yourself to

457
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:43,319
be at the center of the voxel that you

458
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,320
start yeah is that just better

459
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,519
i think it is

460
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,200
i think that's just smarter

461
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,120
so i feel like what we probably want to

462
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,880
do is just simplify this code down a

463
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,479
little bit so that you don't have to do

464
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,120
that checking that i was doing and the

465
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,279
grid is just now center points of the

466
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,399
voxels

467
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,359
you are

468
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,280
in the voxel that you would round to

469
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,279
towards the center of the voxel

470
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,038
yeah i don't know why i didn't think of

471
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,519
that first it seems like we can just

472
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,679
collapse this scheme down to that

473
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,679
and then everyone is just considered to

474
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,360
be in the center of the voxel they're

475
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,600
actually in

476
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,599
right

477
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,159
i don't really know why i didn't do that

478
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,558
like most things i think sometimes

479
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,359
these things are so complicated

480
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,798
like most things in games if you

481
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,959
actually want to go look at a problem

482
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,319
really carefully are complicated enough

483
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,400
that your brain doesn't really

484
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,480
understand it all until you've actually

485
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,120
gone and done it and then you see like

486
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,240
oh actually this is much simpler

487
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,558
when you

488
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,558
sort of

489
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,400
when you actually iron out all the

490
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,038
details it turns out that like the

491
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,720
complexity can be collapsed down but it

492
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,240
not in a way that your brain could have

493
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,480
understood at the time

494
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,480
right

495
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,558
so that does actually seem pretty

496
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,320
straightforward

497
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,279
and i might just say that's what we

498
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:26,879
should do it's way easier

499
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,879
and way less computation

500
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:39,039
i i guess i was just being kind of

501
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,038
blunt uh obtuse

502
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,839
i want to scroll down

503
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,720
i want to scroll down i can't see in my

504
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,000
head there we go

505
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,360
um

506
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,159
so yeah i mean gosh that just seems way

507
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,399
better

508
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,400
like

509
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,799
like that's just so much better because

510
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,079
then like you just say look we just have

511
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,000
a voxel

512
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,599
convention

513
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,679
um

514
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,879
there's no corner code it's just center

515
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,880
code

516
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,880
right

517
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,519
um

518
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,039
and the best part is now the center code

519
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,798
is actually just a boolean

520
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,759
because you know whether or not you

521
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,000
pushed it uh or tested it you don't have

522
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,079
to share corners it's just like if

523
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,359
you're gonna push something you test it

524
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,199
if you're not gonna push something you

525
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,519
don't test it

526
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,519
um

527
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,720
that's really it

528
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,440
so this gets way better in fact you

529
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,519
could just do this and say center code

530
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,400
and it says like pushed or not

531
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,759
right

532
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,759
and pushed open knot

533
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,038
yeah i think that literally just

534
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:12,038
collapses down to did we push this or

535
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,038
not

536
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,879
so we would just have have tested and

537
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,439
like either we've tested it or not and

538
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,960
if we haven't tested it we test it if we

539
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,480
have it and

540
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,159
optionally move there

541
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,159
if or consider it right

542
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:48,240
all right well that was embarrassing um

543
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:51,678
so yeah i mean it's not embarrassing

544
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,798
like like i always say like this is why

545
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,080
it's

546
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,519
i'm the type of person who always like

547
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,639
i think you you have like there's

548
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,918
there's two types of people out there

549
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,960
right

550
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,400
um

551
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,000
you've got like the people who give like

552
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,759
a lot of conference presentations who

553
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,159
anytime they figure out something even

554
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,079
remotely mundane they they think it's

555
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,120
amazing and want to say how great they

556
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,038
are

557
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,319
um and then there's other people like

558
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,599
myself who whenever they figure

559
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,599
something out they think they were

560
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,359
stupid for not figuring out earlier

561
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,038
they're both the same thing

562
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,279
uh it's just

563
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,798
uh probably one makes you feel a lot

564
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,319
smarter than you are and one makes you

565
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:27,599
feel stupider than you are but i don't

566
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,960
know that there's actually a bad thing

567
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,480
about that i think feeling stupid is

568
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,079
probably good

569
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,159
um

570
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,918
because it makes you try to be smarter

571
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,360
whereas feeling smart is probably bad

572
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,440
because it means that you're not trying

573
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,278
very hard to to not be stupid and you

574
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,440
probably still are stupid

575
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,720
anyway difference of opinion

576
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,000
point being

577
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,000
this was dumb

578
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
because now what we really need

579
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,960
is voxel corners can just be voxel

580
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,480
center uh you get back what the cell was

581
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,278
that you were in

582
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,558
whether or not uh it's like possible to

583
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,159
move there

584
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,200
the repulsion vector can still be the

585
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,799
same

586
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,640
uh and the embedded

587
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,278
flag can still be the same

588
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,520
um so all this stuff just kind of still

589
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,960
works fine i think

590
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,240
uh

591
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,798
and

592
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,159
we probably can now just simplify all

593
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:21,200
that code down to something much more

594
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,039
straightforward that doesn't have to

595
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,960
look at corners or any of that stuff so

596
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,640
it'll be much faster

597
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,960
uh and

598
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,320
we can always do our testing only at

599
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,798
voxel centers

600
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,000
so when we do the refinement step we

601
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,359
will

602
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,240
allow testing outside of centers

603
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,678
but for all actual movement stuff

604
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,839
um

605
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,559
we will always test at centers meaning

606
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,639
that it will now be symmetric uh which

607
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:51,678
is what we want

608
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,679
so i think

609
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,960
this is like

610
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,558
way better

611
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,558
but i guess it remains to be seen

612
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,360
so we'll

613
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,798
type in the code first

614
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,798
before declaring it as such

615
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,558
okay

616
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:11,278
so when we come into move entity uh what

617
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:14,319
you can see here is we do like um an

618
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,759
aligned to movement voxel and that all

619
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:17,918
is fine

620
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,679
uh i think that's

621
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,360
that code would be the same no matter

622
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,720
what happens because the voxel is the

623
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,558
voxel whether we're talking about the

624
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,360
center or not

625
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:30,480
uh doesn't matter right

626
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,839
now there is one thing that is

627
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,839
possibly true

628
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,359
which is that if we just simply don't

629
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,038
need that anymore

630
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,439
we can stop talking about the cell

631
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,720
entirely and just talk about the grid

632
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
point

633
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,640
so it may be such that we don't really

634
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,159
need this idea because if you think

635
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,840
about it if we're just stepping along

636
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,278
centers what the heck did we need the

637
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:54,278
cell for

638
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,278
so really like a line to movement voxel

639
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,720
a line to movement voxel can just be the

640
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,720
center points now

641
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,720
right

642
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,919
i mean i just don't know that any of

643
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,918
this stuff is necessary

644
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,840
so i think this

645
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,839
just doesn't matter

646
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,400
i think we still need the bounds on

647
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,400
movement

648
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,918
i mean it's really just because of stor

649
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,759
the the only reason we even need the

650
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,600
bounds on movement is because of storage

651
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:24,038
size

652
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,038
um we wouldn't even need that

653
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,720
like that's another thing to think about

654
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,720
whether we actually want

655
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,840
once you don't have to really do this

656
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,000
there's other options you could think of

657
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,000
i

658
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,119
i'm not going to do that right now so

659
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,439
i'm still going to say that look we've

660
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:09,199
got a delta p here and that's going to

661
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,360
give us effectively like an ending p

662
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,399
so we're still going to do this

663
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,278
right

664
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:15,119
um

665
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,720
but we're now talking about these

666
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,479
centers right

667
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,960
which are like we're talking about being

668
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,880
at the center of the voxel

669
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,960
so instead of a floor

670
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,520
uh right this is going to be more of

671
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,840
like a rounding operation here

672
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,839
in a line

673
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,079
so like when we align to the movement

674
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,319
voxel here what we're really talking

675
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,240
about is like that

676
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,000
um because we want to go to

677
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,319
whatever is closest

678
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,759
we're like snapping to a center not down

679
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:49,119
to a floor other than that i think the

680
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,119
rest of this code just works

681
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,480
and then the like voxel min corner max

682
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,599
corner like none of this stuff

683
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,839
really even matters anymore we probably

684
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,398
don't need the voxel grid

685
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,720
we probably don't need any of that stuff

686
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:04,719
um

687
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:10,558
i i think we just don't need that

688
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,080
anymore

689
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,519
so like in here where we talk about uh

690
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,119
the grid stuff

691
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,879
um

692
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,119
i i really just don't think any of that

693
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,880
matters now

694
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,879
we've got the voxel uh

695
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,079
yeah like we've got the starting p

696
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,558
[Music]

697
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,759
and the ending p

698
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,519
i can see why these are getting like

699
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,038
min chord but again i don't know that we

700
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,599
need any of this i think we're just

701
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:49,599
gonna like

702
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,720
get rid of this

703
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:56,398
um excuse me

704
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,960
i don't think we need any of this and

705
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,199
that way too like this part here like if

706
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,319
we want to do the expansion side of

707
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,240
things

708
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,839
um

709
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,839
this would just be like

710
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,439
these two values

711
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,319
starting and ending

712
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,038
this is still correct

713
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,278
the only difference is i don't think

714
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,278
it's two times anymore because we now

715
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,679
know that the movement grid is exactly

716
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,679
what we're looking at we want to expand

717
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,679
it by one on either side but it was

718
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,600
rounded so we don't need to expand one

719
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,360
side more than the other which is what

720
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,359
we do in a floor when you floor

721
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,678
something you have to expand the high

722
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,038
side twice and the low side once but

723
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,399
when you round you're just expanding

724
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,000
each side once because you've already

725
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,000
said well we're only going in the the

726
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,079
region that we actually cared about

727
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,960
so i think this becomes a simpler

728
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,240
uh

729
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,519
set of things to do here

730
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,319
right

731
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,720
um

732
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,599
i think that's it this stuff all works

733
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,839
just fine uh the span part of things i

734
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:13,119
don't know that this matters at all like

735
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,558
i don't know that we care about the span

736
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,719
anymore

737
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:20,398
we know what it is this is just for an

738
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,399
assertion um

739
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,839
so i don't think we care about the voxel

740
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:30,079
dimension anymore

741
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:34,240
like i'm pretty sure we just don't care

742
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,240
we can assert um

743
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:41,839
we can't assert that like the span

744
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,159
is less than the stack dimension

745
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,278
uh because we do care about that

746
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,840
right

747
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,839
um

748
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,720
i guess i'm not sure certain if we need

749
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,919
to round that first though like like

750
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,919
maybe we do i don't know

751
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,359
um

752
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,359
anyway

753
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,960
what is this about

754
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,639
it's like putting a weird like error oh

755
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,960
because i'm holding my mouse there

756
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,399
um so i think that's all fine

757
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,240
we'll see as we go

758
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:46,959
uh initial cell and target cell i are

759
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,960
just going to be

760
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:54,000
the indexes

761
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,000
um so they're just like this code

762
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,200
right

763
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:00,200
um but we so so really

764
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,200
really all we need to do is round these

765
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,200
with the align to movement voxel thing

766
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,120
so when we do a line to movement voxel

767
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,119
this is the thing that actually like

768
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,119
produces the value that we cared about

769
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,119
here

770
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,640
so when we want to get the movement

771
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:49,278
voxel index for a particular thing we

772
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,880
need to know what the min corner is but

773
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:53,919
other than that that's it so we would

774
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,760
just say like get movement voxel index

775
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,360
and then we subtract them

776
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,919
so

777
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,199
like this code right here is that actual

778
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,159
value

779
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,640
um

780
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,640
excuse me

781
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,760
so this code is is basically the same

782
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,639
and it's just like after you do the

783
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,760
round you're just doing a round

784
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,119
uh

785
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,919
that goes to a integer value instead of

786
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,919
not

787
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,918
right

788
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:28,319
so this code

789
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,240
is like that

790
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,359
so once we know

791
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,719
what the

792
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,719
uh rounded version is

793
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,240
the only question is do we want to do

794
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,480
deltas or not and i'm

795
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,878
not entirely sure

796
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,878
um

797
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,679
that part's a little bit tricky i'm not

798
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,559
sure

799
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,159
but uh we can if we want to know these

800
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,799
these are like supposed to be relative

801
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,720
to the base grid so i think what we do

802
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,240
is we just say like

803
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,358
voxel min corner

804
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,319
um

805
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,319
and we pass in here the

806
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,280
in the start you know

807
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,280
the box will start p

808
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,679
so these two pieces

809
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:20,079
are now like

810
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,078
to me

811
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,679
are now just based on

812
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,039
on that one piece of information

813
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,759
oh whoops i didn't mean that was dumb i

814
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,358
didn't mean to actually delete the voxel

815
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,280
stack there what i meant to do was leave

816
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:41,279
the voxel stack but get rid of the voxel

817
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,839
grid

818
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,359
my

819
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:48,159
bad so basically what we want to do here

820
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:48,159
is get rid of that

821
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,440
um so we do still want the voxel stack

822
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:52,799
we just don't need to initialize it with

823
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,079
anything

824
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,079
it's just empty right

825
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,838
so we can initialize the voxel stack

826
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,959
with nothing

827
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,519
um

828
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,320
and

829
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,320
and off it goes

830
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,719
we've have it all

831
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,720
we

832
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,639
don't really need to do the diagram box

833
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,919
thing but i'm going to

834
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:24,639
anyway

835
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,639
uh by saying like wrecked min max

836
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,000
and passing the vox will start p voxel

837
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,280
and p but i actually want to use the

838
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,480
ones where we

839
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,480
um

840
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,400
like got them into the correct positions

841
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,358
and then expanded them

842
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,358
just to be able to show the whole thing

843
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,400
uh so then when we do the uh voxel

844
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,210
corners bit we don't really need the

845
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,720
check corners thing anymore so

846
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:55,838
[Music]

847
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:59,118
so like

848
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,119
that whole thing

849
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,079
this is why i say i feel like this is

850
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,239
just way smarter and i don't know why i

851
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,920
was i was thinking corner i was thinking

852
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,919
about voxel corners a set of voxel

853
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,920
centers

854
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,519
um

855
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,599
there are times when you care about one

856
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:18,599
in times when you care about the other

857
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,599
right

858
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:39,838
also tim 775 that's like

859
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,920
that's the part of the personality type

860
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,920
though right so for me

861
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,240
i don't want to keep going when i feel

862
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,079
smart

863
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:49,838
i want to keep going when i feel stupid

864
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,760
right when i don't understand something

865
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:53,920
is when i'm most motivated to look into

866
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,920
it

867
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,399
so that's like the part about

868
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
personality types right

869
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,239
um

870
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,400
it's also why i have a hard time with a

871
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,000
lot of games is because like

872
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,240
once i kind of roughly understand

873
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
something i i don't really want to play

874
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:12,239
them anymore

875
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,239
um

876
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,039
so

877
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,800
i always

878
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,800
i always work harder when i feel like i

879
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,400
don't understand something

880
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,480
and then once i feel like i understand

881
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,838
it too much i get a lot less interested

882
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,519
in doing it

883
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,159
um because i'm just like well what am i

884
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,159
going to learn right like not much

885
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:31,159
so

886
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,519
anyway uh

887
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,720
so let's see here so the voxel corners

888
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,440
thing

889
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:46,159
again is not very

890
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,280
necessary anymore like this whole thing

891
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:52,399
uh doesn't have to happen

892
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,640
and so really all we're gonna do is

893
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,400
we're gonna get the current cell i and

894
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:57,440
we can just look it up directly in here

895
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,639
i think

896
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,559
right

897
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,639
so we can basically say like look we're

898
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,320
gonna look up the corner code

899
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,319
uh for this voxel

900
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,720
actually we don't even need to do that

901
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,039
uh because we already know that we can

902
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,039
stand here so the only thing we're gonna

903
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,119
do is like check

904
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,599
the directions we want to

905
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,880
travel in from here

906
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,320
right

907
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,079
so we already know

908
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,160
we already know we can stand here

909
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,160
because we've checked it right

910
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,239
and the embedded part is the only

911
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,640
problem that we're going to have

912
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,439
so when we get up here yeah so we do

913
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:41,358
want we want something like this

914
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,720
which is like

915
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,838
that checks for collision but we

916
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:48,239
wouldn't be doing it here is my point

917
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,799
right so

918
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:55,039
so we wouldn't be doing it here

919
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,359
um and embedding we'll have to kind of

920
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,559
we'll have to

921
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:02,119
work out

922
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,119
in a different way

923
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,559
so

924
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:39,839
looking at this part of the cell code

925
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,838
get closest point in box conservative

926
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,719
if we want to know what the cell is

927
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,838
it's literally just

928
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,239
wherever we

929
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:54,239
are so

930
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,200
the cell center p

931
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,519
and then the cell dimension

932
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,519
is just the cell

933
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,400
right

934
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,559
and

935
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,720
so knowing the position is very simple

936
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,358
the cell center p is just the current

937
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:17,480
cell i times the cell dim plus whatever

938
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,480
the voxelman corner was

939
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,720
right

940
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,519
um

941
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,960
all right so uh yeah so the the this 2p

942
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,599
part of things right that this 2p is

943
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,400
just i believe it's just the 2p but we

944
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,000
um

945
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,519
have like an adjustment that we're going

946
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,599
to do for embed code so we're going to

947
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,440
leave that part in

948
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,160
um

949
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,519
this part does an if not found best so

950
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:07,039
that's just to skip over the part

951
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,800
where it decides it doesn't need to look

952
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,279
for stuff anymore

953
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,280
so it doesn't do this part of things

954
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,200
so when we do this

955
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,280
again this part now is much more

956
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,519
straightforward so when we actually go

957
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,400
to check various sides

958
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,599
there's only going to be one test here

959
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,760
right

960
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,480
so each one of these is just going to be

961
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,480
like um

962
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,599
like something like should

963
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,598
test corner

964
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,559
you know what i mean

965
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,280
um and should test corner is gonna wanna

966
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,960
do

967
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,240
this it's gonna pass like whatever that

968
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,760
um

969
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,799
thing was that it was

970
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,440
building

971
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,318
for the next voxel eye

972
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,720
um and so what i might s

973
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:00,719
hey

974
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,239
is that like

975
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,239
push voxel stack

976
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,358
we could just roll that into that call

977
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,960
i'm having trouble deciding

978
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,719
it would be relatively free for us here

979
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,199
too if we wanted to to allow diagonal

980
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:57,759
movement now but i just don't know that

981
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,759
we want to

982
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,079
but we definitely could allow it now

983
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:23,519
so yeah so like when we go in here

984
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,519
i guess i can see why we had the voxel

985
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,838
grid part of things but i'm not sure we

986
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:27,838
actually

987
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,679
want to keep it like i said we probably

988
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,560
want to just remove it because it's a

989
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,039
little bit

990
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:38,559
misaligned for our needs now but

991
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,559
so when we do should test corner

992
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,199
uh what i'm trying to figure out is

993
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,559
what's the best way to structure this

994
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:45,759
part here

995
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,000
like

996
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,000
we can

997
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:53,759
do it this way

998
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:04,639
but that seems kind of redundant because

999
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:08,000
we're already calling a function whose

1000
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:10,318
only job is to do literally that

1001
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,318
you know

1002
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,200
so it seems like maybe what we would

1003
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:19,838
want to do instead is just

1004
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:19,838
have that be what this code does

1005
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,079
right

1006
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,839
so when we call push voxel stack this

1007
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,000
code checks to see whether we actually

1008
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:30,960
want to do that now the only reason not

1009
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,760
to do that is that push voxel stack then

1010
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,358
would need like the condition code

1011
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,040
which it would have to get by doing an

1012
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,759
actual test

1013
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,000
so

1014
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,440
in order to call collides at p it needs

1015
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,079
the same region the entity and the p

1016
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,838
which it doesn't actually have right

1017
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,480
so

1018
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:50,400
maybe

1019
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,400
what we do is something more like this

1020
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,000
uh

1021
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,920
so that we have like in

1022
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,599
push voxel stack

1023
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,240
we have like the condition code maybe

1024
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,240
that goes on the end

1025
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,000
right

1026
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,400
now the reason i don't like that is

1027
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,800
because it should check the corner code

1028
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,800
first

1029
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,399
so that just seems to it seems to me

1030
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,679
that you really do want

1031
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,680
this to be one thing

1032
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:23,439
right

1033
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,079
so effectively you come in here and you

1034
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:30,480
do this

1035
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:35,480
and this

1036
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,480
is predicated right so you're like

1037
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:47,519
right so you basically say all right

1038
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,519
we're going to go

1039
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,838
and look to see whether we can stand on

1040
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,679
this or not and if we can or can't we're

1041
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:54,960
going to like go ahead and push that on

1042
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:56,399
there's got to be some more stuff in

1043
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,039
here which is like when we push things

1044
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,440
on the stack we have to look to see

1045
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,880
whether or not we can be there or not

1046
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,280
based on the embed code so there's going

1047
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,559
to be a little bit of extra fungibility

1048
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,079
there but

1049
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:11,078
so basically what has to happen is this

1050
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,760
uh where we say you know go ahead and

1051
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:23,838
put that on there

1052
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,760
now again maybe this is the wrong way

1053
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:28,239
about it maybe these should actually be

1054
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,920
out in the code here but i don't know

1055
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,318
it's really hard to say

1056
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,880
um but you could see it would now look

1057
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:35,880
basically like that

1058
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:56,400
the p-value for the entity is going to

1059
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:59,759
be derived from i

1060
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,760
so i'm pretty sure we don't need that

1061
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,760
right

1062
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:14,558
um

1063
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,599
and then if we had a way

1064
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,599
and maybe we sort of do

1065
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,760
so like if we came in here and said

1066
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,920
let's not phrase it that way let's

1067
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:33,520
phrase it this way where we say current

1068
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,519
cell plus like side x zero zero

1069
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,239
you know what i mean

1070
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:49,838
um then what we could do is say well

1071
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,839
each one of these

1072
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,400
just rolls into that call

1073
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
right

1074
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,599
so at that point this also seems a

1075
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,280
little bit unnecessary because you

1076
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,880
essentially have

1077
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,119
this flip thing happen right where side

1078
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,119
x

1079
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,559
you can see here like

1080
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:47,039
we already have the thing we actually

1081
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,760
wanted to test which is you know you you

1082
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:49,759
could just do

1083
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,240
um

1084
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,078
in fact you don't even need the flip

1085
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:57,279
part of things you could just put this

1086
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,119
at the bottom

1087
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,319
like this is just um

1088
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,838
right

1089
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:03,838
because all you're doing is this

1090
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:12,400
like side x equals not side x

1091
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,439
i suppose it's maybe it's more compact

1092
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,200
to write it that way because you'd have

1093
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,639
to initialize the variable up here but

1094
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,838
you know

1095
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,960
so anyway

1096
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:22,880
a little bit more compact

1097
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,079
which is nice

1098
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,599
um and then the min corner value i think

1099
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,559
probably what i would do is say like the

1100
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,559
min corner value

1101
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:35,919
um

1102
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:37,519
and and maybe like the better way to say

1103
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,000
this is min center

1104
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:42,800
like this is the min center point of

1105
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,800
this voxel

1106
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,640
so i think that's what we roughly want

1107
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,559
and in here

1108
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,639
we're gonna have this problem where when

1109
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,319
you're embedded you can't push on so you

1110
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,318
wouldn't be able to move at all right

1111
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,480
um

1112
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,559
and so that's okay right now um we're

1113
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,559
just not gonna deal with that at the

1114
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,559
moment

1115
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,318
so we'll we'll take a look at that later

1116
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:21,838
but at the moment

1117
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:23,199
we just want to do the sim region

1118
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:26,799
i don't actually know what that's called

1119
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:26,799
here's just region not sim region

1120
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,318
uh so basically what we're going to do

1121
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,239
here is yeah just have push voxel stock

1122
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:36,558
stack handle that

1123
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,118
so we set up the min center p so that it

1124
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:42,480
knows what that would actually be uh we

1125
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,358
come through here and you know

1126
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,199
this

1127
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:47,279
cell center p would be maybe something

1128
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:51,318
that we have a call for

1129
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,319
so we just say like

1130
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,000
this code for example

1131
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,199
yeah so all of this stuff now goes away

1132
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,800
too

1133
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,118
right so we can basically get rid of

1134
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,079
this voxel iterator nonsense we don't

1135
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,079
need it anymore

1136
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,000
i don't know where that was actually

1137
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,000
defined

1138
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,680
all right i guess it was all all

1139
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,880
encompassing

1140
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,039
um

1141
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,039
so

1142
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:42,679
i think

1143
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,880
i think we're all good so if we have all

1144
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,960
these already defined we should then be

1145
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,760
able to do a thing where we say

1146
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,760
from the voxel stack

1147
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,440
um

1148
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,440
we can

1149
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,440
take the voxel min center

1150
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,558
we can add the cell dim

1151
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:46,639
and we can get

1152
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:50,318
any center out that way trivially right

1153
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:52,799
so that allows us to do

1154
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:54,838
the operations we actually care about

1155
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,400
um which is like this

1156
00:53:54,838 --> 00:53:58,000
here

1157
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,440
can now just be like

1158
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,880
get cell

1159
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,599
center p

1160
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,559
here's the stack

1161
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,559
here's the index

1162
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,239
and off we go

1163
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,279
when we do push voxel stack here uh we

1164
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,959
need to do

1165
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,960
uh checking against

1166
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:25,839
the is in bounds or is in rectangle

1167
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,838
or whatever

1168
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,800
i don't know if we have

1169
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:39,798
one of these too many functions

1170
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:39,798
too much volcano

1171
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,599
so we really just don't have you know

1172
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,519
there's too many

1173
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,960
there's too much volcano

1174
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:00,639
um

1175
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,838
there's too many of these like if we you

1176
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:03,440
know if this were a normal project i

1177
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:04,558
would have a much cleaner math library

1178
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,920
for it

1179
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,400
uh because you know it'd be something

1180
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,559
that i would spend time cleaning up

1181
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,160
uh but on a project like handmade here

1182
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,519
where you kind of drop in and out of it

1183
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:18,358
it tends to get a little bit more

1184
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:18,358
sprawling it's not as you know tidy

1185
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,199
but

1186
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:29,759
what are you gonna do so anyway uh

1187
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:32,239
really all we need to check here is if

1188
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,720
this thing is

1189
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:38,000
you know not too far out of bounds we we

1190
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:38,000
want effectively this

1191
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:41,519
function

1192
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,118
right

1193
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:47,599
um

1194
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:49,280
but we don't have it because the gen v3

1195
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,720
is like a different thing

1196
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,640
and and

1197
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,879
it's it's actually not like you see the

1198
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:55,679
type def here is the same

1199
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,599
so

1200
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,598
i'm guessing that means that actually

1201
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:03,838
actually we can just use that

1202
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:27,119
so i guess we can just use this we can

1203
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:31,640
say is in array bounds

1204
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,640
and then we can just say like well

1205
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,879
it's not voxel stackdem

1206
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,880
is it

1207
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,240
i guess it is

1208
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:53,279
i think that's all we really need

1209
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,760
um

1210
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,720
probably

1211
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,720
so is in array bounds

1212
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,318
is all we really need for that

1213
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:12,719
um

1214
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,318
now the pushed part of things the push

1215
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,159
voxel stack part

1216
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:18,318
um is just like

1217
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:20,798
have tested

1218
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,318
because we may never have pushed it

1219
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:25,838
right so we're really just saying have

1220
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:27,039
we ever tested this particular one

1221
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:28,719
once we

1222
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,719
go to visit it we only want to visit it

1223
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,558
once so we say never visit it again

1224
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:36,159
which is all that does

1225
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,160
and then we call collides at p

1226
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,679
um and we pass the sim region the entity

1227
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:44,480
and then the p value here is just the

1228
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,759
like

1229
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,358
get min

1230
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,280
uh uh does it get voxel center p

1231
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,119
it's just the center p for whatever the

1232
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,880
in whatever the index was that they

1233
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,480
passed in

1234
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,798
so we're just going to test it at that

1235
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,798
point

1236
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:11,759
right think that's all we need

1237
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,400
uh the collision field that comes back

1238
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,399
from this

1239
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,679
uh for embedding purposes

1240
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,358
um i guess we now need to

1241
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,079
return

1242
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,480
and we'll look at how this data flow

1243
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,160
works in a little bit because we

1244
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,318
probably want to make some modifications

1245
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:58,318
but

1246
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,798
right

1247
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,798
so

1248
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:09,838
something like this

1249
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,880
um

1250
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:14,879
this code is now gone

1251
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:19,679
right um it's just not a thing

1252
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:23,519
anymore

1253
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,519
uh so all of that is

1254
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:29,679
is just not necessary which is why i

1255
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,680
said i think this is just better right

1256
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,590
so

1257
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:35,589
[Music]

1258
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:44,199
all right

1259
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:09,039
so the best cell thing so this code

1260
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,039
right here

1261
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:17,679
um

1262
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:17,680
is probably all we really need

1263
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,960
so i'm not sure we care about the rest

1264
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,599
of that we could make that an actual

1265
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,440
call i'm not sure if we want to or not

1266
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,920
we maybe do

1267
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,318
uh in which case

1268
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,680
you know we would just make our own

1269
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:42,880
version

1270
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:46,679
so like get cell bounds and we could put

1271
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,680
that in here as well

1272
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,519
so in here we'd pass whatever the index

1273
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:15,519
was and this would return

1274
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,559
probably just by calling this

1275
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:30,000
and we'll

1276
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,000
assume that'll be sufficient

1277
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:35,519
so we'd call rec center dim with

1278
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,880
whatever the stack value was

1279
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:40,318
the cell dim

1280
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,318
we again need here

1281
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,759
and then everyone can call this

1282
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:54,159
when they want

1283
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,559
the

1284
01:01:54,159 --> 01:02:00,078
information

1285
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,079
about the entire rectangle

1286
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:10,000
and so now we just want to kind of clean

1287
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:12,798
this up a bit um before debugging it uh

1288
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,239
because it's kind of all garbage up now

1289
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:18,960
and probably isn't quite as

1290
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,479
like properly aligned now than it as it

1291
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,798
should be

1292
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,798
um

1293
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:27,679
and then maybe we weld these things

1294
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:29,759
together because the voxel grid probably

1295
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:32,318
if we just added a feature that allowed

1296
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:36,160
it to be created

1297
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:38,000
um we could use the voxel grid here

1298
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:40,399
so we may don't want to go merge that

1299
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,559
code so that there's just like one set

1300
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,720
of voxel code

1301
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,079
like in the system or whatever like

1302
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,078
maybe we want to do that i don't

1303
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,039
actually know

1304
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,119
uh

1305
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,960
it's hard to say

1306
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:55,519
if we actually want that or not you know

1307
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,119
we might we might not

1308
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:59,838
um

1309
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:02,720
so now like yeah you know

1310
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:04,558
surprisingly that just ran the first

1311
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:06,159
time

1312
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,599
which is actually not what i was

1313
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:09,598
expecting to have happen

1314
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,760
and not only does it run but it's

1315
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,119
like doing something but i don't think

1316
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,160
it's actually working right you can see

1317
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,000
like it's

1318
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:23,838
it's doing the opposite of what you

1319
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,559
would expect it to do

1320
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:28,558
i think in a lot of cases maybe not

1321
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:33,919
well no i guess it's actually

1322
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,519
it's running and it's working which are

1323
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,119
not things that i would have expected it

1324
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:40,400
to do

1325
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:42,000
so that worked unreasonably well uh for

1326
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,280
something that probably shouldn't have

1327
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,480
there you go you got it stuck there or

1328
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,160
whatever you know

1329
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,280
so you know it's like it's like it

1330
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:48,399
shouldn't be working as well as it's

1331
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,319
working because we literally just kind

1332
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,358
of slapped that in there

1333
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:53,599
um

1334
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,639
i guess that's good i'm i'm not going to

1335
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,640
complain too hard

1336
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:03,118
but uh it's definitely

1337
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:03,118
yeah um

1338
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,400
yeah

1339
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,000
anyway uh you know what i might do too

1340
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,119
while we're at it i i'm just kind of

1341
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,159
tired of looking at the world in

1342
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:14,079
wireframe so i might turn that

1343
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:17,759
off for now

1344
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,079
so the code where we kind of nerfed the

1345
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,079
um

1346
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,839
we nerfed the part where we drew the

1347
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:28,720
actual entities

1348
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:28,719
for cubes

1349
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,280
um

1350
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,480
at least i think that's what we did

1351
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,160
yeah

1352
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,000
uh and i'm just going to put that back

1353
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:43,199
in

1354
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,400
probably something we should have a

1355
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:46,399
debug switch for right

1356
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,239
um

1357
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:55,119
so yeah like again i'm kind of surprised

1358
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,240
that that works

1359
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:57,280
uh

1360
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:59,118
but

1361
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,280
you know

1362
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,280
uh i'm sure it doesn't work very well so

1363
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:06,000
like that was you know i guess that was

1364
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,039
a good first um go at it but like yeah

1365
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,280
as you can see it gets stuck really

1366
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,960
easily so you know it's it's it's

1367
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,798
incorrect what i typed in which is what

1368
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,880
i would have expected but

1369
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:16,719
um it's surprising that it works as well

1370
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,960
as it does uh

1371
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:20,959
that was unexpected

1372
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:25,119
so what i'd like to do is go through now

1373
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,119
and just clean this up a little bit more

1374
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:29,599
if we look at

1375
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,200
the move entity call uh so the first

1376
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,440
thing i was saying is like what like

1377
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:36,798
maybe we can collapse these down

1378
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,400
uh to the voxel grid stuff uh

1379
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:42,719
the stack is is quite a bit different

1380
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,720
but it's possible that we could

1381
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,199
change it around i i don't the reason

1382
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:51,039
i'm worried about that is because the

1383
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:53,679
voxel grid is not based around centers

1384
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:56,960
the voxel grid is based around corners

1385
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:58,639
so you know i don't know if i want

1386
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,079
it to

1387
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:02,838
i don't know if i want to try and make

1388
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:05,599
those both work together

1389
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:06,960
there's not that much reason why you

1390
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,440
can't do that

1391
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,199
but it does

1392
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,798
my instinct says no like not for

1393
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:14,239
collision code you probably want to be

1394
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:15,920
working on the centers if you're working

1395
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:17,598
on centers always

1396
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,838
so that's why i'm a little hesitant to

1397
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,838
do that

1398
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,639
i do however think we could move the

1399
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:26,639
voxel stuff out of there and into the

1400
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,798
other piece of code

1401
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:30,400
um so that part i'm not sure about like

1402
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,159
like we could say that you know the

1403
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,480
voxel stack goes in here because it's a

1404
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:36,798
voxely kind of thing

1405
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,798
um

1406
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:41,118
and and we push that code out into this

1407
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:44,719
voxel part of things because they're all

1408
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,720
like voxely things

1409
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:49,519
um so i might kind of do something like

1410
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,519
that

1411
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,039
hard to say

1412
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:02,639
i'm i'm undecided undecided

1413
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,440
um

1414
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,839
so there's some pretty nice aspects of

1415
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,318
this so when we actually call refined

1416
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:24,078
voxel placement we now know like what

1417
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:27,358
we're actually doing

1418
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:29,440
so when we do like get closest point in

1419
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:31,519
box conservative and we pass like the

1420
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:35,119
front p and the 2p

1421
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:36,559
here uh that was actually not necessary

1422
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,318
right um

1423
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:39,599
the from p part of things we don't

1424
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:41,519
actually have to do

1425
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,440
so this actually solves the problem we

1426
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:45,119
had before which is that this code was

1427
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,039
actually garbage

1428
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,039
now this code doesn't have to be garbage

1429
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,280
because we can do

1430
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,280
um

1431
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:57,280
instead one where we say clamp just the

1432
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,480
local target

1433
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,240
right

1434
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:05,119
and then we will refine the voxel

1435
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:05,118
placement based on the center point so

1436
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:11,838
like that

1437
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,079
because now we know we are starting from

1438
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:17,920
the center of the voxel which we have

1439
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,519
tested and know that we can occupy and

1440
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,199
then we're not going to move outside of

1441
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,040
the bounds of it because we clamped this

1442
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:26,079
to the bounds of it

1443
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:27,759
so uh that is actually way better so

1444
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:30,640
again the center

1445
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:32,079
voxel centers way better for collision

1446
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,319
um

1447
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:36,000
we are finding out rapidly

1448
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:38,080
uh base everything off your voxel

1449
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,600
centers and i think you're in better

1450
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:42,399
shape

1451
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:44,480
uh so anyway um i think all of that is

1452
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:46,158
fine so let's take a look at now the

1453
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,358
rest of this code a little bit more

1454
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:52,238
carefully

1455
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:52,239
so i don't know what dir does now

1456
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,920
does it do anything

1457
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:07,600
no

1458
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:10,079
what does side do

1459
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,319
so side only exists here

1460
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:12,318
right

1461
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:19,039
um so that to me

1462
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,560
uh suggests

1463
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:23,600
that

1464
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:27,120
this probably could be

1465
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,120
written directly in here

1466
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:32,479
you know what i mean

1467
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,480
now the only point of this anyway

1468
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:36,479
is just to make sure we look in the

1469
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:39,039
faster direction first

1470
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,879
which is just an optimization so even

1471
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:42,479
this is kind of stupid

1472
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,000
right

1473
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:47,439
um

1474
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,838
but hopefully what you can see here is

1475
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:49,838
like

1476
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,679
this code could just be

1477
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,679
that

1478
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:06,279
probably um i mean maybe not

1479
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:19,119
i'm just trying to code this a little

1480
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,600
bit cleaner

1481
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:24,000
so like if you there's just way too much

1482
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,640
garbage in here so so let's say let's do

1483
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,640
this differently

1484
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:32,319
we now know basically what we're doing

1485
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,760
right and we're doing this

1486
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:01,039
we start out with these

1487
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,750
um we know we want to do this loop twice

1488
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,039
and at the end we just do

1489
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:12,039
[Music]

1490
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:12,039
this

1491
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,119
negate side

1492
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,120
each time

1493
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,679
right so now we know that we've

1494
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,719
pushed on the three ones that are going

1495
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:31,119
in the direction we're actually trying

1496
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,880
to go and then we flip them and we push

1497
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:34,559
the other ones the second time

1498
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,000
right

1499
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,520
um

1500
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,960
that's what we're doing here

1501
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:44,560
and at that point one has to ask oneself

1502
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,560
why you would not just do this

1503
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,239
which is what the compiler is going to

1504
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,520
do anyway and that's probably easier to

1505
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:57,839
read

1506
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,840
right

1507
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,238
i think

1508
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:07,238
that is a cleaner way to write that

1509
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:07,238
um

1510
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,559
that just that just seems like what you

1511
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:24,559
want

1512
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:29,198
so i'm gonna i'm gonna call that good

1513
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:30,319
so i think that's all we need for that

1514
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:31,759
part of the code it pretty

1515
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:34,319
straightforward right so we're just

1516
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,640
testing and we test in that order

1517
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,000
and that's all we do

1518
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,280
um

1519
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,560
we don't have the embedding stuff in

1520
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:42,880
here yet so we're going to do that in a

1521
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,239
second but i want to do the first part

1522
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,560
first

1523
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:49,559
so this code is now quite simple right

1524
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,560
um

1525
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:53,839
um

1526
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:55,919
i mean maybe what we do want to do is

1527
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:58,880
sort of i don't know maybe we do want to

1528
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:02,158
have the embed stuff here so like

1529
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:05,159
if we were in an embedded state

1530
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:05,158
um

1531
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:08,399
it would be like this

1532
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:22,238
so the collision field has the occupied

1533
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,239
flag

1534
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:29,599
um and we'd have to imagine that if it

1535
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:30,879
came back occupied then we are embedded

1536
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,840
to start with

1537
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,600
right if we're embedded to start with

1538
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,520
then what we're doing is we're searching

1539
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,280
through embedded space for some place

1540
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,520
that's not embedded

1541
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:44,840
um

1542
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:48,880
and so uh when

1543
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:49,760
we when we look at a particular point

1544
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,800
we're

1545
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:56,800
going to allow ourselves to

1546
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:59,800
we're going to allow ourselves to

1547
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,800
post

1548
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:13,678
so i take that back

1549
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:15,920
uh i think actually

1550
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:17,760
we don't even need that we just need one

1551
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,679
we don't even need to track this

1552
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,239
am i wrong

1553
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,480
um you know i might be wrong

1554
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:24,479
um

1555
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,800
i think all that happens here

1556
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,359
is that if we are

1557
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,199
embedded we are allowed to move to

1558
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:35,439
embedded

1559
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:38,399
so basically that doesn't have to happen

1560
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:38,399
and neither does that

1561
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,678
this doesn't

1562
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:46,880
happen so what we do here is we just do

1563
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,880
a push voxel stack

1564
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,520
and

1565
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,520
we don't return anything

1566
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,520
uh all we do

1567
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:02,559
is say

1568
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,400
uh

1569
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,880
that if we are embedded we're allowed to

1570
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:08,238
move to somebody else who was embedded

1571
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,480
right

1572
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:12,479
so in the event that we haven't tested

1573
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:15,119
whoever it is

1574
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:17,519
uh we do the collides at p test and we

1575
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:18,880
just say that the result occupied has to

1576
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,840
be equal to

1577
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,600
uh

1578
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:26,159
our occupied or or like um um originate

1579
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:29,039
or occupied

1580
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:30,799
so whoever originated this move

1581
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:32,479
they just pass us in

1582
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,560
whether they were occupied or not and we

1583
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:35,759
can only move to one that's the same as

1584
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,760
what we are

1585
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,760
right

1586
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:44,479
because we're embedded and we need to

1587
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,480
get unembedded and so the only thing

1588
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:47,919
we're allowed to do is move to

1589
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:49,839
the closest

1590
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:53,199
unembedded space

1591
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,640
and that's the end of our move right

1592
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:58,158
now one could argue that we're supposed

1593
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,880
to do that and then also be able to move

1594
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:01,039
but

1595
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,039
uh

1596
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:05,119
i don't know about that so i think i'm

1597
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:07,519
gonna leave it at that for now

1598
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:11,039
so if that's the case then really all we

1599
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:15,600
do here is just say that when we re when

1600
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:15,600
we pop the voxel stack here right

1601
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:19,279
um

1602
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:22,079
and so i guess i

1603
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:23,519
i may be misspoke the first push voxel

1604
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:27,119
stack

1605
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:29,199
does have to be able to always work

1606
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:34,519
and i suppose that's the one thing that

1607
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:34,519
we're not really ex sort of doing here

1608
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:41,238
meaning this one has to work no matter

1609
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:41,238
what

1610
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:02,719
so it's almost like a mask

1611
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,639
in that sense

1612
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:07,640
you know what i mean

1613
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,640
um

1614
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:24,599
because we don't want you to move back

1615
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:24,599
to this point

1616
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:38,238
so this one maybe maybe there's just

1617
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:42,119
like that which is like look you have

1618
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:42,119
you have to push this on

1619
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,679
yeah

1620
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,800
uh

1621
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,800
something like that i don't know we'll

1622
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:03,119
well

1623
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,119
so in push voxel stack here right

1624
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,920
this is just more

1625
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,920
complicated unfortunately right

1626
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,319
what we need to be able to do is we want

1627
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,640
to be able to do this code and we want

1628
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:17,599
to be able to do it either with this

1629
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,039
condition or always

1630
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,880
right

1631
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:24,840
so you can imagine like there's an

1632
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,840
always flag here

1633
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,480
and so that's a little bit

1634
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:37,359
jank

1635
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:40,359
right

1636
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:40,359
um

1637
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,399
so it's you know it's not as good

1638
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:51,960
trying to think if there's a better way

1639
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:51,960
to do this part

1640
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:58,399
because what we really want to be able

1641
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,679
to do here is just say look if we were

1642
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:02,639
embedded

1643
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:07,000
we're just trying to find

1644
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:07,000
the closest unembedded space

1645
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:18,719
oh so actually maybe there's a different

1646
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:21,198
way to do that

1647
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,840
maybe what you're doing is actually

1648
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:23,839
something like

1649
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,880
is actually something like this

1650
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,279
if the originator was occupied then you

1651
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,480
could move to either

1652
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:39,759
right

1653
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:43,198
that actually makes more sense

1654
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,199
so it's actually like if

1655
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:50,880
if the result is not occupied

1656
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:52,799
or the originator was occupied

1657
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,880
that's actually what you want yeah yeah

1658
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,960
yeah so like if the originator was

1659
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,039
occupied or

1660
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,600
the place that we're moving to is not

1661
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:01,600
occupied

1662
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:05,119
yeah

1663
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:07,439
so i think the only problem we then have

1664
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:09,119
there is knowing the answer to this

1665
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:10,000
question which has to be stored on the

1666
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:12,000
stack

1667
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,560
meaning the cell stack

1668
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,479
has to track whether or not that point

1669
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,480
was occupied or not

1670
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:19,479
right

1671
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:41,279
which means maybe we can untangle this

1672
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:45,440
code a little bit more because if that's

1673
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:47,840
the case then maybe we can just say

1674
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:47,839
well

1675
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:56,479
no because we still have to track who

1676
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,480
pushed us on

1677
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,480
so you see what i'm saying i'm not the

1678
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:04,639
only thing i'm not sure about here is

1679
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:06,158
where i get this flag from it seems like

1680
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,480
it has to be stored on the stack and i'm

1681
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,719
not sure if there's a more clever way

1682
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:10,718
right

1683
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:17,920
um now the one thing i could do is store

1684
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:20,479
it in here

1685
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,920
so this could be a corner code

1686
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:24,000
right

1687
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,158
um

1688
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,119
so basically it's like the zero one two

1689
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:29,279
thing

1690
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:32,719
so instead of have tested

1691
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:32,719
this could be like you know

1692
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:38,399
an occupy code

1693
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:40,799
so it's like zero if you've never tested

1694
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:43,359
it one if it's occupied two if it's

1695
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,400
unoccupied or vice versa

1696
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:46,238
right

1697
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:48,719
and then what you would do is you'd pull

1698
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:53,959
it out here

1699
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:53,960
um where you would say like um

1700
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:10,319
so you'd pull out the occupy code for

1701
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:13,599
the one you were on you'd pass it in

1702
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:14,880
and say this is the occupy code

1703
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,199
that i'm

1704
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,199
oops

1705
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:23,880
this is the occupy code that i came from

1706
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:29,359
and then

1707
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:29,359
the code would be able to

1708
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:39,839
do a test there to determine which one

1709
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:39,839
it should use

1710
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:54,959
um

1711
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,840
that's the actual code for it

1712
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:21,039
i'm going to write that in a slightly

1713
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:23,039
different way it's same thing but i'm

1714
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:26,319
just going to write it as equal 0

1715
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:29,920
because i want to emphasize the fact

1716
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,920
that it's now a um

1717
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:35,600
like a code it's 0 1

1718
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:40,560
2. so now when we go in here what we

1719
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:43,600
would say is we need to do the uh test

1720
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:46,880
and so what we're gonna do is set the

1721
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,719
occupy code equal to uh the result

1722
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:51,279
occupied

1723
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:53,840
um that's gonna be zero or one

1724
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:56,000
or like true or false so we need to do

1725
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,520
is set it to like if it's occupied it's

1726
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
one thing if it's unoccupied it's the

1727
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,639
other right so maybe it's two in one i

1728
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
don't know

1729
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:07,600
so then what we want to be able to do

1730
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,600
here is something like if

1731
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:13,920
the originator code

1732
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:13,920
which is this thing

1733
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:18,399
if the originator code is

1734
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,000
uh

1735
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,000
two

1736
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:28,000
so i think what we want is this way

1737
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,120
although i guess it doesn't really

1738
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,119
matter

1739
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:39,119
i guess it doesn't really matter um so

1740
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,560
we're going to produce a code

1741
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:46,479
we're going to store the code

1742
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,560
we know that whatever we stored

1743
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:49,919
will get sent back in here when we're

1744
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,360
trying to do a move

1745
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,359
we want to do something like this

1746
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:56,399
right

1747
01:24:57,279 --> 01:25:02,479
so as long as whoever the originator was

1748
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:04,319
if we just want to set the code equal to

1749
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:06,079
whatever would make this be true in the

1750
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:09,359
case we care about

1751
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:11,439
so for example if it's occupied right

1752
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:13,039
um then

1753
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:14,960
yeah i mean what we probably want to do

1754
01:25:13,039 --> 01:25:16,880
is say look if this code is greater than

1755
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:21,439
the originator code

1756
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:21,440
and uh that way like um

1757
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:25,519
that way what we would do is say

1758
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,960
look

1759
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,480
in the case where the originator code

1760
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,279
was occupied then the thing we moved to

1761
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:32,638
could be occupied or unoccupied so we

1762
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:35,920
just say

1763
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:37,840
uh occupied is one unoccupied is two

1764
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,760
so then when we do the move we just test

1765
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,440
to make sure that like all right if you

1766
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,920
are coming from an unoccupied you're a

1767
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:45,919
two so you can't move into a one you can

1768
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,119
only move into a two which would be this

1769
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,440
right

1770
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:52,880
if you are occupied you can move into an

1771
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:56,319
occupied or an unoccupied so we use

1772
01:25:52,880 --> 01:26:01,039
again greater than or equal to right

1773
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:01,039
for pushing uh on at the beginning oops

1774
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,880
now we have a clear path here as well

1775
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:09,839
which is to say that we can just pass a

1776
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:11,679
1 there or a zero right which just says

1777
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,239
that it doesn't matter what happens

1778
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:17,039
you're gonna move right

1779
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:19,279
um so that's kind of handy because now

1780
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:20,479
like all that stuff makes reasonable

1781
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:23,479
sense

1782
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:23,479
right

1783
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,719
okay

1784
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:30,320
so now i

1785
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:34,359
think that handles um

1786
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:34,359
embed codes just fine

1787
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:46,079
it wouldn't require repulsion here

1788
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:48,559
meaning this will just find if there's a

1789
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:51,559
way to get out it'll find it

1790
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,560
um

1791
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:59,840
the problem is only in the best distance

1792
01:26:57,198 --> 01:26:59,839
calculation

1793
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:05,840
so i think actually this code doesn't

1794
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:05,840
need to be here anymore

1795
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:19,039
i think this is now just entirely

1796
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:20,799
correct the search just works

1797
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:23,439
everything's fine

1798
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:26,000
the only problem with this code now

1799
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:27,599
is we want it to pick the closest point

1800
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,158
to the embedded

1801
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,159
location

1802
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:33,840
right

1803
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,320
so we don't really want to allow you to

1804
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,520
move in a direction we want you to now

1805
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:39,039
have to be

1806
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:42,400
searching for

1807
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:44,639
the closest point to you

1808
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:44,638
um

1809
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:51,439
and so that's a little tougher

1810
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:54,079
because it means that push voxel stack

1811
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:56,319
needs like an if statement here

1812
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:56,319
um

1813
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:02,639
and the problem is we almost want to do

1814
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:07,520
the test early

1815
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:07,520
so so like we kind of want to do

1816
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:15,839
this

1817
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,800
and

1818
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,079
in the event that we find

1819
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,320
here

1820
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:24,319
uh

1821
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:30,639
we probably want to do this test and get

1822
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:32,479
the repulsion vector

1823
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,400
and actually make that be the movement

1824
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:36,000
direction so we're just looking in the

1825
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:41,158
direction of the repulsion for some

1826
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,158
place to put us roughly um

1827
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,760
so so i honestly feel like we kind of

1828
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:51,359
have to do this

1829
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,360
right so so when we do

1830
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:57,840
the voxel start p

1831
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,840
um we kind of want this

1832
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:10,480
if it's occupied then 2p

1833
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:12,960
uh is just going to be equal to

1834
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:12,959
from p

1835
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:18,159
right

1836
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,039
and

1837
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:21,759
this part here

1838
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:25,198
is

1839
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:28,560
the only change that we make is we only

1840
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:28,559
do this code

1841
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:38,920
the found best code

1842
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:38,920
we only do that if we were unembedded

1843
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,639
and so now rather than have those in

1844
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:47,119
there we should be able to do like

1845
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:49,920
an occupy code

1846
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:51,439
thing here which is like occupy

1847
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,840
untested

1848
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:53,839
occupy

1849
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:07,198
like filled and occupy open or something

1850
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:09,600
something like that

1851
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:12,158
um and so here you know we set these

1852
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,840
equal to these uh so that now the code

1853
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:16,319
we can just make the code more readable

1854
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,639
like instead of two you know it's occupy

1855
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:18,639
open

1856
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:24,079
um instead of uh zero

1857
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:26,079
it's occupy untested

1858
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:29,079
and then up here uh

1859
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:33,158
we just you know put those in

1860
01:30:29,079 --> 01:30:33,158
there um

1861
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:40,079
right

1862
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:41,839
and just a little bit clearer

1863
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:44,840
what's happening there

1864
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,840
um

1865
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:54,158
c is just c plus plus is the worst just

1866
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,960
freaking

1867
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:56,960
deal with it dude

1868
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:01,439
enum typing is like complete garbage and

1869
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:03,840
see

1870
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:06,319
um so i think that would work

1871
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:08,239
uh for embedding as well

1872
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:11,119
um and i think we're basically out of

1873
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:14,638
time so i'll call it there but

1874
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:17,198
next week we'll just go ahead and and uh

1875
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:18,800
tighten up this this code

1876
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:19,919
uh but i think this is probably much

1877
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,400
better

1878
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:26,679
than it was right um

1879
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:26,679
i think this is in much better shape

1880
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:39,039
way simpler um

1881
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,679
much easier to understand

1882
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:43,119
and i think it will be like

1883
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:44,560
better too

1884
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:48,399
because it means that for like the same

1885
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:50,880
amount of testing you could use a um

1886
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:53,279
a more refined grid

1887
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:55,279
because you're not doing like

1888
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:56,800
all of this thinking about corners which

1889
01:31:55,279 --> 01:32:00,559
is going to make it be less efficient

1890
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:02,560
right um so yeah so i think this will be

1891
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,159
good uh the only thing we now have to do

1892
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,280
is actually go do the part i was talking

1893
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:08,479
about before

1894
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:10,559
uh where we only test uh at aligned

1895
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:12,718
corners which we're not doing at the

1896
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,239
moment right so the bug that we're

1897
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,079
talking about originally will should

1898
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:17,678
still be in there it's not showing up at

1899
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:21,039
the immediate moment but

1900
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:22,639
uh the reason for that is because um we

1901
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:25,198
disabled the code for checking it we now

1902
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:26,960
allow things to get unembedded so the

1903
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:29,519
bug is there

1904
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:31,760
uh but we're just not

1905
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,760
um

1906
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:37,519
seeing it right

1907
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:41,360
um so yeah we got a bunch of stuff to do

1908
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:42,639
and we will do it but

1909
01:32:41,359 --> 01:32:44,799
that's the issue so i'm gonna put it to

1910
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:47,760
do in here

1911
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,560
so when we do this collides at p

1912
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,560
um

1913
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:55,480
and and maybe we don't even maybe i

1914
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,480
shouldn't say that maybe we just do like

1915
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:02,000
an align to movement voxel

1916
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:05,880
so

1917
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,880
we always do this

1918
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:42,238
so that way we know like we're always

1919
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:44,399
going to test the position as if it was

1920
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:46,879
at the center of its movement voxel so

1921
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:48,319
that way we don't ever have like that

1922
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,000
particular bug

1923
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:52,399
um

1924
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,479
and you know again so it shouldn't

1925
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:56,479
really change anything the only thing

1926
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:58,638
that you will see is now you'll notice

1927
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:00,319
you notice how like where things are is

1928
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:02,159
slightly offset from where they are

1929
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:03,759
tested so like you could see how the

1930
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:04,799
white

1931
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,600
collision

1932
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,880
diagrams don't exactly line up with the

1933
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:13,039
blue collision volumes

1934
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:15,840
that is that snapping and again that

1935
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:19,519
snapping is to ensure that our numerical

1936
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:21,440
accuracy is doesn't matter um and are

1937
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:23,440
like we don't have to be careful about

1938
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:25,599
those things we're always going to test

1939
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:27,198
apples to apples even

1940
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:29,280
in the most extreme scenario because

1941
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:33,519
we're just forcing everyone to just be

1942
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:36,238
where their voxel is right

1943
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:38,719
um so more work to do definitely but

1944
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:40,079
getting there rapidly um i'm starting to

1945
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,439
really like this collision detector i

1946
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:43,679
think it's going to be pretty good at

1947
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:44,879
the end of the day

1948
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,319
it just takes a while to get there

1949
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,600
because it's a complicated problem and

1950
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:49,519
you want you have to kind of think it

1951
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:52,320
through and see opportunities as they

1952
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,320
arise and so on

1953
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:58,000
so yeah

1954
01:34:56,158 --> 01:34:59,118
obviously

1955
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,439
again

1956
01:34:59,118 --> 01:35:02,639
you you definitely uh

1957
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:04,559
need the spatial partition though to

1958
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:06,480
make it be not too slow um so that's

1959
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,400
something we're going to have to do

1960
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:09,439
um but other than that

1961
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:10,960
um

1962
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:12,238
relatively optimistic about it i would

1963
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:15,239
like to be able to turn off the

1964
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:15,238
diagramming

1965
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:18,479
but i don't have a button for that right

1966
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:22,359
now

1967
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:22,359
we should have had one

1968
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:32,479
so like in the editor code

1969
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:32,479
uh

1970
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:47,119
i actually don't remember what this is

1971
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:47,118
supposed to do but like this

1972
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,960
um

1973
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:11,840
so like this

1974
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:18,198
i feel like we need some kind of a

1975
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:18,198
global for

1976
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,920
um

1977
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,319
so you know something like

1978
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,079
this

1979
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:04,560
where you just disable diagrams by

1980
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:05,519
pushing some button

1981
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,480
and

1982
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,480
it just does

1983
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:20,439
something like that

1984
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,319
i think that's probably the easiest way

1985
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:26,319
to do it not sure

1986
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:33,199
apparently not

1987
01:37:31,118 --> 01:37:36,319
because while that that doesn't seem to

1988
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:36,319
actually do the reset

1989
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:45,679
maybe i'm misinterpreting what that

1990
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:49,039
actually does

1991
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:52,480
oh that's got the yeah

1992
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:52,479
that's got this garbage in there

1993
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,920
um

1994
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:11,639
we really should have a way of

1995
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:11,639
controlling that part of things

1996
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:33,039
i'm assuming that roughly what should

1997
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:35,759
happen there is the

1998
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:40,118
maybe there should be like a

1999
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,119
a thing here where it's like

2000
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:51,880
like a capture frame count something

2001
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:51,880
like that

2002
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:02,638
you know what i mean

2003
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:02,638
uh

2004
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:08,158
so like you set that

2005
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,440
capture frame count

2006
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:10,879
maybe that's the right thing to do

2007
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:12,479
because then you can just set that up to

2008
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:15,520
how many frames you want to capture and

2009
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:17,759
that's what you have right

2010
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,600
um and i guess the

2011
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,039
you know one annoying thing is we would

2012
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:24,079
like to be able to set the capture frame

2013
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:24,079
count to something

2014
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,560
um originally

2015
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,760
but

2016
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:53,000
this should be good enough

2017
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:20,199
i don't actually remember what that is i

2018
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,199
think it's the step

2019
01:40:23,039 --> 01:40:25,359
um

2020
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:36,319
so anyway um so in theory now like we

2021
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:39,118
could do a thing where we like capture

2022
01:40:36,319 --> 01:40:41,198
more frames

2023
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:43,599
like so

2024
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:45,519
um it's a little weird though that it

2025
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:49,880
doesn't i guess because reset it's

2026
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:49,880
always going to capture like one frame

2027
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:55,279
because that reset gets called at the

2028
01:40:53,118 --> 01:40:57,519
end

2029
01:40:55,279 --> 01:40:57,519
right

2030
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:08,239
so disabled diagrams is not really going

2031
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,520
to do anything

2032
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:10,399
but

2033
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,840
yeah

2034
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:13,279
we'll take a look at that next time

2035
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,199
we'll have to provide better controls

2036
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:19,000
for the diagramming

2037
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:19,000
than what we have at the moment

2038
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,158
you can see like how slow it gets down

2039
01:41:38,479 --> 01:41:41,599
here right so you can see like that the

2040
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:43,519
collision detector just takes all the

2041
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,800
time right

2042
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,440
because this was previously running

2043
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:49,600
nicely and smoothly

2044
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:52,638
so the spatial partition is a must-have

2045
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,719
and maybe we'll put that in soon

2046
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:58,679
but i do just want to get this cleaned

2047
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:58,679
up a little bit more first

2048
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,920
you

2049
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:34,159
i wonder what i should do about the fact

2050
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:38,079
that you can go like the glove goes

2051
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:38,079
underneath these guys right

2052
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:42,719
because hey the collision detector

2053
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,239
figures out that you can put it

2054
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:47,039
underneath so when it tries to go under

2055
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:47,039
it just rolls off

2056
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,840
anyway

2057
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:56,319
all right so we'll clean that up next

2058
01:42:53,520 --> 01:43:00,280
week um but otherwise i think we're good

2059
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:00,279
any questions about that

2060
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,840
chat was too quiet

2061
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:24,560
be careful what you wish for technic

2062
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:27,119
beam

2063
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:29,360
there was 330 viewers it looks like so

2064
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:31,118
it was a fairly normal

2065
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:34,238
number of people watching i guess they

2066
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:34,238
just didn't have much to say

2067
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,679
or twitch chat is broken and they're all

2068
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:44,400
like frantically typing but

2069
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:46,480
it's like just going into devnull

2070
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:50,359
or something

2071
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:50,359
so you never see it

2072
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:09,840
yeah so uh

2073
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:12,000
just to be clear about uh mine mark 42

2074
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:14,400
the problem that we have with things

2075
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,560
moving um that i was trying to explain

2076
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:19,759
earlier was just that

2077
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:22,480
we are using the corners of voxels to

2078
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:26,239
determine we were using the corners of

2079
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:26,238
voxels and looking at them

2080
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,560
and

2081
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:32,158
we then said if you could be placed

2082
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,159
inside this voxel because like one of

2083
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:36,238
the corners was open that meant that you

2084
01:44:34,158 --> 01:44:38,319
could sit be somewhere in the voxel at

2085
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:40,718
least then we allow you to be in that

2086
01:44:38,319 --> 01:44:42,880
voxel

2087
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:44,800
the way we test the corners is we were

2088
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:46,239
testing if you could put the entity at

2089
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,039
those corners

2090
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:50,638
against entities in their actual final

2091
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:52,719
resting positions which are placed by

2092
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:55,359
the refinement algorithm

2093
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:57,679
which means that the refinement

2094
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:59,599
algorithm

2095
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:01,440
and the corner testing are completely

2096
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,039
different so depending on whether you're

2097
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:05,519
the person moving

2098
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:07,519
or the person being moved against you're

2099
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:09,760
using completely different tests

2100
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,280
so it's trivial to get two objects if

2101
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:13,440
they're both moving

2102
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:15,519
to be placed in a way such that from

2103
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:17,359
either of their perspectives they are

2104
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,520
both colliding

2105
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:22,079
right or rather from one of their

2106
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,159
perspectives they are now embedded

2107
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:26,238
because when the second person moved

2108
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:28,799
they placed the object in a place that

2109
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:30,718
would invalidate all of the corners of

2110
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:32,800
the person against whom they're moving

2111
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:35,600
because the place where the person was

2112
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:37,199
actually placed doesn't happen to be one

2113
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,719
of those corners

2114
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:40,799
so what i wanted to do instead is switch

2115
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:42,158
to a system where we always test voxel

2116
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,840
centers

2117
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:46,399
and everything is always considered to

2118
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,679
be at its voxel center so the test is

2119
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:49,118
always the same

2120
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:51,840
and then when we do our refinement

2121
01:45:49,118 --> 01:45:53,439
movement we do do allow you to place

2122
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:55,679
things continuously so it doesn't like

2123
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:56,559
snap as it moves around

2124
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:59,440
but

2125
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:01,679
when we place it there it's only visual

2126
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:03,359
so we we put it there visually

2127
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:07,440
but where we actually do the collision

2128
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:09,679
check is still where the voxel is

2129
01:46:07,439 --> 01:46:11,599
that's why i align it back so that way

2130
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:14,079
everybody who ever does a collision test

2131
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,840
always tests each other based on the

2132
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:19,719
center of the voxel

2133
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:19,719
and we know that it's the same

2134
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:29,759
i don't think i do have chat set to

2135
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,439
subscriber only because there's tons of

2136
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,440
non-subscribers posting so i think it's

2137
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:34,439
just

2138
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:44,719
how much verticality is there going to

2139
01:46:43,118 --> 01:46:46,319
be because gameplay-wise you may end up

2140
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:47,520
restricting election to a plane uh no we

2141
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:48,559
don't have to restrict question to a

2142
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:54,000
plane

2143
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:55,199
you can just be totally free with that

2144
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,520
don't know if we'll use it but the

2145
01:46:55,198 --> 01:46:58,799
engine allows you to use it so we we

2146
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:01,440
don't have that restriction in the

2147
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:03,360
gameplay you're allowed to

2148
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:04,238
um

2149
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:06,238
to

2150
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:08,879
have collision work

2151
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:11,759
vertically

2152
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,520
uh won't won't that result in clipping

2153
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:16,159
uh clipping

2154
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:18,560
what is clipping in this case

2155
01:47:16,158 --> 01:47:20,638
clipping is like

2156
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:23,840
a

2157
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:23,840
very nebulous term

2158
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:28,238
it really got corrupted because what

2159
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:31,039
happened was

2160
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:33,279
because quake uses a bsp

2161
01:47:31,039 --> 01:47:34,158
carmack used to use the term

2162
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:37,439
clip

2163
01:47:34,158 --> 01:47:39,759
into the bsp to for collision because

2164
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:41,279
you would push a point through the bsp

2165
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:43,199
and you would clip it

2166
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:45,359
in the way that you normally think of

2167
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:46,399
clipping you clip the movement so when

2168
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:47,759
you turn

2169
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:49,839
when you wanted to move everywhere you

2170
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,679
turned on no

2171
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:54,960
but but that's like not the right term

2172
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:54,960
right so but

2173
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:06,960
ah okay so uh no i don't think it does

2174
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,760
because we check based on the center

2175
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:11,279
um

2176
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:13,600
only to the extent that we uh

2177
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:16,000
want to collide against something

2178
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,520
but when something's moving we adjust

2179
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,198
its position

2180
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,719
uh

2181
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:22,158
we do the collision checks on the

2182
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:24,399
position as well

2183
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:27,439
so when we we start at the center and we

2184
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:29,920
say allow the thing to move inside the

2185
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:31,359
voxel that it's in up to the point where

2186
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,840
it would collide with something and no

2187
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:35,039
further

2188
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,520
right

2189
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:39,519
so you can't get inside a wall because

2190
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:41,440
as it tries to place the thing it won't

2191
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:43,280
allow it to get any closer to the wall

2192
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:44,960
than if it was colliding

2193
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:47,599
so everyone's still checking for

2194
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:50,719
collision it's just that when you

2195
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:53,600
actually do your versus your collision

2196
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:55,198
checks versus each other

2197
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,760
we do adjust you to the center of the

2198
01:48:55,198 --> 01:48:59,118
voxel because we want it to always be

2199
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,440
the same

2200
01:48:59,118 --> 01:49:04,079
the voxel has to be small enough that

2201
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:05,919
the displacement of the wall

2202
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:07,519
won't be so much

2203
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,199
that you could

2204
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:10,800
dramatically

2205
01:49:09,198 --> 01:49:11,839
you know like if the voxels were very

2206
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,440
large

2207
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,639
then you could see that allowing you to

2208
01:49:13,439 --> 01:49:16,479
put yourself

2209
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:17,679
significantly inside a wall because it's

2210
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:19,919
like well

2211
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:22,239
we're gonna pretend the wall is very far

2212
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:24,480
away from where it actually is

2213
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:26,319
um but because the voxel is very small

2214
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:29,839
relative to the size of the sprites that

2215
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:29,840
really isn't a concern right

2216
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,679
um yeah i knew you could do something

2217
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:50,079
about enum types but i didn't know what

2218
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:50,079
spec that was in so i never use it um

2219
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,479
i am usually loathe to add anything

2220
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,719
that's a new c plus feature because

2221
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:02,158
usually what happens is if you use it it

2222
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,719
sucks

2223
01:50:02,158 --> 01:50:06,479
um in ways that you don't know about yet

2224
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:08,000
so you try to start using it thinking it

2225
01:50:06,479 --> 01:50:09,839
will be reasonable and then it turns out

2226
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,158
like all your code breaks because it

2227
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:13,279
actually isn't reasonable

2228
01:50:12,158 --> 01:50:14,479
um

2229
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:17,359
so

2230
01:50:14,479 --> 01:50:18,799
i haven't tried that yet i'm usually

2231
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:20,880
very skeptical about those sorts of

2232
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:23,440
things but if that's now widely

2233
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:23,440
supported

2234
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:28,119
i might consider it

2235
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:45,440
like uh i think what you're saying is

2236
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:45,439
that it would allow me to do

2237
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:55,198
that

2238
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:55,199
right

2239
01:50:57,679 --> 01:50:59,920
um

2240
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,198
so like ah

2241
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:09,599
maybe um

2242
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,719
i again i'm usually very very like

2243
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:13,039
skeptical

2244
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:13,039
uh

2245
01:51:13,198 --> 01:51:20,719
so i tend unless i really need a feature

2246
01:51:16,319 --> 01:51:20,719
in c plus i usually won't add it

2247
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:24,559
because

2248
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:28,159
almost every time i've ever tried to do

2249
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:28,159
that it ends up being a bad idea

2250
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:30,718
so

2251
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:33,598
you know

2252
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:36,399
do i really need that piece of code no

2253
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:39,440
so i probably would just leave it out

2254
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:41,118
um but you know

2255
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:44,000
it may be one of the rare c plus

2256
01:51:41,118 --> 01:51:46,158
features that isn't totally awful um

2257
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,479
but i don't usually like to bet on that

2258
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:49,839
so since i normally don't care

2259
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:51,039
like normally you don't have this

2260
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:53,440
problem because normally you're not

2261
01:51:51,039 --> 01:51:54,399
putting things in a u8 so you're usually

2262
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:55,519
okay

2263
01:51:54,399 --> 01:51:56,399
um

2264
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,840
but

2265
01:51:56,399 --> 01:51:59,839
it is one of the things that sucks about

2266
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:00,880
the original way c was defined so you

2267
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:02,400
know

2268
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:04,159
it's not like c did that right and c

2269
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:07,158
plus did it totally wrong or something

2270
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:07,158
but

2271
01:52:16,399 --> 01:52:22,519
i i headless course i have never uh

2272
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:22,520
corpse i've never read that book

2273
01:52:59,359 --> 01:53:02,000
what is the reason that things like sim

2274
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:04,159
region get passed around instead of

2275
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,639
plucking it from a global variable um

2276
01:53:04,158 --> 01:53:09,198
the reason is because uh you might have

2277
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:11,520
more than one of them

2278
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:13,598
like we we even did that because we have

2279
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,719
a thing that we don't like leave it on

2280
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:16,079
right now but we have a thing that

2281
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:17,039
allows you to do multi-threaded region

2282
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:18,399
updates

2283
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:20,960
where like you can update multiple

2284
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:22,319
regions of the world at the same time

2285
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,840
like you could imagine if you had like a

2286
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:25,039
multiplayer situation where like one

2287
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,000
player was in one place and another

2288
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:27,039
player was in another place they're

2289
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,760
completely separate and you wanted to

2290
01:53:27,039 --> 01:53:31,519
update both of them

2291
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:34,000
so the reason i generally don't put

2292
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:37,119
things in global variables is for that

2293
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:39,359
reason most things

2294
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:42,479
have at least a slight risk

2295
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:46,000
of needing to have two or three

2296
01:53:42,479 --> 01:53:47,839
you know if not a hundred right

2297
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,880
and so it's pretty rare that i don't

2298
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:53,760
want to pass in

2299
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:55,599
just at least one pointer that's like

2300
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,800
here's the context that you're operating

2301
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:59,279
in

2302
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:02,560
and yeah it's sort of a global

2303
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:04,800
but it's just not global enough that i

2304
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:06,800
don't want to have to go fix all the

2305
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:09,119
code

2306
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:10,480
because i usually know i'm like yep once

2307
01:54:09,118 --> 01:54:13,279
in a while i'm going to want to have two

2308
01:54:10,479 --> 01:54:14,238
of these live or something right

2309
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:17,359
so

2310
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:18,718
it's like a global and i treat it like a

2311
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:21,359
global

2312
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:23,520
but i just want it passed in because i

2313
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:26,880
know that sometimes i need more than one

2314
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:28,480
in flight not a thousand but you know a

2315
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:31,480
couple

2316
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:31,479
so

2317
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:55,759
all right

2318
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,760
looks like we're

2319
01:54:57,359 --> 01:55:00,759
we're good here

2320
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,560
all right thank you everyone for joining

2321
01:55:15,198 --> 01:55:18,079
me for the episode of handmade hero it's

2322
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,440

2324
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:23,439
series at home you can always pre-order

2325
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:25,679
the game on handmadehero.org it comes

2326
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:28,719
with the source code

2327
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:30,480
um so that you can

2328
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:31,279

2331
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:36,559
collision stuff like i just kind of put

try yourself to kind of like

2338
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:46,639
iron out the the rough parts of the code

2339
01:55:45,279 --> 01:55:50,319
before i do

2340
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:52,639
um you can give it a shot right

may be

2346
01:56:01,198 --> 01:56:04,479

um

2355
01:56:19,118 --> 01:56:22,000
yeah it went very well went way better

2356
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:24,480
than we were expecting

2357
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,079
um to say the least it's almost 300

2358
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:27,359
percent of the of the goals that's

2359
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:29,439
pretty cool but

2360
01:56:27,359 --> 01:56:30,479

that's about it for this week

2369
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:49,039
because it is still the last week of

2370
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:50,479
kickstarter i will be doing um some more

2371
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:52,719
stuff

2372
01:56:50,479 --> 01:56:52,718
um

2373
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:56,079
this week that are kickstarter related

2374
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:58,800
because like i just been doing a lot of

2375
01:56:56,079 --> 01:56:59,760
streams for publicity uh right for doing

2376
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:00,960
pr

2377
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,079
to let people know the kickstarter is

2378
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,359
available and to check it out and all

2379
01:57:02,079 --> 01:57:06,238
that

2380
01:57:03,359 --> 01:57:07,118
and uh there will be some more of that

2381
01:57:06,238 --> 01:57:09,519
so

2382
01:57:07,118 --> 01:57:11,118
there will be at least

2383
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:12,400
two more streams

2384
01:57:11,118 --> 01:57:13,679
on

2385
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:14,879
tuesday

2386
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:17,118
morning

2387
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:19,199
uh there will be a stream

2388
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:22,000
um that will be another lecture kind of

2389
01:57:19,198 --> 01:57:25,678
like the university of tuenta lecture

2390
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:27,359
um for a company asked me on the east

2391
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:30,000
coast if i would do

2392
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:32,880
um a presentation

2393
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,599
to to their company

2394
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:37,359
um not exactly sure why but that's just

2395
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:39,199
something that happens companies ask you

2396
01:57:37,359 --> 01:57:40,880
to give talks sometimes i don't know

2397
01:57:39,198 --> 01:57:42,238
normally i say no but

2398
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:44,400
in this case it's during the kickstarter

2399
01:57:42,238 --> 01:57:46,399
so you know during the kickstarter i'm

2400
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:47,920
doing pr stuff i'm happy to do talks

2401
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:49,279
because

2402
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:51,279
part of my job description during the

2403
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:53,519
kickstarter is you know to

2404
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:54,960
to do pr right

2405
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,880
so uh

2406
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:59,599
that's gonna happen tuesday morning the

2407
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:00,960
topic is still not necessarily

2408
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:02,000
determined i

2409
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,480
have

2410
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,760
a list of topics they were interested in

2411
01:58:04,479 --> 01:58:09,279
because i asked them uh and i don't have

2412
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:10,880
to pick one from there but i probably

2413
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:12,399
will because i find it's usually better

2414
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,359
if i just like find out what the people

2415
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:15,279
who are

2416
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:17,279
at that company are like interested in

2417
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:18,079
of the stuff that i do

2418
01:58:17,279 --> 01:58:20,639
so

2419
01:58:18,079 --> 01:58:23,279
i i don't quite know yet

2420
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:25,199
but it'll probably either be about

2421
01:58:23,279 --> 01:58:28,479
cryptocurrency stuff

2422
01:58:25,198 --> 01:58:29,759
or it will be about uh

2423
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:32,079
like

2424
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:34,960
the 30 million line problem

2425
01:58:32,079 --> 01:58:36,158
kind of stuff

2426
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,439
um

2427
01:58:36,158 --> 01:58:41,198
so we'll see

2428
01:58:37,439 --> 01:58:43,359
but that'll be tuesday morning

2429
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:44,799
and yeah it'll it'll be

2430
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:47,519
uh

2431
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,119
it'll be the well dj terfel the the goal

2432
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:50,880
is to allow you to pay a lot more money

2433
01:58:49,118 --> 01:58:52,559
for those

2434
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,480
that's what starco galaxy is it's just

2435
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:57,039
we're still in development

2436
01:58:54,479 --> 01:59:01,479
right so you can't have it yet

2437
01:58:57,039 --> 01:59:01,479
for that reason it's uh

2438
01:59:05,198 --> 01:59:10,158
uh it's coming right uh

2439
01:59:08,158 --> 01:59:12,238
i everyone's been asking for it for like

2440
01:59:10,158 --> 01:59:14,158
seven years now or something six years

2441
01:59:12,238 --> 01:59:16,158
however long i've been doing this for uh

2442
01:59:14,158 --> 01:59:17,439
and i'm finally doing it it's just very

2443
01:59:16,158 --> 01:59:19,679
very

2444
01:59:17,439 --> 01:59:19,678
um

2445
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:25,440
it's very time intensive for me because

2446
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:27,599
i wanted to do a good job

2447
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:29,198
like like when it goes from being me

2448
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:31,199
just sitting up in front of a blackboard

2449
01:59:29,198 --> 01:59:33,359
randomly saying stuff

2450
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:34,719
to this is actually a course that you're

2451
01:59:33,359 --> 01:59:35,920
going to pay for

2452
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:38,480
right

2453
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:40,639
i want it to be a certain quality level

2454
01:59:38,479 --> 01:59:42,799
and i want to explore

2455
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:46,159
certain possibilities that

2456
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:46,159
you know require time

2457
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:50,480
so it's just it's like anything i do

2458
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:52,079
it's a long development process because

2459
01:59:50,479 --> 01:59:54,799
i don't just crap out the first thing i

2460
01:59:52,079 --> 01:59:57,519
think of so like you know

2461
01:59:54,800 --> 02:00:01,119
that's the thing

2462
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:01,119
but uh we're working on it

2463
02:00:08,399 --> 02:00:12,638
handmade hero does work on linux if you

2464
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:14,480
use community ports of it there are

2465
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:16,719
people who have ported it to linux but i

2466
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:18,718
don't maintain a linux port so that kind

2467
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:21,719
of depends on you

2468
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:21,719
right

2469
02:00:32,319 --> 02:00:34,719
um

2470
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:38,000
yeah

2471
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:41,679
anyway uh i was supposed to be signing

2472
02:00:40,238 --> 02:00:42,479
off and here i am talking about more

2473
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:44,960
stuff

2474
02:00:42,479 --> 02:00:47,439
no point being

2475
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:49,118
so yeah please check out the kickstarter

2476
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:51,039
if you haven't already

2477
02:00:49,118 --> 02:00:52,960
uh star code galaxy which just came up

2478
02:00:51,039 --> 02:00:55,118
it's just starcodegalaxy.com

2479
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:56,560
right um and you can sign up for the

2480
02:00:55,118 --> 02:00:59,279
mailing list but that's going to be the

2481
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:01,039
place where you will uh

2482
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:04,479
actually find

2483
02:01:01,039 --> 02:01:05,519
the full set of like everything

2484
02:01:04,479 --> 02:01:08,879
um

2485
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:11,199
that uh

2486
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:12,800
basically like a here's my idea of how

2487
02:01:11,198 --> 02:01:14,960
you learned a program

2488
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:16,719
right like actually learned a program

2489
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:18,960
not like the fake learn to program that

2490
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:20,480
people do when they get a cs degree

2491
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:23,679
and not the fake learner program that

2492
02:01:20,479 --> 02:01:27,198
people do when they like go watch some

2493
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:28,719
crappy cpp con thing or take some

2494
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:31,359
seminar by someone who doesn't really

2495
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:32,158
program right

2496
02:01:31,359 --> 02:01:34,799
um

2497
02:01:32,158 --> 02:01:36,000
so starcode galaxy is like this is how i

2498
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:37,279
think you actually learned a program

2499
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,439
like if you actually want to know how to

2500
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:40,719
program this is how i this is how you do

2501
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:42,559
it

2502
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:44,399
um and

2503
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:46,239
like i said it's a very big undertaking

2504
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:47,359
it's been extremely difficult

2505
02:01:46,238 --> 02:01:48,799
uh

2506
02:01:47,359 --> 02:01:51,118
i basically had to move on to it full

2507
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:53,760
time because there's so much stuff to do

2508
02:01:51,118 --> 02:01:55,118
uh but i'm hoping that you know at least

2509
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:57,360
at that point it'll just be like okay

2510
02:01:55,118 --> 02:01:59,598
look here it is and we're done so like

2511
02:01:57,359 --> 02:02:01,679
anyone who wants it it's there now i

2512
02:01:59,599 --> 02:02:03,679
don't have to keep saying i don't know

2513
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:05,520
uh where you would go to learn it

2514
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:06,719
because obviously people ask me all the

2515
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:08,480
time and that's what i have to say i'm

2516
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:09,760
like i don't know i i don't know how you

2517
02:02:08,479 --> 02:02:11,279
learned a program

2518
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:12,960
currently because i there are no

2519
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:14,559
resources out there that are very good

2520
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:17,359
right

2521
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:20,400
so this will just be like look

2522
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:22,479
this is now you ask me this is my answer

2523
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:24,079
i can definitively say that i think this

2524
02:02:22,479 --> 02:02:25,598
is how you should learn to program you

2525
02:02:24,079 --> 02:02:28,158
know that doesn't mean i'm right but at

2526
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:30,960
least now i have an answer right and and

2527
02:02:28,158 --> 02:02:33,519
i can just be like this is the answer

2528
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:34,399
for me is this

2529
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:36,080
um

2530
02:02:34,399 --> 02:02:38,638
but yeah like i said it involved

2531
02:02:36,079 --> 02:02:40,800
creating a lot of new technology uh tons

2532
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:42,880
of stuff that no one's done before or at

2533
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:45,520
least i've never seen anyone do before

2534
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:46,560
and when you push into that space

2535
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:48,159
you end up

2536
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:50,880
having a lot of work to do and a lot of

2537
02:02:48,158 --> 02:02:52,319
experimentation so even though the final

2538
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:53,599
thing that comes out

2539
02:02:52,319 --> 02:02:55,039
maybe is something you could have built

2540
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:56,960
in six months

2541
02:02:55,039 --> 02:03:00,880
you had to spend two years experimenting

2542
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:02,000
to get there right um

2543
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:03,840
and so

2544
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,039
uh

2545
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:07,279
yeah it's just a slow development

2546
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:09,039
process and at the at this point now i'm

2547
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:11,519
in in the phase of building the back end

2548
02:03:09,039 --> 02:03:12,880
stuff because uh that turned out to be a

2549
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:14,639
big issue as well

2550
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,239
just how do you deploy it how do you

2551
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:18,239
update it how do you have other people

2552
02:03:16,238 --> 02:03:19,678
be able to use the tools to do things

2553
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:21,039
all these sorts of things are like

2554
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:22,000
actual issues

2555
02:03:21,039 --> 02:03:24,880
and

2556
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:27,279
i was not big surprise happy with any of

2557
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:29,279
the web stuff i found that i really

2558
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:31,519
didn't feel like it would be any good

2559
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:34,000
um i mean that's kind of obvious just

2560
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:34,800
use the web you can tell it sucks

2561
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,319
so

2562
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:37,199
we're working on it

2563
02:03:36,319 --> 02:03:39,198
um

2564
02:03:37,198 --> 02:03:40,319
it'll be done when it's done

2565
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:41,759
if you sign up for the mailing list

2566
02:03:40,319 --> 02:03:43,279
we'll do our best to notify you but our

2567
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:45,599
mailing list goes to spam all the time

2568
02:03:43,279 --> 02:03:47,359
because google sucks and can't program

2569
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:49,840
and so does hotmail

2570
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:50,639
or microsoft big surprise there

2571
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,078
um

2572
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:54,719
if you know it

2573
02:03:52,078 --> 02:03:56,238
the people who who work on gmail could

2574
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:57,920
maybe take the class and learn to

2575
02:03:56,238 --> 02:03:59,598
program but the problem is they'll never

2576
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:01,279
receive the email that lets them know

2577
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:02,800
that the class is ready because they

2578
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:04,960
program so poorly that it just goes to

2579
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:06,800
their spam folder right

2580
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:09,679
so it's kind of a it's kind of a weird

2581
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:11,039
like unfortunate situation where like

2582
02:04:09,679 --> 02:04:12,960
the people who should probably take the

2583
02:04:11,039 --> 02:04:14,880
class and learn to code are so bad at

2584
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,239
programming that they wrote programs

2585
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:17,359
that don't let them get the emails that

2586
02:04:16,238 --> 02:04:19,759
let them know that now they could learn

2587
02:04:17,359 --> 02:04:23,399
to program

2588
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:23,400
you know what can you do

2589
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:29,440
uh but we're working on that we switched

2590
02:04:27,279 --> 02:04:31,599
our email backend provider

2591
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:33,519
uh and we're going to try and send the

2592
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:35,360
emails more regularly so once every two

2593
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:37,520
weeks or so so that we build up a

2594
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:39,039
reputation

2595
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:41,040
which you now need

2596
02:04:39,039 --> 02:04:42,960
this is my favorite part so like in

2597
02:04:41,039 --> 02:04:44,880
their infinitesimal wisdom

2598
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:46,880
um you know they they crawled out of

2599
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:49,039
their crib to program gmail

2600
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:51,599
spam filter and in their infinitesimal

2601
02:04:49,039 --> 02:04:53,439
wisdom what happens is the more you spam

2602
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:54,960
your users the more legitimate they

2603
02:04:53,439 --> 02:04:58,000
think you are

2604
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:59,679
so if you send email every week

2605
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,760
you're much less likely to be sent to

2606
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:03,279
spam than if you send email once every

2607
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:05,599
three months

2608
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:08,960
so the worst

2609
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:10,719
act the more you misbehave the more they

2610
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:13,039
think you are a good

2611
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:14,880
actor right

2612
02:05:13,039 --> 02:05:16,399
like you can't make this stuff up but

2613
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,400
that's really something that they do

2614
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:22,078
because they are just that bad at their

2615
02:05:18,399 --> 02:05:22,078
job right um

2616
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:27,760
so who knows maybe you'll get the email

2617
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:29,119
maybe you won't

2618
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:31,119
the people who definitely need to get

2619
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:33,439
the email definitely won't

2620
02:05:31,118 --> 02:05:35,279
uh so that's unfortunate

2621

foreign places where the banking system

02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:45,280
technology that we could build that

2657
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:48,320

2658
02:06:45,279 --> 02:06:49,118
