1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,710
all right hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:07,740
handmade here are the share we code a

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,629
complete game live on stream today I

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,759
wanted to kind of shift gears a little

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,530
bit because I think we've come to the

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,449
point lighting wise where we kind of

7
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:20,129
need to get more involved in the

8
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:24,859
geometry production side of things and

9
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:28,649
so you know I try on handmade hero to

10
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:30,150
break things up in sort of like to to

11
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:31,500
break things up into blocks where it's

12
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,558
like if we're doing lighting we try do

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,869
lighting for a couple weeks in a row

14
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,058
rather than bouncing back and forth

15
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,159
between you know different parts of the

16
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,780
engine that's not necessarily how I

17
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,159
would normally do stuff sometimes it is

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,239
and it does mirror the process a little

19
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,589
bit if I'm working on new lighting

20
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:48,390
algorithm obviously going to spend a lot

21
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,070
of hours working on a new lighting

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,489
algorithm and doing tests and so forth

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,738
but often times I'm bouncing around

24
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,179
through parts of the engine modifying

25
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,689
what needs to get modified next and

26
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,969
whatever and I would imagine like you

27
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,530
know I can't speak for other people

28
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,250
necessarily but I would imagine that

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,079
folks like John for example who's

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,170
streaming I know a lot of people watch

31
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,868
to watch this show I I feel like

32
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,340
typically speaking maybe not as much

33
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,950
when he's working on compiler stuff and

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,570
whatever but typically speaking when he

35
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,750
does a game because he's a game designer

36
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:26,908
and he does a lot of engine programming

37
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,430
I feel like it's probably even more

38
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,850
right like he probably bounces around

39
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,368
even more does you know totally kind of

40
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,798
random walks through the codebase where

41
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:39,390
he'll be like oh I want to work on this

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,829
gameplay thing I was thinking about and

43
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,849
oh but it needs this engine thing so

44
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:42,989
I'll do a little bit of that and then

45
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,158
I'll come back to the gameplay and I'll

46
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:45,780
see if that works and all that that

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,329
reminds me that this thing was broken

48
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,618
and right and so I feel like it is true

49
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:55,109
that generally speaking when you're

50
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,149
working on a project most of the time if

51
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:58,228
you're on a small team and you're

52
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,849
responsible for a lot of different

53
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:01,349
pieces you're gonna be bouncing around a

54
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,228
lot and so that's sort of where we're at

55
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:05,519
now I think and so we're gonna start for

56
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:08,580
the next few weeks we're probably

57
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,370
bouncing around quite a bit the goal is

58
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,810
to eventually get to the point where we

59
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,469
sort of have an idea of how our

60
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:20,650
world creation lighting movement all

61
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:23,199
work together and so we've put in a lot

62
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,870
of pieces for that individually but we

63
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,238
haven't really kind of taken the step of

64
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,000
like ok game make this an actual game

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,769
now that we're confident everything's

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,979
working together and so that's what I'm

67
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:37,450
gonna start trying to do today and this

68
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:39,818
is just gonna require us to go through

69
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:42,729
all sorts of parts of the code and clean

70
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:44,949
up lots of stuff and tune it to be what

71
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,568
we want and remove parts that turned out

72
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:49,839
to not be useful and all these are the

73
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:51,068
things so I do apologize for that making

74
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,099
a little bit harder to follow but

75
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:55,719
realistically speaking that's just how

76
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,729
programming actually works and in fact

77
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:02,109
it's a very common way that you might be

78
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:04,179
programming on a game and you know I try

79
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,680
to maybe make it a little less likely on

80
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,650
handmade hero simply because of the fact

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,879
that it's you know hard to keep track of

82
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:17,739
things if you're watching the series at

83
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:20,799
home but yeah so the first thing I want

84
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:23,920
to do is I'd like to take a minute to go

85
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,349
in and make the movement code and minute

86
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,969
I might mean multiple episodes I'd like

87
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:29,289
to go in and start to like lock down the

88
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:31,599
movement code a little bit and I'd like

89
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:35,048
to basically make it so it's easy for me

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,789
to move around my character and the

91
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,859
character right now doesn't have to be

92
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:40,389
anything in particular it can literally

93
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,579
just be that light source or whatever

94
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:45,219
but I want to feel like I think it

95
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,650
should feel in the game if that makes

96
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:49,719
sense and I'd like to be able to move

97
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,299
around pretty cleanly and have the

98
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,430
camera fall pretty cleanly and then I'd

99
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,859
like to start getting the lighting to

100
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,439
follow cleanly and the lighting points

101
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:03,040
to be aligned right with the cube based

102
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,079
geometry so that's like the first big

103
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,568
push and it's gonna take several weeks

104
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,030
to get there several because we only do

105
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:11,708
like what four hours a week of

106
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,530
programming so that's not very much

107
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:19,120
programming so if I like it take several

108
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,560
weeks to get there and but that's what

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,840
we kind of need to do because at this

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
point we we've got a lot of systems in

111
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,609
place and really the only way to finish

112
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,069
them is just to actually do the fly

113
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:34,270
stuff that we want there and see what

114
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:37,598
the requirements are and so that whole

115
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:40,500
set of things will do and then we will

116
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:44,168
have to do one more big thing after that

117
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,689
which is finalized sort of the way in

118
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:48,698
which the world building code works

119
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:50,199
right now the world building code is

120
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,990
completely standard we've literally

121
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,939
never spent any time on it on the series

122
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,408
we just spam stuff in there as we're

123
00:04:54,939 --> 00:05:00,729
trying to test and we've never done

124
00:04:56,408 --> 00:05:02,740
anything even remotely serious in that

125
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:05,860
branch of the code it's just a dumping

126
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,300
ground for whatever tests we're trying

127
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,300
to do at the moment we just spam

128
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,098
something in there that creates it but

129
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,718
basically after we get all of that stuff

130
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:16,329
working which is quite a considerable

131
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:17,860
push through the codebase to the way we

132
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:19,778
want it then we need to update that

133
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,259
world building code to be ready to

134
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:25,569
actually go do real-world building and

135
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,218
the reason that we need to have

136
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,968
something nice in place there is because

137
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:32,079
we have to be able to do stuff like

138
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:35,288
conveniently place entities in the world

139
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,829
and know whether things are connected to

140
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:41,500
other things and you know do reasonable

141
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:45,158
sort of accessing of the world to

142
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,038
produce what we want and we can't really

143
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:49,810
have anything in that system that's not

144
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,370
going to be efficient because as the

145
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,588
world gets generated fairly large

146
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,750
anything that was like N squared or

147
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:57,459
anything like that is going to

148
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,528
immediately roll over and die

149
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:01,628
so we'll you know it will sort of give

150
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:04,810
us a chance to sort of proof all of

151
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:07,389
those pieces so that's what we're doing

152
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,848
again just to recap want to get it so I

153
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:13,028
can move through the world nicely and so

154
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:17,439
we can explore rooms then I want to

155
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:20,560
build some reasonable rooms that have

156
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,658
lighting points distributed across them

157
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,699
how I want them lit then we're gonna

158
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:27,879
roll into the lighting system get it

159
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:29,500
working correctly for that which will

160
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,180
require modifying how we pass things

161
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,250
down the pipeline like finalizing all

162
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,379
that stuff and then I want to go ahead

163
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,430
and do world build-out so we can

164
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:41,500
actually like place fairly large numbers

165
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,009
of things throughout the world in a

166
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,560
a little pattern and not have it be

167
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:50,529
cumbersome to do so so like good tools

168
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,240
for just slamming down rooms and walls

169
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:56,259
and whatever else we want so that we

170
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,759
kind of can see how that what that part

171
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:04,959
of the code needs to support because we

172
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:13,000
don't really know right until you start

173
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:15,339
generating something that you actually

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
want it's pretty hard to know what that

175
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:24,189
code has to support right okay so let's

176
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,470
see here I'm gonna go ahead and just

177
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:30,730
like I said get started on on this kind

178
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:32,740
of semi randomly I'm just gonna do sort

179
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,650
of walks through the code and get

180
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,418
whatever I feel like I need to have

181
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,620
working at any particular time working

182
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:40,930
again

183
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,590
what I will do temporarily is I think

184
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:47,230
I'm going to go ahead and and re-enable

185
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:52,000
we had like a little stand in player

186
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:54,790
there and let me see yeah we just turned

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,579
off like a lot of the stuff that was on

188
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:04,390
the hero so I'll turn that back on and

189
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:12,459
we can take a look at at how that's

190
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:15,159
working at the moment okay so you know

191
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:17,228
the hero is is still in there right and

192
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,540
he can still kind of move around but I

193
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:21,909
think like I've talked about before I

194
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,069
have a much more solid idea now about

195
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,720
how I want the hero to move around

196
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:27,728
through the world and what's supposed to

197
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,710
happen there and so I kind of want to

198
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:36,158
clean that up a little bit and and make

199
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,599
it feel more like I want to feel and one

200
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,729
of the things about that too like you

201
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,509
can kind of see is you know we don't

202
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:45,700
really have a lot of understanding here

203
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:47,289
yeah well there's just a lot of stuff

204
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,440
that we haven't really talked about or

205
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:52,329
haven't really like addressed and I want

206
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,220
to also make sure that we have like I'm

207
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,930
gonna try and add some more levels of

208
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,080
room here

209
00:08:54,929 --> 00:09:00,959
- because again I kind of want to look

210
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:06,740
at the entire picture so I'm gonna go

211
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,740
ahead and add some more rooms in here

212
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:18,810
let me see here so it actually looks

213
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:23,099
like we've added quite a few rooms but I

214
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:25,349
guess right I mean we're we're adding

215
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,930
quite a few rooms here is that our the

216
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:32,909
room just above us I guess all the rooms

217
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:35,699
are above us is what actually is going

218
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:37,289
on so does that mean that if I came over

219
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,450
here and tried to jump on to this thing

220
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:42,709
I don't know if we actually can but does

221
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,710
that mean I can kind of come up here

222
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:52,529
yeah okay so I guess our lighting is

223
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:55,289
actually holding up okay - even in the

224
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:57,959
face of like kind of a bigger set of

225
00:09:55,289 --> 00:10:00,469
geometry that has to deal with but again

226
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,470
like

227
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,480
okay so yeah so that seems fairly

228
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,980
reasonable right like and so I guess

229
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,659
we've got a bunch of room stacked on top

230
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,249
of each other now which is pretty easy

231
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:21,688
to test with we do have a few

232
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:23,790
weirdnesses here with just the height of

233
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:26,838
things I think we decided that this was

234
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:29,490
roughly how high we wanted things to be

235
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,589
so maybe that's fine I don't know we'll

236
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,198
have to take a look at that later too

237
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,180
it's a little hard to see how stairways

238
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:37,740
work here so that's you know maybe

239
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:41,758
something we need to take a look at but

240
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:44,669
anyway so what I want to do here is just

241
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:48,749
make the movement code a little bit more

242
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:49,078
solid in terms of what I can expect from

243
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,329
it

244
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,308
so originally the way that I was

245
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:55,289
thinking that the the hero would move

246
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:58,379
like way back when we first wrote this

247
00:10:55,289 --> 00:11:02,789
code was I kind of assumed that what I

248
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:05,490
would want is sort of maybe a continuous

249
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:07,318
sort of motion for the hero and you can

250
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,480
kind of see that that's what we have at

251
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:11,878
the moment like there's basically like

252
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,389
you you know you move the head of the

253
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:21,539
hero around and and the body just kind

254
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:23,549
of follows after it and while I'm you

255
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:25,500
you know while I well I'm okay with the

256
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:30,539
feel of that what I sort of was thinking

257
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,860
when I started sort of closed in on some

258
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:33,208
of the design things that I was like

259
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,879
well how do we want to actually do this

260
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:39,619
I I was thinking that I might just want

261
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:42,269
a more tapi feel for moving around

262
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,639
because as I've been sort of like into

263
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:48,120
the more block tile-based sort of

264
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,789
aesthetic I just I feel like you might

265
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,339
just want to click to move to the next

266
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:55,019
square so like if I just tap you know

267
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,059
like that I just want to move from

268
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:02,100
square to square to square and have it

269
00:11:57,058 --> 00:12:04,499
be fairly precise now obviously I'm not

270
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,290
sure if there may be some downsides to

271
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:10,170
that like I don't know if maybe that

272
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:11,610
becomes too sort of onerous as you're

273
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:15,208
sort of moving around like maybe it's

274
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:17,669
just too clicky and I I don't know if

275
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,779
there's a lot of precedent I can look to

276
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:23,370
for games of

277
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:32,309
nature because usually you don't click

278
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:35,340
to move square to square so I am a

279
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:38,329
little bit nervous about it but I do

280
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,040
kind of feel like it would just be nice

281
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,350
and so like one of the things that I'm

282
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,939
thinking in in my head anyway right it's

283
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:49,050
like I would be interested in sort of

284
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,240
when you're when you're doing sort of

285
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:53,339
fighting style things to like think

286
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,129
about moving like quickly like I can

287
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,670
click like aw and know that I'll be

288
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:02,700
exactly on this square so like aw click

289
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:05,250
for attack and it would go like here

290
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,410
here and then punch that way right and

291
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:12,240
just the precision of that I'm just

292
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:14,069
interested in that feel right again I am

293
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,779
NOT a game designer so I am not

294
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,790
pretending that these are good ideas I'm

295
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,069
just saying what I'm gonna implement and

296
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:22,529
so I think I would like to go that route

297
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,450
if for no other reason than I think that

298
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:26,250
it's not done that often and so I think

299
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,900
it might be just kind of nice to have

300
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,580
something that feels that way to play

301
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,870
and if it turns out to not be a great

302
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,910
idea well handmade here as an

303
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,529
educational series it's not supposed to

304
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:37,949
be a great lead assigned game or

305
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,539
anything so I'm okay with that so I

306
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,970
think that's how I would like that to go

307
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:43,559
and so then at that point I like when we

308
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,090
forgot we did that little camera thing

309
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:48,779
where you can look down if you're if

310
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:51,780
you're if you go next to an edge so I

311
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:57,240
would like to sort of get get that stuff

312
00:13:51,779 --> 00:14:00,959
working a little bit more and just kind

313
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,419
of have a nice sort of snappy feel to it

314
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,519
and so then the head and the body will

315
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:08,339
actually not move separately if that

316
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,009
makes sense so it will only really be

317
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,170
the body that moves and the thing that I

318
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:16,379
want to do on top of that is basically

319
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:17,549
like if you will will get there I guess

320
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:21,269
when we get there but the idea is you

321
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:24,120
click wants to move to one Square and so

322
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:26,699
just clicking will move you but if you

323
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,310
hold it down I was thinking that will be

324
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,620
dodged so basically if you hold down the

325
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:32,109
button you'll just lean to the side and

326
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,789
you won't

327
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,350
to the next square I know this sounds

328
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:38,110
kind of weird but I'll I'll show you

329
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,399
what I mean so that's the movement that

330
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,399
I want and so I'm just gonna go ahead

331
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,659
and put that in and kind of get it

332
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,730
feeling the way that I think it should

333
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:47,469
feel and then we can move around the

334
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,730
world kind of cleanly and we can start

335
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,649
to build worlds and I'll see how they

336
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,899
feel to move around and then we can put

337
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:54,360
the letting points in and get to the

338
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,200
point where we're pretty happy with

339
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,250
construction right

340
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:09,028
in general alright and maybe I'll let

341
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:09,028
this thing pick there was kind of I

342
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:27,129
think this will generate arbitrary stuff

343
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:29,679
I'm not mistaken right yeah so this

344
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,600
these rooms are too big and they don't I

345
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,069
forgot we have a bunch of stuff so this

346
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,139
will this is yeah I mean this is long

347
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,790
overdue because if you look here we

348
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,470
don't zoom the camera out far enough to

349
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:40,088
see this whole room and that was the

350
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,670
thing we had in there but then when we

351
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,949
did some of the other camera stuff we'd

352
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:48,578
never really re-enabled that stuff right

353
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:53,198
so yeah this'll this'll this will be

354
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:54,429
good alright so first things first just

355
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:55,689
gonna look at the movement stuff and

356
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:58,088
then we're gonna look at the camera

357
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:01,540
stuff then we're gonna look at the

358
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:04,000
lighting stuff and yeah then we look at

359
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:06,778
the world building stuff just one one

360
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,850
thing after another until you get there

361
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:12,698
so inside our entities if you remember

362
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:15,040
the way that we were doing this and you

363
00:16:12,698 --> 00:16:17,649
can see this when we did oops I've typed

364
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:21,039
correctly you can see them better when

365
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:23,500
we did add player there were a couple of

366
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,809
different entities that were sort of

367
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,169
involving the player right the body the

368
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:31,838
head and the glove now we don't have to

369
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:34,120
undo that we can still keep this

370
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,920
basically the same way and you know

371
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,419
maybe we want to because maybe there are

372
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,009
some weird spells you can do that like

373
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:42,458
detach the body from the head I think I

374
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:43,629
mentioned that before so these can be

375
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,909
different

376
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:49,750
that's not

377
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:52,149
the end of the world but regardless of

378
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,519
whether or not we merge those into one

379
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:57,309
entity or leave them as actual separate

380
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,279
entities where you know they're each

381
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:04,649
kind of different one of the things that

382
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:08,500
I want to do was to make it so that the

383
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:11,560
the movement always is coherent for the

384
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,240
body in the head so I don't want it to

385
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:15,220
be that the head moves and the body

386
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,870
tries to keep up with it I want it so

387
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:21,370
that the movement decides what's

388
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:24,068
happening and then both are tracked with

389
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:28,689
it directly now I believe we have a

390
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:32,019
specific update call for these for these

391
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:36,789
two right here and where is it's in

392
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:39,700
brain right yeah so you can see here

393
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:42,460
we've got this brain here oh right and

394
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,230
here's that code right there which is

395
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,319
kind of huge at this point so I might go

396
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:50,559
ahead and pull it out I don't know why

397
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:52,359
these remarks is in line because I can't

398
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,799
imagine the compiler would care one way

399
00:17:52,359 --> 00:18:00,519
or the other whether there's a jump in

400
00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:08,099
there but you know who knows so I'm just

401
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:08,099
gonna put this out here

402
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:22,509
and I'll just call them do it now when

403
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:24,520
we compile this you can see here we've

404
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:26,710
got a bunch of stuff that we are then

405
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:28,029
gonna have to pass into it and this is

406
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,470
just basic gonna tell us what those

407
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:31,210
things are right the compiles going to

408
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,308
tell us when I cut and paste that code

409
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,159
out what the stuff from the previous one

410
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:41,619
was that it depends on so you can kind

411
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:43,480
of see here we've got the the brain part

412
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:45,129
here that was getting passed in right

413
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,980
here that we're gonna need we're gonna

414
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,630
need that DT as well so I'm gonna go

415
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,069
ahead and put those in here you can see

416
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,470
that it's looking at the input layer

417
00:18:51,069 --> 00:19:04,538
oops

418
00:18:52,470 --> 00:19:06,669
where'd that go there it is here so

419
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:10,288
we're gonna need that as well I don't

420
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:16,600
know that we need the entropy at all for

421
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:19,019
this guy but maybe we do and the

422
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,019
gamestate

423
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:34,709
so looks like we use most things here

424
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:52,930
that that we pass in yeah and that's

425
00:19:51,069 --> 00:20:00,039
just to make it a little easier for me

426
00:19:52,930 --> 00:20:03,850
to see what's in there cuz it's a lot of

427
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:08,409
code at this point alright

428
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:11,469
so taking a look at this code we have a

429
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:14,950
bunch of stuff going on here and you can

430
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:21,880
see that we've got analog control versus

431
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:26,250
digital control and you can see here

432
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,390
that we put into this hero controller

433
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,630
which is sort of a thing that stores

434
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,610
what's going on with any individual

435
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,090
person who's controlling a hero cuz I

436
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:38,109
don't know if you guys remember this but

437
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:40,509
and in fact I don't know this might

438
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:41,799
still work for all I know probably

439
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:44,200
doesn't because I don't think we've

440
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,889
really made any way for them to get in

441
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,200
here but if if somebody is using a

442
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,210
controller okay so it does work so if

443
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,870
someone's using another controller they

444
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,730
can just join the game right so it's you

445
00:20:55,869 --> 00:21:00,849
know I don't know that there's gonna be

446
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,589
any support in the design for co-op but

447
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:04,809
we allow you to do it so I'm just

448
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:08,379
holding you can see I'm holding a Xbox

449
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:12,429
controller here I'm Xbox one controller

450
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:14,470
and so you know if if you happen to grab

451
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:17,830
something that has an analog stick we

452
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:22,410
kind of want that to work as well and so

453
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:24,689
we want to allow both types of control

454
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:28,269
to do the thing that I'm talking about

455
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,900
which is you know sort of the hop from

456
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,029
room to room

457
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,540
sorry hop from square to square as well

458
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:36,349
as dodge behavior

459
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:40,009
whatever so let's go ahead and and

460
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:42,559
figure that out we'll start with the

461
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:47,629
digital version and we'll go to the

462
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:49,279
analog version after that now one way we

463
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,410
could do this is to keep going the way

464
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,109
we were going which is to say that we

465
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:57,080
just set a DDP value which is basically

466
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:59,619
saying curious the acceleration we're

467
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:03,679
using whatever the the control stick

468
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:09,399
says and then if it's digital we're just

469
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:12,049
stuffing it with whatever we've got here

470
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,259
and that's a pretty reasonable way to do

471
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:16,339
it I just don't know if we want to be

472
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:23,089
more specific than that

473
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:26,839
I don't know if we need to yeah I'm just

474
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:31,429
not 100% sure how we want to make that

475
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:35,539
work so for the moment I guess I would

476
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:38,269
say let's leave it this way and we'll

477
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:40,369
kind of just we'll see if we need to

478
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:43,509
push up into that code and change and

479
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:50,209
and give that code more control later

480
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:52,160
because that's mostly that's something I

481
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:54,410
really don't know until I actually write

482
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,470
the code below whether it's sufficient

483
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,750
to just look at a DDP value right and

484
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,509
again DDP is just I'm just using that I

485
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:05,450
typically use P for position DP as

486
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:07,279
velocity of DDP is acceleration

487
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,299
it's just position first derivative of

488
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,769
position second derivative of position

489
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:14,659
right so PD DP DP and DDP mostly because

490
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:19,309
you can't write Prime right I can't do

491
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:20,240
it I can't do like P P Prime and P

492
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,549
double Prime

493
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,599
those are not you know things you can do

494
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:31,490
and see so DP and DDP or another way to

495
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:34,279
write that okay so if you take a look at

496
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,799
what's going on here you can see we've

497
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,089
got the hero spawning code and that was

498
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,180
the thing that allowed the hero to come

499
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:43,250
into play before so when I hit start on

500
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,180
controller this is what executed so we

501
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,650
don't really need to worry about that

502
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,100
now obviously eventually we'll have to

503
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,019
do something

504
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:50,029
Mart here I don't even know Fergus for

505
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:53,750
multiple players I have no idea right so

506
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:57,259
that's like way down the line this is

507
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:58,730
for handling the sort of swipe glove

508
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,288
thing which we haven't really worked on

509
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,960
yet but that's you know when we want to

510
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:04,609
start doing attacks so we don't really

511
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,509
care about any of that either

512
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:11,089
so once we actually want to start

513
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:13,339
working with this stuff what I want to

514
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:20,839
do here is differentiate between the two

515
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:23,000
cases and see so what okay so is this

516
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:35,720
the one place we used eight and two by

517
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:37,548
the way yeah it is basically oops so one

518
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,710
of the interesting things about this is

519
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:43,700
we were we were looking at replace to

520
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:48,769
see runtime library and so Andrew

521
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:52,130
Bromage pseudonym 73 sorry and uber

522
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:53,658
homage I said that wrong I look I love

523
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,650
the pronunciation of his name it's like

524
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:59,179
homage basically anyway Andrew Bromwich

525
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,559
was looking at how to replace the sine

526
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:03,080
and cosine stuff and he showed us on

527
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:06,740
stream some ways to do that which we

528
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:08,149
should do at some point soon but then he

529
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,798
was like I don't know about a tan -

530
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,850
because you don't really use it and I

531
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:14,179
was like yeah you're right we don't

532
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:15,769
really use it we are only doing the

533
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,600
facing direction of stuff here with it

534
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:18,679
which we could easily have done in a

535
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,240
different way

536
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,730
we could just look at which of these

537
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,609
parameters was greater effectively and

538
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:28,190
just use that so we should probably get

539
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:30,769
rid of that atan2 entirely it's really

540
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,190
not necessary so that's something to be

541
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:37,970
thought about at a different time anyway

542
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:39,830
so what I want to do here is I want to

543
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,370
differentiate between the case where

544
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:53,109
we're moving just ahead so basically if

545
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:56,418
we're doing a head and no body or a body

546
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:59,209
and a head which are the only cases I

547
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:59,720
think that we will support so in this

548
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,840
case

549
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:08,269
here we want to basically say like if we

550
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:11,058
have a head and a body right then we're

551
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:18,679
gonna do some extra stuff and in fact I

552
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:21,379
don't know yeah I'm not sure exactly how

553
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,850
I want this code to work so we gotta

554
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:40,340
yeah I'm gonna have to kind of take this

555
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:45,019
one step at time but just looking

556
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:53,240
through it here I think I probably want

557
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:56,000
to simplify this down a bit because it's

558
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,069
just like until we actually know that we

559
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,390
need to ever do it separately we

560
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:02,359
shouldn't really have to worry about

561
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:05,030
that so at the moment I think I'll just

562
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:06,678
mainly collapse most of this and then

563
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:09,879
we'll worry about what happens without

564
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,900
it later so what I'm going to do here is

565
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,090
and I don't want that to acceleration

566
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,090
vector what I want to do here is

567
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:19,009
basically remove all of this and just

568
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:20,720
say look if we don't have a head in the

569
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:24,950
body that's something for some other

570
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:27,169
gameplay stuff down the line that I'm

571
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:30,200
not really interested in thinking about

572
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:38,179
right now so this stuff will just kind

573
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:41,090
of happen and yeah for no glove maybe

574
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:46,700
that's fine maybe I'll try to isolate

575
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:50,209
the glove stuff a little bit here but

576
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:52,340
otherwise I think we're good and I think

577
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,909
for the glove I can pretty much keep

578
00:27:52,339 --> 00:28:02,269
that at the end where we can just do

579
00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:05,780
something like this and so we'll still

580
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:08,048
allow you to be gloveless for the time

581
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:08,048
being

582
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,149
but we'll leave it so that we really

583
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:17,450
don't execute any of this code unless

584
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:27,108
you have a head and a body so looking at

585
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:28,869
this input code here does the body get

586
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:32,210
referenced in here anywhere it doesn't

587
00:28:28,868 --> 00:28:33,980
so one thing I might do the head is all

588
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:40,840
that that gets referenced here you can

589
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:40,839
see that happening I might just move

590
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:48,980
that stuff down so it's a little easier

591
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:54,378
to see that's really not supposed to be

592
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:56,618
happening other than in here right and

593
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:59,238
similarly the glove part we could also

594
00:28:56,618 --> 00:29:02,209
move to right here so now I know that

595
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:05,480
like nobody is doing anything with those

596
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:08,440
things so I'm not sure what this was

597
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,440
exactly

598
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:26,989
it's trying to stop the attack from

599
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:30,619
happening if the glove was already

600
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:32,479
moving right like you can't do another

601
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:35,509
attack if the glove is still in the

602
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:42,219
middle of an attack is what that was

603
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:42,219
meant to do and yes so I don't know I

604
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:49,960
guess what I would say is maybe I'm ok

605
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:54,639
with that for now I could move this out

606
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,639
and actually put that here

607
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:07,179
and we'll leave that for now ok so this

608
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:10,038
will not change anything that we did

609
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:14,349
right we're still just kind of moving

610
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:20,419
the old way and everything is the same

611
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:25,729
now what you can see here is the way

612
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:30,379
this was was working is when you do a

613
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:34,460
head motion the head was just getting

614
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:37,878
accelerated along and then it would look

615
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,440
to see if the body needed to go towards

616
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,118
where the head was by looking at

617
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,200
wherever the closest traversal was to

618
00:30:41,118 --> 00:30:46,628
where the head was currently floating I

619
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,819
don't really want to do that anymore

620
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:53,028
what I want to do instead is when you

621
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:59,479
are in the middle of moat so let me draw

622
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:59,960
this out so you can see what I'm talking

623
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:04,389
about

624
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,389
ok get some milk and go in here

625
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:19,788
sounds like some kind of a dance series

626
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:24,048
at the Modern Art Center body motion by

627
00:31:19,788 --> 00:31:27,408
Casey Mira Tori so what I want to do

628
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:30,440
here is say all right the body is gonna

629
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:34,730
be standing on a square and there's a

630
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:36,110
square next to it if you tap I want you

631
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:39,710
to hop to the next square

632
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:44,979
if you hold I want you to just lean and

633
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:48,829
stop right and so we have these two

634
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:52,880
conflicting ideas right tap versus hold

635
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:55,819
and the thing with tap versus hold is we

636
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,220
don't know which has happened until a

637
00:31:55,819 --> 00:32:03,168
certain amount of time has passed so

638
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:05,750
right if you imagine here is time and

639
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:08,630
what we get here is at a certain moment

640
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:12,579
in time the user presses let's say the D

641
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:16,390
key right so this is the D key goes down

642
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:20,599
well is it a tapper is it a hold if

643
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:22,880
later the D key goes back up when we

644
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:26,619
look at this amount of time we can then

645
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,630
definitively say tap or hold right and

646
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:32,658
we can pick some threshold here like oh

647
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:36,140
you know a hundred milliseconds is a tap

648
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:38,539
a hundred and one milliseconds is a hold

649
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:42,080
right we can pick some threshold that's

650
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:44,179
whatever we think is the right feel so

651
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:47,000
we need to wait we need basically a

652
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:51,230
timer that says how long we have between

653
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,269
these right but what we definitely don't

654
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:56,480
want to do and what unfortunately games

655
00:32:53,269 --> 00:33:00,470
affect player unknowns battlegrounds has

656
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,720
exactly this bug we don't want to wait a

657
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:05,210
hundred milliseconds to start taking

658
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,240
action for the user because in an action

659
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:10,220
game we want to take action as soon as

660
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,558
the user does something so if the user

661
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,028
is trying to tap to move to the next

662
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:18,440
square if they want to move to the next

663
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:19,429
square right now right but we don't know

664
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,590
whether they're trying to move the next

665
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:24,048
square or dodge so

666
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:26,778
what I want to do is I want to basically

667
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:28,339
have the first let's say hundred

668
00:33:26,778 --> 00:33:32,720
milliseconds which is one tenth of a

669
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:34,970
second right I want that to respond

670
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,250
immediately and I want it to be

671
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:40,069
ambiguous as to which is happening and

672
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,440
then if you let go of the key within the

673
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:43,970
hundred millisecond window then your

674
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,860
character will hop

675
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,929
so he'll kind of like move to the side a

676
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:49,548
little as you write when you push to

677
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:52,070
give you instant feedback that it is

678
00:33:49,548 --> 00:33:55,339
happening and then you let go he'll hop

679
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:58,700
right you hold down and he'll just

680
00:33:55,339 --> 00:34:00,139
crouch into it and so again you you

681
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:05,090
really want to make sure that you

682
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:08,389
immediately give the player some control

683
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:11,449
effect right away otherwise the controls

684
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:14,119
feel laggy and unresponsive and that

685
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:16,699
that is not a good action game feel

686
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,679
right this is not a competitive game so

687
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:21,049
where it's not like it's making handmade

688
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,000
hero not eSports ready and to not

689
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,280
respond or something

690
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,559
it does make pub G not eSports ready in

691
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:33,470
my opinion but that's separate thing but

692
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:34,909
what it does mean is that the feel you

693
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:36,168
know the feel of the action game is

694
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,878
important because whether or not a

695
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:39,949
player is having a good time has a lot

696
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:41,898
to do with how the controls feel so we

697
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:43,699
don't want to be in a position where

698
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:45,319
we're not giving them any feedback that

699
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:47,449
they actually started doing the action

700
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,460
they're trying to do and so all we need

701
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:51,559
to do is start an action in that

702
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,210
direction and then when they either

703
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,619
release or don't release the key and we

704
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,780
definitively know which one they've done

705
00:34:54,619 --> 00:35:00,140
we'll commit to this to this particular

706
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,810
animation that shows them the activity

707
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:08,389
that they actually were trying to do so

708
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:11,210
what I want to do here is in the sort of

709
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:15,529
in the code I want to have that timing

710
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:18,559
occur and I want to manage that timing

711
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:21,070
based on how you're pressing the keys

712
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,070
right

713
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:35,829
all right I so I'm gonna start by

714
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:38,480
nerfing out a lot of this code actually

715
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:42,410
and then I'm gonna slowly sort of put it

716
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:48,409
back in as we go so for example if I

717
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:51,170
take all of this out I should no longer

718
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:53,299
be able to move right ASD if do nothing

719
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,050
but attack does cuz the glove codes

720
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,519
still in there

721
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:00,970
right so that's the only thing that's in

722
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,969
there so now let's start by looking at

723
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:06,289
just straightforward button button

724
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:08,510
pushes and what I'm going to do is I'm

725
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:11,150
going to assume when the user presses

726
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:13,880
the button that they are always going to

727
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:18,490
jump so I'm gonna implement the jump to

728
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:21,588
next square code first with no timer and

729
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:25,338
then I'm going to implement the code for

730
00:36:21,588 --> 00:36:27,199
lean with no timer and then I'm gonna

731
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:29,119
integrate the two and tune the timer

732
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,279
until I think it feels okay right

733
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,690
because we know we need both things and

734
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,859
so I'm going to write both things so I

735
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,659
can see how they look and then I'm gonna

736
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,710
merge them together rather than trying

737
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:38,509
to Murray write them both at the same

738
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:41,659
time which I think would just lead to

739
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:43,460
more confusion so the first thing we

740
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,710
need to do is say all right look if

741
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,108
there is a DDP going on here because you

742
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:52,010
can see we've got sort of this this

743
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:55,400
notion of the DDP that you can see up

744
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:57,349
here right and so I need to figure out

745
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,019
something that tells me whether or not

746
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:02,269
we think we're doing an actual motion or

747
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:07,550
not and so I think I'm just going to use

748
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:09,858
like how lengthy is this how much

749
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,079
movement is am I actually getting like

750
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:15,529
haha what's the distance that I'm

751
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,690
actually moving the stick and I'm gonna

752
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:21,019
look at that to determine whether or not

753
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:22,818
I think I've issued instruction to jump

754
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:26,409
and the reason I'm doing that is because

755
00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:29,210
I need some plausible thing in my head

756
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:30,739
that will tell me and in fact you can

757
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,869
see it right down here there's there's a

758
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:35,839
version of this code happening for the

759
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:37,970
old way of doing it basically I need

760
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:42,320
understanding at least to a certain

761
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:44,299
degree that tells me whether or not the

762
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,700
user has committed to a move at all and

763
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,940
if we're playing on a controller that's

764
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:52,009
like an Xbox controller the distance

765
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:54,260
that they move the stick may need to be

766
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,000
a certain amount before we ever want to

767
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,520
consider it because a little bit of

768
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,949
motion maybe we'll let them the head

769
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:03,769
dodge move with that little bit of

770
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:06,049
motion right but the hop is never going

771
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:09,170
to want that so the hop is only ever

772
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:11,150
gonna happen if you've moved enough in a

773
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,220
particular direction so the first I'm

774
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,900
going to do is effectively do this part

775
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:18,349
right here where we're doing like a

776
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:20,150
length squared so I definitely do want

777
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:22,489
this part of the code to come back up

778
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,110
and say all right here's the DVP that's

779
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:26,689
happening I'm gonna take a look at that

780
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:28,309
length I'm going to go ahead and see

781
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,289
what I want to do with that length here

782
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:31,820
and so you can see what's happening

783
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:33,650
where I've got the DDP length greater

784
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:41,269
than 1.0 and then I do some stuff with

785
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:44,780
it and bah bah bah bah bah right you can

786
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:46,909
see what's happening here right so what

787
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:50,690
I want to do is I want to produce a

788
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:53,239
normalize DDP from this and so I want a

789
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:55,280
DDP normal and what that's gonna do is

790
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:59,589
that's gonna start out as nothing and

791
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,930
I'm also gonna have like a hop requested

792
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:05,600
flag let's say and so I'm going to look

793
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:07,639
at this and say I've got a DDP that DDP

794
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,900
is pushing a certain direction I don't

795
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,759
know how long it is so I'm gonna take

796
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,590
the length of it first I'm going to look

797
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,260
to see if that length exceeds a certain

798
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:20,990
hop threshold if it does I'm going to

799
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:25,670
normalize it right and so looking at

800
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:27,949
this this code was meant to sort of this

801
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:30,440
code was meant to prevent acceleration

802
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:32,329
past a certain amount I don't care about

803
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:36,050
that anymore right that's not really

804
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:38,840
what I'm looking at here at all what I'm

805
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:41,600
looking at here is whether or not you've

806
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,400
pushed far enough to request a hop and

807
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,809
to produce a normal so this codes going

808
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,190
to change a little and maybe we'll do

809
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:47,630
something like this similar later I

810
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,429
don't know but it's not that important

811
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,369
right now for what we

812
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:55,429
actually want to do so what I'm gonna do

813
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:57,829
here is say okay you know

814
00:39:55,429 --> 00:40:01,578
and in fact honestly maybe this is the

815
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:04,910
right code temporarily so we do want to

816
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:07,010
do this in in this case but I also want

817
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:09,500
to do it for the normal in the other

818
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:13,190
case as well might be the right way to

819
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:15,920
say it right so basically what I want to

820
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:19,838
do is say look if this CDP length is

821
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,130
greater than some really low threshold

822
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,239
then I want to do one thing and then I

823
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:29,088
want to do another thing in another case

824
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:31,399
right so something like this so if the

825
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:34,099
DVP length is greater than any small

826
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,680
amount at all and maybe you know who

827
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:39,260
knows how small it is but quite small

828
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:49,549
then what I want to do is produce this

829
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:52,069
value so maybe like the normalize

830
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:54,710
coefficient is going to be one over the

831
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:58,130
square root of whatever this length is

832
00:40:54,710 --> 00:41:01,429
right and then what I want to do is say

833
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:07,880
well the GDP normal is always gonna get

834
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:09,769
well it's not quite that it's that way

835
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,150
the DTP normal is always going to be a

836
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:13,519
normalized version of the direction

837
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:16,338
we're going or zero if there wasn't one

838
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:19,880
right and then if the DVP length is

839
00:41:16,338 --> 00:41:23,210
above a certain amount then I'm going to

840
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,630
also normalize the DDP so that it can't

841
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:32,659
get longer than one hopefully that makes

842
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:34,818
some sense okay so that's all I wanted

843
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:36,500
to do there and then for my hop

844
00:41:34,818 --> 00:41:38,509
requested actually this becomes fairly

845
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,099
simple that's just get the DDP length

846
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:41,960
like the amount they're pushing the

847
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:43,220
stick is greater than some amount that I

848
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,530
think indicates that we're definitely

849
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:47,419
trying to move to another square I don't

850
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,940
know how much that should be let's say

851
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:53,630
that it's 0.5 for now but obviously

852
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:58,730
these are all tunable okay so that gives

853
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:59,298
me like an entire sort of I'm not sure

854
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,449
how to say this

855
00:41:59,298 --> 00:42:03,130
that gives me sort of an entire set of

856
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:04,960
information about what the

857
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,730
trol stick and or keyboard are trying to

858
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,619
do it this time and now what I want to

859
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:11,889
do is I want to show that in some way

860
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:13,059
that I can relate to pretty easily so

861
00:42:11,889 --> 00:42:16,329
what I'm going to do here is actually

862
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:18,639
peg the location of the head I'm just

863
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:20,440
gonna literally put it at whatever that

864
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,279
thing was I'm gonna put it at that

865
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,269
offset to the body right so you can seen

866
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,450
here

867
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:30,909
there's ways that we're saying where the

868
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:33,069
head should be and you can see a bunch

869
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:37,989
of that information here right so you

870
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:54,550
can see for example let's see where

871
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:56,439
we've got head P settings P equals so

872
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,900
we've got a spring on the head and I

873
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,750
don't remember how high off the ground

874
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:07,090
we chose to make the head I literally

875
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:10,570
have no idea the head distance max is du

876
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:15,460
DT bomb but okay that's the floor

877
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:17,920
displace times head Delta XY y-axis head

878
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:23,220
Delta X Y also don't care about that

879
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,220
that's the 2d stuff where's the Z

880
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:41,550
love that no you anyway

881
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:44,130
so uh yeah I'm not sure exactly how we

882
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:47,039
pegged it here let me decrypt this code

883
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,960
for a second so you can see that all of

884
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,809
this stuff is moving the body and the

885
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,539
head I mean the head has to want to be a

886
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:57,150
certain distance off the ground right I

887
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:59,039
mean that's and so I think that was just

888
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,690
how we were doing it but I want to look

889
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,199
at what that was because I don't really

890
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:10,769
know what we decided that to be right

891
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:13,409
and so let's see here this is just

892
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:17,099
transactional occupy stuff against

893
00:44:13,409 --> 00:44:23,309
substrates reversible the timer is up no

894
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:30,170
push recenter duty PCBs closest to a DP

895
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:30,170
e that's the spring right and some drag

896
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,849
[Music]

897
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:48,559
you know what I guess we just leave the

898
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:50,900
heads point on the ground that's a

899
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,929
little unfortunate but I guess that's

900
00:44:50,900 --> 00:45:00,230
because our heads bright is offset

901
00:44:52,929 --> 00:45:00,649
poorly honestly we should probably fix

902
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,559
that

903
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:06,650
before going much further I mean the

904
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:10,070
good news there is well we just set it

905
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:15,769
with the body's direct position and then

906
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:17,240
we move it and that's that so anyway if

907
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:17,929
we want to do that that's pretty easy

908
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:20,229
right

909
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:24,980
so all we have to do is then say okay

910
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:31,309
you know the head P equals the body P

911
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:36,099
plus the whatever the actual GDP here

912
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:36,099
the value is that we're looking for so

913
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:41,210
I'm just gonna set the heads position to

914
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:42,700
literally be whatever the body's fishin

915
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:46,670
was and then I'm going to take that

916
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:48,500
offset and you know however you're

917
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:50,838
pushing the stick basically and move the

918
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:53,690
head directly there right no animation

919
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:57,380
yet so I don't know if you can see this

920
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:59,420
but right and so if I start this other

921
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:02,059
guy with the analog stick you can see

922
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,650
that well you can't see me moving the

923
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,779
stick but you can sort of imagine how

924
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:10,700
I'm gonna stick you can see that like as

925
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:15,440
I move around the stick the head just

926
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:22,909
moves exactly as I as well as you would

927
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:24,588
expect it to right and that's just me

928
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:27,190
verifying the fat code is working

929
00:46:24,588 --> 00:46:29,750
properly and also verifying that

930
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:35,200
commercial joysticks have really crappy

931
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:35,199
pots in them but yeah mmm so anyway

932
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,980
looking at that that is exactly what I

933
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,660
wanted so I know that that's working

934
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:43,400
relatively well now and so what I want

935
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:45,190
to do now is look and see when we

936
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,450
request the hop I want to look to see

937
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:52,030
where I could hop to in the

938
00:46:49,449 --> 00:46:54,789
and if that is unoccupied I'm gonna move

939
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:56,769
the body there right and I'm not going

940
00:46:54,789 --> 00:46:58,480
to do any animation for that yet

941
00:46:56,769 --> 00:47:00,130
well I guess you know what since we've

942
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,858
already got a thing in there that does

943
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,869
the animation I guess I'll leave it in

944
00:47:02,858 --> 00:47:07,900
there because I suppose there's no

945
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:11,260
reason not to leave it in there but yeah

946
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:12,970
there we go so in this case we'll take a

947
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,849
look the body movement mode equals

948
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:17,319
movement planted we could just we could

949
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:19,450
make this a little simpler by saying

950
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:24,099
look don't bother looking for the

951
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:27,338
closest traversable if you're not you

952
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:29,109
know we only really need to look if we

953
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:34,059
could move right now so let's go ahead

954
00:47:29,108 --> 00:47:36,969
and and actually and actually look for

955
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:40,420
the close traversal first so we'll get

956
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:46,269
the close traversable to wherever the

957
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:49,000
place we wanna look is so call that hop

958
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:51,309
target P if we found one then what we'll

959
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,480
do is we'll say look if this is a place

960
00:47:51,309 --> 00:48:00,670
that we can go then we will try to go

961
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:03,760
there and if we can then we will set our

962
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:05,889
our movement request to be that we want

963
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,760
to hop from this Square to that square

964
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:13,868
right and so all I need to do here is

965
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,490
say look if if the hair is a hop

966
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:18,970
requested and what I could do is say

967
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:21,459
look let's roll this into there so you

968
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:23,429
know there's only a hop requested if we

969
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:26,619
could request the hop meaning we're not

970
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:28,568
already in the middle of a hop and we're

971
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:30,130
gonna want to now a little bit we'll

972
00:48:28,568 --> 00:48:31,719
talk about that later but we don't

973
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,010
actually probably want you to have to

974
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:34,989
finish your previous hop before

975
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:37,980
requesting an S top so you know I'll

976
00:48:34,989 --> 00:48:40,269
make a note of that that's again this is

977
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,940
I've said many times not a game designer

978
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:44,619
so I am NOT trying to tell you anything

979
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,150
game design really need I'm just trying

980
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:49,358
to tell you game implementation related

981
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:52,599
the feel of controls is important and

982
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:55,150
the player doesn't want to have to wait

983
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:58,539
till the full height of the hop has

984
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:59,289
completed before notching over to get

985
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:02,650
the next one

986
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:03,279
necessarily so if they're just about to

987
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,980
land

988
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,530
the knotch left again like they top left

989
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,750
they mile hop look again you want to let

990
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:12,820
them have a little bit of leeway there

991
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:16,480
now you don't want them to have all the

992
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:18,400
leeway because you want them to have the

993
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,500
ability to change their mind so if they

994
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,170
click left twice in the middle of this

995
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,369
hop and then like by the time they land

996
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,409
there's like a monster there and they

997
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:28,269
really shouldn't do that you don't want

998
00:49:26,409 --> 00:49:30,849
to remember that hop and force them to

999
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:32,889
hop right so they need you need to

1000
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:35,289
basically pick what feels right when

1001
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:38,769
you're playing it in terms of what's

1002
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:42,940
good for forgiveness but not something

1003
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:47,230
that feels very laggy right it's got to

1004
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:49,090
be that that nice middle ground between

1005
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,230
the two of those and so that's just

1006
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,360
something that you need to make sure

1007
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:55,090
that you've polished when you're when

1008
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:57,700
you get the code right so anyway in here

1009
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:59,800
we've got the hop requested code if

1010
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:01,480
we're going to request the hop then what

1011
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,690
we're going to need to do is is build a

1012
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:08,110
hop target and the hot target is going

1013
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:12,519
to be wherever the body is plus the

1014
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:15,460
Delta so we've got this DDP normal which

1015
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:18,429
is telling us that direction and that

1016
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,170
direction needs to be moved out by a

1017
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:22,029
certain amount so I don't know how far

1018
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:24,400
we want to move that out but it's

1019
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:28,530
probably something like two units to

1020
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:33,869
look there for traversable and we'll see

1021
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:40,330
how we want to do that exactly right and

1022
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:41,559
yeah there's a couple of the things in

1023
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,539
here that we need to talk about but

1024
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:46,170
roughly speaking that's what we want to

1025
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:46,170
do okay

1026
00:50:52,650 --> 00:51:02,440
so you can actually see that this is

1027
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:10,950
sort of working now right and I can

1028
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:10,950
actually hop exactly how I wanted to hop

1029
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:23,769
and the hop takes a little too long but

1030
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:26,318
one of the things about this game that I

1031
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:39,429
don't know yet is whether hop speed will

1032
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:40,929
be so yeah well there's a lot of things

1033
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,429
so first of all I don't know whether

1034
00:51:40,929 --> 00:51:44,019
you'll be allowed to hop diagonally but

1035
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:46,328
I suspect the answer is no so I probably

1036
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:48,849
have to get rid of that because with the

1037
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:50,680
analog stick you can and so I'll

1038
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:53,588
probably have to yet make that not

1039
00:51:50,679 --> 00:52:00,338
happen you're only really supposed to be

1040
00:51:53,588 --> 00:52:01,838
going on Cardinals in this game so that

1041
00:52:00,338 --> 00:52:04,900
actually feels very good right now

1042
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,880
actually it feels so much better than

1043
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:09,970
the old way it's kind of a little bit

1044
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:15,298
frightening to think about what a small

1045
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:18,639
change can different what a small change

1046
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:21,759
that's it how much difference a small

1047
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:24,989
change can make in terms of whether you

1048
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,099
want to actually play something or not

1049
00:52:24,989 --> 00:52:29,078
we got to fix that camera it doesn't

1050
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:35,920
understand big rooms for some reason now

1051
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:37,180
and that's like yeah yes so anyway sorry

1052
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,519
I'm being distracted by the fact that

1053
00:52:37,179 --> 00:52:43,058
it's kind of fun to hop around now

1054
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:48,159
anyway so there's a couple things that I

1055
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:51,548
don't know about so just playing with

1056
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:53,048
this and I really want to emphasize that

1057
00:52:51,548 --> 00:52:54,788
every step of the way that I'm not a

1058
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:57,038
game designer so please don't take my

1059
00:52:54,789 --> 00:52:58,690
advice on anything game design related I

1060
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:59,859
will say that repeatedly every time

1061
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:03,550
we're working on anything that's game

1062
00:52:59,858 --> 00:53:06,579
design related so I'm just calling

1063
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:09,370
it like I see it here as a player of

1064
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:11,049
games and that is that and and I'm

1065
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:14,409
harkening back to something that a good

1066
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:16,180
game designer said which is John blow he

1067
00:53:14,409 --> 00:53:20,049
often says that like the important thing

1068
00:53:16,179 --> 00:53:24,190
to do is you have to like experience

1069
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:27,340
things and follow them right rather than

1070
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:29,530
back then you you can't always be going

1071
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:31,660
towards a goal that you've predetermined

1072
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:35,290
you have to be willing to follow what

1073
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:36,969
feels right in an experience and he

1074
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:41,170
could say it better than I could because

1075
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:42,879
it's his idea not mine but one of the

1076
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:44,980
things that I'm just noticing here is

1077
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,960
like I wanted you to be able to do that

1078
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:52,179
kind of dodge by just holding down the

1079
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:55,539
button but it feels nice to hop like it

1080
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:57,969
feels nice to be able to hop by holding

1081
00:53:55,539 --> 00:54:02,489
down the button and so that's making me

1082
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:02,489
reconsider what I was going to say about

1083
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:10,469
about holding to dodge it's a problem

1084
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:16,960
because I wanted you to be able to dodge

1085
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:19,149
without moving but maybe the game just

1086
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,500
needs to not do that I mean maybe the

1087
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:29,789
dodge is like left and then you come

1088
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:29,789
back you go like that right I don't know

1089
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:40,360
so that's that's a problem because yeah

1090
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,220
I feel like now I want to be able to

1091
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:45,150
hold down the button and go so I'm not

1092
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:45,149
sure how you would dodge

1093
00:54:53,929 --> 00:55:04,549
we move this guy so yeah I'm not sure

1094
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,550
how you would dodge at that point

1095
00:55:47,090 --> 00:56:01,470
so if you're on a controller I think it

1096
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:04,440
would be pretty easy which is to say you

1097
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:06,929
just have a clutch I suppose like I like

1098
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,119
maybe like the trigger for example you

1099
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:21,389
just hold it down and then you'd let the

1100
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:26,850
head dodge on the keyboard maybe you'd

1101
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:27,449
hold the spacebar oh god what did I just

1102
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:32,699
do

1103
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:35,549
I detached my head my head is now a

1104
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:42,868
snake that's jumping around I don't want

1105
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:44,340
to know what happened there so the

1106
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:45,450
keyboard is a little bit of an issue

1107
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,760
there

1108
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:50,259
you know shift in space I suppose you

1109
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,289
could have either of those to do that

1110
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,289
[Music]

1111
00:57:07,539 --> 00:57:13,000
I mean that isn't my first choice cuz I

1112
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:15,010
really don't like games that proliferate

1113
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,130
the number of buttons you know I mean

1114
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:20,530
like I don't know if you guys have

1115
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:25,210
played a triple a game recently but if

1116
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:28,750
you go play something that's like you

1117
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:31,570
know even to take a game I thought was

1118
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:35,679
pretty decent like I mentioned horizon

1119
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:36,850
zero dawn in terms of really great

1120
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,929
graphics the other day I thought they

1121
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:42,789
did a beautiful job with them you know

1122
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:44,710
there's like this orgy of controls that

1123
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:46,690
happens and like every last thing on a

1124
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:48,460
controller is mapped and like it's

1125
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:50,409
you're in the middle of a battle and

1126
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:53,349
like you're pushing like this button and

1127
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:55,089
that button down as well like the actual

1128
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:57,849
push button version of these is

1129
00:57:55,090 --> 00:58:01,600
happening both bumpers and both triggers

1130
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:04,089
are in play the d-pad and then you know

1131
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:07,900
and you're just it's nuts right and like

1132
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:10,059
I can usually manage it because I've

1133
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,369
been playing games all my life and I get

1134
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:14,139
used to it and it's okay but still kind

1135
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:15,699
of annoying but then like you know your

1136
00:58:14,139 --> 00:58:16,989
hand like controller to someone who just

1137
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:19,149
wants to play a game

1138
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:20,649
who easily could have played like Super

1139
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,599
Mario Brothers because it's like a d-pad

1140
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:25,450
and two buttons and like forget it right

1141
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:27,579
I mean it's nuts how many things if you

1142
00:58:25,449 --> 00:58:31,599
haven't played a recent game that you do

1143
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:33,009
and and so I don't want to end up in any

1144
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,279
kind of scenario where there's all these

1145
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:38,170
buttons but given the fact that I can't

1146
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:43,180
think of any other way to do it

1147
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:47,289
I could see allowing one clutch button

1148
00:58:43,179 --> 00:58:53,169
for dodge because it just seems like

1149
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:55,239
it's gonna feel better and I think it'd

1150
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:58,119
be pretty easy because I could make I

1151
00:58:55,239 --> 00:59:04,299
could make basically anything anything

1152
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:07,329
on the you know left or right trigger or

1153
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:09,850
bumper all of those on this thing could

1154
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:11,199
all be the clutch so anything that you

1155
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:18,250
hit was fine you didn't have to be

1156
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:20,019
specific about it I don't know so it's

1157
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,949
that's a tough decision again that's

1158
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:22,449
really the kind of thing

1159
00:59:20,949 --> 00:59:24,009
that I think is more appropriate for a

1160
00:59:22,449 --> 00:59:27,098
game designer to be worrying about and

1161
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:28,780
not me but in this circumstance I

1162
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:33,700
suppose there's not a lot I can really

1163
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:36,010
do about that so I've got to have

1164
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:38,049
something so I'm just gonna go ahead and

1165
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:40,270
say for now I will introduce a clutch

1166
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:41,980
key it's not my first choice but that's

1167
00:59:40,269 --> 00:59:43,809
just because I get not because I think

1168
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,429
things are wrong with it in the abstract

1169
00:59:43,809 --> 00:59:47,559
but just because it proliferates the

1170
00:59:45,429 --> 00:59:48,940
number of buttons and I was kind of like

1171
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:51,070
hoping this game would be a game where

1172
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:53,858
you just have a d-pad for movement and

1173
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:55,630
then any button you hit punches in that

1174
00:59:53,858 --> 00:59:57,098
direction so it's extremely simple and

1175
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:01,210
anyone can understand it and they don't

1176
00:59:57,099 --> 01:00:02,920
have to be some kind of like you know

1177
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:04,929
dude who has their picture on a face of

1178
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,579
monster you know their face on a monster

1179
01:00:04,929 --> 01:00:11,799
energy drink carton to be able to like

1180
01:00:06,579 --> 01:00:14,260
play this game right and so I'm gonna go

1181
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:17,079
ahead and say that it's okay to have the

1182
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:18,670
clutch button in there and I'll expose

1183
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:20,589
that through the platform layer but I

1184
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:22,450
don't really want to go nuts with that

1185
01:00:20,588 --> 01:00:27,539
so I'm really gonna try to make this be

1186
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:31,389
the last thing that we have here so

1187
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:33,750
looking at this we've got sort of the

1188
01:00:31,389 --> 01:00:38,440
up-down left-right up-down left-right

1189
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:41,760
for the for the game here but we got the

1190
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:45,420
shoulders the shoulder buttons there and

1191
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:52,240
then we've got this button state so I

1192
01:00:45,420 --> 01:01:01,139
don't really know it looks like the sort

1193
01:00:52,239 --> 01:01:01,139
of triggers are not mapped right

1194
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:15,159
so I think that would have to be mapped

1195
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:17,079
in here right so if we've got a stick

1196
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:19,239
average so I'm just gonna clean these up

1197
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:20,829
to our new types so you've got stick

1198
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:28,929
average I think I'm gonna have to say

1199
01:01:20,829 --> 01:01:40,059
clutch average and just point out this

1200
01:01:28,929 --> 01:01:43,539
like eg triggers or spacebar yeah I I

1201
01:01:40,059 --> 01:01:46,179
claim that this is okay because yeah

1202
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:48,940
like my not a game designer get out of

1203
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:51,129
jail free card allows me to just kind of

1204
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:59,170
say I'm just doing what feels right here

1205
01:01:51,130 --> 01:02:00,940
and I don't pretend to speak for people

1206
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,619
who know what they're doing in terms of

1207
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:04,838
making design decisions that is not the

1208
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:06,880
point of handmade Hiro and I do not want

1209
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:09,429
to argue with anyone about it so please

1210
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,869
take that argument somewhere else about

1211
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:12,368
whether it's appropriate to be using

1212
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:14,710
these buttons or not because I don't

1213
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:17,320
want to hear it and don't care but in

1214
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:19,030
this particular case I just feel like

1215
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,190
that's what I want to do and since it is

1216
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:25,480
programming I feel free to do it because

1217
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:28,119
this is a programming stream so in here

1218
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:31,269
we've got how the d-pad is coming out

1219
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:32,710
and you can see here that I'm going to

1220
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:34,210
switch over here because it's code

1221
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:36,099
that's kind of going behind my head too

1222
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:37,960
much and it's making it hard for me to

1223
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:42,609
see it as well so I'm just going over

1224
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:44,889
here you can see that we've got the the

1225
01:02:42,608 --> 01:02:47,920
controller being read out and we beat

1226
01:02:44,889 --> 01:02:52,259
out here digital buttons for things like

1227
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:56,880
the X input d-pad and the X input

1228
01:02:52,260 --> 01:03:01,839
buttons but we're not really looking

1229
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:05,559
anywhere for anything else right like

1230
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:08,650
we're not looking for those trigger

1231
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:09,940
buttons I don't think anywhere else so

1232
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:15,338
if you take a look at the X input

1233
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:17,530
gamepad stuff here what we should see in

1234
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:18,360
there I think we've got that in here

1235
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:26,160
somewhere

1236
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:29,670
and put pink that we have that anywhere

1237
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:31,679
no so that's probably something in the X

1238
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:34,260
input Docs that we did not just cut and

1239
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:36,599
paste in yeah so we're actually opening

1240
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:39,330
up that text input stuff that's no big

1241
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:40,920
deal I'll just open up that Docs and

1242
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:43,500
what I want to do is I want to read out

1243
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,940
those triggers and they're simple this

1244
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,670
will take 10 seconds it's not a

1245
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,289
complicated thing to tube it's exactly

1246
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:51,470
like the analog sticks they're just

1247
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:54,110
values that we read out of that struct

1248
01:03:51,469 --> 01:03:58,019
so I'm gonna go ahead in here and say

1249
01:03:54,110 --> 01:04:04,940
include X input dot H again using my

1250
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:04,940
magical search feature here let's here

1251
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:16,110
include and then so all I'm gonna do is

1252
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:19,500
just say look tell me where X input

1253
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:24,570
gamepad is using like the Browse info

1254
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:27,539
here so you can see here here's the

1255
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:28,590
example gamepad you can see the

1256
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:32,340
thumbsticks

1257
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:33,960
are here and those we are looking at and

1258
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:37,140
you can see that those are signed values

1259
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,690
so those are actually shorts so that's

1260
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:41,400
because you know the x position goes

1261
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:44,250
negative positive so they just decided

1262
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:47,670
to represent it that way the triggers

1263
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:49,559
can only go down right they can't go up

1264
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:52,200
from their rest position so they chose

1265
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:56,610
to represent those as purely unsigned

1266
01:04:52,199 --> 01:05:01,439
values those are unsigned values that

1267
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:03,990
just go from 0 to 255 at maximum push so

1268
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:07,230
we know we got V left trigger and B

1269
01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:09,629
right trigger and I'm just gonna verify

1270
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:11,429
the B left trigger and right trigger

1271
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:15,000
don't get you yeah and they don't right

1272
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:17,579
I so we're not using those currently as

1273
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,579
I suspected so I am going to go ahead

1274
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:22,590
and just use that now for that purpose

1275
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:25,829
and you can see here we've got the stick

1276
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:29,579
average stuff process stick value we've

1277
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:32,478
got a dead zone in there and that's the

1278
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:36,929
dead zone for

1279
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:40,009
that's the deadzone that's prescribed or

1280
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:40,009
[Music]

1281
01:05:41,018 --> 01:05:46,689
do we not read the right thumbstick I

1282
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:58,068
guess we don't read the right thumbstick

1283
01:05:53,838 --> 01:06:00,318
all right well um we've got a dead zone

1284
01:05:58,068 --> 01:06:01,849
that's prescribed there by the ex input

1285
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:06,588
system that we're kind of lazily

1286
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:08,869
applying there and I don't know whether

1287
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:09,978
we want round or not and there's a bunch

1288
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:11,180
of stuff that we might want to do there

1289
01:06:09,978 --> 01:06:12,858
but it's not really probably going to

1290
01:06:11,179 --> 01:06:14,328
matter a whole lot for this game so it's

1291
01:06:12,858 --> 01:06:17,268
not really worth worrying about point

1292
01:06:14,329 --> 01:06:21,619
being what we want to do here is we want

1293
01:06:17,268 --> 01:06:25,459
to take the stick average stuff here we

1294
01:06:21,619 --> 01:06:31,180
want to go ahead and take those those be

1295
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:31,179
left trigger and be right trigger values

1296
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:40,548
again these are bytes and what I'm gonna

1297
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:42,440
do is since I don't care which one

1298
01:06:40,548 --> 01:06:43,699
you're holding down and I want you to

1299
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,200
just use whichever one you feel more

1300
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:46,129
comfortable because you know they're not

1301
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:48,939
gonna do different things it's the

1302
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:51,140
clutch button is whichever one you want

1303
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:53,509
what I want to do is I want to make it

1304
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:56,118
so that whichever one you're pushing if

1305
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:59,778
you push it down far enough it works

1306
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:02,358
right so what that means is I don't want

1307
01:06:59,778 --> 01:07:03,920
to add them together right because if I

1308
01:07:02,358 --> 01:07:06,228
add them together then pushing either

1309
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,670
down just a little bit might result in a

1310
01:07:06,228 --> 01:07:08,058
clutch and that's not what supposed to

1311
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:10,068
happen

1312
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:12,349
right what I want to do is make it so

1313
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:13,308
that if either one is pushed down far

1314
01:07:12,349 --> 01:07:14,509
enough so what I want to do is look at

1315
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:17,989
that whichever one's pushed down the

1316
01:07:14,509 --> 01:07:19,519
furthest look at that one and if that

1317
01:07:17,989 --> 01:07:19,999
one's pushed down far enough then you're

1318
01:07:19,518 --> 01:07:22,248
good to go

1319
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:24,048
so what I want to do is take a look at

1320
01:07:22,248 --> 01:07:25,608
the pad here and I want to say like

1321
01:07:24,048 --> 01:07:27,528
let's start with the left trigger and

1322
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:31,130
then I'll say okay if being right

1323
01:07:27,528 --> 01:07:36,199
trigger was actually greater than that

1324
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:37,759
then we'll take that one instead right

1325
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:40,699
so I just I just take whichever ones

1326
01:07:37,759 --> 01:07:43,838
bigger and off we go so then from there

1327
01:07:40,699 --> 01:07:45,659
I'll say all right on the new controller

1328
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:49,288
we now have

1329
01:07:45,659 --> 01:07:51,449
the clutch average it's not really

1330
01:07:49,289 --> 01:07:53,880
clutch average it's clutch max so

1331
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:55,949
because that's what makes more sense in

1332
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,849
this case so I'm gonna I'm gonna change

1333
01:07:55,949 --> 01:08:01,919
the name of that just to be a little

1334
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:04,200
little clearer here right so the clutch

1335
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,710
mass max in this case is just gonna be

1336
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:09,659
whatever that maximum trigger value was

1337
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:12,119
and then I'm gonna just divide that out

1338
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:16,079
by the maximum that it could be which is

1339
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:17,819
to 255 right so that lets me know like a

1340
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,469
range of what's pushed and we'll decide

1341
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:21,929
you know maybe if it's greater than

1342
01:08:19,469 --> 01:08:23,338
halfway its clutch maybe it's only a

1343
01:08:21,929 --> 01:08:26,159
quarter of the way I don't know how far

1344
01:08:23,338 --> 01:08:28,350
we want to go but that's all it's gonna

1345
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:30,960
do so we don't need a dead zone on it

1346
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:33,270
because the whole control itself is a

1347
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,130
dead zone we're just gonna tune that to

1348
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:42,029
be however far we want to be so we don't

1349
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:44,850
need us best dead zone there because the

1350
01:08:42,029 --> 01:08:46,620
actual control further down the line is

1351
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:50,759
gonna apply that dead zone for us in a

1352
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:52,829
sense okay now if we have this clutch

1353
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:54,659
max value being set for these guys we're

1354
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:58,048
also gonna need the clutch max value set

1355
01:08:54,659 --> 01:09:00,210
for the control for the keyboard so we

1356
01:08:58,048 --> 01:09:02,729
need because we need a way of having

1357
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:05,640
that happen as well so we've got a

1358
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:07,769
spacebar a situation here so I'm gonna

1359
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:11,160
take a look at where that happens so you

1360
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:12,900
can see VK space here and that's

1361
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:17,039
controlling the start key so we're gonna

1362
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:19,909
have to change that so I want VK enter

1363
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:28,109
to now be the start button and we need

1364
01:09:19,909 --> 01:09:31,108
VK space to be something else so hitting

1365
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:34,469
return will start because the spacebar

1366
01:09:31,109 --> 01:09:36,179
it's not gonna be clutch and I mean to

1367
01:09:34,469 --> 01:09:40,020
be honest we could use the clutch for

1368
01:09:36,179 --> 01:09:41,909
this purpose as well so that's kind of

1369
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,890
neither here nor there but for the

1370
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:46,698
moment I'm just gonna say that that's

1371
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:46,699
that's mapping

1372
01:09:49,859 --> 01:10:01,779
so VK space will now do processing on

1373
01:09:56,470 --> 01:10:03,220
the will do pressing on whether or not

1374
01:10:01,779 --> 01:10:09,429
the clutch is gonna be there

1375
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:11,380
and what I don't quite remember in this

1376
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:12,369
case is is there anything else yeah I

1377
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:15,069
don't know if there's anything else I

1378
01:10:12,369 --> 01:10:18,750
really want to set there so what I want

1379
01:10:15,069 --> 01:10:25,809
to do here is if we can look at the

1380
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:29,050
wintery to process keyboard message bit

1381
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:31,150
here you can see this like this half

1382
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:32,710
winter view prosecutor message this half

1383
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:35,019
transition state stuff we don't actually

1384
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:37,779
care about that very much so what we

1385
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:41,790
really want to do is just cold set the

1386
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:45,130
keyboard controller so that the clutch

1387
01:10:41,789 --> 01:10:48,250
max value is just whether it's down or

1388
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:50,650
not so if it's down on any given frame

1389
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:52,899
it's at full clutch if it's up if it's

1390
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:56,399
not down it's at no clutch at all and

1391
01:10:52,899 --> 01:10:56,399
off we go right

1392
01:10:56,470 --> 01:11:09,300
is it DK return oops that's not handmade

1393
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,300
hero

1394
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:23,329
right so in theory now we're good to go

1395
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:27,109
on that and you know in in theory there

1396
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:29,058
is the clutch value now so if I am like

1397
01:11:27,109 --> 01:11:30,439
hopping around now what I want to do is

1398
01:11:29,059 --> 01:11:33,980
make it so that the clutch value would

1399
01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:36,589
switch me to dodging so I'm gonna go

1400
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:42,319
ahead and do that I'm gonna go in here

1401
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:44,960
and take a look at inside the brain code

1402
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:46,340
the hop requested stuff basically what

1403
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,519
I'm saying is if you have the clutch

1404
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:51,920
down you cannot request a hop okay

1405
01:11:49,519 --> 01:11:55,519
that's just right it's just not gonna

1406
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:57,559
happen uh so what I want to do is say

1407
01:11:55,519 --> 01:12:02,090
all right hop requested has yet another

1408
01:11:57,559 --> 01:12:10,579
thing on here which is that I you know

1409
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:16,309
the the level of down miss of the clutch

1410
01:12:10,578 --> 01:12:19,578
will control that so that's where I'm

1411
01:12:16,309 --> 01:12:22,730
looking for dodging maybe so dodging

1412
01:12:19,578 --> 01:12:25,340
will be false and by default you're not

1413
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:26,899
dodging if we did get input here then

1414
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:32,750
what we're going to do is we will look

1415
01:12:26,899 --> 01:12:39,469
to see at the end if whatever the

1416
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:41,179
controller is doing here patroller yeah

1417
01:12:39,469 --> 01:12:43,099
whatever the controller is doing here if

1418
01:12:41,179 --> 01:12:44,750
I take a look at clutch max if that's

1419
01:12:43,099 --> 01:12:44,989
greater than whatever I don't know what

1420
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,988
it is

1421
01:12:44,988 --> 01:12:50,089
then dodging is going to become true and

1422
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:52,189
so then when we get down here we can

1423
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:53,449
just use well we know we'll set that to

1424
01:12:52,189 --> 01:12:56,268
something intelligent up there

1425
01:12:53,448 --> 01:13:00,859
eventually and so from here we can just

1426
01:12:56,269 --> 01:13:02,570
say look if you're not dodging then we

1427
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:04,538
can do the stuff we were doing before

1428
01:13:02,569 --> 01:13:07,250
otherwise you're gonna stay in one place

1429
01:13:04,538 --> 01:13:08,779
and now I can test to see whether that's

1430
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:11,300
actually working if we flip back to the

1431
01:13:08,779 --> 01:13:12,529
game running here so here I'm walking

1432
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:15,769
around and so when I push down the

1433
01:13:12,529 --> 01:13:18,429
clutch you can see now I am just dodging

1434
01:13:15,769 --> 01:13:18,429
right

1435
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:34,159
okay uh so

1436
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:57,329
so I think that's all fine and let me

1437
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,770
just test the keyboard version of that

1438
01:13:57,329 --> 01:14:00,300
as well just to make sure the spacebar

1439
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:04,410
parts working so if I'm hopping around

1440
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:12,840
here and I push the space bar that

1441
01:14:04,409 --> 01:14:15,719
totally didn't work oh right of course

1442
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:21,500
that's not going to work because I

1443
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:23,789
actually need to record whether I don't

1444
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:36,750
remember what happens to that keyboard

1445
01:14:23,789 --> 01:14:39,769
state over time so how does that persist

1446
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:39,770
or not persist

1447
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:05,159
so yeah you can see here how the

1448
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,159
keyboard processing works

1449
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:21,700
actually wait that's not keyboard

1450
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:31,980
processing that's mouse processing why

1451
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:34,569
is that called keyboard processing what

1452
01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:38,939
why did we call this keyboard processing

1453
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:43,179
this is mouse button processing right I

1454
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:47,460
mean look at it there's no keyboard

1455
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:51,940
processing yeah

1456
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:55,510
that's why comments suck they're always

1457
01:15:51,939 --> 01:15:57,489
wrong so anyway if we take a look in the

1458
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:58,869
actual processing for the keyboard code

1459
01:15:57,489 --> 01:16:02,949
because this is Mouse position but

1460
01:15:58,869 --> 01:16:04,689
that's mouse button right what I

1461
01:16:02,949 --> 01:16:06,569
actually want to do here is is figure

1462
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:11,579
out how those keyboard controllers work

1463
01:16:06,569 --> 01:16:16,090
so you can see this is the part that is

1464
01:16:11,579 --> 01:16:20,319
problematic for us we want this keyboard

1465
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:22,770
stuff to work properly as well so the

1466
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:27,460
for every keyboard controller

1467
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:29,470
that we have here yeah you can see we

1468
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:33,430
want the state to persist and I think

1469
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:35,980
that's what's doing it for the other

1470
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:38,650
buttons so what we want to do in this

1471
01:16:35,979 --> 01:16:41,859
case is we want to say like alright the

1472
01:16:38,649 --> 01:16:43,779
new keyboard controller clutch max

1473
01:16:41,859 --> 01:16:45,639
equals the old keyboard controller

1474
01:16:43,779 --> 01:16:46,869
clutch max because we just assume that

1475
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,980
if we haven't gotten another message

1476
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:50,500
then that's what it is

1477
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:52,949
right so we need to persist that value

1478
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,949
forward

1479
01:17:03,329 --> 01:17:07,738
don't ask me why our gloves stayed there

1480
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:31,449
probably because we don't move the glove

1481
01:17:12,219 --> 01:17:33,279
now or something so here's what I will

1482
01:17:31,448 --> 01:17:42,609
say if it's a little concerning about

1483
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:49,059
this is it doesn't feel that good to

1484
01:17:42,609 --> 01:17:51,579
dodge on the keyboard it feels actually

1485
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:54,150
pretty good on the controller I like it

1486
01:17:51,579 --> 01:17:54,149
on the controller

1487
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,548
[Music]

1488
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:08,580
and you know maybe that's okay cuz you

1489
01:18:07,109 --> 01:18:10,619
know this is a game that probably is

1490
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:13,559
meant to be played on the controller but

1491
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:16,289
you know maybe there's a better way to

1492
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:20,190
do dodge on the keyboard I'm gonna leave

1493
01:18:16,289 --> 01:18:28,260
that maybe to figure out a little bit

1494
01:18:20,189 --> 01:18:29,399
later yeah that just feels awesome this

1495
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:32,030
game feels really nice with the

1496
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:32,029
controller now

1497
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:52,659
um I just I really just don't know what

1498
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:54,310
to make of it on the keyboard side of

1499
01:18:52,659 --> 01:18:55,689
things cuz I kind of had this idea about

1500
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:59,530
how it would work and it's definitely

1501
01:18:55,689 --> 01:19:01,809
not gonna work that way now you know

1502
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:03,550
maybe I just give the you the option of

1503
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:05,830
doing you know I'm sort of playing with

1504
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:09,430
it here and like I could see maybe using

1505
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:11,319
the right shift key as a clutch as well

1506
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:13,450
you know maybe if I just give you enough

1507
01:19:11,319 --> 01:19:16,659
keys like left and right shift and space

1508
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:19,649
bar are all like clutches maybe there's

1509
01:19:16,659 --> 01:19:22,930
always one that kind of feels ok to hit

1510
01:19:19,649 --> 01:19:22,929
[Music]

1511
01:19:31,238 --> 01:19:38,859
so I really don't know you know I'll go

1512
01:19:36,469 --> 01:19:42,288
ahead and throw those in there because

1513
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:45,979
maybe it's the right thing to do but I

1514
01:19:42,288 --> 01:19:47,569
don't really know so I'm just gonna go

1515
01:19:45,979 --> 01:19:49,698
ahead and do that because I feel like

1516
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:51,799
spacebar just it doesn't quite feel

1517
01:19:49,698 --> 01:19:57,738
right to hold down the spacebar while

1518
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:59,779
you're doing the dodge and you know the

1519
01:19:57,738 --> 01:20:01,879
other thing you could do is maybe maybe

1520
01:19:59,779 --> 01:20:06,229
one another way to think about dodging

1521
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:10,250
would be like if you just like spam if

1522
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:15,229
you hold down like the the punch key or

1523
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:16,698
something I know III don't have a I

1524
01:20:15,229 --> 01:20:19,848
don't have an idea for it I really don't

1525
01:20:16,698 --> 01:20:25,939
but while we're in here I'll just I'll

1526
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:36,139
go ahead and and throw shift on there as

1527
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:39,859
well so if you get an up-or-down message

1528
01:20:36,139 --> 01:20:42,949
from either of those now probably what I

1529
01:20:39,859 --> 01:20:49,848
should do is use the state of the

1530
01:20:42,948 --> 01:20:53,238
keyboard you know like if we if you

1531
01:20:49,849 --> 01:20:55,880
Union some keys together in this way

1532
01:20:53,238 --> 01:21:05,000
then what we probably want to do here is

1533
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:07,929
actually check for those check for those

1534
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,929
keys here

1535
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:25,550
like this so basically if I get a

1536
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:28,070
message for space or shift what I want

1537
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:30,829
to avoid is if you push down the shift

1538
01:21:28,069 --> 01:21:32,630
key then push down the spacebar then let

1539
01:21:30,829 --> 01:21:34,488
go of the shift key but don't let go of

1540
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:37,640
the spacebar that should probably still

1541
01:21:34,488 --> 01:21:40,209
be dodging right so I don't want to

1542
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:43,789
assume that the last up message we get

1543
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:45,649
means it's up if we haven't received up

1544
01:21:43,789 --> 01:21:48,140
messages from everybody else yet right

1545
01:21:45,649 --> 01:21:52,609
so what I want to do is I want to

1546
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:55,010
essentially do something that looks a

1547
01:21:52,609 --> 01:21:57,559
little bit like this so we say look if

1548
01:21:55,010 --> 01:22:04,430
space or shift either of those two is

1549
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:08,270
down then the clutch is down right and

1550
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:10,310
that way it's not gonna like take which

1551
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:12,980
ever one comes up first as meaning it's

1552
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:14,810
up so now if I hit shift it's down right

1553
01:22:12,979 --> 01:22:16,639
clutch is still down in holding space I

1554
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:18,680
let go of shift I'm still in clutch I

1555
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:23,150
let go of space I'm in clutch I'm out of

1556
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:27,890
flat rather right and so we'll just use

1557
01:22:23,149 --> 01:22:30,229
that for now and that seems fine so I'm

1558
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:32,469
just going to call that good for now if

1559
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:35,959
you don't like it call a game designer

1560
01:22:32,469 --> 01:22:37,310
that's their job not mine and I'm not

1561
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:44,000
responsible for those kinds of decisions

1562
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:47,330
now what I want to do now is allow the

1563
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:52,819
dodging and the hopping to work a little

1564
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:54,289
bit more fluidly we don't have to do the

1565
01:22:52,819 --> 01:22:59,988
thing that I said at the beginning which

1566
01:22:54,289 --> 01:23:01,488
is to look to see whether or not whether

1567
01:22:59,988 --> 01:23:03,109
or not a timer has elapsed because now

1568
01:23:01,488 --> 01:23:09,169
we're saying look there's a button for

1569
01:23:03,109 --> 01:23:11,569
it period right and so what I want to do

1570
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:14,329
now is just kind of make the feel a

1571
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:15,769
little bit more fluid you'll notice that

1572
01:23:14,329 --> 01:23:18,199
right now we just move the head and the

1573
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:19,700
body doesn't lean so I can put that in

1574
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:23,119
there and I also put a little bit of

1575
01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:24,469
crouch down on the clutch so there's a

1576
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:25,039
couple things I just kind of want to do

1577
01:23:24,469 --> 01:23:26,899
there

1578
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:28,069
kind of like rounded out a little bit

1579
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:29,719
this turned out to be easier than if I

1580
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:32,590
was gonna be so it looks like it'll all

1581
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:35,690
base to be done today I mean I got I

1582
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:40,610
don't know 10 20 minutes left or

1583
01:23:35,689 --> 01:23:42,019
something so yeah we kind of did what I

1584
01:23:40,609 --> 01:23:44,449
was planning I thought it might take a

1585
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:45,500
couple days of programming to get it to

1586
01:23:44,449 --> 01:23:54,590
where I wanted but it's pretty much

1587
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:56,960
there so again come up say sube we come

1588
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:59,420
on down here and you can see all this

1589
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,739
code that's in the if zero what I want

1590
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:02,869
to do is just take a look at the the

1591
01:24:00,739 --> 01:24:07,609
code for the leanin direct direction

1592
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:10,550
right and kind of get that bit in there

1593
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:14,599
so when we look at this here you can see

1594
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:18,050
that there was sort of a a head distance

1595
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:21,260
thing that was getting created here like

1596
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:23,510
how far the head was away and there's

1597
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:26,720
like a bob delta and all this stuff and

1598
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:30,530
a floor displacement and all this sort

1599
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:33,829
of nonsense and so what I need to kind

1600
01:24:30,529 --> 01:24:36,769
of do is look at how that stuff was

1601
01:24:33,829 --> 01:24:39,979
working and just put this back in there

1602
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:43,280
now it looks to me like this might be

1603
01:24:39,979 --> 01:24:45,109
somewhat isolated like I don't know if I

1604
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:47,149
can just rename a like this code for

1605
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:50,960
example and pretty much be done I'm not

1606
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:52,819
quite sure I'm gonna look and see what I

1607
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:57,800
don't remember much of what this stuff

1608
01:24:52,819 --> 01:24:59,119
is doing so we'll see yeah so so

1609
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:02,720
basically the code that kind of

1610
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:10,189
stretched him out along the way and and

1611
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:13,180
did the dodging and so on that's just

1612
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:13,179
still in there right

1613
01:25:15,488 --> 01:25:20,738
and so what I kind of need to do now is

1614
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:24,130
probably like figure out a way to

1615
01:25:20,738 --> 01:25:26,169
indicate that you can't go diagonally I

1616
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:28,060
mean another thing I could do just not

1617
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:30,159
let you go diagonally and not feel the

1618
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:33,250
need to indicate it at all but that's

1619
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:35,380
another story but basically yeah this is

1620
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:37,960
all I wanted and we don't really I think

1621
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:38,920
when I I got to put some new art in

1622
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,689
there

1623
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:42,640
this is the old art that's not really

1624
01:25:40,689 --> 01:25:44,769
drawn at the right perspective so I'm

1625
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:46,239
not too worried about the weird look of

1626
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:48,160
that I just want to make sure that it's

1627
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:55,059
stretching properly and it looks like it

1628
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:57,569
is the moment right so I think that's

1629
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:57,570
all good

1630
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:50,770
so I think that's all I wanted to do

1631
01:26:45,909 --> 01:27:02,889
with that part of the code so I don't

1632
01:26:50,770 --> 01:27:08,770
know the rest of this stuff here so all

1633
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:10,250
of this can just go like I don't care

1634
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:13,720
about any of this

1635
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:13,720
[Music]

1636
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:21,060
let's just eliminate dead code here so I

1637
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:24,100
don't care about any of these things I

1638
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:26,770
don't know what the recenter timer is

1639
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:35,730
anymore and I don't think we care about

1640
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:35,730
it so I'm going to delete that as well

1641
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:48,820
in fact let's just let's just get rid of

1642
01:27:41,829 --> 01:27:51,000
that wholesale so that's just not in

1643
01:27:48,819 --> 01:27:51,000
there anymore

1644
01:27:51,449 --> 01:27:57,939
all right and so we've got this other

1645
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:59,710
code still in there the head DDP the

1646
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:02,559
head doesn't get a DDP any more that's

1647
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:05,880
just not a thing so I don't care about

1648
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:07,810
any of this the movement mode

1649
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:12,720
[Music]

1650
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:17,470
is already handled above I think I don't

1651
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:21,510
want any of that the bob parts so that

1652
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:25,260
might be something I kind of want to do

1653
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:25,260
so let me just look

1654
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:42,119
I'm not sure what body DP ever actually

1655
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:45,170
does so let's take it one step at a time

1656
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:49,739
I'm going to leave this out for a moment

1657
01:28:45,170 --> 01:29:08,460
and then I'll get rid of em anything in

1658
01:28:49,739 --> 01:29:12,869
there that I don't like yep that's all

1659
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:24,750
good and so the body DP part I don't

1660
01:29:12,869 --> 01:29:30,409
think matters the this part here we were

1661
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:34,260
adjusting the DDT Bob value of the body

1662
01:29:30,409 --> 01:29:38,699
based on some head distance stuff and

1663
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:46,680
I'm not sure what that really needed to

1664
01:29:38,699 --> 01:29:50,039
do so yeah I don't think we need that

1665
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:55,230
but let's see what happens with it in

1666
01:29:50,039 --> 01:29:58,289
the first place it's just some micro

1667
01:29:55,229 --> 01:30:01,250
control stuff for like adjusting the

1668
01:29:58,289 --> 01:30:01,250
bounce I think

1669
01:30:09,729 --> 01:30:14,439
so it's fine I mean we can leave it in

1670
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:14,439
there

1671
01:30:33,319 --> 01:30:39,439
getting some weird lighting effects on

1672
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:41,510
that I wonder if we have some bugs there

1673
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:43,429
or if that's just because when this gets

1674
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:47,960
far enough away they're sort of hitting

1675
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:53,360
an aggregate light value that that is

1676
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:55,310
not properly shadowed right like our

1677
01:30:53,359 --> 01:31:00,170
aggregate light volume stuff is probably

1678
01:30:55,310 --> 01:31:01,220
a little bit bad you know but

1679
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:02,539
occasionally I see some lighting

1680
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:04,090
happening here that probably shouldn't

1681
01:31:02,539 --> 01:31:06,380
be happening

1682
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:13,960
not sure how concerned I should be about

1683
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:13,960
it but anyway so that seems fine anyway

1684
01:31:16,119 --> 01:31:22,670
so I think that's all fine what I do

1685
01:31:19,369 --> 01:31:28,340
want to do here is look at the DDT Bob

1686
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:30,829
stuff I I want that squishiness for the

1687
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:38,770
Dodge I want that to maybe be a little

1688
01:31:30,829 --> 01:31:38,769
bit related to Klutch max so yeah like

1689
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:57,640
I'm gonna take a look inside the env

1690
01:31:53,289 --> 01:31:59,140
stuff for the movement mode and just

1691
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:10,539
look at how this is working

1692
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:14,650
sooo it looks like I could just hold set

1693
01:32:10,539 --> 01:32:17,779
the t-bob value if I wanted to

1694
01:32:14,649 --> 01:32:17,779
[Music]

1695
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:58,579
what I want is when you hold down the

1696
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:58,579
clutch button I want him to kind of

1697
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:06,770
compress relative to that that push and

1698
01:33:11,029 --> 01:33:17,639
I'm just not sure if I want to like dig

1699
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:22,559
into that code much right now or not but

1700
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:24,390
like the t-bob value I'm just gonna like

1701
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,310
see like just play around tell it so

1702
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:31,740
let's say I just cold set the t-bob

1703
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:38,160
value just straight up and I set that to

1704
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:46,050
be whatever the clutch max is so maybe

1705
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:50,399
like in here we have you know when we

1706
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:52,440
get the controller out I will just say

1707
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:57,779
okay the clutch level equals the

1708
01:33:52,439 --> 01:34:09,599
controller clutch max just in general

1709
01:33:57,779 --> 01:34:16,319
and okay so t-bob going up it actually

1710
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:22,380
makes that go up and the head doesn't

1711
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:27,630
actually go up or down based on that

1712
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:31,550
value but I could probably displace them

1713
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:31,550
a little bit

1714
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:51,690
so I guess what I would say is let's

1715
01:34:47,369 --> 01:34:56,010
suppose I did the head is the body P

1716
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:58,909
plus a deep GDP plus some nominal value

1717
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:58,909
I don't know what it is

1718
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:08,720
that's a Z displacement and the Z

1719
01:35:04,109 --> 01:35:15,210
displacement is going to be times the

1720
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:17,369
clutch level right I and specifically

1721
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:19,590
probably the inverse of the clutch level

1722
01:35:17,369 --> 01:35:22,050
so the further the harder you press on

1723
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:24,380
the clutch the further the head will go

1724
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,380
down

1725
01:35:31,939 --> 01:35:38,340
yeah that's that's more what I'm looking

1726
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:42,049
for there and then I'll set the t-bob

1727
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:45,748
value to kind of mirror that so you know

1728
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:49,498
and in fact I can do it in watch here

1729
01:35:45,748 --> 01:35:50,819
which just like says all right you know

1730
01:35:49,498 --> 01:35:54,029
if you want something that counter

1731
01:35:50,819 --> 01:35:57,359
varies with the clutch you can have that

1732
01:35:54,029 --> 01:35:59,849
and so here you can see me setting the

1733
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:01,799
thing to the Bob value I'm gonna set it

1734
01:35:59,849 --> 01:36:14,128
to the inverse clutch level I'm at that

1735
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:16,979
as well and I don't really want to get

1736
01:36:14,128 --> 01:36:19,229
rid of the bobbing feel for the body so

1737
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:21,418
I want to not quite override it like

1738
01:36:19,229 --> 01:36:27,989
that I'm just doing that at first right

1739
01:36:21,418 --> 01:36:30,569
so you can see this way we have you can

1740
01:36:27,988 --> 01:36:33,118
have like visual confirmation of the

1741
01:36:30,569 --> 01:36:37,139
clutch going down just because otherwise

1742
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:39,779
I mean it's just kind of like you're hey

1743
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:41,788
it's down I think right so having visual

1744
01:36:39,779 --> 01:36:45,509
confirmation of the clutch going down so

1745
01:36:41,788 --> 01:36:54,628
you can dodge more confidently is all

1746
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:57,059
I'm looking for there right and you can

1747
01:36:54,628 --> 01:36:59,939
see we've lost the springiness now and

1748
01:36:57,059 --> 01:37:04,248
that's because of this line over Mt Bob

1749
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:04,249
so what I want to do here is say like

1750
01:37:05,689 --> 01:37:11,550
that there's like a concept of whatever

1751
01:37:08,248 --> 01:37:15,260
the clutch Fat Bob value is right and I

1752
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:19,829
want the key Bob value to say like don't

1753
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:24,300
whatever that value is I want you to

1754
01:37:19,828 --> 01:37:34,248
make sure that you aren't going to go

1755
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:34,248
above it if you're dodging I guess

1756
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:41,289
I mean really what I want to do is set

1757
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:50,950
this as a target in this case and not in

1758
01:37:41,289 --> 01:37:53,109
the other cases so I think I probably

1759
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:56,670
want to like as we kind of do a little

1760
01:37:53,109 --> 01:37:56,670
bit more with the animation floors there

1761
01:38:04,409 --> 01:38:09,519
so it's probably not quite what you

1762
01:38:07,689 --> 01:38:10,779
really want in this case but what I'm

1763
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:15,600
gonna do is say all right we set a

1764
01:38:10,779 --> 01:38:18,039
clutch Bob target if we're dodging then

1765
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:21,430
you know maybe it sets it if we're not

1766
01:38:18,039 --> 01:38:36,630
maybe we don't maybe that's what I'll do

1767
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:36,630
for now but we may want some fancier

1768
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:03,610
yeah so we're gonna want something

1769
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:08,139
fancier than that and I guess we'll see

1770
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:11,289
what happens when we when we put some

1771
01:39:08,139 --> 01:39:13,980
art in there we may want do some other

1772
01:39:11,289 --> 01:39:13,979
stuff right

1773
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:38,619
so what I the only other thing I think I

1774
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:40,420
need to do now is I want to prevent you

1775
01:39:38,619 --> 01:39:41,470
from being to go diagonally because I

1776
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:44,819
don't think you're supposed to be able

1777
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:44,820
to go diagonally in this game ever

1778
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:52,019
it's supposed to be Cardinal movement

1779
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:57,550
only so what I'd like to do there is

1780
01:39:52,020 --> 01:40:00,480
kind of snap you to one or the other so

1781
01:39:57,550 --> 01:40:03,190
when we talk about the movement there

1782
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:08,799
you can see we've got the hop requested

1783
01:40:03,189 --> 01:40:11,589
part this DDP normal I guess I need to

1784
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:14,470
kind of do another yet one more step on

1785
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:16,840
there and maybe the DDP normal value

1786
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:18,430
should just need this in general but I'm

1787
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:22,300
gonna just introduce another value which

1788
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:25,060
is like like a D target value that'll be

1789
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:29,560
two times it'll be this value to start

1790
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:32,289
with but it's gonna threshold its two

1791
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:36,640
values so basically it'll say like if

1792
01:40:32,289 --> 01:40:38,619
the absolute value of D target X is

1793
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:44,850
greater than the absolute value of D

1794
01:40:38,619 --> 01:40:44,849
target Y so basically just looking at

1795
01:40:45,479 --> 01:40:54,099
whichever component is greater right

1796
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:57,460
then all zero the other one so whichever

1797
01:40:54,100 --> 01:41:00,610
one's greater gets the preference and

1798
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:03,730
that's the direction you go and that'll

1799
01:41:00,609 --> 01:41:05,679
just prevent you from moving on a

1800
01:41:03,729 --> 01:41:08,229
diagonal so you know I can still use the

1801
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:11,170
analog stick like I'm using here but if

1802
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:16,779
I try to go diagonally it just goes in

1803
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:19,180
whatever direction you go you sort of

1804
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:24,880
are mostly pushing in if that makes

1805
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:28,300
sense and then the player will just know

1806
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:32,039
they can't go diagonally so you know no

1807
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:32,039
harm no foul right

1808
01:41:33,849 --> 01:41:38,179
now whether I don't know if I want the

1809
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:39,860
head to reflect the fact that you can't

1810
01:41:38,179 --> 01:41:49,729
or not we can cross that bridge later

1811
01:41:39,859 --> 01:41:52,549
but for now hey that's fine all right so

1812
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:54,019
that's good I'm happy with that let's go

1813
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:54,439
ahead and go to Q&amp;A I think we're almost

1814
01:41:54,019 --> 01:41:56,570
done

1815
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:58,989
two minutes left if anyone has any

1816
01:41:56,569 --> 01:41:58,988
questions

1817
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:58,710
hmm in Subodh is doing some good stuff

1818
01:42:44,340 --> 01:43:02,090
there feller on for the win failfish are

1819
01:42:58,710 --> 01:43:10,619
you planning on having a jump command no

1820
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:12,360
everything this character does jumps so

1821
01:43:10,619 --> 01:43:22,439
in some sense there are only jump

1822
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:24,960
commands a Celeron was just you know how

1823
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:28,019
nowadays they have like Core i5 and core

1824
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:30,810
i7 and stuff like that

1825
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:33,600
Celeron was just a previous sort of

1826
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:36,900
version of that kind of branding where

1827
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:38,400
there were slower or perhaps more

1828
01:43:36,899 --> 01:43:41,389
power-efficient or whatever but it

1829
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:44,699
wasn't the high performance version

1830
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:47,900
that's all Celeron was if I remember

1831
01:43:44,699 --> 01:43:51,750
correctly so they were basically like

1832
01:43:47,899 --> 01:43:54,329
you know what a maybe an i3 or an i5 is

1833
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:59,359
today is what a Celeron it's just

1834
01:43:54,329 --> 01:44:04,189
branding it was just a way of creating a

1835
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:07,738
more readily consumer identifiable name

1836
01:44:04,189 --> 01:44:10,738
for the difference between a Pentium and

1837
01:44:07,738 --> 01:44:14,009
a seller on or would you know like those

1838
01:44:10,738 --> 01:44:16,649
kinds of things Intel's not very good at

1839
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:18,600
that they tend to not name things very

1840
01:44:16,649 --> 01:44:22,500
understandable for the average person

1841
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:25,039
and so I don't ask me why they don't try

1842
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:28,550
harder on stuff like that but you know

1843
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:28,550
it's just how it is

1844
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:39,890
there were some questions around b3 2 X

1845
01:44:35,659 --> 01:44:41,599
versus B 32 at some point B 32 X is just

1846
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:44,840
saying that I don't care how big this

1847
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:47,030
value is I just am storing a boolean in

1848
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:48,739
it yes it's like yes or no it's a true

1849
01:44:47,029 --> 01:44:50,179
or false value but I don't care how much

1850
01:44:48,739 --> 01:44:52,010
space it takes so use whatever the most

1851
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:54,170
convenient thing is for the processor be

1852
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:57,890
32 on the other hand says use exactly 32

1853
01:44:54,170 --> 01:44:59,359
bits to store this boolean period even

1854
01:44:57,890 --> 01:45:05,030
if the processor would rather store it

1855
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:07,339
as 64 bits or something else right how

1856
01:45:05,029 --> 01:45:09,500
about a dive and slide command I want as

1857
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:14,390
few of commands as possible so it was

1858
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:21,470
just gonna be dodging move ideally so

1859
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:23,270
hopefully no but I you know I don't put

1860
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:27,500
any control remapping interface

1861
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:31,100
probably not we will probably do some

1862
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:33,340
support for other keyboards because not

1863
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:39,950
everyone has like WASD in the same place

1864
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:41,390
but I know you're viewing comments but I

1865
01:45:39,949 --> 01:45:42,739
often see you asked myself what was all

1866
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:44,240
that about when looking at old code

1867
01:45:42,739 --> 01:45:46,550
wouldn't be beneficial to comment now

1868
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:51,500
yourself no because it's wrong that's

1869
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:52,820
it's the same problem always comments

1870
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,470
are old widow

1871
01:45:52,819 --> 01:45:55,819
I would totally use comments if I

1872
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:58,130
compiler check them to see if they

1873
01:45:55,819 --> 01:46:00,469
actually were accurate but they it

1874
01:45:58,130 --> 01:46:03,380
doesn't so commenting old code is

1875
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:05,420
usually worse because the comments are

1876
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:07,310
probably also wrong which means now it

1877
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:09,289
will mislead you into thinking it does

1878
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:10,850
something else so I try to just always

1879
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:17,029
reread the code and figure out what it

1880
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:19,070
did shut up 4 6 7 what is the reason of

1881
01:46:17,029 --> 01:46:23,719
pure C I think see both pluses OOP and

1882
01:46:19,069 --> 01:46:25,429
procedural coverage much better so I

1883
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:26,750
don't like it I don't think it's a good

1884
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:29,630
language that's why I don't use it if

1885
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:31,640
you like it then well no one's stopping

1886
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:33,609
you if you don't care how much space of

1887
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:36,950
bool is why not use b8x

1888
01:46:33,609 --> 01:46:40,460
the reason for that is just because

1889
01:46:36,949 --> 01:46:44,420
sometimes they move in between so for

1890
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:46,130
example a lot of times I'll do some

1891
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:49,310
comparison of two 32-bit file

1892
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:51,230
and then put that into Brule and I want

1893
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:54,500
that to stay 32-bits so the processor

1894
01:46:51,229 --> 01:46:56,379
would keep it clean through right so

1895
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:58,579
typically I try to make everything b32

1896
01:46:56,380 --> 01:47:00,020
it's kind of like as if you were simply

1897
01:46:58,579 --> 01:47:02,750
programming it you want all of your

1898
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:05,390
lanes to be the same so typically I try

1899
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:08,029
to keep it as the same Lane size always

1900
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:11,380
throughout so if I was using you eights

1901
01:47:08,029 --> 01:47:11,380
I'd probably use a v8 right

1902
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:22,730
we eventually make these input commands

1903
01:47:16,149 --> 01:47:28,609
event-driven what do you mean by

1904
01:47:22,729 --> 01:47:30,819
event-driven I'm not sure I understand

1905
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:30,819
the question

1906
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:48,540
I'm in here what do you think are the

1907
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:51,630
disadvantage of samosas compared to see

1908
01:47:48,539 --> 01:47:54,448
isn't see basically subsets useless yeah

1909
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:56,190
so you know I've talked about this many

1910
01:47:54,448 --> 01:47:58,409
many many many many times before so go

1911
01:47:56,189 --> 01:48:00,149
look at the episode guide if you want to

1912
01:47:58,409 --> 01:48:03,359
hear more about it but generally

1913
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:06,479
speaking yes see is more or less a

1914
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:08,460
subset of C++ and I actually use C++

1915
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:11,488
like these are this is actually

1916
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:13,980
compiling as C++ so I'm not compiling a

1917
01:48:11,488 --> 01:48:19,649
C I just don't like the features that

1918
01:48:13,979 --> 01:48:21,988
C++ added because they're crappy so it's

1919
01:48:19,649 --> 01:48:23,579
it's not that I don't compile my code to

1920
01:48:21,988 --> 01:48:25,049
see much less I do some people don't

1921
01:48:23,579 --> 01:48:30,929
some people actually compile their code

1922
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:34,500
to see so you know that's a different

1923
01:48:30,929 --> 01:48:36,690
thing I actually still use C++ per se

1924
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:39,779
meaning it is a C++ file compiled with a

1925
01:48:36,689 --> 01:48:41,899
C++ compiler I just don't use most C++

1926
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:45,689
features because I don't like them I

1927
01:48:41,899 --> 01:48:47,029
don't think they're effective if that

1928
01:48:45,689 --> 01:48:50,399
makes sense

1929
01:48:47,029 --> 01:48:54,689
like if I wrote the book effective C++

1930
01:48:50,399 --> 01:49:00,509
it would just be empty right there'd be

1931
01:48:54,689 --> 01:49:03,178
one page in it that says you see and

1932
01:49:00,510 --> 01:49:05,489
that would be it right so it's it's

1933
01:49:03,179 --> 01:49:07,170
mostly that right it's it's mostly just

1934
01:49:05,488 --> 01:49:08,849
about what I think is good in the

1935
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:11,159
language and what I don't use features

1936
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:13,410
that I don't think are good and I don't

1937
01:49:11,159 --> 01:49:14,789
think the features that C++ added to see

1938
01:49:13,409 --> 01:49:20,399
we're good I think they were all pretty

1939
01:49:14,789 --> 01:49:23,550
lousy which is not to say that I that

1940
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:25,738
there aren't miles worth of features of

1941
01:49:23,550 --> 01:49:27,600
that I would add to see it's just simple

1942
01:49:25,738 --> 01:49:29,609
stuff didn't add any of them right

1943
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:32,270
there's so many features I would add to

1944
01:49:29,609 --> 01:49:34,500
C and C bus plus added like none of them

1945
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:38,400
so that's why I don't use it

1946
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:41,520
they added things in the vicinity of

1947
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:43,829
what I want like you know they they

1948
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:45,480
added metaprogramming like stuff with

1949
01:49:43,829 --> 01:49:47,670
templates they just did it all wrong and

1950
01:49:45,479 --> 01:49:49,109
so I would actually rather have no meta

1951
01:49:47,670 --> 01:49:54,929
programming than their meta programming

1952
01:49:49,109 --> 01:49:56,639
right and you know they I like dispatch

1953
01:49:54,929 --> 01:49:58,140
tables but they added them as

1954
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:00,210
inheritance based vitae

1955
01:49:58,140 --> 01:50:05,130
which I don't like so I don't use them

1956
01:50:00,210 --> 01:50:06,779
right so you know C++ is kind of CMOS

1957
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:09,390
this is an example of a language that

1958
01:50:06,779 --> 01:50:11,670
every time there was something I would

1959
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:13,619
have added they added the wrong version

1960
01:50:11,670 --> 01:50:15,930
of it such that I would just prefer not

1961
01:50:13,619 --> 01:50:17,279
to use it but there were good versions

1962
01:50:15,930 --> 01:50:19,140
of all the things they added they just

1963
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:21,960
didn't add those they added crappy ones

1964
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:23,520
and so I don't use it long boolean

1965
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:24,930
something I thought of of course it is a

1966
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:27,090
gameplay thing type to you you could

1967
01:50:24,930 --> 01:50:29,190
have the Dodge double as an attack or

1968
01:50:27,090 --> 01:50:37,079
have it push enemies away in the

1969
01:50:29,189 --> 01:50:41,369
direction of the Dodge it's not a bad

1970
01:50:37,079 --> 01:50:49,829
idea we'll have to see how it progresses

1971
01:50:41,369 --> 01:50:52,289
I'll keep it in mind since you

1972
01:50:49,829 --> 01:50:54,029
interviewed Pat Wyatt in 2015 handmade

1973
01:50:52,289 --> 01:50:58,760
Khan have you ever thought about copying

1974
01:50:54,029 --> 01:51:02,519
the Guild Wars fo z axis configuration

1975
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:05,280
so do I know what that is I don't know

1976
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:10,230
if I know what the guild war is foes the

1977
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:11,670
axis configuration is so I mean the

1978
01:51:10,229 --> 01:51:13,679
answer to answer the question literally

1979
01:51:11,670 --> 01:51:14,730
no I have not thought about copying it

1980
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:18,170
because I don't think I know what that

1981
01:51:14,729 --> 01:51:18,169
is what is that

1982
01:51:50,739 --> 01:51:54,170
what is happening with C++ templates

1983
01:51:53,329 --> 01:51:55,460
that shouldn't be

1984
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:59,149
isn't it just generating code based on

1985
01:51:55,460 --> 01:52:01,069
the temp remembers yeah so I mean to be

1986
01:51:59,149 --> 01:52:03,409
specific about C++ templates

1987
01:52:01,069 --> 01:52:05,659
the problem with C++ templates is that

1988
01:52:03,409 --> 01:52:07,519
the way that meta programming it needs

1989
01:52:05,659 --> 01:52:11,090
to work is it has to work across

1990
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:13,090
elements so basically in order for a

1991
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:15,949
meta programming system to have any

1992
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:17,480
important level of power it has to be

1993
01:52:15,949 --> 01:52:19,279
able to do things like look at the call

1994
01:52:17,479 --> 01:52:23,169
graph it has to be able to do things

1995
01:52:19,279 --> 01:52:28,099
like introspection and C++ added like

1996
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:30,670
literally the most useless part of meta

1997
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:35,560
programming which is passing a type as

1998
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:41,180
at compile time right and it's just

1999
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:43,370
really benign and like ineffectual it's

2000
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:45,409
like it's it's like the least useful

2001
01:52:43,369 --> 01:52:48,079
thing you can do in meta programming and

2002
01:52:45,409 --> 01:52:49,699
then they tried to like build everything

2003
01:52:48,079 --> 01:52:52,489
on top of it for some reason it's

2004
01:52:49,699 --> 01:52:55,369
laughable how bad it is like even really

2005
01:52:52,489 --> 01:52:57,889
basic stuff like like injection and

2006
01:52:55,369 --> 01:53:00,559
stuff you can't even do right so like

2007
01:52:57,890 --> 01:53:01,550
you know a really typical thing you'd

2008
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,980
want to be able to do with meta

2009
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:07,760
programming to say hey I want to insert

2010
01:53:03,979 --> 01:53:11,059
a linked list linkage like a next at a

2011
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:13,010
previous into an existing type and like

2012
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:16,010
you can't even come close to doing that

2013
01:53:13,010 --> 01:53:19,659
C++ there they're like years away from

2014
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:24,079
even thinking about how to do that right

2015
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:29,599
and that's like meta programming 101

2016
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:31,159
right so I don't know I mean I think it

2017
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:32,630
was just it was written by people who'd

2018
01:53:31,159 --> 01:53:35,180
never done Megha Mehta part name before

2019
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:39,609
it's what I think in fact I kind of know

2020
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:48,950
that's true um maybe to a certain extent

2021
01:53:39,609 --> 01:53:50,929
so but you know what what do you think

2022
01:53:48,949 --> 01:53:52,130
about nd component systems as the engine

2023
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:54,770
architecture how would you implement

2024
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:58,760
this if you don't use inheritance sorry

2025
01:53:54,770 --> 01:54:00,770
if it's off topic well so the problem

2026
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:03,270
with that is I'm not sure what you mean

2027
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:04,590
by entity component systems because

2028
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:06,420
different people mean different things

2029
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:09,060
from my experience when they say that

2030
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:10,649
but I guess I would just ask why do you

2031
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:13,410
think you need inheritance to make an

2032
01:54:10,649 --> 01:54:15,179
empathy component system can't you just

2033
01:54:13,409 --> 01:54:19,439
have an enum that says what the type is

2034
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:20,760
like I mean what why do you think that

2035
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:23,819
inheritance would be something that's

2036
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:25,560
required ever really but just even

2037
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:27,329
especially in that case I recently

2038
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,440
learned about imperfect shadowed maps I

2039
01:54:27,329 --> 01:54:29,699
wonder if that could be a substitute for

2040
01:54:28,439 --> 01:54:35,129
Ray casting in the current lighting

2041
01:54:29,699 --> 01:54:36,569
system at least on the GPU so not really

2042
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:38,489
because remember we don't have

2043
01:54:36,569 --> 01:54:39,869
individual light sources everything in

2044
01:54:38,489 --> 01:54:43,710
the game can be an emitter if it wants

2045
01:54:39,869 --> 01:54:46,050
to be so shadow maps don't really work I

2046
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:51,659
don't remember which one in perfect

2047
01:54:46,050 --> 01:54:54,210
shadow maps are so I apologize if they

2048
01:54:51,659 --> 01:54:58,609
somehow allow everything in the world to

2049
01:54:54,210 --> 01:55:01,050
be an emitter but I assume they don't

2050
01:54:58,609 --> 01:55:04,559
because I assume they still take some

2051
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:07,340
shadow maps if I remember correctly I

2052
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,340
could be wrong about that

2053
01:55:36,489 --> 01:55:39,840
any other questions

2054
01:55:54,979 --> 01:56:05,780
400 viewers that does seem like a pretty

2055
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:05,779
high number for your average Sunday

2056
01:56:16,930 --> 01:56:20,590
the flame 937 even if you don't do

2057
01:56:18,969 --> 01:56:23,439
Network for the game but you do some

2058
01:56:20,590 --> 01:56:27,880
lecture about it probably not because I

2059
01:56:23,439 --> 01:56:30,369
am NOT a network game programmer so you

2060
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:32,199
know I mean I know how to do basic

2061
01:56:30,369 --> 01:56:34,630
networking stuff because I've made

2062
01:56:32,199 --> 01:56:36,609
things that you know do land-based

2063
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:40,569
networking for various reasons like

2064
01:56:36,609 --> 01:56:44,738
tools and stuff like that but generally

2065
01:56:40,569 --> 01:56:48,519
speaking I don't do that sort of stuff

2066
01:56:44,738 --> 01:56:50,109
for a living right so on a handmade hero

2067
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:56,290
I try to stick with things I'm at least

2068
01:56:50,109 --> 01:56:58,809
fairly comfortable with and I certainly

2069
01:56:56,289 --> 01:57:00,850
would never give a lecture on stuff like

2070
01:56:58,810 --> 01:57:02,200
you know I'm here we do some stuff that

2071
01:57:00,850 --> 01:57:05,829
are not my job like lighting isn't

2072
01:57:02,199 --> 01:57:07,269
something I typically do right so you

2073
01:57:05,829 --> 01:57:08,649
know I'm not an expert on it but we need

2074
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:11,560
to do something for the game so I did it

2075
01:57:08,649 --> 01:57:15,569
right and it's probably not the best you

2076
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:15,570
know if you went and asked you know

2077
01:57:17,189 --> 01:57:25,738
somebody to do I don't know like like

2078
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:28,390
let's say you ask someone from the the

2079
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:34,059
ed tech team to do the lighting or

2080
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:35,619
something right they the or maybe like

2081
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:39,280
an Nvidia research guide to do the

2082
01:57:35,619 --> 01:57:41,738
lighting or something right they would

2083
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:42,699
do a better job on the algorithm than I

2084
01:57:41,738 --> 01:57:44,529
would cuz that's what they spend all

2085
01:57:42,699 --> 01:57:46,840
their time doing right but I'm okay with

2086
01:57:44,529 --> 01:57:48,099
you know it's important to be versatile

2087
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:50,110
as a programmer so I'm okay with showing

2088
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:53,980
how to do stuff that maybe isn't my

2089
01:57:50,109 --> 01:57:55,299
strong suit but just so you have some

2090
01:57:53,979 --> 01:57:56,009
familiarity with kind of just how it

2091
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:59,340
goes

2092
01:57:56,010 --> 01:58:01,829
networking I've literally never done any

2093
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:04,270
network game programming on any

2094
01:58:01,829 --> 01:58:05,319
significant scale like anything that had

2095
01:58:04,270 --> 01:58:07,540
to really be played on the internet I've

2096
01:58:05,319 --> 01:58:09,189
never worked on that side and I so I

2097
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:12,729
wouldn't even really know what to tell

2098
01:58:09,189 --> 01:58:14,799
you it's something that you at least

2099
01:58:12,729 --> 01:58:16,779
need some experience having done

2100
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:24,130
real-world stuff to really know what to

2101
01:58:16,779 --> 01:58:26,079
program and so you know if there was a

2102
01:58:24,130 --> 01:58:28,060
reason to show you how to duel and

2103
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:29,140
networking we could do that but there

2104
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:31,330
really isn't

2105
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:33,789
cuz nobody does that there's no such

2106
01:58:31,329 --> 01:58:36,850
thing as land only games anymore games

2107
01:58:33,789 --> 01:58:38,949
are either couch co-op meaning they just

2108
01:58:36,850 --> 01:58:42,160
run on one machine or they play over the

2109
01:58:38,949 --> 01:58:44,500
Internet and land parties are just too

2110
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:48,550
rare for a game to be only land party

2111
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:50,170
based right so no I'm probably never

2112
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:53,140
gonna cover that and the reason is just

2113
01:58:50,170 --> 01:58:55,000
because it's really something you need

2114
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,590
to have done in order to say anything

2115
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,289
about it sending packets back and forth

2116
01:58:56,590 --> 01:59:01,329
takes like 10 seconds anyone can do it

2117
01:58:59,289 --> 01:59:03,670
that's not the hard part like getting

2118
01:59:01,329 --> 01:59:06,640
through mats and figuring out what to do

2119
01:59:03,670 --> 01:59:10,329
about you know packet loss and rate

2120
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:11,500
limiting and replay attacks and blah

2121
01:59:10,329 --> 01:59:13,720
blah blah blah blah like all that stuff

2122
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:16,090
you just you kind of need to have some

2123
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:19,360
experience having done and so I really

2124
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:20,289
have nothing to say about it it's

2125
01:59:19,359 --> 01:59:22,449
something you don't have to learn

2126
01:59:20,289 --> 01:59:25,899
somewhere else what are your current

2127
01:59:22,449 --> 01:59:30,029
thoughts on jei I don't have any yet I

2128
01:59:25,899 --> 01:59:35,500
am really happy that it's happening and

2129
01:59:30,029 --> 01:59:39,670
I hope it becomes popular even if it's

2130
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:45,819
only slightly better than C and C++ it's

2131
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:48,130
still very welcome and so you know I

2132
01:59:45,819 --> 01:59:51,009
hope it does well I hope it becomes a

2133
01:59:48,130 --> 01:59:53,079
viable option to ship your games on I

2134
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:54,460
would love to not have to care about all

2135
01:59:53,079 --> 01:59:55,960
the ridiculous decisions of C++

2136
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:58,180
standards committee makes all the time

2137
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:59,199
right and so having something nice to

2138
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:02,850
turn to that was a viable alternative

2139
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:02,849
would be fantastic

2140
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:09,939
so don't have much thoughts other than I

2141
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:11,289
hope it works out with the capabilities

2142
02:00:09,939 --> 02:00:12,189
of mobile games exponentially increasing

2143
02:00:11,289 --> 02:00:15,869
what are the decision factors that

2144
02:00:12,189 --> 02:00:20,289
result in games being ported to mobile

2145
02:00:15,869 --> 02:00:25,390
well I mean most of the that's really a

2146
02:00:20,289 --> 02:00:27,399
business question you know and so you'd

2147
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:30,160
be better off asking a person who does

2148
02:00:27,399 --> 02:00:32,019
game business stuff but generally

2149
02:00:30,159 --> 02:00:34,210
speaking if you just look at it

2150
02:00:32,020 --> 02:00:38,290
objectively the problem with mobile is

2151
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:40,600
the market right so there's zero price

2152
02:00:38,289 --> 02:00:42,340
support on games in the mobile space so

2153
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:42,699
it doesn't make a lot of sense to ship a

2154
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:45,340
call

2155
02:00:42,698 --> 02:00:47,558
there that's just not something you get

2156
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:49,269
rewarded for on Steam if you ship a

2157
02:00:47,559 --> 02:00:51,159
quality game you can still often times

2158
02:00:49,269 --> 02:00:53,739
have someone pay $15 for it that's

2159
02:00:51,158 --> 02:00:55,988
really important that's that's a very

2160
02:00:53,738 --> 02:00:58,149
important thing on an iPhone no one will

2161
02:00:55,988 --> 02:00:59,649
pay $15 for anything ever under any

2162
02:00:58,149 --> 02:01:02,529
circumstances it just doesn't happen

2163
02:00:59,649 --> 02:01:04,868
right a lot of times you have to slow

2164
02:01:02,529 --> 02:01:08,259
your game for like $2.99 or just free

2165
02:01:04,868 --> 02:01:10,118
right and that's just Apple and androids

2166
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:12,190
fault for not curating their store well

2167
02:01:10,118 --> 02:01:14,018
for not promoting high-priced games well

2168
02:01:12,189 --> 02:01:15,488
that like that's just strictly a failure

2169
02:01:14,019 --> 02:01:18,369
of those companies to curate their

2170
02:01:15,488 --> 02:01:19,748
market space to be fair that's not what

2171
02:01:18,368 --> 02:01:21,670
they care about they just care that you

2172
02:01:19,748 --> 02:01:23,139
use their phones and look at their ads

2173
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:24,578
and stuff like that so they're doing

2174
02:01:23,139 --> 02:01:25,659
probably the right thing from their

2175
02:01:24,578 --> 02:01:27,248
perspective it's just not the right

2176
02:01:25,658 --> 02:01:30,129
thing from a person who wants to sell

2177
02:01:27,248 --> 02:01:32,948
games on their platform and so what I

2178
02:01:30,130 --> 02:01:35,409
think is much more germane to the

2179
02:01:32,948 --> 02:01:37,839
decision has nothing to do with whether

2180
02:01:35,408 --> 02:01:39,998
the phone can run a game what half has

2181
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:42,998
to do is can your game support ad or

2182
02:01:39,998 --> 02:01:44,260
micro transaction based economies

2183
02:01:42,998 --> 02:01:46,510
because that's the only way you're

2184
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:48,309
probably gonna succeed over there once

2185
02:01:46,510 --> 02:01:49,809
in a great while you might be able to

2186
02:01:48,309 --> 02:01:53,498
make a game that some people buy in an

2187
02:01:49,809 --> 02:01:55,239
iPad for $9.99 maybe but most of the

2188
02:01:53,498 --> 02:01:58,630
time what you're looking to do is to

2189
02:01:55,238 --> 02:02:00,368
make games for that platform that are

2190
02:01:58,630 --> 02:02:02,650
designed to make money in other ways

2191
02:02:00,368 --> 02:02:05,859
like you know farmville kinds of stuff

2192
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:07,658
right and so I think that's really what

2193
02:02:05,859 --> 02:02:10,538
ends up happening and one of the reasons

2194
02:02:07,658 --> 02:02:13,089
I think that a lot of people don't port

2195
02:02:10,538 --> 02:02:14,859
their PC games over there has nothing to

2196
02:02:13,090 --> 02:02:17,469
do with the fact that they couldn't port

2197
02:02:14,859 --> 02:02:18,969
them over they probably could they just

2198
02:02:17,469 --> 02:02:21,399
still think they make any money cuz the

2199
02:02:18,969 --> 02:02:23,649
store over there is a joke right it's

2200
02:02:21,399 --> 02:02:26,049
like a sort of race to the bottom low

2201
02:02:23,649 --> 02:02:27,549
pricing manipulate your users into

2202
02:02:26,050 --> 02:02:29,409
spending money other ways kind of thing

2203
02:02:27,550 --> 02:02:30,969
or show ads all over it and they just

2204
02:02:29,408 --> 02:02:35,348
don't want to do that necessarily right

2205
02:02:30,969 --> 02:02:37,059
uh it's a shame I wish they had made a

2206
02:02:35,349 --> 02:02:39,340
thriving marketplace for gamers on

2207
02:02:37,059 --> 02:02:42,820
mobile I wish they had done that they

2208
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:46,569
didn't do it so now it's just a lot less

2209
02:02:42,819 --> 02:02:48,670
likely that people will poor quality

2210
02:02:46,569 --> 02:02:51,488
games to mobile if they don't see a way

2211
02:02:48,670 --> 02:02:54,998
to kind of have some other market there

2212
02:02:51,488 --> 02:02:56,319
you know it's not to say you can't do it

2213
02:02:54,998 --> 02:02:56,619
there are some examples but it's just

2214
02:02:56,319 --> 02:02:59,649
rare

2215
02:02:56,619 --> 02:03:00,579
a lot of people you know just don't

2216
02:02:59,649 --> 02:03:02,139
think it's gonna be worth their time

2217
02:03:00,579 --> 02:03:03,369
because if they're if they're not gonna

2218
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:05,530
make enough money off of it if they

2219
02:03:03,369 --> 02:03:07,269
don't do something like shove ads in

2220
02:03:05,529 --> 02:03:08,619
there or make microtransactions be a

2221
02:03:07,270 --> 02:03:09,820
thing right and they may not want to do

2222
02:03:08,619 --> 02:03:12,489
those things or their game just might

2223
02:03:09,819 --> 02:03:15,159
not that may ruin their game right those

2224
02:03:12,489 --> 02:03:20,079
things might ruin the game for them

2225
02:03:15,159 --> 02:03:23,559
right what are your thoughts on rust I

2226
02:03:20,079 --> 02:03:26,649
don't really have any I haven't looked

2227
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:30,550
at it much what was it C was missing

2228
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:36,369
that makes you compile using C++ not

2229
02:03:30,550 --> 02:03:38,079
much honestly when I started using C++ C

2230
02:03:36,369 --> 02:03:40,420
didn't even have stuff like declare

2231
02:03:38,079 --> 02:03:43,689
anywhere and I do think like declare

2232
02:03:40,420 --> 02:03:46,300
anywhere is a good idea I also like

2233
02:03:43,689 --> 02:03:48,549
function overloading because I like to

2234
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:50,110
be able to have the same name take two

2235
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:51,760
different sets of parameters so that

2236
02:03:50,109 --> 02:03:54,789
people can just still use the same name

2237
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:58,060
to call it there's a couple things like

2238
02:03:54,789 --> 02:04:04,569
that that I think are worth changing and

2239
02:03:58,060 --> 02:04:08,470
so I guess what I would say is in the

2240
02:04:04,569 --> 02:04:10,420
most modern versions of C probably have

2241
02:04:08,470 --> 02:04:14,500
the things I would want and I probably

2242
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:18,069
could compile and see robably I'm not

2243
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:20,529
sure but like there's enough stuff in

2244
02:04:18,069 --> 02:04:22,269
the base level C++ stuff operator

2245
02:04:20,529 --> 02:04:26,229
overloading for vector types like that

2246
02:04:22,270 --> 02:04:28,930
sort of thing is useful so I'll do like

2247
02:04:26,229 --> 02:04:31,889
having those features pretty much

2248
02:04:28,930 --> 02:04:31,890
everything else I don't like

2249
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:44,110
s TV doesn't do hinting is there another

2250
02:04:40,029 --> 02:04:48,729
lib that supports small text I don't

2251
02:04:44,109 --> 02:04:52,689
know OpenType or free free type whatever

2252
02:04:48,729 --> 02:04:55,509
the that giant packages OpenType free

2253
02:04:52,689 --> 02:05:01,479
type open free type free open type free

2254
02:04:55,510 --> 02:05:09,970
type open up probably does hinting I

2255
02:05:01,479 --> 02:05:18,699
don't know get a higher res screen and

2256
02:05:09,970 --> 02:05:22,560
call it a day all right time to wrap it

2257
02:05:18,699 --> 02:05:28,779
up and stretch as well

2258
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:34,000
okay free type free type there we go

2259
02:05:28,779 --> 02:05:36,729
yeah free type probably does that I

2260
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,470
don't know how many types of enemies

2261
02:05:36,729 --> 02:05:43,469
enemies are you planning on having I

2262
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:50,260
don't know how long have you been coding

2263
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:58,920
since I was seven so so that would be

2264
02:05:50,260 --> 02:06:01,570
what 3 plus 31 so 30 34 years I guess

2265
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:02,680
kind of off topic question but here it

2266
02:06:01,569 --> 02:06:04,090
goes I've been in the game tooshi

2267
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:05,740
working with studios but now I decided

2268
02:06:04,090 --> 02:06:07,150
to make an independent game of my own

2269
02:06:05,739 --> 02:06:07,960
and I kind of wanted to make a

2270
02:06:07,149 --> 02:06:10,119
Kickstarter do you have any

2271
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:15,909
recommendation that I do not I've never

2272
02:06:10,119 --> 02:06:21,539
done a Kickstarter so I do not know all

2273
02:06:15,909 --> 02:06:21,539
right I'm gonna wrap it up for today

2274
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:27,069
thank you everyone for joining me for

2275
02:06:25,689 --> 02:06:28,989
the upside of handmade Hero it's been a

2276
02:06:27,069 --> 02:06:31,149
pleasure coding with you as always if

2277
02:06:28,989 --> 02:06:32,649
you would like to follow along the

2278
02:06:31,149 --> 02:06:34,479
series at home you can always pre-order

2279
02:06:32,649 --> 02:06:36,609
the game on handmade hero dot org and it

2280
02:06:34,479 --> 02:06:39,789
comes with all of the source code that I

2281
02:06:36,609 --> 02:06:41,019
update every night so that you can play

2282
02:06:39,789 --> 02:06:44,979
around with it and do your own

2283
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:49,790
experimentation we will be back here

2284
02:06:44,979 --> 02:06:52,549
next weekend to start working on the

2285
02:06:49,789 --> 02:06:55,100
boom creation stuff because like I said

2286
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:56,690
I want him now the movement stuff

2287
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:58,039
wrapped up quicker than I thought like

2288
02:06:56,689 --> 02:07:00,250
that's basically all I really wanted for

2289
02:06:58,039 --> 02:07:04,789
my movement stuff to be solid like that

2290
02:07:00,250 --> 02:07:08,060
for now and I want to just build out

2291
02:07:04,789 --> 02:07:11,390
some nice room areas that we can explore

2292
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:16,610
through so I can tighten up the camera

2293
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:17,869
code and the lighting code because those

2294
02:07:16,609 --> 02:07:21,469
are going to take a while to sort of

2295
02:07:17,869 --> 02:07:22,789
settle in and like I said we got a bunch

2296
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:24,980
of stuff I want do with how we're gonna

2297
02:07:22,789 --> 02:07:26,449
place letting computation points and

2298
02:07:24,979 --> 02:07:28,339
then we got to make the lighting effect

2299
02:07:26,449 --> 02:07:29,750
the entities properly so there's just a

2300
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:31,699
lot of bookkeeping that's gonna go on

2301
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:33,619
there and in order to do it right I feel

2302
02:07:31,699 --> 02:07:36,829
like we need to have some real like

2303
02:07:33,619 --> 02:07:40,189
level geometry stuff that's plausible in

2304
02:07:36,829 --> 02:07:42,229
there that then I and have it so that I

2305
02:07:40,189 --> 02:07:46,250
can actually have the code that like
