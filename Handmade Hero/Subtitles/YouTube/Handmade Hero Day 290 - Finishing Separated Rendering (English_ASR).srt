00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,490
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,440
hero the show Rico to complete game live

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:13,199
on stream uh we are just about to I

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:15,359
guess I don't want to say wrap up but

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,189
we're sort of coming to a junction point

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,410
here we we finished moving everything

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,240
over to this concept of these sort of

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,550
impromptu created controller structures

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,528
that we called brains and those seem to

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,230
be working ok now but we we have some

11
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:31,079
more like kind of entity partitioning

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,789
work that we want to do and you know we

13
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,409
started down a path at the very end of

14
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,238
last stream of like pulling out the

15
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:39,000
concept of how a particular entity gets

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,349
rendered as well and so we've kind of

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,878
you know we're kind of at a place where

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,789
we're starting to pull new things in the

19
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:47,789
mix so we want to kind of just continue

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,679
that process and we'll see what kind of

21
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,070
comes out of it in terms of what the

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:56,070
next major area we want to tackle is now

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,350
I want to address some things but let me

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,820
first say this is day 29 tso day 289

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,670
source code is the source code that you

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,769
want to start with so the first thing

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:10,680
that I'll say is in the pre stream busy

28
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:14,819
beever brought up a good point which is

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,860
that we have a sort of late a bug in

30
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,989
waiting let's say a bug that is waiting

31
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,359
to be a problem it's not a problem right

32
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:23,069
now because we are not real actually

33
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,090
doing like the stuff that would be

34
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:30,209
necessary to cause it to to to bite us

35
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,009
but it's definitely there and it's

36
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:33,688
because of the sort of changes that

37
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,099
we've made recently we haven't gone back

38
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:36,959
and revisited the way that we're

39
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,030
actually doing or begin sim and sim

40
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,899
steps so what I'd like to do here is

41
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,359
just go ahead and take care of that so I

42
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,790
what the bug is is remember we now move

43
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,950
to a system where we load chunks in we

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,210
pull in all the entities from them then

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,009
we simulate those entities and then we

46
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,839
write them back out to the chunks what

47
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,519
this means is that we destroy the chunks

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,649
as we go because of course we're

49
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,140
intentionally not going to pack anything

50
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,509
back into those chunks as we pulled

51
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,769
everything out of it but we left in

52
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:10,889
place the entity overlaps rectangle call

53
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:12,628
to sort of trim the bounds which now

54
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,689
means that certain entities that fail

55
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:15,759
that check

56
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:17,800
will not get streamed in and hence be

57
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,449
sort of silently deleted right they'll

58
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,180
just go away because we pulled them out

59
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:24,519
of there chunk but we never actually

60
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,500
record them and so the bug fix is

61
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,360
obviously trivial there really isn't

62
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,800
anything to it we can actually just

63
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,560
delete this code because it's

64
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,510
unnecessary code but it is important to

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,129
do so otherwise eventually we would have

66
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:38,169
this problem where we would suddenly

67
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:40,240
lose some entities on the periphery and

68
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:43,599
we would wonder why so a really good

69
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,420
catch by busy beaver there saved us a

70
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,250
bunch of time I suspect because we would

71
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:52,059
have had to hunt for that in the future

72
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,740
and feel like what's going on so that

73
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,719
really shouldn't affect anything right

74
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,310
now that's just like sort of going in

75
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,849
there and sort of trying to make sure

76
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,890
that we don't have a bug later I don't

77
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:08,129
know I should double-check to make sure

78
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:11,319
that identity itself always does uh does

79
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:14,699
like the appropriate add as well Matt I

80
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,900
pulled my shoulder and really bugging me

81
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:20,409
it's just it's always there you know

82
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,810
it's always like ah anyway so if i go

83
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,819
through begin same and just look at

84
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,620
what's happening here pretty much we go

85
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,870
through all the entities and we always

86
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,629
add them unless we hit our max entity

87
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,069
count cap and that's an invalid code

88
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,829
path for us so we're going to want to

89
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:37,989
make sure that that can never happen but

90
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,120
other than that we are always going to

91
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:43,750
add it so even if we if it doesn't

92
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,039
overlap our simulation rectangle we

93
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,330
still keep it we just marked this

94
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,099
unobtainable now I don't know if that's

95
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,390
still going to be a thing but it's at

96
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,709
least not going to prevent the entity

97
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:56,349
from being loaded which is all we care

98
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:59,409
about all right so that takes care of

99
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,909
that now we need to kind of go back to

100
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,819
what we were doing before now you'll

101
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:06,039
remember what we'd started yesterday was

102
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:08,789
we started making entities get rendered

103
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,109
in a more procedural way and less

104
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:14,229
hard-coded I shouldn't same procedure

105
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,850
maybe let's say data-driven way and less

106
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:18,909
about a hard-coded function that says

107
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:21,370
how they're going to be rendered and you

108
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,710
can see that the trees are back to the

109
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,538
to the way that they were and they are

110
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:27,129
the that's what we did the last dream

111
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:29,349
they are the only entities

112
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:30,939
now going through this path and so what

113
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,070
we want to do is now we want to sort of

114
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:35,319
move all of the other entities over

115
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:38,319
until we're left with no entities still

116
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:41,230
being rendered via the old path if that

117
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:45,550
makes sense so let's go ahead and see if

118
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,960
we can figure that out you know what

119
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,520
someone else mentioned by the way on the

120
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,310
forums I should also take care of

121
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:58,500
another bug while we're here it was a

122
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:58,500
real simple one it's in brain actually

123
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:04,989
there was a bug in this code that we

124
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,099
sort of haven't really we haven't really

125
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,920
gotten to the point where this code is

126
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:15,010
really doing anything at the moment but

127
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:16,780
we need to now use the DDP too because

128
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:18,039
we need a three dimensional vector here

129
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:19,029
and we were we were still looking at

130
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,200
this one which is only two dimensions we

131
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:22,469
were kind of reading off the end which

132
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:26,469
could have given us like complete bogus

133
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:30,190
results there right so yeah so that was

134
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:34,390
that was the only thing with that anyway

135
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:36,100
so yeah so anyway we got mr. mr. tude

136
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,259
moving around here but everyone like I

137
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,820
said besides the trees are still going

138
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,189
through the old render path so what I

139
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,290
want to do is see if we can get a you

140
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:45,969
know all the other people through that

141
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,580
same render path that we were using

142
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:52,440
before and you can see how that render

143
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:57,120
Pat path works right we've got it's um

144
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,120
this is all kind of dead code

145
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:06,730
I so you can see how that path works up

146
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,920
here it just loops through the number of

147
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,290
things that has to draw just like the

148
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,640
way everything else works pretty much I

149
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:17,920
might put draw hit points kind of here

150
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,389
so we have the other loops we could also

151
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,189
just move draw hit points right down in

152
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,019
here if we wanted to but anyway you can

153
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:26,139
kind of see how this works we have some

154
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:28,329
set of pieces for each individual entity

155
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,180
and we go through each individual piece

156
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:34,689
we get a bitmap match out of it and then

157
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,180
we push that bitmap onto the renders you

158
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:39,819
know into the stack we're using for

159
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,170
rendering and so what that means is most

160
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,759
of these people will probably be fine

161
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,220
like if we take a look at what Monstar

162
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:49,539
does right Monstar does a shadow and

163
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,430
then a torso right and that seems pretty

164
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,680
straightforward as well so I feel like

165
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,019
we could take care of Monstar and make

166
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,540
Monstar have pieces just the way that

167
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:04,149
everyone else does right and the same

168
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:07,629
would probably be true of hero head

169
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:09,969
right all we would need to do is have

170
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:12,879
the offset on there which is something

171
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,430
that i can add so let's go ahead and add

172
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:19,029
that offset in for now so here is right

173
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,139
here's piece offset and that's going to

174
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:21,909
be something that's probably going to

175
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,620
have to get a little more complicated as

176
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,750
time goes on but we don't want to be too

177
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,769
premature with it so I'm going to wait

178
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,209
till we have a little bit more

179
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:30,849
information about how we're animating

180
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:32,168
parts of things because that could

181
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,580
change a little bit so I'm not going to

182
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,979
get to hog well with that we're just

183
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,849
going to have a single offset for now

184
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,020
knowing that that will probably have to

185
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,980
get a little bit more complicating the

186
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:41,769
future because we're going to probably

187
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:44,530
want more than just a static offset as

188
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:47,079
we want to kind of make more more things

189
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,489
animate right so we'll kind of when we

190
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,050
do the hero will get a little insight

191
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,110
into that but we may need to go even

192
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,600
further than that to really know what

193
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,270
we're doing and what would be

194
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,970
applications in that scenario alright so

195
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,870
now we've got that piece offset

196
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,490
happening there and I'm just going to go

197
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,000
make sure that that's handled properly

198
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:10,060
so you can see here in ad piece what I

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,579
want to do is add that the offset part

200
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,288
in here and maybe that happens right

201
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:16,558
here I'm

202
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:21,149
sure but I'll just go ahead and say that

203
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:24,509
those for now oops so we'll say height

204
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:26,158
piece offset equals offset and then when

205
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:28,439
I compile i would expect an error here

206
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:29,998
because we're not specifying it so now i

207
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,180
just have to say well the offset here at

208
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:38,459
000 and that's all good now in that case

209
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:40,078
what i want to do is I want to start

210
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,818
expanding now that I know that that

211
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:44,758
that's you know all better i guess i'll

212
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:46,469
double check that it actually is and

213
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,659
remember every time we change the data

214
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,430
layout we don't have data safe reloading

215
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:52,769
so we just have to restart the game if

216
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:55,528
we change the data layout code week in

217
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:59,399
hot load but but data changes we don't

218
00:08:55,528 --> 00:09:02,639
handle or Sega sized data changes so

219
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,409
anyway in this case you can see we're

220
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,039
still drawing the trees properly and

221
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:11,009
everyone else too let's go ahead and and

222
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:15,899
the Mon star in here so we'll make an ad

223
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:19,289
piece call for the Mon star and here's

224
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:22,409
that Mon star and what I need to do is

225
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:25,649
go into the monster our code that it was

226
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:27,809
using in World mode and just grab out

227
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,850
what it was doing here with this with

228
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:31,828
these bitmaps right so I should be able

229
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,750
to just say okay you know there's the

230
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:36,088
Mon star and we're going to say that

231
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:40,198
there's a push bitmap call which now

232
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:44,149
becomes an ad piece call and these

233
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:48,719
things are obviously based on the entity

234
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:54,269
and then we know that this is an asset

235
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:58,079
shadow in one case and an asset torso in

236
00:09:54,269 --> 00:10:00,688
the other case right and then we know

237
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,188
that the offsets are whatever the

238
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:03,899
offsets actually are and you can see

239
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:06,778
that there don't appear to be any actual

240
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,019
offsets for the Mon star so we really

241
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:11,338
shouldn't have to to deal with anything

242
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:15,959
there now I don't know where shadow

243
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:19,470
alpha was defined must be somewhere up

244
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:22,588
here okay should be computed after the

245
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:25,319
update yeah so this is shadow alpha I

246
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:27,120
don't know what exactly we want to do

247
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:28,709
with that probably this show

248
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,190
ohs are going to have to be special

249
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,750
cased and so I'm not going to super care

250
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,900
about that right now but eventually

251
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,460
we're going to care about that so I'm

252
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,350
going to say that the Monstar since it's

253
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,850
on the ground at the moment is going to

254
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:46,970
have a no point five but i'm going to

255
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:51,080
say here something like to do casey

256
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:56,690
shadows should be handled especially

257
00:10:51,080 --> 00:11:00,420
because they need their own pass

258
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:02,160
technically as well so we're probably

259
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,019
gonna have to tag things that are

260
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,620
shadows on the ground because that's

261
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:10,289
going to be something that is the

262
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,089
renderer eventually the final very final

263
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:15,360
version of the renderer with all the

264
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:18,060
tweaks will need to know that that

265
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,250
things are shadows especially it won't

266
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,189
be able to just treat them as normal

267
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,879
objects because there's you know if two

268
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,800
shadows overlap they don't necessarily

269
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,838
double darken it will depend on like how

270
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,778
what the rule is and what's actually

271
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,310
happening there we may need to do more

272
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:40,169
complicated things to get the look that

273
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:42,329
we want in those circumstances so yeah

274
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:44,399
that's all we really need to do here

275
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,100
we've got we don't need the tree

276
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:51,240
obviously so we've got the shadow and

277
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:54,149
the torso I is it true that the shadow

278
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,000
is 4.5 is that actually what that is I

279
00:11:54,149 --> 00:12:00,689
don't know we'll find out in a second

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,360
here add peace um well you know what let

281
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,850
me just double check with that actually

282
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,060
was supposed to be a bit maps asset

283
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,470
shadow yeah so the shadow is also 4.5 I

284
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,229
guess that's just because hey it should

285
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:16,129
be the same size as everything else I

286
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,129
guess that makes some sense

287
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:23,689
who knows alright so we've got our ad

288
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,570
piece call and I just need to make sure

289
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:29,720
that it's it's right it's the trees

290
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:32,510
let's see so the entity the type the

291
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,340
height the offset and the color so I

292
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:42,379
just need to put a color in here and

293
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:44,810
then we should be good to go so now we

294
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:47,090
should see a Mon star and we do see the

295
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:52,129
monster that is the monster right there

296
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:54,460
that's the monster and yes since we're

297
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:56,990
not really doing collision at this point

298
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,320
on because we turned all that stuff off

299
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,029
we need to start and this will be

300
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,340
actually a very good thing for us to do

301
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:05,990
next we need to start having the monster

302
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,700
go through the new movement controllers

303
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,560
as well so we take so he takes ownership

304
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,990
of the square that he's on and so that I

305
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:15,409
cuz right now I can move right into a

306
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:18,769
square if i want to write so that's a

307
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:21,980
not good whereas if i have one of those

308
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:23,480
like if i actually had someone who is

309
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,519
occupying the square properly that

310
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,129
wouldn't work alright so let's keep

311
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,059
going on that same you know the same

312
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:34,279
clean up route the Monstar case is now

313
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:37,839
gone let's go ahead and take the hero

314
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:41,149
head and and turn that into something

315
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,399
that we can work with as well so when we

316
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:45,559
do an ad player that's going to have a

317
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:49,519
thing where we can add the construction

318
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:52,039
here to make sure that the player also

319
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,149
has render information so here's the

320
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:59,809
head entity and we have the asset hero

321
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:03,620
head or just head I guess we've got the

322
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:08,059
hero sighs see I don't really know what

323
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:09,710
the hero size even is but I guess we

324
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:13,519
just kind of made it so it was easier

325
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:17,410
for us to scale and so I'm just going to

326
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,909
say that that can come up here now and

327
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:23,230
we'll leave it there temporarily but

328
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:25,129
i'll do a little to do kc delete this

329
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,480
because once you move everything out of

330
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:28,070
there the hero size could be something

331
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,539
that's a property of when you're

332
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,420
constructing it and doesn't have to be a

333
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:34,269
property later right

334
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:36,339
so we can add this in here and this is

335
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:40,769
all exactly what we want right all we

336
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,769
need to do now is just have sort of a

337
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,059
color a dummy color that's in there but

338
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:49,089
otherwise that's all we need to give our

339
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:51,699
hero a headpiece and so now when we run

340
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:53,379
hopefully we'll get ahead and there's

341
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,910
the head and it does respond to

342
00:14:53,379 --> 00:15:00,909
directional changes correctly so that's

343
00:14:54,909 --> 00:15:03,370
good too and so another case down which

344
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:05,439
is cool alright so we're it slowly

345
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,200
winnowing away at these edit e cases

346
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,480
slowly slowly but surely and so now you

347
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,550
can see in here we were down to only two

348
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,500
there's the familiar and there's a hero

349
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:16,929
body now the familiar in the hero body

350
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,700
are the tough cases for us because the

351
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:22,059
familiar in the hero body are the ones

352
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,800
that have actual animation right so you

353
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:26,109
can kind of see in there that there's

354
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,549
sort of been you know there's there's a

355
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:32,769
certain amount of bending asst that

356
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:34,569
happens with these you know one of them

357
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:36,879
one of them kind of was meant to bob up

358
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,940
and down and one of them is meant to be

359
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:43,570
bendy and so that's information that we

360
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:46,540
need to capture right we need that to be

361
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,680
reactive and we can't do the same thing

362
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:49,059
that we were doing for the other

363
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,399
properties of these pieces because the

364
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:54,250
other properties of these pieces we're

365
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,439
such that you just create a static idea

366
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,840
of relative to the entity what do I need

367
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,420
to know these are actually dynamic than

368
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:05,170
they have specific ways in which they

369
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:09,219
kind of need to work right there's all

370
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:11,110
this logic in there and so I don't know

371
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:14,350
exactly how we want to deal with that

372
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:18,340
yet but I suspect what we want to do

373
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,649
here is create sort of a like an

374
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:23,759
infrastructure for saying when people

375
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:26,500
move we have a certain sort of armature

376
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,470
understanding of what their parameters

377
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,600
of motion are and then we have ways of

378
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,180
constructing the pieces so that they

379
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,610
latch on to that are mature in a useful

380
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:37,689
way right this is when people are always

381
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,370
saying about the skeletal animation

382
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,110
stuff like I saying what we're doing is

383
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,149
already skeletal animation for all

384
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,389
intents and purposes we just haven't

385
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,100
systematized it yet so we're just

386
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:49,199
doing it but you know like the fact that

387
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,029
the the the two pieces of the hero can

388
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:56,780
bounce that is exactly what skeletal

389
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:59,459
animation actually is right and so

390
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:02,209
slowly I'm just kind of moving it out to

391
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:05,069
see what kind of system we actually want

392
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:07,680
so what I should be able to do here is

393
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:11,208
for starters I can i can probably get

394
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,828
rid of this situation like hero bitmaps

395
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,269
we can probably get rid of because you

396
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:16,500
can see that it's just head caped torso

397
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,180
that's the stuff that we're just putting

398
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,490
in here at that piece of information we

399
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,990
definitely know that we would have so

400
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,319
that's not particularly interesting

401
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:27,150
right and so I'm going to f0 these guys

402
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:32,849
out and then I'm going to start by

403
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:34,170
making pieces that are actually what

404
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:36,539
should I put it I'm gonna start by

405
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,430
making pieces that are just the static

406
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:40,559
versions of these guys without the

407
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,150
animation and then we'll figure out how

408
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,470
to get the animation back in right

409
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,480
because we know that part of this is

410
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,339
working the part where we just say that

411
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,250
there is a shadow in a cape or this and

412
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:52,399
that that stuff will work just fine it's

413
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,619
the rest of the stuff that won't write

414
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,100
it's the movement so we've got the

415
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:00,539
player we've got the Monstar so inside

416
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:03,209
the player now this is the head

417
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:05,940
information i should be able to also now

418
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,829
do add piece on the for the bottom right

419
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:12,930
i should be able to say okay the body

420
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:14,549
got has these three things and again the

421
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:18,480
only real difference here is going to be

422
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:20,819
the fact that when I'm what I'm creating

423
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,640
these I'm leaving out the animated

424
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:27,480
portion of them right so this is all you

425
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,100
know this is all the same this shadow

426
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,480
alpha I don't know for now i guess i'll

427
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,679
do a pound to find for it so that we

428
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,220
could find it later because we're going

429
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,529
to pull it out later into something else

430
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,390
so i'm gonna I guess I'm leave it so

431
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:46,970
that shadow alpha is a is a known

432
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:46,970
quantity here there we go uh so we

433
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:55,429
so we know ok so in here what we want to

434
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:59,388
do is add the pieces out the animation

435
00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:03,950
shadow obviously doesn't have one the

436
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:07,209
torso does I believe right you can see

437
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:10,369
that it's right here x-axis and y-axis

438
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:13,460
so that's the part that we won't be

439
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:16,759
handling properly right here I don't

440
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,788
know what why color I guess we just set

441
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:23,960
it to 111 well you know what i could do

442
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:34,069
i can replicate that it makes sense for

443
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:36,379
me to replicate that I think and so

444
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:39,739
again same exact thing that we were

445
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:41,538
doing before we've got the everything

446
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:42,980
copied out except that x axis y axis so

447
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:44,358
we lose that bit of information and

448
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,659
that's one that will have to put back in

449
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:50,628
and then we've got also here the cape

450
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:53,090
and the same same diff deal here you can

451
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:54,829
see that it's got the x-axis y-axis we

452
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:57,918
don't have that piece of information at

453
00:19:54,829 --> 00:20:00,019
the moment and then we also have this

454
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,080
this notion of this offset here and that

455
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:05,618
offset with the tea bob is is not going

456
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:15,048
to get it's not going to get properly

457
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:16,819
respected either ok so we lose a bunch

458
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:19,788
of stuff but we can still basically

459
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:21,378
recreate the thing and so our job will

460
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:29,679
just be to put it back oops it's not

461
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:29,678
head so yeah

462
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:43,869
they go ahead and delete this there we

463
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:45,970
go okay so now we should have a pretty

464
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:47,379
much everybody but and you can see that

465
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,600
they're not down there everyone but the

466
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,890
familiar is represented and you can see

467
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,519
that everything still works just fine

468
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:57,370
it's just we lose that animated those

469
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:59,769
test animation things we did for our hop

470
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:03,699
right and it looks a lot stupider now

471
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:05,589
right so that's you know not good but

472
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,180
that's fine that's what we expected and

473
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:09,459
so now we just need to finish off the

474
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,890
the the familiar and here's the

475
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,660
familiars code so i'll go up to add

476
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:17,259
familiar and just do exactly the same

477
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,940
thing that I did before so we'll put

478
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:23,619
familiar in there this is going to be an

479
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:28,059
ad piece so is this and in here we just

480
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:32,529
have entity and this is one of them

481
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:39,669
shadows nothing particularly teresting

482
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:44,639
there we lose again the bob sign and

483
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:44,640
then here we've got again the entity I

484
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:57,490
don't what does be ID in this case why

485
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:03,850
were we what was what was that it's just

486
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:05,740
a head alright and yeah again exact same

487
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:09,699
thing here so you know we just we don't

488
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:22,778
really know where it goes all right

489
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:24,850
um that's really it oops so now

490
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:28,630
everyone's being recreated properly and

491
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:31,058
we've essentially gotten rid of that all

492
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,740
of that code right that's now all

493
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,690
procedural and just created so now we

494
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,659
can create any combination of those that

495
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:40,870
we want right and so what I'm going to

496
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:43,450
do now is go figure out how to get the

497
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:44,888
stuff that we missed and put it back in

498
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,558
there now I'm going to do that in the

499
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:49,178
simplest possible way at first but like

500
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:51,158
I said as we get a little further down

501
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:52,990
the road and have some more animating

502
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:55,330
objects will be able to find out a

503
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,399
little bit more information about how we

504
00:22:55,329 --> 00:23:02,859
want to construct this system to go

505
00:22:57,398 --> 00:23:06,129
beyond just simple pieces right okay so

506
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:08,199
inside handmade world mode or actually

507
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,450
sorry inside handmade entity I'm just

508
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,019
going to add into this piece the the

509
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:19,750
most basic thing right which is a look

510
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:23,620
at entity visible piece sort of I don't

511
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:27,429
know let's call it a movement or

512
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:29,949
something and in here we'll just say you

513
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:32,409
know peace move and you know we'll just

514
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,360
say nun is a rigid it just means you

515
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:37,929
know it's it's just attached directly to

516
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:40,538
the frame we could say that there's like

517
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:45,659
a access to form right so if the entity

518
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:45,658
axes to form it would deform the thing I

519
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:52,808
axis X is deform or something like this

520
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:56,379
and then we should also have one that's

521
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:59,740
like a bob offset right and these should

522
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,929
probably be tipped you know to think

523
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,909
about these could easily be flagged so

524
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:07,269
we could just say like hey whichever

525
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:10,389
ones you want you can have so I can just

526
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:12,099
say like movement flags and care right

527
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:14,199
and then we can just so all I'm doing

528
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:16,449
here is being able to pick up parts of

529
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,179
that code and essentially use it for

530
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:23,470
what I was doing before so here's my

531
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:27,340
access to form I know that basically

532
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:29,558
the familiar had a bobbing head right so

533
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:34,899
I'll put that in at the end for the

534
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:41,220
flags on on that guy and similarly the

535
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:43,750
hero needs both a bobbing torso and a

536
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,970
what was the other one access actually

537
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:51,819
deforming well I guess it needs the

538
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:53,259
access to forming a cape and up both of

539
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:56,619
them you'd axial the form of I member

540
00:24:53,259 --> 00:25:03,808
quickly but only the Cape actually does

541
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:07,808
the Bob offset right that's my sort of

542
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:10,538
recollection of it anyway so I'm gonna

543
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:13,029
leave it at that and assume that that is

544
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:16,720
good enough so then I'm going to go to

545
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:18,460
the add piece call and I'm just going to

546
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,429
say okay you know if you add a piece you

547
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:25,659
can have some flags on the end of it and

548
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:35,740
then we set it up and so that's all good

549
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:37,090
and sorry movement flags so that's all

550
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:41,548
good that's not going to do anything

551
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:43,329
just setting the flags texture upload

552
00:25:41,548 --> 00:25:45,548
that's not gonna do anything just

553
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:48,369
setting the flags right because we're

554
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:51,129
still not obeying those flags but

555
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:53,678
everything should now be set for us to

556
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,990
actually just use the equations we were

557
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,980
using before base on which flags are in

558
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:04,000
there right alright so now we can go

559
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:05,500
ahead and say alright I in this code

560
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,849
where we're looping through the pieces

561
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:11,440
when I do push fit map I now want to do

562
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:12,699
essentially the full version of the call

563
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,788
you could see this this one right here

564
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,880
kind of has a full it's everything that

565
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:23,440
we had been doing previously right it's

566
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:27,190
got the entity transform it's got the

567
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:30,490
offset it's got the y bobbing and it's

568
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,990
got the x and y axes right and so what

569
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,970
I'm going to do is I'm going to keep for

570
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,430
now all of these things when I'm going

571
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:38,370
to grab these guys on here

572
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:44,340
and I'm just going to say okay so we've

573
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:46,469
got all of this stuff as the optional

574
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:48,569
ways in which these things can can

575
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,480
behave and so what I'll do is I'll say

576
00:26:48,569 --> 00:27:03,659
well alright if the if this piece is

577
00:26:51,480 --> 00:27:07,559
flags well here's the easiest way here

578
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:09,779
we go so to say all right I'll

579
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,819
initialize it and soon that our x and y

580
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:15,119
axis is our new to our x and y axes are

581
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:19,759
neutral right then i'll say well okay if

582
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,759
the pieces flags in this particular case

583
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:31,259
say that we do access to forming then we

584
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:33,300
want to we want to overwrite whatever

585
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:36,450
the default axes are with the axes that

586
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:39,180
come from the entity right otherwise it

587
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:42,600
won't do that deformation similarly will

588
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:45,150
say okay we've got this offset here and

589
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,839
we'll say that if and also similarly

590
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:53,220
Artie Bob value those will both get

591
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:55,619
initialized to nothing like so and then

592
00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:02,960
what we'll say is well if the piece

593
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:07,459
flags were supposed to be Bob offset

594
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,460
then we will will use them

595
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:17,519
and then we should be able to call

596
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:22,230
essentially the same parameters we were

597
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:32,430
calling before for everything else but

598
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:42,839
now right we've got this happening and I

599
00:28:32,430 --> 00:29:02,730
guess that offset value should just have

600
00:28:42,839 --> 00:29:04,409
that some din right okay so there we go

601
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,880
I don't know if we really want to call

602
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,500
those movement flags because I feel like

603
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,410
we'd want to pack all our flags into the

604
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:17,210
same place so I feel like we should

605
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:22,350
probably just call it nad visible peace

606
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:23,579
flag I'm just call this flags and then

607
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:25,500
everywhere that we were calling it

608
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,639
movement flags which I obviously didn't

609
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,529
even want to do because I never typed

610
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,970
that I always typed it wrong on how to

611
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:38,160
correct myself we'll bring it back

612
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:41,850
alright so now you can see we're getting

613
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,250
that hop back in there we're not getting

614
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:46,019
the torso is not actually deforming

615
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,599
though for some reason I don't know if

616
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,980
you notice that and i'm not sure why so

617
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:51,689
let me go double check whether it is but

618
00:29:49,980 --> 00:30:00,960
now we can get rid of this switch

619
00:29:51,690 --> 00:30:02,460
statement entirely which is good I know

620
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:09,000
where I want to put this I'm constantly

621
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:11,400
not sure where okay so let's go up and

622
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,160
see what I did wrong I assume I did

623
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:18,120
something wrong I don't know but we'll

624
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:20,940
find out in a second so both of these

625
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,099
guys have axial deform deformation the

626
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,150
torso and

627
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:29,449
cave right they both have access to

628
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:34,250
forum they both have Bob offset so let

629
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:41,450
me see did I define them correctly I

630
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:43,429
assume I did yeah and so the way I'm

631
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:49,910
looking at this is saying oh let's see

632
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:55,190
if we do access to form x and y and yeah

633
00:30:49,910 --> 00:31:00,500
so that should that should deform both

634
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:04,429
of those right I'm not sure why it's not

635
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:09,769
but it's definitely not right you see

636
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:11,330
the torso is straight up and down oh you

637
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:13,279
know what it's not deforming I'd room

638
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:15,408
it's just moving the other one so the

639
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:23,230
axial deformation is just plain not

640
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:23,230
working so the question is why

641
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:37,539
so there's two possible reasons one is

642
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,750
that something is wrong with this code

643
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:44,799
that's not obvious and the other one is

644
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:48,309
that we're just not setting them in the

645
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:54,089
brain or we're setting them on the wrong

646
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:54,089
person so let's find out

647
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,558
so here we set I don't know why we have

648
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,900
to do set the set construction and then

649
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,210
we don't set it at construction probably

650
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:25,110
should actually we should probably

651
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:38,509
actually use our actual comment but we

652
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:38,509
want to actually have that work so why

653
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:53,279
did we accidentally delete it I am

654
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:59,279
confused it looks like we somehow

655
00:32:53,279 --> 00:33:02,069
deleted it right because it's not here

656
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,928
anymore so I must have deleted it at

657
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:07,939
some point but I'm not really sure when

658
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:07,940
I did that

659
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,900
hmm I assume this would be a good time

660
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,519
of course I don't really use get usually

661
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:23,710
so I guess I don't know how to really

662
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:26,410
figure this out but I'm assuming that in

663
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:31,779
here I could ask it when we deleted that

664
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:37,990
line of code but let's let's at least go

665
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:43,418
back in and see what it was so let's see

666
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:46,329
here we've got world mode and I'm

667
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:50,820
assuming that I can get the history for

668
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:57,009
it so yeah so if I if we go back to

669
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:59,649
something like you know this code where

670
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:03,579
we weren't touching anything we should

671
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:17,260
be well how do I get it to show me just

672
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:21,519
the file that's not what I wanted oh boy

673
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:25,419
I just want to see this file at that

674
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:28,269
version is that this one of those like

675
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:30,039
oh you wanted to do something that's the

676
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:31,898
default thing you'd want to do you can't

677
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:35,579
do that thing what do you get who you

678
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:42,128
get in here we go this is what I want

679
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:44,799
browser positive Tory at this point all

680
00:34:42,128 --> 00:34:46,418
right so this is handmade world mode and

681
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,649
so now I can go look at that piece of

682
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:53,918
code and I don't know why it got deleted

683
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:57,279
here it is I guess it must have it was

684
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:59,440
probably sitting down here and it just

685
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,150
got the best they've got I must have

686
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,150
accidentally today just at one point

687
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:11,640
accidentally so oh well alright so in

688
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:15,220
the brain here oh no it's right there I

689
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:18,789
was okay i was just searching for x axis

690
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:20,259
that's the problem okay that's why it's

691
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:22,630
gone so i didn't delete it it's right

692
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,559
there alright so the question is why is

693
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:33,729
this not

694
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:35,769
to be happening right first of all this

695
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:41,139
needs to be inside the head code so

696
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:42,669
that's a bug to begin with oh wait no

697
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,838
that's I guess that's not true never

698
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,659
mind because it does have an if around

699
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:49,150
it so we compute the head Delta and then

700
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:51,159
we're setting the body y axis here so I

701
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,989
guess the only bug is that this this is

702
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:54,969
the bug the fact that this server rights

703
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:56,769
is every time so really what we have to

704
00:35:54,969 --> 00:36:00,159
do is just go back up to the constructor

705
00:35:56,768 --> 00:36:01,899
and do what we said we were going to do

706
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,328
in there which is when we do begin low

707
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,670
entity and we do the 0 struct we got to

708
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:09,278
set these to the correct values and

709
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:17,739
that's really it I think and by the way

710
00:36:09,278 --> 00:36:20,199
why do we still have entity low we got

711
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:27,880
rid of all that that no longer has to

712
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:29,798
happen ever okay all right so now we're

713
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,890
properly deforming with the deformable

714
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:34,719
axis which is good as well and so now

715
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:37,538
we've gotten rid of all of the things

716
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:40,719
that were specific to a piece of an

717
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:42,670
entity in the render code right so the

718
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,759
render code no longer needs the entity

719
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:48,548
type so the next question is what does

720
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:51,219
anybody else need the entity type right

721
00:36:48,548 --> 00:36:53,349
so let's start by just going into the

722
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:57,579
entity and deleting the type and we'll

723
00:36:53,349 --> 00:37:00,068
just see who notices right and we'll see

724
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:02,109
if anyone cares so it's like all right

725
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:03,458
gets their ground Wells get stared

726
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:04,929
around isn't even a thing we're ever

727
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:08,469
going to have anymore so that doesn't

728
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:12,009
matter let's see what this is entity

729
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:14,019
overlaps rectangle oh that must have

730
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:15,998
been one of those I for kodir has a

731
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:18,308
weird bug these days where it can't go

732
00:37:15,998 --> 00:37:20,678
it doesn't the first time you try to

733
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:23,729
jump something it doesn't jump to it for

734
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:26,650
whatever reason I'm not quite sure why

735
00:37:23,728 --> 00:37:28,419
ok so in handle collision this we're not

736
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,528
really using at the moment so I'm going

737
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,099
to just go ahead and say that these

738
00:37:29,528 --> 00:37:35,248
things can sort of be nerfed for the

739
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:35,249
moment

740
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:56,079
because we're going to go ahead and play

741
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:58,930
with those a little bit later on all

742
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:12,250
right don't know that I used to still be

743
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:13,809
there get rid of that rid of this can

744
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:28,630
also take the opportunity to get rid of

745
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:31,809
begin low entity okay and let's see we

746
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:42,809
can ground identity does not need any of

747
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:42,809
this stuff let's keep on going

748
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,690
nothing to really see here you can see

749
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:06,359
what I'm doing I'm literally just

750
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:14,460
cleaning this up so that it's not taking

751
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:15,719
that anymore all right so now we have

752
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,349
the game running and it literally just

753
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:22,649
doesn't have any types at all right

754
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:24,599
which is what I wanted so that's like a

755
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,910
good big step we still got a ways to go

756
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:32,700
but it's a pretty big step because now

757
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:35,308
like I said all of those all of the

758
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:37,588
information that sort of type knowledge

759
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:39,960
has been decoupled which is what I

760
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:43,230
wanted right I don't want a notion that

761
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,909
this entity is type X where X defines

762
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:47,460
everything about it I want that

763
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:48,538
splintered into dozens of little types

764
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,639
that are like what type of collision

765
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:52,170
does it have and what type of body shape

766
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,730
does it have and what type of brain is

767
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,380
it using and what type of this so that

768
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,358
they can be mixed and matched freely

769
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,990
without having to think of something as

770
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:09,449
up being a particular whole type of

771
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:12,439
enemy and so now that that's done i'm

772
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,439
pretty happy camper

773
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:22,838
okay so that's pretty good and I'm going

774
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,159
to say that that I'm willing to promote

775
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,659
I think the way the brain was working

776
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,058
was quite good so I'm willing to start

777
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:29,048
to promote that up to here where this is

778
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:33,278
the thing we've actually thought about

779
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:36,518
and want right like I feel like that

780
00:40:33,278 --> 00:40:38,318
system is is it a place where that's you

781
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:41,699
know that's doing what I wanted to do in

782
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:41,699
the way I wanted to do it for the moment

783
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,579
and so I consider that to actually be

784
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,440
our first thing where we kind of thought

785
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,700
it through there's some it'll probably

786
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,349
still need some improvements down the

787
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:58,058
road but I think that's an actual real

788
00:40:53,349 --> 00:41:01,510
thing now that I want to keep so entity

789
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:03,250
ID updateable is not something we've

790
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,170
thought about but entity ID definitely

791
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:07,960
is and obviously that's also something

792
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:09,190
we need so that's our actual part of the

793
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,000
energy structure that we thought through

794
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:14,079
pretty carefully and so I feel like

795
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,079
those are going to stay there for a

796
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:22,119
while all right so let's go back and

797
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,609
take a look now at what the world mode

798
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:27,490
code looks like now that we've got rid

799
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:30,759
of that part and you know what what this

800
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:31,778
sort of straight line code looks like so

801
00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:33,579
you can see that we loop through the

802
00:41:31,778 --> 00:41:37,568
controllers here to see whether anybody

803
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:39,548
has tried to start playing the game we

804
00:41:37,568 --> 00:41:41,469
then loop through all the brain code and

805
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:45,038
Allah give each brain a chance to think

806
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:48,038
right essentially and tell its component

807
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,809
entities what he wanted them to do we

808
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,690
then have a loop through all the

809
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:54,278
entities where we you know duty but

810
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:57,960
could if we need to assuming that it's

811
00:41:54,278 --> 00:42:00,039
an updatable entity we kind of have this

812
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,809
global alpha stuff having here I think

813
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:03,819
this is you know something we want to

814
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:05,798
pull out and into sheep rendering like i

815
00:42:03,818 --> 00:42:07,568
said before but then we've kind of got

816
00:42:05,798 --> 00:42:11,048
this notion of the movement mode and

817
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:13,210
then the physics update right and all of

818
00:42:11,048 --> 00:42:17,079
that is good but it needs to start being

819
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:19,179
factored for real into actual you know

820
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,099
this isn't really all that thought

821
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:22,629
through yet it probably needs a little

822
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:24,490
bit more refinement but on the whole

823
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,869
it's okay and then we get to move entity

824
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:27,250
and move entity is

825
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:29,980
the weakest link at this far because

826
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,860
that's still our old standard physics

827
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:36,849
stuff and that probably needs a good

828
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:39,010
good dusting right then our render code

829
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:40,210
is now pretty reasonable I mean it's not

830
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,060
great it's not going to win any awards

831
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:45,570
but it's actually starting to be a

832
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:48,130
little bit more straightforward and on

833
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,900
you know unencumbered by notions of what

834
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:51,070
entities are anything like that you can

835
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,960
see it just kind of goes through and

836
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:55,900
says well I just got a list of things I

837
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,400
should render i render those and if I've

838
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,250
got other things like hit points I draw

839
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,130
them on top you know and debug data on

840
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:05,650
top right and then we just got a bunch

841
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,390
of debug code so overall there's really

842
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:11,110
not much there at this point and that's

843
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:13,119
good so I feel like we're kind of

844
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:19,059
getting we're kind of getting to a good

845
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:23,019
place so really I think we need this to

846
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:24,730
be like the physics section so we've got

847
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:30,190
our physics and then we've got our

848
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:34,269
rendering down here right i guess i'm

849
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:37,690
not sure if an entity is updateable i'm

850
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:42,280
not sure why entity has to be updateable

851
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:43,690
for it to be rendered like I guess it

852
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,130
makes sense because we'd only want to

853
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:47,950
render something that we that is

854
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,150
actively and well I don't know it's a

855
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:53,739
little weird because I'm not sure that

856
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:57,430
really is what that means but okay so

857
00:43:53,739 --> 00:44:00,849
yeah if we take a look at what's

858
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:03,369
happening here we kind of have the Bob

859
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:07,650
update and the movement mode hopping

860
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:07,650
update and so on and so forth

861
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,760
I'm not sure exactly what we want here

862
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:24,640
hmm i say hmm

863
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:36,739
so I guess here's something that I i

864
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:40,139
guess i would like to start to do then

865
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm going to say let's create a brain

866
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:43,170
type well we don't really have to create

867
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,500
a brain tab because I think we've got

868
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:48,990
one yeah so let's let's start playing

869
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:52,338
around with this I'm going to I'm going

870
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:55,649
to have a brain Monstar test here right

871
00:44:52,338 --> 00:44:58,588
and the brain Monstar is just going to

872
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:02,639
be a thing that utilizes the movement

873
00:44:58,588 --> 00:45:04,889
spec and maybe uses hopping as a thing

874
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:09,059
and so the way I'm going to do this is

875
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:11,129
going to say ok a monster brain at the

876
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:14,639
moment I guess really just has just the

877
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:16,680
body right but it you know probably

878
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:20,608
eventually have some real stuff there

879
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:25,710
but in here we've got these are sort of

880
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:27,568
our types of brains right if that makes

881
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:30,420
sense in fact what we could do here as

882
00:45:27,568 --> 00:45:35,009
well as say all right you've got brain

883
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:36,900
IDs and brain slots and brain types and

884
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:40,980
those sorts of things and maybe all of

885
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:43,050
that kind of lives down here and that's

886
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:54,260
the definition of the brain and then in

887
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:54,260
here this is brain types

888
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:12,700
right something like that so we've got

889
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:14,230
brain hero parts we've got brain and

890
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:23,009
maybe it should just be brave hero

891
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:23,009
instead of parts this is brain Monstar

892
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:31,568
and this is brain familiar and again I

893
00:46:29,768 --> 00:46:32,768
don't know that these are actually I'm

894
00:46:31,568 --> 00:46:34,389
not trying to suggest that these are

895
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:37,899
actually the types of brains we would

896
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:40,210
have they the brains themselves might

897
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,548
want to be a lot more fluid to as we go

898
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:44,380
further on but for now i'm basically

899
00:46:42,548 --> 00:46:46,528
taking the same approach with brains as

900
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,298
i would took with the entities first

901
00:46:46,528 --> 00:46:51,670
hardcode them to what i want them to do

902
00:46:49,298 --> 00:46:53,588
first and when i start to see the places

903
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:55,480
where things can be pulled apart pull it

904
00:46:53,588 --> 00:46:58,929
apart then rather than try to guess

905
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,519
ahead of time and this is sort of the

906
00:46:58,929 --> 00:47:02,139
you know a very much a compression

907
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:05,278
oriented style thing that I'm suggesting

908
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:11,920
here I think that's going to be more

909
00:47:05,278 --> 00:47:13,960
useful so a familiar just has a head at

910
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:21,639
the moment I believe and a monster just

911
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:23,679
has a body so there's that but you know

912
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:25,298
that's just how it goes i guess so let's

913
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,828
go ahead and reenable some of these

914
00:47:25,298 --> 00:47:31,748
things just to play with them a little i

915
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:35,769
just want to see what happens so i'm

916
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:38,288
going to go ahead and and put this in

917
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:41,649
here i'm going to set the config for now

918
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:43,980
to the AI follows here at a true so i

919
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:47,650
wanted to fall to it actually working

920
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:50,528
and then we'll just say alright we've

921
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:54,068
got our our brain familiar we've got our

922
00:47:50,528 --> 00:47:55,568
brain familiar this is essentially just

923
00:47:54,068 --> 00:48:00,420
want a mirror like you can see what we

924
00:47:55,568 --> 00:48:00,420
did here I just want to do this

925
00:48:00,969 --> 00:48:15,399
I so we just grab that out and we say

926
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:17,829
well familiar only has a head so that's

927
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,470
fine inside here we've sort of got this

928
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:22,059
loop through and we need spatial queries

929
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:26,049
that's true but we don't care about that

930
00:48:22,059 --> 00:48:29,079
for the very moment but what we want to

931
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:31,240
do here is say well we want to find I

932
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:33,940
guess the closest thing that has a brain

933
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:37,348
that is a hero if there is one so I

934
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:44,289
guess we would say if the brain type is

935
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:51,099
brain type hero or brain hero then

936
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:58,509
that's then that's it yeah I think

937
00:48:51,099 --> 00:49:02,019
that's pretty much all there is remember

938
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:03,520
how movements effects work I'm going to

939
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:08,739
go ahead and assume that this is how it

940
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:10,509
works at the moment and then in here

941
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:17,709
everywhere we're doing entity is going

942
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:22,950
to be head right so head head head head

943
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,949
head head oops

944
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:38,970
okay um so I don't expect anything to

945
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:40,140
happen now when we run this and the

946
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:42,358
reason for that is no one should have

947
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:45,808
that brain look we have not installed

948
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:48,259
that brain in anything right so what we

949
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:54,150
need to do is when we do an ad familiar

950
00:49:48,260 --> 00:50:01,049
to the game and familiar we need to do

951
00:49:54,150 --> 00:50:03,588
this this piece of code oh I just had an

952
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:07,639
idea we need to do this piece of code

953
00:50:03,588 --> 00:50:16,529
right and we need to say brain familiar

954
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:18,420
for this entity the brain ID in this

955
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:25,680
case we're going to have to get so we

956
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:27,858
need to do an ad brain and that's about

957
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:27,858
it

958
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:45,019
well that was anticlimactic mr. familiar

959
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:49,460
not following me now I probably have to

960
00:50:45,019 --> 00:50:52,550
set his movement mode he's a separate

961
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,780
issue but I gotta go first check to make

962
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,760
sure some other things are happening uh

963
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:58,040
what I did want to point out those I had

964
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,870
an idea here which is what we might want

965
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:02,659
to do to make things easier on ourselves

966
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:07,579
is we might want to make these like

967
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:12,139
brain hero or whatever and bring monster

968
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:14,809
or whatever I we may want to make it to

969
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:18,769
the brain type and the struct are the

970
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:28,719
same right I so it would basically be

971
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:37,489
like hey this is just like you know type

972
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:44,289
brain hero type brainsnake that sort of

973
00:51:37,489 --> 00:51:56,349
thing type brain familiar type brain

974
00:51:44,289 --> 00:52:01,670
floaty thing for now type brain monstar

975
00:51:56,349 --> 00:52:03,110
type rain and the reason I suggest that

976
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:11,059
is because it gives us a little bit of

977
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:12,740
opportunity to protect ourselves to you

978
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:14,750
know sort of overcoming again the C C++

979
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:17,449
language shortcomings that force us to

980
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:21,170
do some weird macro things this brain

981
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:25,839
slot for we could sort of make this into

982
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:28,490
a more extensive macro set that would

983
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,890
sort of reduce the chances of us making

984
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:32,629
an assignment error so you can see like

985
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:34,429
for example in this case we have the

986
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:38,000
brain type and the brain slot and there

987
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:39,440
are signs together and that's a very

988
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,929
common thing so I'm starting to think

989
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,849
well maybe a brain slot and a brain type

990
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:48,369
should sort of be bundled together into

991
00:52:45,849 --> 00:52:51,170
some single thing

992
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:53,719
you know so maybe there's something more

993
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:56,300
like oh okay there's a brain type and a

994
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:57,980
brain slot and since anything that gets

995
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,440
assigned to bring type has to have a

996
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:03,199
slot into which it goes instead it we

997
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:09,050
could say Oh in that case you know its

998
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:11,779
brain type in slot right makes sense so

999
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:13,340
maybe brain slot is a very is a totally

1000
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:18,769
different thing maybe it's something

1001
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:20,539
more like this you know I'm saying so

1002
00:53:18,769 --> 00:53:23,090
brain type actually doesn't appear

1003
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:25,820
anywhere and brain slot for is a thing

1004
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:28,910
that you actually gives you back both of

1005
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:30,680
these so what I do is I say well okay I

1006
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:32,389
know what the type is that we were

1007
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:35,269
talking about and I can get the

1008
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:38,690
enumerator for that type just by pacing

1009
00:53:35,269 --> 00:53:40,820
on type underscore at the beginning of

1010
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:43,309
it which means that now i can say that

1011
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,170
just takes a brain type in addition to

1012
00:53:43,309 --> 00:53:48,049
whatever the value i'm supposed to be

1013
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:51,050
packing in right so then when i do brain

1014
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:53,990
slots i can say well the slot is the

1015
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:56,090
type and then the pack value and we

1016
00:53:53,989 --> 00:53:58,189
could also warrant that this is going to

1017
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,420
be a u16 because we know that we're not

1018
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:05,000
going to have more than that number of

1019
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:08,119
slots right so that seems pretty

1020
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,849
compelling to me and I think that I like

1021
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:13,730
that because now what we do is we say

1022
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:16,730
that the brain slot is just that and now

1023
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:20,420
you can't mess it up you can't use an

1024
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:21,829
offset for one type of brain but assign

1025
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,840
it to a different type of brain just

1026
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:27,650
threw a typo which is something I could

1027
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:29,480
easily see us doing right and so it's

1028
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,400
free it doesn't create any cumbersome

1029
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,619
this for me so it seems like a freeway

1030
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,380
there's a purely free way to prevent

1031
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:38,210
some errors so I'm going to take it I

1032
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,430
think I have five minutes left on the

1033
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:42,920
clock so I'm going to use them to finish

1034
00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:45,129
this up and then we can worry about

1035
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:49,159
familiars and stuff like that tomorrow

1036
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:51,260
okay so in here we've got a brain slot

1037
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:53,299
brain type so now we just get rid of

1038
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,740
brain type and it's gone and then I just

1039
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,410
have to deal with the fallout from that

1040
00:54:54,739 --> 00:55:00,379
and we should be good and can you not

1041
00:54:57,409 --> 00:55:03,159
convert brain type 2 u16 possible loss

1042
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,160
of data what

1043
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:14,048
how on earth with that enum ever be

1044
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:20,409
greater you're staring right at it all

1045
00:55:14,048 --> 00:55:29,139
right well I won't ask I won't ask my

1046
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:31,179
friend okay uh so get a rad brain let's

1047
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:33,368
see here so get our ad brain is looking

1048
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:40,179
at the desk brain type but now it needs

1049
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:43,869
to be the brain slot type right what's

1050
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:46,960
going on here bring ID right its brain

1051
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:48,970
slot type is it not cannot convert

1052
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:56,760
argument 3 for me 16 to brain type

1053
00:55:48,969 --> 00:56:01,899
alright fine we'll just say great type

1054
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:10,680
and so all of these now have to be type

1055
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:20,410
brain hero type brain snake type brain

1056
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:29,889
familiar and type brain floaty thing for

1057
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:32,489
now type dream monster aah type brain

1058
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:32,489
era

1059
00:56:40,269 --> 00:56:45,619
okay so hopefully nothing has changed

1060
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:47,240
that should just be the same and so we

1061
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:49,639
still have to go get our familiar

1062
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:52,569
working but we can do that tomorrow and

1063
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,569
I can go to the QA

1064
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,090
man then that kink not fun

1065
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:40,360
quarter were you trapped in an elevator

1066
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:42,799
today ah no was there a risk of that I

1067
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:49,519
mean I guess I did use an elevator today

1068
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:51,740
but I never became trapped the marsala

1069
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:53,030
if you are nuking the constant any type

1070
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:54,709
but still keeping everything tightly

1071
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:56,090
bound in the brain what real gain does

1072
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:58,550
all this work give us didn't we just

1073
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:01,910
shift responsibility into the brain no

1074
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:04,580
right because now you can assign any

1075
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:06,859
brain to any collection of entities and

1076
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:10,909
use any movement type with any brain

1077
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:13,670
type it just allows us to decouple all

1078
00:58:10,909 --> 00:58:16,369
of those systems before everything was

1079
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:18,530
on the env type how you moved whether

1080
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:21,619
you were controlled by a controller what

1081
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:24,410
your actual render pieces were what your

1082
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:30,409
movement speed and even was was all

1083
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:32,750
bound into that right and so now we have

1084
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:34,039
the ability to just mix and match so we

1085
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:36,619
can have something that's created out of

1086
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:38,900
totally different renderable pieces but

1087
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:40,369
uses the same brain as a hero we can

1088
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:43,099
take something that appears to look like

1089
00:58:40,369 --> 00:58:45,829
a hero but uses the you know Monstar

1090
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:50,809
brain or whatever and those are just

1091
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:52,940
separated so similarly I would assume

1092
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:56,739
that as we go a little further we may

1093
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:59,900
have brains have quite a bit more

1094
00:58:56,739 --> 00:59:01,429
parameterization to them as well but

1095
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,320
again the point of moving things out in

1096
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:04,940
two brains was to vet the other thing

1097
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:07,910
that we gained is that brains operate

1098
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:10,490
cross entity so that solved a big

1099
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:12,589
problem for us was like oh we have these

1100
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:14,689
multi entity assemblies that want to

1101
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:16,160
think across multiple entities Weeden

1102
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:18,470
have any way to do that now and brain

1103
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:21,109
solve that for us too right so now we

1104
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:22,699
can have the hero head in the hero body

1105
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:25,490
can both be controlled by one controller

1106
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:26,509
for at some point and then we can make

1107
00:59:25,489 --> 00:59:28,729
it so they're going to control

1108
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:30,020
separately at other points and we could

1109
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,630
even have it so you can you know

1110
00:59:30,019 --> 00:59:34,489
dynamically switch as you sort of maybe

1111
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:37,750
get into situations where your head

1112
00:59:34,489 --> 00:59:37,750
could detach or other stuff like that

1113
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:53,759
Abner after all this time are finally

1114
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:57,019
you used to programming live is this a

1115
00:59:53,759 --> 01:00:01,798
comfortable habit now I know it's always

1116
00:59:57,018 --> 01:00:06,538
not great I mean it's always a lot

1117
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:08,248
harder than programming not it's not the

1118
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:12,329
live part that's the problem it's the

1119
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:15,238
talking and the little bits is also

1120
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:16,920
problematic and having lots of products

1121
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:19,588
at once is also not great I don't love

1122
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:25,430
that either so it's a lot harder than

1123
01:00:19,588 --> 01:00:25,429
programming normally like a lot harder

1124
01:00:27,048 --> 01:00:31,288
lung boolean could you explain again

1125
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:33,239
what you just did with the brain slot

1126
01:00:31,289 --> 01:00:37,680
that went a little fast for me well I

1127
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:39,838
was just saying I so if you take a look

1128
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:45,078
at at what was happening let me see if I

1129
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:51,268
can pull that up in here I want to open

1130
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:54,298
brain dot H so if you take a look at

1131
01:00:51,268 --> 01:00:57,358
what happens in here we've got this

1132
01:00:54,298 --> 01:01:00,389
nation of of these brain slots which we

1133
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:01,920
haven't really you know we haven't

1134
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:03,538
looked into too much how this is going

1135
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,450
to work this might get a little more

1136
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:08,160
complicated later on right but the way

1137
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:09,689
it works right now is a brain this is

1138
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,118
just something that's got some slots in

1139
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:13,380
it that you can stick things into but we

1140
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:15,599
don't really know what they are and then

1141
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:17,548
what happens is depending on what type

1142
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,989
of brain you are we've got some

1143
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,579
different understandings of how those

1144
01:01:18,989 --> 01:01:23,728
are laid out whether it's a hero a

1145
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:27,390
monster are familiar right oops undo

1146
01:01:23,728 --> 01:01:30,179
that and so we've got these layouts here

1147
01:01:27,389 --> 01:01:32,308
and those layouts are important right

1148
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:33,778
there you know at the moment we could

1149
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:35,609
probably just do it all with just head

1150
01:01:33,778 --> 01:01:38,219
and body and having two slots right and

1151
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:40,920
maybe if in the end that turns out to be

1152
01:01:38,219 --> 01:01:42,450
all we need then great but assuming we

1153
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,710
start having crazy stuff like weird

1154
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:46,018
spider creatures that have eight

1155
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:47,670
different pieces or you know sets of

1156
01:01:46,018 --> 01:01:49,588
pieces or who knows what else if we

1157
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:51,479
start to have stuff like that or like a

1158
01:01:49,588 --> 01:01:52,978
snake thing that's just a bunch of

1159
01:01:51,478 --> 01:01:54,899
different pieces that follow one after

1160
01:01:52,978 --> 01:01:57,118
each other you know I don't know what

1161
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,900
we're going to have and so to make sure

1162
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,920
that while we're experimenting with it

1163
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,250
right like if I knew we're going to have

1164
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,570
I could just say here's maybe the

1165
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,619
sperry do it but since I don't know

1166
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:07,120
we're going to want to be able to play

1167
01:02:05,619 --> 01:02:09,909
with this and just see what happens as

1168
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:13,889
we go I wanted to make sure that we

1169
01:02:09,909 --> 01:02:16,929
would never use the wrong template uh

1170
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:18,879
with the with a different type so if

1171
01:02:16,929 --> 01:02:20,649
we're saying that a brain is of type

1172
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,050
familiar I want to make sure that

1173
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:27,039
everyone is using brain familiar to

1174
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:29,860
assign themselves a slot index right so

1175
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:32,289
I want them to say I'm you know the head

1176
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:34,420
of a familiar and make sure that the

1177
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:36,309
type is marked as familiar I don't want

1178
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:38,079
them to say I'm the head of a familiar

1179
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:42,279
and then mark the type as floaty thing

1180
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:44,739
for now or Monstar right and so before

1181
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:47,950
what was happening is when we assigned

1182
01:02:44,739 --> 01:02:50,409
in India brain we assigned it a slot and

1183
01:02:47,949 --> 01:02:52,299
a type completely separately so you

1184
01:02:50,409 --> 01:02:55,359
could have easily just said this is a

1185
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:57,550
snake but then assigned it the slot as

1186
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:59,230
if it was enumerated like a hero which

1187
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:02,530
would give totally nonsensical results

1188
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:06,099
potentially right so what I did instead

1189
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:08,710
was say hey let's use a macro to make

1190
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:12,460
sure that whatever struct you use to

1191
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:16,929
measure your slot location you will then

1192
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:19,389
use that as your type as well so I just

1193
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:25,239
named these the same things as the

1194
01:03:19,389 --> 01:03:27,969
struts and so you know that that is just

1195
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:29,229
a little trick to make it so that you

1196
01:03:27,969 --> 01:03:32,069
use a preprocessor to prevent you from

1197
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:32,070
making a typo

1198
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:08,079
sighs acai would you handle something

1199
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:11,058
like mind controlling other entities or

1200
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:14,030
having your own or sorry having your

1201
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:22,930
mind swapped into a differently

1202
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:28,240
structured body um well at the moment I

1203
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:32,509
guess there's one thing we might have

1204
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:35,389
well no not really I guess I I guess I

1205
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:37,400
think there really isn't much to do for

1206
01:04:35,389 --> 01:04:45,588
that you know all we would all we would

1207
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:49,519
need is to just all we would need is

1208
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:51,980
just to take whatever that other set of

1209
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:59,030
entities are and set them to our brain

1210
01:04:51,980 --> 01:05:00,740
ID and then jettison our own right again

1211
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:02,599
this is why I think it's so important to

1212
01:05:00,739 --> 01:05:04,789
have these things decoupled I mean maybe

1213
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:07,519
maybe it's it's a little obtuse right

1214
01:05:04,789 --> 01:05:10,509
now just because you know I have

1215
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:14,599
everything in my head pun intended and

1216
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:16,579
and everyone else doesn't but like so

1217
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:18,470
like for example the marsala said

1218
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,818
player-controlled flag but no you don't

1219
01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:21,709
need a player controlled flag like

1220
01:05:19,818 --> 01:05:23,389
that's like the whole point so for

1221
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:25,220
example you know let's say I wanted to

1222
01:05:23,389 --> 01:05:30,170
have that exactly what you just said

1223
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:33,618
happen so if I came and said well we've

1224
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:36,530
got you know the start button down or

1225
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:38,210
something I don't know what the start

1226
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:40,730
button is I guess it's the spacebar I

1227
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:42,909
think so i think i think this is it

1228
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:42,909
right

1229
01:05:45,969 --> 01:05:58,699
let me just see here so if I came over

1230
01:05:50,900 --> 01:06:09,470
here to see where that was just wanna

1231
01:05:58,699 --> 01:06:14,239
make sure this is the correct thing wait

1232
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:18,109
what oh that's ended down I want was

1233
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:20,269
pressed of course it's going to be stuck

1234
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:21,170
ended down because I get the spacebar

1235
01:06:20,269 --> 01:06:23,869
and then went into it and it wouldn't

1236
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:25,130
have been checked again but cannot go

1237
01:06:23,869 --> 01:06:35,089
right one from bulleted game button

1238
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:41,900
state that alright so when I hit the

1239
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:43,760
spacebar yeah there we go okay uh so if

1240
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:47,450
I for example wanted to do the mind

1241
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:51,800
control thing like you said then what i

1242
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:56,179
could do is go okay let's let's actually

1243
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:59,510
make that scenario happen right so when

1244
01:06:56,179 --> 01:07:01,309
i do was pressed i'll just make it so

1245
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:06,610
that i take control of whoever the

1246
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:12,320
closest entity is right like literally

1247
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:13,760
is like even if it doesn't have well i

1248
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,170
guess i don't want to take toiletries

1249
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,020
but i'll just take care I'll take care

1250
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:22,070
of anyone anyone with a brain I'll take

1251
01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:23,719
control of that person right we really

1252
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:25,370
need to make find closest entity we need

1253
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:28,219
a call for that that's got to be done

1254
01:07:25,369 --> 01:07:30,230
soon so if I search through here and I

1255
01:07:28,219 --> 01:07:33,049
just say hey if rain slapped slot type

1256
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:36,349
or i guess i should say brain slot ID is

1257
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:39,320
you know is nonzero then whatever this

1258
01:07:36,349 --> 01:07:41,119
test entity is I'm going to take it as

1259
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:46,160
my head and jettison the head that I do

1260
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:52,130
have right so I'm going to say like if

1261
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:56,469
head head gut brain slot equals brain

1262
01:07:52,130 --> 01:08:04,240
slot for or I guess clear

1263
01:07:56,469 --> 01:08:08,049
no brain slot like that or just no brain

1264
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:12,189
right so I'll get rid of of the head

1265
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:18,759
that I do have and I'll just assign me

1266
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:24,250
to to this to this brain yes now I think

1267
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:42,670
about I want to do it out here star

1268
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:45,130
closest 0i so we've got the closest hero

1269
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:47,230
here and so when we come out of here

1270
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:51,310
we'll just say well if I had a head the

1271
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:55,119
head's gone now and the the closest hero

1272
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:56,589
whatever that was I guess I should check

1273
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:59,289
for us to see that we found somebody so

1274
01:08:56,588 --> 01:09:04,630
we don't end up headless will save the

1275
01:08:59,289 --> 01:09:12,600
closest here is brain slot is just going

1276
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:16,600
to be brain slot for brain or brain hero

1277
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:21,670
head so this just like installs a

1278
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:25,920
different head right and so all I have

1279
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:28,180
to do is is actually make that groups

1280
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,588
all I have to do is actually make that

1281
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:32,440
no brain which is something we would

1282
01:09:29,588 --> 01:09:34,809
have wanted anyway and so in here I just

1283
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:37,119
need a way of returning zero so it'd

1284
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:47,160
just be like brain slot you know no

1285
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:47,159
brain brain slot result results

1286
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,789
uh and I guess oh you know what I don't

1287
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:55,130
even really have to do that now I think

1288
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:58,429
about it it's just I guess it's just no

1289
01:09:55,130 --> 01:10:00,859
brain it only affects the ID now that i

1290
01:09:58,429 --> 01:10:07,489
think about it right so it's actually

1291
01:10:00,859 --> 01:10:10,849
just it's only the ID nid result return

1292
01:10:07,488 --> 01:10:13,579
result so really I guess I don't have to

1293
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:19,699
do the brain slot I it's really just

1294
01:10:13,579 --> 01:10:24,229
brain ID right so--okay so closest hero

1295
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:30,559
bring an ID equals whatever my brain ID

1296
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:32,779
is and off you go so I think that should

1297
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,330
work but again this is kind of early and

1298
01:10:32,779 --> 01:10:37,130
testing but so maybe I try to go pick up

1299
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:41,689
the familiar head we'll see if it works

1300
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:51,400
I don't know if it will or not let's see

1301
01:10:41,689 --> 01:10:51,399
here okay can we find one

1302
01:10:54,069 --> 01:11:00,368
oh you know what I just realized we have

1303
01:10:58,569 --> 01:11:01,929
to make sure it's not somebody we're

1304
01:11:00,368 --> 01:11:04,569
going to just pick ourselves because

1305
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:09,060
we're the closest so we also have to say

1306
01:11:04,569 --> 01:11:15,840
the test brain ID value is not zero and

1307
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:15,840
is not us right because our brain ID

1308
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:27,189
would count so we don't want to take

1309
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:29,139
control of ourselves because we're

1310
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:41,319
always the closest thing all right try

1311
01:11:29,139 --> 01:11:44,639
one more time so let's see so that was

1312
01:11:41,319 --> 01:11:47,439
me taking control of that head right and

1313
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:50,289
now take control of this head back again

1314
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:53,738
I guess not sure if I can actually do

1315
01:11:50,289 --> 01:11:56,399
that like that should have worked why

1316
01:11:53,738 --> 01:11:56,399
doesn't that work

1317
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:08,510
my set a breakpoint there because it

1318
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:14,328
should work to swap back as well jump

1319
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:16,400
down to hear it could not find one brain

1320
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:21,380
ID value is not equal to the head brain

1321
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:23,420
ID value and I guess this only works if

1322
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:26,510
we have a head as well should make this

1323
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:37,190
as if head but tests inity brain ID

1324
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:39,079
value ah that's why because we need to

1325
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:49,908
give it some kind of a different brain

1326
01:12:39,078 --> 01:12:51,380
ID so when we when we leave it I don't

1327
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:55,308
really know what we would do here

1328
01:12:51,380 --> 01:13:00,170
exactly but there's this notion of a

1329
01:12:55,309 --> 01:13:02,840
thing that is is it an animate or

1330
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:05,480
inanimate like can I possess it and I'm

1331
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:09,949
and I don't know how we really want to

1332
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:13,069
describe that but I guess I guess we'd

1333
01:13:09,948 --> 01:13:15,189
want to swap does that make any sense so

1334
01:13:13,069 --> 01:13:19,788
the old thing should have become us

1335
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:21,109
probably so let's say I mean just

1336
01:13:19,788 --> 01:13:24,259
because we could assign it some other

1337
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:26,328
thing but yeah I don't know so so let's

1338
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:31,659
say that we just swapped these directly

1339
01:13:26,328 --> 01:13:38,288
like maybe we just say brain ID you know

1340
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:41,929
old brain ID equals head grain ID and

1341
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:48,109
and this would only be if we have a head

1342
01:13:41,929 --> 01:13:50,590
right so we have our old brain ID and we

1343
01:13:48,109 --> 01:13:54,319
have our brain slot our old brain slot

1344
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:56,360
equals head brain slot and so what we

1345
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:59,359
need to say is like well the heads brain

1346
01:13:56,359 --> 01:14:03,170
ID becomes whatever this thing's brain

1347
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:06,710
ideas and the heads brain slot becomes

1348
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:10,389
the closest heroes brain slot and then

1349
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:13,969
the closest hero brain ID just becomes a

1350
01:14:10,389 --> 01:14:18,650
the old brain ID and the closest heroes

1351
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:20,239
brain slot comes the old brain slot that

1352
01:14:18,649 --> 01:14:21,710
way we don't make it in an animate that

1353
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:28,038
we can never really use for anything

1354
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:29,899
again it just becomes it become our head

1355
01:14:28,038 --> 01:14:35,389
becomes whatever it was and vice versa

1356
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:38,179
right so like if I you know toggle this

1357
01:14:35,389 --> 01:14:43,269
guy right now I've I've sort of taken

1358
01:14:38,179 --> 01:14:48,170
control of this dude I got to fix our

1359
01:14:43,269 --> 01:14:52,248
collision code here in fact a second I

1360
01:14:48,170 --> 01:15:06,380
want to do this temporarily let me see

1361
01:14:52,248 --> 01:15:08,868
here world mode that's the P collision

1362
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:13,368
because we we still the collision is

1363
01:15:08,868 --> 01:15:14,868
definitely the the elephant in the room

1364
01:15:13,368 --> 01:15:16,279
right now both not ideal for the rich is

1365
01:15:14,868 --> 01:15:17,569
something that you know you're kind of

1366
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:19,880
gotten rid of it but we haven't actually

1367
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:21,078
gone in and finished that the done any

1368
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,389
of the actual work to make sure that

1369
01:15:21,078 --> 01:15:24,889
it's still happening there so I'm just

1370
01:15:23,389 --> 01:15:27,559
going to make these guys no collisions

1371
01:15:24,889 --> 01:15:28,760
for now so that I don't have to worry

1372
01:15:27,559 --> 01:15:31,210
about them while we're playing with

1373
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:31,210
other things

1374
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:58,379
okay so so now i can like tool over here

1375
01:15:53,969 --> 01:16:04,079
right and let me swap to this guy and

1376
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:07,289
then I can you know swap back swap swap

1377
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:12,539
back and then i can swap this thing out

1378
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:15,840
presumably so if I moved away I think I

1379
01:16:12,539 --> 01:16:18,420
could swap to this thing can I does this

1380
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,400
thing have a brain I don't know if it

1381
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:23,190
does or if it doesn't it doesn't seem to

1382
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:25,769
want to recognize that guy as somebody I

1383
01:16:23,189 --> 01:16:29,159
can swap to it always won't it always

1384
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:34,440
fix the one who's way far away so I

1385
01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:36,420
don't know what that guy is due mon

1386
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:40,259
stars have brains right now mom stars

1387
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:42,600
might not have brains and so let's just

1388
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:44,880
give our monster our brain yeah mansour

1389
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:49,890
doesn't have a brain that's no big deal

1390
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:51,060
right here's a monster or brain I so we

1391
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:54,800
can just say like oh there's a monster

1392
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,800
and that's got the body

1393
01:17:02,609 --> 01:17:07,689
so now i can i can swap right and i've

1394
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:09,579
picked this thing up as the head which

1395
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:11,889
is not appropriate because the torso but

1396
01:17:09,579 --> 01:17:16,720
it's okay i can do it and then i can

1397
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:18,700
swap back right if i want to i got to

1398
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:23,850
fix the movement code now to be back to

1399
01:17:18,699 --> 01:17:23,849
the way we had it before but yeah

1400
01:17:31,409 --> 01:17:37,720
so yeah so hopefully that makes some

1401
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:39,840
sense right hope you that answers the

1402
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,840
question

1403
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:55,590
let's see

1404
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:07,739
when will we implement the zombie brain

1405
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:09,869
well honestly like a lot of monsters are

1406
01:18:07,738 --> 01:18:16,949
kind of zombie like so probably that'll

1407
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:21,390
be one of the first things actually that

1408
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:24,559
make sense so let me see if there are

1409
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:24,560
any other q Collins here

1410
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:48,118
alright so looks like I've got all the

1411
01:18:40,559 --> 01:18:49,230
cues all right so I think I've all the

1412
01:18:48,118 --> 01:18:50,939
cues that are relevant to anything that

1413
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:55,098
we're actually doing so I'm going to go

1414
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:59,158
ahead and wrap it up close this down and

1415
01:18:55,099 --> 01:19:00,270
this as well all right thank you

1416
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:01,319
everyone for joining me from those set

1417
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:03,090
of handmade here it's and a pleasure

1418
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:04,259
coding with you as always if you would

1419
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:05,940
like to follow along at home you can

1420
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:08,489
always go to the game on handmade here

1421
01:19:05,939 --> 01:19:10,669
or get it come to the source code so you

1422
01:19:08,488 --> 01:19:12,779
can play wrath it at home and experiment

1423
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:13,739
we also have a forum site you can go if

1424
01:19:12,779 --> 01:19:15,750
you want to ask questions you have a
