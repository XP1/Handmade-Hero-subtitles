00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,000
hello everybody and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,838
hero we

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,519
are back i uh wanted to

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,280
take a look at some collision detection

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,679
stuff today because we just

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,558
just just just did uh collision

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,760
detection

8
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:21,039
um over the past couple weekends and

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:26,000
we are at the point where we

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,480
have to so i'm actually pretty

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
i guess i haven't run the shell.bat here

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,520
we go

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,159
uh we actually haven't uh looked at

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,079
one aspect of collision detection we did

15
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,479
some kind of interesting stuff with it

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,280
um and you can sort of see if i go ahead

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,839
here

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,840
uh and and run the actual game

19
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,000
uh what you can see is we actually had

20
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,878
uh some reasonable collision detection

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,960
stuff working

22
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,198
you can see here that like i can i can

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,799
now move the glove around and it will

24
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,960
it's kind of on a very loose spring

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,479
right now uh which is probably not great

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,519
like we probably don't want it to be

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,280
on that uh indefinitely but

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,880
uh what you can see here is that like it

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
it works pretty solid now the glove

30
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,280
doesn't really get stuck in things

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
um and it's it's pretty good uh in terms

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,439
of collision detection

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,040
uh so far we can we can sort of get it

34
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,399
like lodged on the other side of stuff

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,799
usually and and whatever

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
uh like trees currently don't have

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,118
collision detection you can see that

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,560
there's no

39
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,840
collider on trees which is probably

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,519
something we have to fix because we

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,640
probably don't want the glove

42
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,319
going through trees i would assume

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,680
but anyway you can kind of see that it

44
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,559
works pretty good and it doesn't really

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,280
have a problem but

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
we do have some some issues with it that

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,719
we'd like to address

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,560
uh and the issues

49
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,319
well they're not really issues they're

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
just things we haven't implemented yet i

51
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,679
guess is the way to look at it

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
um and there's there's a couple of them

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
so number one

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,439
uh is that we don't have a way for

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,560
something to get unstuck

56
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:04,000
if it's created in a stuck position so i

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,200
think we're doing a pretty good job

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,599
right now of not

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,920
getting them something stuck um it can

60
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,519
get stuck in the sense that like

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,559
when it's trying to move let me parse

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,760
all these out

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,878
so things are currently squares or

64
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,639
right rectangular prisms right and

65
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,439
the problem is so you can get stuff like

66
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,759
this for example so that's not stuck

67
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,039
it's just it's trying to move straight

68
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,318
and it can't

69
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,318
right um so for things like the glove

70
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,238
we want to probably switch to a sphere

71
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,399
so that it will roll off of

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
surfaces right because like there's no

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,280
amount like if you zoom in on what's

74
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,399
happening here

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,519
right there's no amount

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
of moving in this direction that will

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,159
ever

78
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,839
cause that thing to move forward it will

79
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,479
always hit this thing

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,319
right so you have to move it sideways

81
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,238
first before it could move forward

82
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,000
so it's not stuck in any kind of

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,400
numerical sense if i just hop

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,959
ooh the heck happened there why is my

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
camera

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,560
that was weird my like debug camera shot

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
to the side oh cause he moved over a

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,239
threshold yeah all right

89
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,839
the debug camera is its own thing um

90
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,360
all right so let me switch back to

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,280
regular camera so you can see

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,560
so you can see here the glove can't move

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,959
forward right because it's

94
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,239
it's pushing against a block but it's

95
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,000
not stuck if i move

96
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,519
over here it can come out just just

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
nicely right

98
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,519
so one thing that we want to do that has

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,879
nothing to do with the numerical quality

100
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,519
of the cushion sector is we'd like to

101
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,359
switch

102
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,519
uh like at least the glove but probably

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,360
enemies as well to using something like

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,519
a sphere or a cylinder

105
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,120
um so that it can roll it can sort of

106
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,200
smoothly roll off of things

107
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,878
easily which just feels better to the

108
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,919
player usually

109
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:52,000
the reason we do this in games the

110
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,039
reason we use

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,959
cylinders or capsules or spheres is

112
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,199
specifically for that feel it just

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,799
feels better regardless of the actual

114
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,798
shape of the object is the player would

115
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,519
rather feel it smoothly roll off of

116
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,680
things rather than sort of the stuck

117
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,640
nature that you get with with right

118
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,159
angles where they

119
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,679
can't glide off of each other right

120
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:17,039
um so anyway uh what we what we want to

121
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,319
do is a look at that

122
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,319
but b um that's just adding a collision

123
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,120
type to our system which is sphere

124
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,240
uh which wouldn't be that hard um we

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,918
were already set up for that

126
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,478
but uh what we don't have is any way of

127
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:36,159
getting unstuck if you are created stuck

128
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,159
and at the moment anyway

129
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,960
i guess i don't know if we have any test

130
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,679
examples of this

131
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,918
uh meaning an object that is stuck in

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,478
geometry when it is created

133
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,519
um i just feel like we want to support

134
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,918
things like that

135
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,879
because they create bad situations in

136
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,399
game design

137
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,959
where if you accidentally screw up the

138
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,719
game code and some piece of game code

139
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,799
accidentally creates an object which is

140
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,320
easy for it to do uh if it doesn't have

141
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
really advanced placement logic or

142
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,560
something

143
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,159
if it accidentally creates and two

144
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,319
objects interpenetrating

145
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,919
we don't have code that would really at

146
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,439
this point allow uh

147
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,279
those things to become unstuck right

148
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,279
um there's a little bit of a way that

149
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,079
things can become unstuck currently

150
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,959
um and uh and right now you know there's

151
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,159
not much of that

152
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,680
right so there's two things there's the

153
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
one that's getting stuck like this this

154
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
glove can get stuck in between or on

155
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,720
things

156
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,560
again not stuck in in the uh in the

157
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,880
numerical sense but you can see

158
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,038
it can kind of get pinned between things

159
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,800
or trying to move in a direction

160
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,079
uh that it simply can't and it won't

161
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,680
really roll around

162
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,560
on it so that's one thing we'd like to

163
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,478
fix um similarly like you can see

164
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,399
uh in this particular case right it's

165
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,800
wedged between two things at least

166
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,638
um and can't necessarily get out so we

167
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
have like all sorts of things like that

168
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,280
that we would want to fix uh for with

169
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,840
with spheres potentially or

170
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,839
um where we have an a uh

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,120
so i can't really demonstrate this one i

172
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
mean i can sort of demonstrate it like

173
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,079
there

174
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,439
that's good um probably

175
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,439
i'm trying to see if this actually is

176
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,759
true or not yeah

177
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,199
okay cool so the other thing we've got

178
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,720
is so in this example

179
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,400
right this is a perfect example of the

180
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,600
second thing i'm talking about that's th

181
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,038
that is an actual um

182
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,560
it's not a numerical problem i suppose

183
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:25,439
but it's an algorithmic thing we want to

184
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,079
fix

185
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,360
so this rectangle here right that's

186
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,560
attached to the player

187
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,240
is moved mandatorily on every frame

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,240
meaning the collision system doesn't get

189
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,400
to reject movements of it

190
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,360
so what has happened here is it has

191
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,918
placed itself

192
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,560
directly on top of the glove's bounding

193
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,359
box

194
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,199
right now this is not a big deal in

195
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
practice because hey the player can just

196
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,240
move or something

197
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,159
and that will unstick the glove but we

198
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,879
don't really want that to be the feel

199
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,639
right and similarly this is exactly the

200
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,519
kind of thing that would happen

201
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,160
as well in a situation where two things

202
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,240
were created

203
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
overlapping so in other words once two

204
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,680
things are overlapping

205
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,279
some some system that has nothing to do

206
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,439
with collision

207
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,598
so it's not a numerical error but just

208
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,639
some system such as the mandatory player

209
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,399
movement system

210
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:19,038
places two things overlapping like this

211
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,839
it then locks up the collision moved one

212
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,079
because it's like

213
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,519
there's nowhere it can feel to go that

214
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,000
isn't also colliding

215
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,719
right and so the reason i say we want to

216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,879
handle that

217
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,840
is because i don't actually want to have

218
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,839
to care about that

219
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:40,079
i don't want the rest of the game code

220
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,879
to have to avoid consciously avoid this

221
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,800
problem

222
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,719
i don't want to have to put things under

223
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,038
physics control

224
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,240
to avoid this or anything like that i

225
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:49,038
want to be able to keep doing what i'm

226
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
doing which is just

227
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,878
hard moving the player wherever i want

228
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,079
and then having the collision detection

229
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,599
have the slop

230
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,598
in it as necessary to unstick those

231
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,598
and so i have it to do in the code and

232
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,360
that's what i want to look at today

233
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,399
uh before we add like spheres or

234
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,280
whatever i want to add a thing

235
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,839
that basically says if you started the

236
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,239
frame

237
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,638
intersecting then we will let you try to

238
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,240
get

239
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,960
out of that intersection right

240
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,478
and this is a little bit difficult um

241
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,120
it's a little bit difficult because

242
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,159
i don't know that we have particularly

243
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,439
good ways

244
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,639
of concretely measuring your

245
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,958
separation directions necessarily um

246
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,319
but we probably can invent some so

247
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,038
that's probably not the hugest deal in

248
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,440
the world

249
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:43,038
but other than that it doesn't seem like

250
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,680
it'll be that hard and the reason is

251
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,080
because

252
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,079
we already know that we're in this case

253
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,440
so it's not like this is a mysterious

254
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,120
thing that we're not aware of

255
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,640
we literally know that this is the case

256
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,639
because if we test

257
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,639
the original starting configuration for

258
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,120
intersection we will get back true

259
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,319
like we will get back the fact that it

260
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
is in this thing

261
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,720
and so it's easy for us to take action

262
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,600
based on this scenario specifically

263
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,399
because

264
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
this scenario itself is easily

265
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,559
detectable

266
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,360
right so that's what we want to start

267
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,359
taking a look at today

268
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
okay um

269
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,120
so as you can see from this

270
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,959
configuration right

271
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,720
i can move the glove target that's that

272
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:36,319
little white uh thing there

273
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,879
right i can move the glove target around

274
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,920
uh and it's kind of crappy uh like the

275
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,919
glove target

276
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,120
uh we have to we have to work on our

277
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,958
glove movement code

278
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,159
uh that's gonna be a big thing we do but

279
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,759
we wanted to get the collision detector

280
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,879
solid first because obviously that's a

281
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,120
big part of it

282
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,720
um but either way you can see like i try

283
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,240
to move it here and it can't get out

284
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,000
right it can't figure out how to get out

285
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
now one of the directions that direction

286
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,039
it probably shouldn't be able to go in

287
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
because that would require it moving

288
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,599
through that object

289
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
but another direction intuitively

290
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,639
speaking like that direction

291
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,959
we probably do want to be able to go in

292
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,838
because it's just sort of unfortunately

293
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,958
overlapping

294
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,480
based on the movement of the player the

295
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,199
player kind of stomped over it and is

296
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,519
now

297
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,399
uh overlapping it and we would like to

298
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,799
have it

299
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,519
now so that it can get out of that

300
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,599
situation

301
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,320
right we'd like it to move out because

302
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,159
that's the that's the least

303
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
moving out in that direction is the

304
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,519
least amount of motion

305
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,039
to get it unstuck right um so if we look

306
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,240
at the way the collision sector

307
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,199
currently works

308
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
what you can see here

309
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,278
is that it's a pretty straightforward

310
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,759
right you can kind of see

311
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,600
like how we've got it going there's a

312
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,480
pretty straightforward to do here

313
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,519
handle getting uh unembedded that is the

314
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,759
to-do we want to do

315
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,000
uh today and you can kind of see here

316
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,278
the way that the algorithm works uh what

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,879
it does is

318
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,320
for those of you who who haven't watched

319
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,838
the entire collision section

320
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,800
uh series where we're doing it is we

321
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,200
use sort of a voxel model where we say

322
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,479
let's

323
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:15,600
test the squares in a aligned voxel

324
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,759
around where this thing is let's see

325
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,200
if any of the corners of it would allow

326
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,919
it to be placed there

327
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,560
uh and then based on that what we do is

328
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,360
we allow it to move

329
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,639
out of that voxel into a neighboring

330
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,000
voxel

331
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,078
if the corners of the voxel

332
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,600
in that direction would indicate that

333
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,559
that move

334
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
is legal and that's what these four

335
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,199
things are doing here

336
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,800
they test the four directions

337
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,560
that you could move in a voxel that go

338
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,838
towards your target so if you think

339
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,119
about a

340
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,160
voxel cell a voxel cell is a cube

341
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,600
right there are uh

342
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,120
you know depending on you want to look

343
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,759
at it there are eight vertices of the

344
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,639
cube

345
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,958
six faces of the cube if we pick a

346
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,320
direction to go in

347
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:10,799
then there are at most four

348
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,760
different voxel cells you could imagine

349
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,719
going into

350
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,360
in that direction the one that goes out

351
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,800
the

352
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,720
um the three faces so you know let's

353
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,000
suppose our direction is

354
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
you look at the sign of the direction

355
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,078
you get like positive positive negative

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,839
right so positive x direction positive y

357
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,319
direction negative z direction or

358
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
something

359
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,120
is the vector of motion so then we we

360
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
would look at the positive x face the

361
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,039
positive y

362
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
face and the negative z face right we

363
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,519
look at moving into

364
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,919
the cells on those sides and then we

365
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,879
would also take that vertex the vertex

366
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,240
shared

367
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,720
by those faces and try to move into that

368
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,278
now there are other things we could do

369
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
there

370
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,480
uh we could look at more cells

371
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,560
there's a bunch of things we can do but

372
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,519
that seems to be a pretty reliable set

373
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,759
of

374
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,000
choices and then we just take whichever

375
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,799
voxel cell produced the closest point to

376
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,039
the target

377
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,479
and we move into that one now another

378
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,278
thing we could do is consider this more

379
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,200
of a search

380
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,879
and go uh propagate that search out

381
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,720
we're not doing that right now we just

382
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,000
propagate always just to closest you

383
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,399
could think of this sort of

384
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
um as like an a-star search without the

385
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,200
search so just always going to the

386
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,919
closest thing

387
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,240
never backtracking when we then hit uh

388
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,599
the

389
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,360
the end of as far as we can go um

390
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,360
so this might be fine and this might be

391
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,360
all we want but like i said uh so

392
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,039
now and i'm pretty pleased with how it's

393
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,759
working it seems pretty stable and good

394
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,480
to me

395
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,480
uh and when you look at its performance

396
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,920
so far i really have never seen it get

397
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,720
stuck

398
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,000
on something that itself wasn't placed

399
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,040
on top of it and if you can place

400
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,879
something on top of it then obviously

401
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,958
it'll get stuck because like i said

402
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,639
everything at that point is colliding so

403
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,159
it seems pretty robust and good we

404
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,159
haven't done like extensive

405
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,958
uh attempts to validate it yet so you

406
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,000
know don't want to say anything

407
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,958
prematurely but

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,480
it seems pretty good so what we really

409
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,159
want to do now is look at how we would

410
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,519
modify this routine

411
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,439
um because it's written with the

412
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,000
assumption that the

413
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
uh if we did this for example where we

414
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,278
checked

415
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,319
uh collision at the start um we would

416
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,000
it's assuming

417
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,519
a priori that we would not be in a cell

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,519
that was completely embedded

419
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,838
okay now i don't think we really need

420
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,560
this

421
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,000
we don't care about this it's not

422
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,479
relevant

423
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,759
we want to do and this is a little bit

424
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,959
of collision detection philosophy here

425
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,120
collision tech is something i've done

426
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,719
a lot of work on in the past so i have a

427
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
philosophy about it as opposed to things

428
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,759
i don't work on a lot in which case i

429
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,278
don't have a velocity about it

430
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,639
uh in my opinion when you're doing

431
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,320
collision detection work one of the

432
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,560
biggest things that you want to do

433
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,639
to keep them robust is you always want

434
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,958
to test the same thing every frame

435
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,399
so what you really don't want to do is

436
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,599
introduce a lot of things

437
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:05,278
that vary based on the person's position

438
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,720
right the cells uh the cells themselves

439
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,278
want to be aligned

440
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,879
uh to the world so they're consistent

441
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,439
and you typically want to test things on

442
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,240
the cell not the individual things

443
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,440
because the more you can keep things

444
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,639
regular the less

445
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,959
room there is for um

446
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,440
weird error to sneak in based on the

447
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,518
specific locations of things

448
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,800
and so it helps keeps things reversible

449
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,159
in this particular case

450
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,958
because we know we have a game where

451
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,439
we're cold setting the position of stuff

452
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,119
just in game code it's less important

453
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,079
because we know that we'll be getting

454
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,759
those

455
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,198
bad situations because the game code

456
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,399
will just produce them and there's

457
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,319
nothing we can do about that

458
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,958
no matter how precise our clinton code

459
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,360
is but again philosophically speaking

460
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,399
i approach this kind of code usually uh

461
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,560
by saying

462
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,000
i feel like my life will be easier if in

463
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,159
general i minimize the

464
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,519
number of things that can be different

465
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,360
from frame to frame

466
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,039
and using a coherent testing methodology

467
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,959
where the points that get tested are the

468
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,919
same all the time

469
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,479
can help with that a little bit right so

470
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,958
anyway

471
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
um so i'm going to get rid of this uh

472
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,278
because that's what we're working on now

473
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,278
and i don't want to do this things what

474
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,600
i'd like to do is focus more on this

475
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:20,240
scenario so

476
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,079
one thing that i would like to observe

477
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,919
about this code as it exists

478
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,319
at the immediate moment is if you take a

479
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,278
look at how the voxel occupation code

480
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,519
works here

481
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,039
where we compute the occupiers for a

482
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,320
voxel um

483
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:37,519
what you can see is because you are only

484
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,160
allowed to move out of a voxel

485
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,320
if the occupation criteria for that

486
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,759
voxel says that you can

487
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,120
it means that that like um i i would i

488
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,240
would argue

489
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,519
that therefore

490
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,519
there should be no way for us to be in

491
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:00,399
a voxel where we are not

492
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,078
colliding on some of the points and then

493
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,480
we move to a voxel

494
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,480
where we are colliding on all the points

495
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,199
the reason for that is because each

496
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,000
voxel

497
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,360
shares at least one point with all

498
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,359
neighboring voxels

499
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,599
right in the case of moving through a

500
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,198
face we know that we share four points

501
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,038
in the case of moving through a vertex

502
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,240
we knew that we share one point

503
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,400
so if we are in a voxel and we look in a

504
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,959
direction and we say there are points

505
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,839
that are

506
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,080
occupiable in that direction we know

507
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:33,038
that then the voxel that we move to

508
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,519
cannot have all eight points occupied if

509
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,400
it

510
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,160
could then that means one of the we

511
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,798
shouldn't have seen any unoccupied

512
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,080
points

513
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:44,798
on that face right

514
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,119
so to me that means that we have a sort

515
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,160
of

516
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,599
nice ancillary thing here uh which is

517
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,960
that if we take a look

518
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:55,918
at these um

519
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,880
results here so this this occupied stuff

520
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,720
and i'm gonna write this in the

521
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,720
sloppiest possible way we could just be

522
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,558
summing these with a counter

523
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,558
for example and avoid all of these but

524
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,558
we're we're not even a little bit

525
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,319
concerned uh with the performance of

526
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:12,079
this routine right now

527
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:14,798
um at all this this is not a

528
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:17,119
performance oriented uh piece of code

529
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:22,720
yet we're literally just doing it

530
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,719
um just just for correctness first

531
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,000
like so uh and so all i'm gonna do here

532
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,639
is

533
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,079
say uh that there's a embedded and i

534
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,759
look and i see

535
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,439
look um oops that's not an or

536
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,240
that's supposed to be an and wrong

537
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,279
boolean operator

538
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,558
um so i'm just trying to see look

539
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:49,440
if all of the points of this voxel

540
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,759
are all occupied then that means that i

541
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,960
have

542
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:56,000
embedded this object that i'm looking at

543
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,880
is completely embedded right it

544
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,880
can't get out

545
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,160
and so what i'd like to do here

546
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:14,880
is i'd like to have some way

547
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,880
of determining emotion

548
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,439
that i can do um and you can see here is

549
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,759
essentially what i'm doing is i'm saying

550
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,798
hey i'm gonna determine whether i'm

551
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,679
embedded

552
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,960
if i'm these are in the wrong side of

553
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,640
the branch

554
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:37,038
there we go a bit of slow morning

555
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:40,160
there you go if i'm not embedded

556
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,160
then this is probably okay and the

557
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,080
reason that this is probably okay

558
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,400
is because if i'm not embedded then i'm

559
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,639
by definition not stuck in anything

560
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,400
so i should just do my regular series of

561
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,000
moves because if i can't do them that

562
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,919
just means that the player or whoever

563
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,519
is controlling the motion subject is

564
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,679
trying to push through

565
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,200
something that they're not allowed to go

566
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,640
through and i should

567
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,480
just not let them right

568
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
meaning either this will succeed and the

569
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,679
object will move somewhere or

570
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,119
it will fail and that's what should have

571
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,679
happened because

572
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,119
the only valid movement is behind is in

573
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,840
the opposite direction from where it's

574
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,119
looking

575
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,558
and therefore we should prevent it

576
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,599
because it's trying to push through a

577
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,200
solid object

578
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,359
and that's not allowed right so we want

579
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,720
this to happen any time we started off

580
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,199
in a place where there was

581
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,079
where there were uh unoccupied vertices

582
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,319
of the voxel

583
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,240
but in the case where all of the

584
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,798
vertices were occupied we know that

585
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,159
we've

586
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,480
effectively gotten ourselves into a

587
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,280
situation where we're embedded

588
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,440
in another object so what we need now is

589
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,639
a solution to this problem

590
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,120
we need a way of moving from this voxel

591
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,720
to another voxel that doesn't have

592
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,678
that um uh

593
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,200
what's the word i'm looking for that

594
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,200
doesn't have that problem

595
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,240
okay so

596
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,639
couple things about this

597
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:21,839
obviously there are limits to what this

598
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,839
probably should or could correct

599
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:32,319
and we have to think a little bit

600
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,319
about how forgiving we want this to be

601
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,759
we could make it extraordinarily

602
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,279
forgiving

603
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,440
which says that if you're embedded in

604
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,079
something you can just go wherever you

605
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,440
want

606
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,439
right um and for example

607
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:55,759
um just to

608
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,759
to give you some

609
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,839
perspective on what that would look like

610
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,480
i could literally just say if you're

611
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,679
embedded you get free motion and then

612
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,000
i'm going to tell you why i don't want

613
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,519
to do

614
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,919
that um but obviously that's one

615
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,798
quote-unquote solution to this problem

616
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,159
now remember

617
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,079
i held the game open here it's still

618
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,080
running we're in this kind of

619
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,519
state here right and now i'm going to

620
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,639
compile it

621
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,359
and then we're going to so it's going to

622
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,320
reload in the middle of the code here

623
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,839
i don't know why there's a breakpoint

624
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,480
set there but there was

625
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,839
and now what you can see is i'm unstuck

626
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,360
right

627
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,678
and that's exactly what expected because

628
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,000
now it's allowed to move

629
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,759
out of there um and i'm pretty sure that

630
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
this would just work i don't think that

631
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,558
was a

632
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,919
very complicated scheme there but you

633
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,639
can see uh

634
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,200
like pretty much now any time this thing

635
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
got stuck

636
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,240
in the middle of something it will just

637
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,120
get unstuck probably just did it just

638
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,159
then

639
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,319
for example and so on right now the

640
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,080
reason i don't really want to do that

641
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,599
is because i believe this would create a

642
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,798
little bit too much opportunity for

643
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,158
speedrunners

644
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:12,400
again because we know we have this

645
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,840
sort of scenario of there's these things

646
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,240
like the player's head

647
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,119
that gets moved at or like these things

648
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,919
right

649
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,519
that get moved programmatically that

650
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,440
aren't subject to physics

651
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,679
they're literally they hop from square

652
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,240
to square with gameplay logic

653
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,919
that's required sort of a hybrid we have

654
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,440
a hybrid engine right

655
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,200
some of things want to be on on a

656
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,120
mandatory game logic it has to go from

657
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,960
here to here it's required we check

658
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,278
occupancy we only allow one thing per

659
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,519
square for gameplay rule reasons

660
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,558
um kind of not that dissimilar from john

661
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,319
sokoban game

662
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,000
right there's a transactional move

663
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,960
system underlying this game that

664
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,679
means that things that aren't projectile

665
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,679
or floaty

666
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,678
they move with a rigorous game logic

667
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:01,359
that cannot be

668
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,360
broken it has to go the way it goes

669
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,798
but floaty things like the glove it's a

670
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,879
hybrid because they are

671
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,200
built on a physics thing and they can

672
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,278
physics themselves around

673
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,880
but we could change that right i mean

674
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,119
another thing we could do is say

675
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,880
no let's not do that and let's actually

676
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,678
make these things transactionally occupy

677
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,360
squares

678
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,360
you know that's probably smarter

679
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,558
who knows um but we don't do things

680
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,799
smart here on handmade hero we do things

681
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,558
just to have an excuse to do different

682
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,200
kinds of programming so people can see

683
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,798
how to do it right uh and so that's what

684
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,400
we did and you can see like

685
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:41,918
you can see how cool this collision

686
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,000
detection system is

687
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,679
it's so darn good right it just hugs the

688
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
wall that whole way it does like look at

689
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,200
how

690
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,038
smooth that is very good um so pleased

691
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,960
with it's such a small simple routine

692
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,240
you saw how simple that routine was

693
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,519
produces excellent results um

694
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,839
really very happy with it anyway um so

695
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,440
when we uh look at this what i was

696
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,399
thinking is like you know it suppose i

697
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,120
do that

698
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,919
um now the collision system knows that

699
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,639
it has

700
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,080
like effectively two uh pieces and and i

701
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,440
guess i didn't do a very good job here

702
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,399
so it kind of snuck underneath so it

703
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,960
didn't happen

704
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,000
but i feel like it wouldn't be that hard

705
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,159
for me to push the glove into the wall

706
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,759
um especially let you know using

707
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,720
something else and the speedrunners will

708
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,519
find anything

709
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,480
right i mean they'll find everything i

710
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,798
feel like there should

711
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,558
there's yeah like that right so did you

712
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:33,519
see how i kind of was able to push that

713
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:35,440
into the wall

714
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,839
and it's because it was up high and then

715
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,798
it the the blocker pushes it into the

716
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,519
wall

717
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,960
um and now it's embedded in the wall and

718
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,639
once it's embedded in the wall

719
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,159
because my rule is if you're embedded in

720
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,278
the wall you can do whatever you want

721
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,400
you can see i can just move straight

722
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,000
through the wall now right um

723
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,038
if i rerun the game because it's hard to

724
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,240
see with the camera in there because

725
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,079
there's stuff in the front

726
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,000
if i rerun the game and so you can see

727
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,079
it in there to see see what i've done

728
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,278
now the the glove gets to move all

729
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,599
through that region

730
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,400
again not a bug it's literally what i

731
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,319
told it

732
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,640
it was supposed to be able to do when it

733
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,599
was embedded so you can kind of see why

734
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,960
i don't

735
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:16,158
want that specifically

736
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,120
and the reason that i don't want that is

737
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,559
because

738
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,519
i don't like the idea of speedrunners

739
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,720
having quite

740
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,918
that much ability uh to screw with the

741
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,440
game's collision rules

742
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,759
right because at that point they can do

743
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,200
all sorts of like intentionally embed

744
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,319
something into a wall

745
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,558
because they know that the collision

746
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,038
detection will be forgiving and then

747
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,918
they'll

748
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,278
use that right and you know a part of me

749
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,120
just says like just do that anyway

750
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,000
because speed running is cool and you

751
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,158
want to give

752
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,440
speedrunners a bunch of cool things to

753
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,200
do because it's just cool

754
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,440
right so believe me i'm sympathetic to

755
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,240
uh the idea that maybe we should just do

756
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,278
it that way

757
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,240
but um on the other hand i'm like it's

758
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,519
just it's a little

759
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,038
too much i feel like we sh yes

760
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:05,759
give them some things to work with but

761
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,519
that's a little too much in my book so

762
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,919
that just i'm not comfortable

763
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,558
with that level of a gimme to

764
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,559
speedrunners

765
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:24,558
so what i want to do instead

766
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,359
is i want to do something where if we're

767
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,240
embedded

768
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,079
we create for example maybe a new motion

769
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,960
vector

770
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,480
and that motion vector is based on some

771
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,000
kind of displacement

772
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,000
uh that would try to get things

773
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,519
unembedded

774
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
uh in a way that we hope will be

775
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,839
reasonable there's a

776
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,880
bunch of risk involved in doing it this

777
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,839
way to be sure

778
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,799
but i want to give it a try so let me

779
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,879
motivate this

780
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:51,918
um for you a little bit just you can

781
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,320
kind of have

782
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,159
a little bit of an idea about what i'm

783
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,759
talking about so

784
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:02,159
if you uh take a look at how this is uh

785
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,240
working here you can see that you know

786
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,200
what we're expect what we're

787
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,319
what we're planning on doing here uh is

788
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,360
we're detecting

789
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:14,319
embedded by saying here's the eight

790
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,119
vertices of the voxel cell uh that the

791
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,759
player

792
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,359
currently finds themselves in we know

793
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,119
that they're all occupied so we know

794
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,639
that in order to move the player or

795
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,278
shouldn't say player the entity like the

796
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,720
glove in this case will have to

797
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:32,398
go in some direction that is clearly not

798
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,880
indicated by its occupied

799
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,959
status but allowing it to move in

800
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,440
whatever direction it wants to move

801
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,240
is probably too permissive what we'd

802
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,840
rather do

803
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:48,399
is only allow it to move in a direction

804
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,398
that would get it less embedded

805
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:56,558
right like we want to

806
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,558
we want to produce

807
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:04,719
a some idea

808
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:09,119
of the direction of motion

809
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:12,558
that is moving out of the embedded

810
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:15,759
of the embedding that this

811
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:20,158
um that this entity has

812
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,158
has found itself in right

813
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:23,359
now the most straightforward way to do

814
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,079
this uh

815
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,599
would be if we were to take the position

816
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,918
of the entity

817
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,639
and try to come up with a unembedding

818
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,960
direction

819
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,960
from there and

820
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,959
the reason i don't want to do that is

821
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,520
because

822
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,240
since we're we're basing our decision

823
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:51,679
about whether or not you can move

824
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,359
on vertices of a voxel if i then

825
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,360
say well we're going to base our

826
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,158
direction of how you get unembedded

827
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,719
based on your actual position we run the

828
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,200
risk of your actual position

829
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,798
not colliding whereas the vertices of

830
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,480
the voxel do collide

831
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,359
right and i realize that that's kind of

832
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,200
a bit weird

833
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,639
uh because you know in theory you'd be

834
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,360
like well wait how the heck could that

835
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,880
happen

836
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,719
right but numerical precision wise it

837
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,278
certainly could if you imagine the voxel

838
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,319
cell

839
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:25,119
maybe you can stand just like

840
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,319
all of the colliders are just such that

841
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,319
if you were to stand on

842
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,519
any of the vertices of the cell you

843
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,359
would be intersecting

844
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,440
the ones on like the left side or the

845
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,798
right side if you sit on the the left

846
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,240
side you'll attack the left side ones

847
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:37,599
the right side right sides but right in

848
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,679
the middle

849
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,639
you could actually stand there and the

850
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,038
player

851
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,000
or the entity happens to be right in the

852
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,200
middle

853
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,558
right so i one of the things that's a

854
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,240
little annoying about this

855
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,398
is i would like to be able to just test

856
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,079
one position but i really can't quite

857
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,278
do that um because in order to do that i

858
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,000
would actually need

859
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:01,919
to know that they were themselves

860
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,480
embedded which they might not be

861
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,519
so i need the check i need to be able to

862
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,079
to produce

863
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,679
a motion vector that gets me that hopes

864
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,759
to get me unembedded

865
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,759
based on on something else

866
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:19,839
now

867
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,360
the easiest way to do this is just to

868
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:34,798
produce that motion vector

869
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:34,798
for each of the voxel positions

870
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,919
and

871
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:50,959
if i did that and then i just kind of

872
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,720
use i could i could try linearly

873
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,289
interpolate it

874
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,380
um

875
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:56,379
[Music]

876
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,839
i could just use the average of it

877
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,839
um i mean really the only

878
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,080
there's all sorts of things most of them

879
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,158
will just work fine

880
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,519
except for the fact that they probably

881
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,840
all

882
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,200
have some bad case where you could

883
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,199
imagine

884
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,640
them not producing a vector that will

885
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,840
actually get you unstuck very

886
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,080
effectively

887
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,079
right

888
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:29,839
so

889
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,119
i can't say that there's anything that

890
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,840
i'm

891
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:49,839
coming up with magical here in my head

892
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,839
it just kind of seems like probably

893
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,798
i mean i'm tempted to just wing it and

894
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,960
say look we'll do one of those and we'll

895
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,918
see how bad it is

896
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,640
um i don't know how rigorous we want to

897
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,720
be

898
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,799
about this particular thing like i don't

899
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,759
know how much validation we want to try

900
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,679
and do here and say

901
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,640
how bad of situation should this thing

902
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,120
be able to recover from

903
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,880
and i don't know you know i don't know

904
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:20,558
the answer to that question

905
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,600
uh but either way i'm pretty sure that

906
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:23,759
i'm gonna want

907
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,359
i i'm pretty sure i know what i'm going

908
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,599
to want here

909
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:27,599
um

910
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,038
in terms of sort of like basic routines

911
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:34,319
anyway

912
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,319
so i think i'm just going to go ahead

913
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,119
and write those and then we'll see

914
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,798
so if you look at like collides at p for

915
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,678
example

916
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,119
um really what i want to do is modify

917
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,159
this collides at p

918
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,719
function to produce more than just

919
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,840
the fact that it collided or not and

920
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,839
what i want to do

921
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,120
uh is produce sort of a

922
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,639
a repulsion field if you will right

923
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,919
so when i'm looking at collision

924
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,679
anything that

925
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,039
this collides with i want it to produce

926
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,639
a repulsion field

927
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,079
that basically says look we're going to

928
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,320
push you away

929
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,760
from this thing if you're embedded in in

930
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,440
it right

931
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,800
and then maybe i even want that

932
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,559
repulsion field

933
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,280
this is hard to say but maybe i even

934
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:32,639
want that repulsion field

935
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,119
to reflect

936
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,919
how far embedded into something you are

937
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,000
so

938
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,279
if you get more embedded into something

939
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,639
it tries to push you

940
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,359
out of it harder than if you were less

941
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,358
embedded in it

942
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:49,838
and

943
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,799
the reason that i'm a saying that

944
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:57,838
is not because the actual code on the

945
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,880
outside

946
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,400
will push you any harder because it's

947
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,079
literally just talking about a move from

948
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,559
a voxel to a neighboring voxel so it's

949
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,440
not

950
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,440
trying to push you with any particular

951
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,280
amount of force

952
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,559
high or low it's just a basic movement

953
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,560
it's not affecting your velocity it's

954
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:20,000
not affecting anything

955
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:22,400
however what i'm actually

956
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,679
talking about when i talk about that

957
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,000
amount of push

958
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,358
what i mean is that we are going to be

959
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,239
looking at

960
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,440
situations where because any time that

961
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,039
you are embedded in something

962
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,039
you don't have to just be embedded in

963
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,719
one thing

964
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,199
for a very simple example if i go back

965
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:42,559
to the game here

966
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:44,000
and you look at some uh place let's say

967
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,078
that you embedded yourself

968
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,599
right in this area right here well

969
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,960
there's one two three

970
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,079
four at the very minimum there's four

971
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,320
separate like colliders that you could

972
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,920
have

973
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,800
embedded into right and so if you

974
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,000
embedded

975
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,000
very far into these two

976
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,320
but not very far into these two so

977
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,679
pretty far to the left but not very far

978
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,559
down right then you may want the

979
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,358
resulting

980
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:16,799
push like the direction that your that

981
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:20,639
the thing is saying you should go in

982
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,839
you may want that to reflect

983
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,799
a more rightward push and a less

984
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,199
upward push just so the outer routine

985
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,280
knows

986
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,358
it's trying to get things further to the

987
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,200
right than it is trying to get them

988
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:38,400
up right so it's more about producing

989
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,598
a vector that captures the direction

990
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,039
we're trying to go

991
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,200
to disembed things um so

992
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,400
it's more about that and not so much

993
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,639
about how

994
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,519
hard the outer routine will actually try

995
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,838
to move you

996
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:55,119
because it's not really about that at

997
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:57,440
all right

998
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,440
um

999
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,598
and again i really just don't have a

1000
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:15,118
strong opinion about that

1001
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,880
uh off the bat i'm not sure i can really

1002
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,200
think of much um that's important there

1003
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,800
so it's just a little bit hard

1004
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:27,439
to really consider so i don't know yet

1005
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,720
but anyway i am probably going to do um

1006
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,480
a little struct here

1007
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:32,480
that we're going to say like uh

1008
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,280
i'm going to call this a collision field

1009
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,838
maybe

1010
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,320
um and for right now i'm just gonna do

1011
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,119
like

1012
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,559
an occupied flag like we had before

1013
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,640
meaning the point is

1014
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:51,920
um and then i'm gonna put a v3 in here

1015
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,039
that's also uh a product of the

1016
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,200
collision detection

1017
00:37:53,039 --> 00:38:00,400
that just says like the uh

1018
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,919
repulsion right uh

1019
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,559
so this is basically just a vector that

1020
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,800
points in that direction so what i want

1021
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,559
to do is take collides at p

1022
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,359
and i want it to produce one of these

1023
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:15,759
collision fields so the result now

1024
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:18,480
um is going to be

1025
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,400
about occupation in this way uh we're

1026
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,679
going to remove this break statement

1027
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,680
here

1028
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,879
because we now need to do some summing

1029
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:29,679
up of

1030
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,039
the uh of the occupied colliders

1031
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,279
but otherwise that's all we're going to

1032
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,639
do and then here what i'm going to do

1033
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,359
is take this

1034
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,960
code that was previously calling it and

1035
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,440
i'm just going to reduce it to just

1036
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,559
doing

1037
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,559
exactly what it was doing before by

1038
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:49,679
pulling out only the occupied

1039
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,320
field which means now we should run the

1040
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,719
game

1041
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,000
uh and get identical behavior to what we

1042
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,078
were getting before

1043
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
with no changes because the code is the

1044
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,599
same i can still push into that wall

1045
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,039
just fine

1046
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,519
and so on then what i want to do is say

1047
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:08,000
okay

1048
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:11,440
when we get this embedded situation here

1049
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,480
and then we we see that we are embedded

1050
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,599
what i want to do is i want to change

1051
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,199
and you can see uh out here we we set up

1052
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,200
these best things here right

1053
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,199
distance squared and all that stuff

1054
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:32,719
right

1055
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:36,000
so what i'd like to do is say well maybe

1056
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:43,838
i'm going to go back here uh and

1057
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,838
i'm going to take this well

1058
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,479
i'm not quite sure yet so let me hold

1059
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,480
off on that thought

1060
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,039
so what i want to do here is say like

1061
00:39:54,639 --> 00:40:00,639
okay if i was embedded

1062
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:03,920
uh and i want to turn this stuff on

1063
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:06,078
uh what i might do is just say okay i'm

1064
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,039
going to clear out the occupied stuff so

1065
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,000
that you can move

1066
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,719
in a direction but maybe then i'm also

1067
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,760
going to

1068
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:17,919
clip the motion direction to

1069
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:22,720
have to go in the same direction

1070
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,720
as the uh repulsion field

1071
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,210
right so

1072
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,420
i

1073
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,420
[Music]

1074
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,119
this is i feel like it's not worth me

1075
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,200
going over to the light board just for

1076
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:43,200
this but this is a very like

1077
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:47,279
diagrammatical sort of thing

1078
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:50,639
um so i have two vectors

1079
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:54,800
one of them is the motion vector

1080
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:58,639
that says i want to go from here to here

1081
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:02,480
uh and you can see that that's just um

1082
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:04,078
you know a from p2p thing where i say

1083
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,639
this is the entity position

1084
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:11,039
and i want to go to this um

1085
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,759
i want to go this displacement so then i

1086
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,279
end up

1087
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:21,839
with this new target is you know

1088
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,839
is that that displacement right

1089
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,559
so that's pretty easy to understand but

1090
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,358
what we're doing here

1091
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:33,199
is we're saying okay if we end up in a

1092
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,440
situation where we start off embedded

1093
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,279
which is what's going to happen here

1094
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,599
and this can pretty much this pretty

1095
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,920
much only is ever going to happen

1096
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,800
continuously or not at all meaning

1097
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,880
either we're going to start

1098
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,800
embedded and then we may have some

1099
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,599
series of cells we traverse where we're

1100
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,920
embedded

1101
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,519
or we start unembedded and we will never

1102
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,800
traverse an embedded cell

1103
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,440
because we wouldn't be able to move into

1104
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,839
it in the first place right

1105
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,599
so we know we start off with with this

1106
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,920
being something that only happens

1107
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,200
from the very first cell and then may

1108
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,119
continue onward

1109
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,199
but we know it's never gonna happen like

1110
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,920
in the middle of a series of cells like

1111
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:10,799
we're never gonna

1112
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,240
be like unembedded unembedded embedded

1113
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,000
unembedded embedded right

1114
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,519
it's either a series of embeddeds and

1115
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,358
then unembedded or

1116
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,119
a series of unembedded that's all we've

1117
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,880
got uh

1118
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,400
if something else happened then the

1119
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,280
routine's gone haywire and we need to

1120
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,760
debug it right

1121
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,640
so we know that in normal operation with

1122
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,400
no bugs

1123
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:32,639
that will not happen so

1124
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,119
um what we need to do here is say look

1125
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:37,920
if the if the thing was embedded

1126
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,680
then we know that that uh 2p so the

1127
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,318
place that we're trying to move

1128
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,639
we need that to be adjusted right we

1129
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,358
need to adjust the the

1130
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,199
place that we're going to to say we're

1131
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,480
allowing you to do

1132
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,279
motion in embedded space we will not

1133
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,240
allow you

1134
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,440
to go hog wild we are only going to

1135
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,598
allow you to move it

1136
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,720
in the direction that would make it most

1137
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,838
closely resemble

1138
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,679
an a a removal motion an unembedding

1139
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:09,440
motion

1140
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:12,719
right uh and so in order to do that

1141
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,159
uh we would need to say look

1142
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:19,358
the uh we know that the

1143
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:22,559
movement right so this

1144
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:27,838
best 2p here um we know

1145
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,838
that the movement which

1146
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,000
i want to say we don't yeah we don't

1147
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:35,838
really care

1148
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,639
so when this happens

1149
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:39,519
we know that we have our uh from

1150
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,879
direction

1151
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:45,920
right and we now want to take

1152
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,800
and uh apply that delta to it we want

1153
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,838
that delta

1154
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,440
to now be effectively clipped

1155
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:56,400
like we want to clip that delta

1156
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,119
so that any motion that isn't in the

1157
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,559
same

1158
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:04,160
uh direction that that would go

1159
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:09,838
against the direction of unembedding

1160
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,838
is removed and

1161
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:20,318
i mean i guess another way to think

1162
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,079
about this would be do we want to

1163
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,279
just force it to go in the unembedded

1164
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,640
direction even if that's not the

1165
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,640
direction it was trying to go

1166
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:37,838
and that's a good question

1167
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:51,920
you

1168
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,800
that's a good question and i don't know

1169
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,079
the answer to that question because

1170
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,599
there's a lot of different ways that we

1171
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,680
could play this and i'm not sure which

1172
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,480
one is the smart way

1173
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,039
right like one way to play this is that

1174
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,639
we just

1175
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,440
i mean there's so many ways to replace

1176
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:25,598
we could actually not update 2p at all

1177
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,599
and just update the occupied

1178
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:33,838
stuff in that in that direction

1179
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,960
i might try that first it's a really

1180
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,318
tough call

1181
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:48,159
and i'm not sure i really don't know

1182
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:50,800
um but like so this

1183
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,920
basically is what i'm talking about um

1184
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,920
we would we would say

1185
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,440
okay so like if you're embedded in

1186
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,519
something

1187
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,800
um then what we're gonna do is we're

1188
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,719
gonna create uh

1189
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:07,119
some side values here for uh

1190
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:07,118
an unembed direction

1191
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:14,318
right um and then what we're going to do

1192
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,920
is we're going to take and set that

1193
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:17,559
vertex

1194
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,280
right um

1195
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:21,920
[Music]

1196
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,560
so that you can move in that direction

1197
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,358
um

1198
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,400
and and maybe we could even do like

1199
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:29,838
right

1200
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,880
so we would say okay uh

1201
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:32,880
whatever side

1202
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:37,279
x we're on um

1203
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:44,879
this kind of thing you know what i'm

1204
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:47,039
saying

1205
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,160
so we're gonna allow you to move out the

1206
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,400
unembed direction

1207
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:54,480
there uh maybe we allow you to move out

1208
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,119
of the face

1209
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,480
um we could take the strongest face and

1210
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,960
allow you to move out of that

1211
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,960
in fact

1212
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:09,519
that may be the best

1213
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,800
right like like i don't know we have to

1214
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:12,880
sort of think about how we would want to

1215
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:17,039
code this efficiently

1216
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:19,920
but you can imagine like um

1217
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:22,639
you know if unbed x is greater than

1218
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,639
unembed y

1219
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:25,838
um

1220
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,200
you know we're just basically picking

1221
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:43,200
the the direction that's strongest

1222
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,159
you know what i mean um and then we

1223
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,279
could just say

1224
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:53,838
that will set we'll set these up

1225
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,839
in one in a specific way

1226
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:09,599
uh

1227
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,599
so something like this

1228
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,159
and so you can see it's like okay if x

1229
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,079
is greater than y and x is greater than

1230
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,719
z then x is the face direction we're

1231
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,160
going to move

1232
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:24,000
um out of right and so

1233
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:26,159
we would in here i guess we still need

1234
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,358
that side one but we so so here we would

1235
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:35,838
just say like whatever the side x is

1236
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:35,838
we use and then everything else is just

1237
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:38,960
set right

1238
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:46,078
um similarly here if we have

1239
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,078
a um

1240
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,838
if we have x is greater than y

1241
00:48:50,719 --> 00:49:03,838
uh but x is not greater than z

1242
00:48:53,838 --> 00:49:03,838
then that means this would be the z side

1243
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:14,639
and then finally we have the exact same

1244
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,440
case over here so if this is not true

1245
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:17,759
then that means

1246
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,079
y is greater i don't know why this is

1247
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,200
set up this way

1248
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:25,200
um so if y is greater than z then

1249
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,239
we do the side y one and if it's not

1250
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,318
then that means

1251
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:29,439
z is the greater so it's it's really

1252
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:31,759
just this case again

1253
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,240
right there's only three possible cases

1254
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,960
we just can arrive at that same case

1255
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:39,439
in two different ways um so this one's

1256
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,440
the side y

1257
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:48,480
case

1258
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:52,160
and that's mostly what we want

1259
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:59,838
right so if we assume that this happens

1260
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:59,838
as well

1261
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,519
where we just take a unembed

1262
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:16,800
direction and we produce the side

1263
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,799
for that uh and then we clear it

1264
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,119
and again we we're gonna probably

1265
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:22,480
eventually need to think oops size

1266
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,559
that's good

1267
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,838
we're gonna need to think about how we

1268
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,119
wanna do this maximally efficiently

1269
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:28,480
because like a lot of this code is you

1270
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,838
know just i'm just kind of

1271
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:34,800
sketching it out just doing it directly

1272
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:37,039
um and i think that's roughly what we

1273
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:40,160
want

1274
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:43,679
minus the spelling errors

1275
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:46,799
right um so now all we need to do is

1276
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,399
actually produce that unembed value and

1277
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,000
the unembed value

1278
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,680
uh in this case i will probably just

1279
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,358
take as a sum

1280
00:50:53,679 --> 00:51:00,960
so i'll probably just do unembed d here

1281
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,239
uh i'll sum it up so at each one of

1282
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,280
these things

1283
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:09,838
we'll take the collision field and we'll

1284
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,839
actually record it

1285
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:18,639
uh and then what i'll do is if the field

1286
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,838
oops we actually want that uh if the

1287
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:22,879
field is occupied

1288
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:24,159
then i will take the unembed d and we

1289
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,358
will add

1290
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:31,358
uh to it and

1291
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,440
there are sort of two ways we could do

1292
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:37,838
this i think what i'd like to do

1293
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,838
is like embed count equals zero

1294
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,119
so i'll count how many times i'm

1295
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,160
embedded here

1296
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:47,200
i'll take the unembed d and i'll do the

1297
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,719
uh repulsion fields addition here and

1298
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,759
then when i'm at the end

1299
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:54,959
embedded now will just be in bed count

1300
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,319
um if the embed count equals eight then

1301
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,119
you know they're all embedded we don't

1302
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,079
need

1303
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,800
uh to study that any further so this can

1304
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,119
just be

1305
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:08,160
directly placed in here um and then

1306
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:11,440
what we do is for the unembed d

1307
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:14,719
we know that at that point we need to

1308
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:19,838
normalize it so it's it's had

1309
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,838
eight things added to it or

1310
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,279
well i guess so to be honest we really

1311
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,358
don't need that i mean we know that we

1312
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,960
only use it in that one

1313
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:37,119
case so actually we can just do

1314
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,720
this which is probably better

1315
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,519
because then it's not anything

1316
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:41,519
conditional

1317
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:47,838
uh

1318
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:54,480
hmm

1319
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:03,679
all right well anyway

1320
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,679
so uh

1321
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,400
point is hey we're only going to use

1322
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,400
this if all eight were in so that means

1323
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,358
we know we can just take the average by

1324
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,920
doing

1325
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:15,519
one over eight times the value when we

1326
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,400
accumulate it and then it's just

1327
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:19,358
known to be correct right it's just

1328
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,720
right

1329
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:24,558
just right at the time so at that point

1330
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:28,480
our main problem now

1331
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:30,559
other than maybe logical errors we made

1332
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,559
in typing in that code

1333
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,000
uh is that we don't actually set it so

1334
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,839
it's always going to be zero

1335
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,280
right which means that

1336
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,759
it'll just kind of let you move out of a

1337
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,200
random one of the faces

1338
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,000
right it's not really going to give any

1339
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:46,000
actual information

1340
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:52,159
it's going to be i don't remember how we

1341
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,160
wrote these ifs exactly but it's going

1342
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:56,318
to be

1343
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:57,519
all of these are going to be false so

1344
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:59,759
it's going to be false

1345
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:03,119
false so it's basically going to say

1346
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,119
look you can move

1347
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:13,199
um out of the out of the z

1348
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,079
positive face so you can move upwards it

1349
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:17,679
will always let you move upwards only

1350
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,519
um and then we also have to remove the

1351
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:21,679
else claws because now

1352
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,199
we're we're always going to still do the

1353
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,919
movement

1354
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,639
so all we're doing is reconditioning the

1355
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,079
occupy

1356
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:32,558
the occupied uh checks to to prevent

1357
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,760
uh you from going in a direction that

1358
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,760
you wouldn't already be able to go but

1359
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,599
that's the only thing we're changing

1360
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,960
so if we run the code now it should

1361
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,240
still work

1362
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:45,440
um and it should allow you to get

1363
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:47,519
unembedded in the upward direction right

1364
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,200
um and so what that means is if i embed

1365
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:50,798
this in the wall like before

1366
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:52,558
i wouldn't have expected it to do what

1367
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,798
it just did oh

1368
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,839
but no it kind of does notice it allows

1369
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:57,759
you to move

1370
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,400
in the upward cell it looks like that's

1371
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,640
sort of what it did

1372
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,680
hard to say though so that may not be

1373
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:07,838
quite correct

1374
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,838
let me see if i can get a better

1375
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,119
so you know what that is correct based

1376
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,000
on what i wrote okay so that's a good

1377
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,640
piece of information

1378
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,719
i hadn't thought of so if we do this

1379
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:26,639
conditioning

1380
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,879
that means that you could still move

1381
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:30,480
like laterally because if you

1382
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,160
right you would still be able to move

1383
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,119
laterally if you always consider those

1384
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,440
cells were out

1385
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:39,280
so i do think this this is a dumb idea

1386
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,559
this won't we do need to do the thing i

1387
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,519
said originally which is

1388
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,519
condition the target vector um

1389
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:50,000
i think we do have to condition the

1390
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:52,000
target vector so we we have to adjust it

1391
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,280
so that it's pointing in the direction

1392
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,798
of unembedding

1393
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,440
i think that's pretty much what we have

1394
00:55:54,798 --> 00:56:00,000
to do uh so i'm going to change

1395
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,200
i'm not going to do that like i said

1396
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,880
from before

1397
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,519
uh not gonna do that what i'm gonna do

1398
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,519
instead ignoring this

1399
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,838
so that was a good piece of information

1400
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:09,838
right

1401
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,838
um

1402
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:25,839
so i'm gonna take this uh

1403
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:27,598
embed count here and i'm going to say if

1404
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:29,039
it equals eight then we're going to do

1405
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,838
the full wash

1406
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:31,838
right

1407
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:47,838
like so uh and that should be fine

1408
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,119
so now you can move in all directions

1409
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:52,159
and what we need to do

1410
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,039
now is say okay and when you get in this

1411
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,078
state

1412
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,519
we are going to require that the place

1413
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,640
that you move to

1414
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:03,119
is going to have to be the unembed

1415
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:03,118
direction

1416
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,480
period right so you have to move in that

1417
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,839
direction

1418
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,760
and you don't get any choice in the

1419
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:16,558
matter um and we may say that okay

1420
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,960
uh we have a certain amount of distance

1421
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,720
here

1422
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,240
because i don't know like what we

1423
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,480
actually want that to be

1424
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:23,519
uh but we're gonna say that like for now

1425
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,159
we're just gonna say

1426
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:28,079
it's it's you're trying to move one unit

1427
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:30,078
in that direction

1428
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,760
right like like that's that's where

1429
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,880
you're trying to get to

1430
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,079
um and what we probably want to do is we

1431
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,119
want to say

1432
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,519
uh as soon as you get to

1433
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,119
a place where you're out again we would

1434
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:47,358
stop doing that

1435
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,358
now this is not um

1436
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:52,480
it's a little bit hard because i'm not

1437
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:55,838
sure

1438
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:08,480
i mean so i'm guessing i probably want

1439
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:10,798
to do this

1440
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,798
right

1441
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,519
so try to get the person unembedded for

1442
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,119
a while

1443
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:21,039
um and if if we do ever succeed in

1444
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,318
getting unembedded then we revert back

1445
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:26,079
to trying to get

1446
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:29,440
towards the actual goal right

1447
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:31,760
i could i could believe that okay so

1448
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,559
this should do some weird stuff

1449
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,200
currently

1450
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,559
because it's always going to hap well no

1451
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:37,358
so this will just freeze things in their

1452
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,798
tracks because

1453
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:42,078
that vector is zero right so things

1454
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:44,400
should not be able to move

1455
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,880
once they get embedded in something if

1456
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,920
they get significantly embedded

1457
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,119
they presumably couldn't move although

1458
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,680
weirdly enough

1459
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:56,880
that does so that's a little surprising

1460
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:56,879
how is that able to move

1461
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,838
so you would think did i mess something

1462
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,838
up you would think

1463
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:15,199
that this would mean that it

1464
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,199
wouldn't accept emotion here

1465
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:19,838
because

1466
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:27,199
oh no it would though

1467
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,200
because this

1468
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:33,838
hasn't been updated

1469
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:47,838
interesting

1470
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:01,838
so

1471
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:15,838
this seems very wasteful

1472
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:45,279
um

1473
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,000
this seems a bit wasteful so i'm not

1474
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,000
thrilled about it

1475
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:59,599
um

1476
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:11,838
uh but it is what it is at the moment so

1477
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:11,838
i think we're gonna do it this way

1478
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:39,838
so we may not really want to do that

1479
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:39,838
long term

1480
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,519
uh but

1481
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:49,920
there we go that's what i was expecting

1482
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,838
right like when i push this in like that

1483
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,160
it should just

1484
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:57,838
get stuck right and it should not be

1485
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,000
allowed to move at all

1486
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:02,480
because it's supposed to be confined to

1487
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,920
moving to a vector that it literally is

1488
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,760
not allowed to move

1489
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,960
anywhere right it's like a zero vector

1490
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,480
of motion so

1491
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,159
i wanted to make sure that was working

1492
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,519
first before i interpreted what was

1493
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,679
going on and

1494
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,719
now it is so that's good that's what i

1495
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,078
want

1496
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:20,719
good okay so now what we want to do

1497
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,240
is actually produce this unembed vector

1498
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:23,598
that we are constraining to move by and

1499
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:26,078
we just saw that it does kind of

1500
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:29,440
constrain the motion in the sense that

1501
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:31,519
if i make sure that this is zero now

1502
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,639
you can't you you get physically stuck

1503
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:33,519
when you're embedded and

1504
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:35,358
you're not allowed to move anywhere

1505
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,400
which is what i wanted to verify should

1506
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:38,239
happen

1507
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,599
and so now what i want to do is actually

1508
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:43,679
produce the vector that i

1509
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:46,160
will allow you to move along

1510
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:49,038
um and so what you can see here is you

1511
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:51,279
can see that this collides at p

1512
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,880
um it's doing this intersection it's

1513
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,720
taking the result occupied

1514
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,599
what i want to do is be able to produce

1515
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,598
something here

1516
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:05,838
that represents the direction one would

1517
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,838
expect to have to go

1518
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:12,719
in order to to exit the

1519
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,480
collision this particular collision

1520
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,959
right

1521
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,318
and this will be a summation in that it

1522
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,358
will be like a sum of

1523
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:24,480
of push directions right

1524
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:27,598
and whether i want to like how those

1525
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,760
should get normalized and such

1526
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,920
uh that's a good question we'll have to

1527
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,839
think about that

1528
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,920
in a little more detail later for now we

1529
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:38,719
just want to produce something

1530
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,079
so we have uh rectangles and we know

1531
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:42,000
that they intersect

1532
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,440
if we've gotten into this part of the

1533
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,719
routine we have two

1534
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,838
overlapping rectangles in space

1535
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:52,798
we have the one that came from

1536
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:53,759
the thing that is moving and we have the

1537
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:56,719
thing

1538
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:00,079
the one that came from the obstacle and

1539
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:03,519
what we want to know is

1540
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:06,559
what direction would we probably push

1541
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:09,599
uh these things in in order to get

1542
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:13,839
us out of

1543
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,838
of our current position right

1544
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,559
so

1545
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:28,000
with spheres this is significantly

1546
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:29,199
simpler because you always know that the

1547
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,400
push is in the direction

1548
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,399
[Music]

1549
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,480
of the point right it's from the center

1550
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,000
to the point is always the shortest way

1551
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,639
out

1552
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,679
and the problem with rectangles is

1553
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:43,440
that's

1554
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:46,639
not true uh because

1555
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,079
it was cube it's sort of true uh because

1556
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:50,480
they're all equally

1557
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,000
have equal dimensions so you can think

1558
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,400
of it as a sphere and it's probably

1559
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,679
roughly correct most of the time

1560
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,680
but when you have something in an

1561
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:58,399
arbitrary rectangle you have to remember

1562
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:00,159
like one

1563
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,920
of the three dimensions could be much

1564
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:04,000
larger than the others

1565
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,280
so if you look at the vector from the

1566
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,280
center

1567
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,720
it may have like a massively

1568
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,280
overweighted

1569
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:12,719
component that doesn't actually tell you

1570
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,480
what you wanted to know

1571
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:17,439
which is what the simplest way to get

1572
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,440
out of there would be

1573
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:24,880
um and so that's a little bit

1574
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,880
harder

1575
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,038
so i suspect what we want to do here

1576
01:05:37,699 --> 01:05:42,558
[Music]

1577
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:45,680
is just say how far

1578
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:51,359
in x y and z would i have to move

1579
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:55,358
to get to the edges

1580
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:57,199
right you're always closer to one edge

1581
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:59,038
than the other

1582
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,118
how far in x y and z would i have to

1583
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:05,039
move

1584
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,519
and that is going to be the vector now

1585
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,799
the

1586
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:10,798
nasty part about that is just that

1587
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,119
it's sort of a if statement festival

1588
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:13,759
right it's like there's two there's a

1589
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,160
minimum

1590
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,160
and a maximum and you have to go like

1591
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:20,639
whichever one is greater

1592
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:21,279
right whether i take the negative motion

1593
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:23,038
because

1594
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,280
there's two right there's two bounding

1595
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,839
planes

1596
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,798
to any kind of rectangular prism and you

1597
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:30,880
got a point

1598
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,880
and you want the point you want to know

1599
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:36,000
how far it is to the closest

1600
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:38,400
side and so i'm trying to think

1601
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:47,838
but i can't i'm not really thinking of a

1602
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:47,838
good way

1603
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:55,759
this is actually not that hard right you

1604
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,358
could just do a

1605
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,880
test to produce the mask and then you

1606
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:03,358
just keep

1607
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:06,559
you just do a select on the two so

1608
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:09,838
what is it booba oh

1609
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,839
come up with your save hi

1610
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,960
how you doing

1611
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:21,440
what are you doing what are you doing

1612
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:21,440
what's going on

1613
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:27,359
do you want a brushing do you want to do

1614
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:28,558
brushing times let's do brushing times

1615
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:31,119
we're just working on the collision

1616
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,119
detector

1617
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,480
it's coming along pretty good we're just

1618
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:38,960
working on

1619
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,400
what we want our strategy to be for when

1620
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,838
the gameplay code creates

1621
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,838
interpenetrating objects

1622
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:46,798
there you go

1623
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:51,119
coat health is very important isn't that

1624
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,480
right

1625
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:57,119
oh we gotta trim your back your back

1626
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,599
nails my goodness they're getting way

1627
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,599
too sharp

1628
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:14,558
all right um i got to finish this

1629
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,640
code here is that cool

1630
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:17,920
i just want to finish we've only got it

1631
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,359
it's not much longer in the stream i

1632
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,199
just wanted to just finish just this one

1633
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,600
piece code

1634
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:26,000
just with a sketch of something just to

1635
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:29,279
see how it works bubba

1636
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,640
okay how's that how's that sound

1637
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:34,880
does that sound okay does that sound

1638
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,880
good

1639
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:40,399
you can type it for me if you want

1640
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:41,679
i know you like to type on the keyboard

1641
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,158
you definitely have some interesting

1642
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,520
code

1643
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:47,519
that you've put in in the past i've

1644
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,839
experienced some very interesting cat

1645
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,839
code

1646
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:55,838
new new algorithms that mostly include

1647
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,560
repeating a single letter for a long

1648
01:08:55,838 --> 01:09:00,880
time

1649
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:04,080
oftentimes the space bar is involved

1650
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:06,159
all right is that okay can i put you on

1651
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:07,679
the floor now

1652
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:10,079
can i put you on the floor you can go

1653
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,079
around

1654
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:17,358
yeah okay come on

1655
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,359
go on go on bubba

1656
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,838
all right

1657
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:28,000
okay then um so yeah like what i mostly

1658
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,278
just want to figure out here is like

1659
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,439
what this directional

1660
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:36,319
uh thing would be here and and really

1661
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:37,198
so like you know let's just do this for

1662
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,880
now

1663
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,399
it's not great but this is what i'm

1664
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,520
gonna do

1665
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,519
so um

1666
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:48,158
i'm just gonna take an average count uh

1667
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:48,718
the number of times we occupy here we're

1668
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:51,920
gonna

1669
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,679
uh increase the the average count

1670
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,000
uh and then i'm just gonna do like an if

1671
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:59,679
average count

1672
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,479
uh result dot repulsion times equals one

1673
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,760
over

1674
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:06,718
average count

1675
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,199
right so uh i'm just going to go in here

1676
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,480
and

1677
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:15,279
track this repulsion value

1678
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:15,279
by summing up some like unembed

1679
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,279
direction here like we were doing before

1680
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:23,279
the unembed direction

1681
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:23,279
is just going to be like the center

1682
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:33,119
uh of like the minkowski some maybe of

1683
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,960
these two

1684
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:38,719
uh colliders so um or i could just

1685
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,920
you know actually for now we could do it

1686
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:40,880
even simpler just because we're pretty

1687
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,359
much out of time

1688
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,039
so what i could do is just say like okay

1689
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:46,158
let's just take the two collision

1690
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:50,238
volumes

1691
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:53,519
and subtract their centers right um

1692
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:56,639
so you know the test rects

1693
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,840
uh and the mover rect um so we want the

1694
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,840
we want to say

1695
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,480
that so if we were moving into it we

1696
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:07,198
want to basically move towards

1697
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:09,198
us and away from from them so we want to

1698
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:09,919
go like okay we want to move towards the

1699
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,559
mover

1700
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,520
rect away from the test rect is probably

1701
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,800
what we're looking for

1702
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,840
this is not good uh we probably don't

1703
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,079
want this to be the

1704
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,039
the permanent thing at all but then at

1705
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:23,760
least we've got

1706
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:26,000
something we can start with right so

1707
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,760
that's that's the basic

1708
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,279
uh thing that we'll use so going into

1709
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:33,360
next weekend we can

1710
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:36,479
start to work with that right um and so

1711
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:38,000
that looked a little odd although it

1712
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:40,079
kind of works

1713
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,600
notice how it pops it right up on top

1714
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:44,319
there if it was high

1715
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,880
and it keeps it out if it was in so that

1716
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:46,719
actually

1717
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,719
does exactly what it you would think it

1718
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,920
would do actually

1719
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:54,079
right um if it was up high we'll push it

1720
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:57,199
up higher to get over the top of that

1721
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:57,519
thing um because there's nowhere it can

1722
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:00,639
go

1723
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,640
right um

1724
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:07,520
you can't you can't push in

1725
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:10,319
so i mean even just that really stupid

1726
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,880
piece of code worked

1727
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:13,759
if we put a ceiling on here then it

1728
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,319
would just work

1729
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,760
it looks like so we may just luck out

1730
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:19,359
and not have to do anything fancy

1731
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,199
we may just end up with something really

1732
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:22,719
stupid it's fine right

1733
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:25,198
and the only thing we need to do here is

1734
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:28,640
make sure we have a um

1735
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:29,279
an actual cap on the ceiling so that you

1736
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,320
can't

1737
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:36,158
go arbitrarily high and go over

1738
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:36,880
walls right and that's just adding a

1739
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:39,039
collider

1740
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,480
at the top of the room right there

1741
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:43,198
that's nothing

1742
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:44,399
that's really simple um so i think

1743
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:47,519
that's good

1744
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:49,599
uh and i'm happy with that for today

1745
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,120
um that looks great yeah it just pops

1746
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:55,440
right up over the wall

1747
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:55,439
to avoid getting embedded um

1748
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:05,840
so yeah in pretty good shape

1749
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:13,039
yeah no real complaints so far

1750
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:13,039
looks pretty good

1751
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,480
uh and mainly the controller for the

1752
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,480
glove kind of sucks right now so

1753
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:24,319
that is something we'll have to work on

1754
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:25,678
for sure although it kind of feels fun

1755
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:26,719
to play with so maybe it doesn't suck

1756
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:30,079
that bad

1757
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:31,920
um so you know we want to like uh

1758
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:47,840
we want to work on that and also i think

1759
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:47,840
we want it like i said to be a sphere

1760
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:51,600
all right uh that's a pretty reasonable

1761
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:54,880
place to stop for today anyone have any

1762
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:57,840
questions about collision detection

1763
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:01,840
i can take a look at them and while we

1764
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,840
are doing that

1765
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,359
i wanted to show off something i just

1766
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:14,559
received in the mail

1767
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:18,158
check it out so

1768
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,120
this guy i don't know that seems to be

1769
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:21,519
like really

1770
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,039
aggressively not wanting to autofocus

1771
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:28,159
there it goes

1772
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:32,238
so this guy um

1773
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:36,319
is a uc one from grim audio

1774
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:38,718
and they sent it to me uh because

1775
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:39,439
i guess they decided they they asked for

1776
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,319
permission

1777
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,039
about a year ago to use some handmade

1778
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:46,238
hero

1779
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:47,359
code stuff uh in their i guess the

1780
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:49,279
driver

1781
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:50,639
uh for the the like the interface for

1782
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:52,079
the driver or i don't know if maybe it

1783
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,039
was the interface for the

1784
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:56,399
this this has a little uh screen on it i

1785
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:59,679
don't actually know

1786
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:01,119
um but i was like sure uh can can you

1787
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:04,000
send us one when you

1788
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:04,800
when you ship it uh and they graciously

1789
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
said yes

1790
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,640
and um so it's a pretty cool

1791
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
box i i have literally not read the

1792
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,880
manual yet but

1793
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,920
it has like a crap ton of audio on the

1794
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,640
back

1795
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,399
um so it's basically like a ton of

1796
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:23,600
inputs and outputs

1797
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:26,719
and i guess the idea behind it is uh

1798
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,320
that it's it's like a little like

1799
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,000
virtual kind of like

1800
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:32,639
routing sort of thing like in other

1801
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,640
words you can

1802
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,640
plug in a bunch of inputs and outputs

1803
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:40,559
and then use this thing

1804
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:43,760
to control like where things go right

1805
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:46,480
um and uh

1806
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:49,600
and honestly like having had a lot of

1807
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,919
problems with the stupid stereo mix crap

1808
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,079
in windows i'm kind of wondering if i

1809
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,800
can like once i go read how it actually

1810
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:56,719
works

1811
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,279
uh and stuff i'm wondering if maybe it's

1812
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:03,760
something i could actually use

1813
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:06,800
on the show uh to get a more stable

1814
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:09,280
scenario like a more stable like input

1815
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:13,520
output scenario

1816
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:18,639
for the um for the machine

1817
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:18,640
right um so you know

1818
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,239
uh we've had a lot of problems with that

1819
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,520
in the past

1820
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:35,519
we might we might want to try um

1821
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:40,560
but you know that's about it

1822
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,560
js christ brought up a question um

1823
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,840
what about tracking a previous location

1824
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,000
and always moving back towards where the

1825
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,440
entity came from um

1826
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,520
yeah that doesn't really work

1827
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:52,960
particularly well uh and the reason that

1828
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,760
that doesn't work particularly well

1829
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,800
is because all the entities are moving

1830
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,880
and so there's no

1831
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,560
particular reason to suspect that the

1832
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,920
place the entity came from

1833
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:06,320
is any better than anywhere else

1834
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,679
right so what you really want is

1835
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:11,279
something that is go

1836
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:14,000
like so if we wanted to do this full

1837
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:14,800
uh all the way right what we would

1838
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,439
probably do

1839
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,560
is say okay let's just start searching

1840
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,399
in a radius

1841
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,000
and see where the closest place we could

1842
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:25,359
put this as unembedded is

1843
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,238
right that's probably the best thing um

1844
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:30,559
then if we want to go a stage above that

1845
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:34,479
you can have your room regions

1846
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:37,520
coded by reachability

1847
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:38,718
and only pick a location that has the

1848
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,159
same reachability

1849
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:44,640
as the last place the player was right

1850
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,759
and you can do all that stuff in our

1851
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,400
case

1852
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,600
it's probably not going to be very

1853
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:52,000
important

1854
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,039
um to do any of that stuff you know this

1855
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,039
isn't the witness

1856
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:56,158
or something where i cared a lot about

1857
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:57,760
trying to make sure

1858
01:17:56,158 --> 01:18:00,079
that the player's experience was rock

1859
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,520
solid and it was supposed to be that way

1860
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:02,800
for game design reasons and all this

1861
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,760
other stuff

1862
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,880
this is a very chaotic room based

1863
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,719
hopping game with

1864
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:13,520
crazy crap happening and so i don't

1865
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:14,239
care that much about those same sorts of

1866
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,320
things

1867
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:17,678
right so don't think i would bother with

1868
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,319
reachability analysis

1869
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:21,600
it just doesn't seem like it was a good

1870
01:18:20,319 --> 01:18:24,079
use of time

1871
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,039
what was the name of the audio box it's

1872
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:28,399
called a grim

1873
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:28,399
audio uc1

1874
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:34,799
so it it is um

1875
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:39,520
let us open up microsoft's amazing

1876
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:43,039
browser

1877
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,040
grimm you see one

1878
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:54,000
um so it is this

1879
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:56,960
and uh you can see like

1880
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,238
it's got like a bunch of output and

1881
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:02,880
input options

1882
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:02,879
right uh and

1883
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:10,480
because i don't know very much about it

1884
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:12,238
i really like i said don't know uh if

1885
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,479
it's an appropriate thing for

1886
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:16,238
anything that we happen to do with the

1887
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:19,678
stream

1888
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:23,439
but we obviously could

1889
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:26,480
use a nice like mixing and routing

1890
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:28,799
thing for uh

1891
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:30,559
any number of reasons is because of like

1892
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:33,600
all the trouble i've had with like

1893
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,440
getting audio to both go to headphones

1894
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:39,039
and to um

1895
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,960
the other computer and all this other

1896
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:45,600
sorts of stuff right

1897
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,600
um and so i don't really know

1898
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:54,400
like

1899
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:56,560
i i don't really know uh we have to play

1900
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:57,839
with it and find out

1901
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,440
the reason i have one is because they

1902
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,239
use the hand of samantha hero code

1903
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:04,879
that's it

1904
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:07,519
uh but it and so i was just like um

1905
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,679
thought it was cool but also it may end

1906
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,199
up being something i can actually use

1907
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:13,279
because it happens to be something that

1908
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:15,519
is in a space that we have trouble with

1909
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:15,519
right

1910
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:20,000
so it may actually be something that

1911
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,920
ends up being useful plus knowing the

1912
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,279
people who worked on it means that if

1913
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,880
there's problems with the drivers or

1914
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:26,479
something i actually have someone to

1915
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,600
talk to which is different than most

1916
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:29,039
things i use right

1917
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,639
it could be like hey i'm having trouble

1918
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:32,000
getting this to work or

1919
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,119
it seems to be blue screening in this

1920
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,800
case or something right it's like

1921
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,439
sometimes it's nice to have friends who

1922
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,119
work on a

1923
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:38,319
device use because if you have a problem

1924
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,079
someone might actually listen to you

1925
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:46,079
which is different than

1926
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:47,439
you know the normal situation

1927
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:49,119
someone who started the series a few

1928
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:50,638
days ago and wants to make a game of his

1929
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:52,158
own how do i manage to catch up with the

1930
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:55,199
current stage

1931
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:58,399
um i don't really think you need to

1932
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:59,919
right um i would just say

1933
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:02,399
you know handmade here is a good thing

1934
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:04,158
to watch to see the parts that you

1935
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:06,079
think that you need to see for working

1936
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:08,079
on whatever you're working on

1937
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:10,238
but you can safely ignore the episodes

1938
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:14,880
that aren't about those things

1939
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:19,198
right um and if you go to

1940
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:21,520
um the episode guide here

1941
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:21,519
um

1942
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:28,079
i don't this is such a weird episode i

1943
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:30,639
don't know i don't do this

1944
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:31,679
it's a very strange program um i don't

1945
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:35,119
didn't make it

1946
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:40,079
uh so it kind of is its own thing

1947
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:43,198
it's it's just full nuts uh

1948
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:47,679
there we go

1949
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:48,719
um you can usually do stuff like search

1950
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,480
for things in here

1951
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,800
that you need to find like if you need

1952
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:56,399
to know how to do sse or something or

1953
01:21:52,800 --> 01:22:00,719
you know cindy or something you can

1954
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:03,599
look it up in here um

1955
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:04,079
but yeah i don't know it's so basically

1956
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,560
all

1957
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:07,600
all the episode guide really needs to be

1958
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,400
good

1959
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,800
is some work on styles right like you

1960
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:13,119
never

1961
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,960
want like you see how small that text is

1962
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:15,920
you never ever want your text to be a

1963
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,039
fixed size

1964
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:21,440
text should always be related to the

1965
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:23,760
the rem size of the page so that it

1966
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:26,799
grows as the page grows and such

1967
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,800
you know um so

1968
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,639
so it doesn't make a lot of sense the

1969
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:34,000
way that it's set up at the moment

1970
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,279
um but like the actual content is very

1971
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,840
good

1972
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:39,198
uh so you know you click on something it

1973
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,560
goes right to that something and then

1974
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:42,479
you get that so all of this

1975
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,920
you know where it is in the video right

1976
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:47,039
and so it's pretty good

1977
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,760
and you can play part of that um through

1978
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:49,920
it and whatever

1979
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,520
and it keeps the stuff synced so like on

1980
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,719
the side of a few things yeah i need

1981
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,120
first of all the color

1982
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,639
which stylistic like layout wise it

1983
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:58,639
doesn't really work

1984
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:01,039
it's a pretty pretty busted starting box

1985
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:02,639
but content-wise it does

1986
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:04,800
and like i said i don't really do it so

1987
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:06,319
i can't i'm sorry a box really say much

1988
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,719
about it other than like that's what it

1989
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:09,599
is

1990
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,480
i don't have time to go mess with this

1991
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,880
stuff

1992
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:14,879
so um but the content in it is very good

1993
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,840
right

1994
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,840
uh

1995
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,319
i recently discovered your stream i

1996
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:53,279
learned a lot from the in-depth videos

1997
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:54,639
on how computer

1998
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:57,279
actually works in front of a level like

1999
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,719
the c tutorial and the blackboard videos

2000
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:00,000
i'm really excited about circle galaxy

2001
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:01,359
do you have any information about when

2002
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,119
it will launch and what kind of material

2003
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:06,719
will cover um

2004
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:08,079
i don't really um i mean it will launch

2005
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:10,319
as soon as possible but there's just a

2006
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:12,079
tremendous amount of work involved in it

2007
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:13,920
um and it's a very complex product to

2008
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:17,279
try and ship so

2009
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:19,119
uh you know i promised

2010
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:21,599
that i'll put out an early access

2011
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:23,519
version before it's really ready

2012
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,120
so i will be shipping it you know

2013
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,199
prematurely because

2014
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:28,639
people really want to get their hands on

2015
01:24:27,198 --> 01:24:32,638
it so there will be a

2016
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:34,480
sort of quiet early release that will be

2017
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:36,119
available to people

2018
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:37,519
if you signed up for the mailing list on

2019
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:39,519
starcodegalaxy.com

2020
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,360
you'll get notified when that's

2021
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:44,480
available so there will be

2022
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:46,719
that thing um and i

2023
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:48,638
i you know i'm trying to get it out as

2024
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:50,319
soon as possible like literally as soon

2025
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:53,440
as i feel like everything is stable

2026
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:55,679
enough and there's enough content in it

2027
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:58,960
to release we will but there's it's a

2028
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:00,639
very complicated project

2029
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,158
that was done in a very small amount of

2030
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:06,719
time

2031
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:08,960
compared to how much stuff is in there

2032
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:10,158
it included building two studio setups

2033
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,920
at my house

2034
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:14,638
a complete new design for an educational

2035
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,319
system

2036
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:17,760
a complete deployment of that in

2037
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:19,279
javascript so it will run

2038
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,119
on the web um

2039
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:23,920

01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:26,399
all the videos the code base like

2041
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:29,679
basically three complete game code bases

2042
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:32,799
like it's a tremendously large thing

2043
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:35,520
that is very intricate and complicated

2044
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:37,039
and uh i've had to do a tremendous

2045
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,400
amount of work to

2046
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:43,760
to bring it to fruition and so i

2047
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:46,000
i other than the fact that i'm trying as

2048
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:51,039
hard as i can to get something out

2049
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,039
early i cannot really promise anything

2050
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,840
else

2051
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,840
can you tease just how awesome sauce the

2052
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:14,238
scg

2053
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:18,239
player will be um

2054
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:20,000
i mean no i don't know

2055
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:22,000
i guess what i would say about the seg

2056
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,119
player is you can look at it in one

2057
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:28,319
of two ways one way is you can

2058
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:30,559
think of it as it is completely

2059
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:31,759
revolutionary and completely changes

2060
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,080
everything you know

2061
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,600
about how you would make course

2062
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:38,479
materials

2063
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:40,560
another way would be actually it's just

2064
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:43,759
the obvious thing you would do

2065
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:46,400
if you weren't youtube right

2066
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,679
if if youtube if anyone at youtube cared

2067
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:50,799
at all

2068
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:52,239
about what watching things should be

2069
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:55,679
like when there's a computer

2070
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:59,279
this is just what you would get right so

2071
01:26:55,679 --> 01:27:02,319
i mean you can either do the like

2072
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:04,800
paul graham an obvious thing is a

2073
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:06,319
revolutionary technology nonsense puff

2074
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,039
piece about it if you want or you can

2075
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:10,238
just be like

2076
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:12,000
oh cool somebody who actually cared

2077
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:13,678
made a thing for playing back videos for

2078
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,920
instructional purposes

2079
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:17,440
and we got all of the things that you

2080
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,560
would think you would do

2081
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:24,158
art actually got done right

2082
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:26,239
um so so you know it's

2083
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:27,759
it's there there's a fair number of

2084
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:29,359
things in there i guess that maybe

2085
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:32,719
people wouldn't think of

2086
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:34,158
because they haven't gone and tried um

2087
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,840
right so so there's a bunch of things

2088
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:38,319
that probably will be surprising

2089
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:40,319
but when you see them i think you will

2090
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:41,119
mostly think oh right that's how it

2091
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:42,719
should be

2092
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:44,479
i don't think you will think like whoa

2093
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:46,319
that's weird or whoa that's

2094
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:48,638
so far out there i think like oh right

2095
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:50,059
of course we should have done that

2096
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,840
right um

2097
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:53,600
[Music]

2098
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,960
so so hopefully the things i think

2099
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,480
there's a lot of really

2100
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,719
smart stuff in there but i think it's

2101
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:00,399
all stuff that in hindsight

2102
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,840
after you see it it will seem very

2103
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:02,719
natural be like of course we should have

2104
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,640
done that right

2105
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:06,079
which is usually i think

2106
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:15,840
[Music]

2107
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:15,840
you know the kind of idea i like

2108
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,840
um

2109
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,279
have you implemented some kind of

2110
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:57,678
friction effect

2111
01:28:55,279 --> 01:28:58,880
for the player walks or runs along the

2112
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:02,560
voxel boxes

2113
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:03,279
uh well there's no so in this game

2114
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,760
things hop

2115
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:08,399
so there's no real friction so i'm not

2116
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,400
i'm not sure

2117
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,319
there's only two types of objects in the

2118
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:13,519
system ones are hoppers which just hop

2119
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:15,759
around and the others are

2120
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,159
gliding so they don't really do friction

2121
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,159
they just

2122
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,199
they're just allowed to go anywhere

2123
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,719
they're allowed to go so we don't really

2124
01:29:21,198 --> 01:29:23,678
have a use case for friction in this

2125
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:27,198
particular

2126
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:28,639
game did you make the final products for

2127
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:30,399
each module first and then build the

2128
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:32,719
course around each for each module

2129
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:32,719
yes

2130
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:40,479
i mean to a first approximation i guess

2131
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,198
that's not entirely true but that's

2132
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:44,959
mostly

2133
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:46,719
true yes can you explain again how the

2134
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,679
unembedded vector is calculated

2135
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:51,520
yes so right now it's not calculated in

2136
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:53,760
any particularly smart way

2137
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,199
so right now all we do is say look if

2138
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,280
two things are colliding

2139
01:29:55,198 --> 01:29:59,039
we just take the centers of each of

2140
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:01,119
their bounding boxes

2141
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:02,479
and we assume that the thing that will

2142
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:06,079
get you unembedded

2143
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:08,479
is is the opposite motion of that right

2144
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:09,119
so if if two things you take their two

2145
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:11,198
centers

2146
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:12,639
and you you use the vector that would

2147
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:15,439
push

2148
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:15,760
back towards the person who's moving

2149
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:17,439
right

2150
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,600
so you have one person moving and one

2151
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:21,919
person who's stationary

2152
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,360
for purposes of this algorithm right the

2153
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,679
person who's moving

2154
01:30:23,359 --> 01:30:27,759
we basically push you back towards that

2155
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:30,960
person along the line

2156
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:32,800
of the two bounding box centers right

2157
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,800
and if there's more than one thing

2158
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,560
collides with we just average them

2159
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,920
so it's not a very good it's not it's

2160
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,679
not nothing it's not good

2161
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,600
right it's not particularly good

2162
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:43,359
computation but it's fine

2163
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,520
for our purposes already seem to work

2164
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:46,799
okay so we may not want to belabor the

2165
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:48,400
point until we actually have some

2166
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,279
examples of it failing

2167
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:51,279
to do what we want

2168
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:04,639
any idea on the approximate price

2169
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:06,639
historical switch uh yes so

2170
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:08,400
i haven't announced any final pricing

2171
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:09,600
yet but the the estimate was it would be

2172
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:12,879
like 50 bucks

2173
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:17,840
per you know per

2174
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:17,840
um module right

2175
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:47,599
so the yeah the well 200 is for

2176
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:48,638
so there's there's people who wanted to

2177
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,840
do like a buy

2178
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:53,760
everything so 200

2179
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:55,039
it was the price point that was floated

2180
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:59,039
for like you get ev

2181
01:31:55,039 --> 01:32:02,960
all the modules right

2182
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:06,639
so so the the idea was that you can buy

2183
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:10,000
um you know the modules are fairly

2184
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:11,359
uh substantial and you only buy as many

2185
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,198
as you wanted to take

2186
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:19,039
right um and those would be 50 bucks per

2187
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:19,519
right so that was kind of the general

2188
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:21,359
idea

2189
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:23,280
and the reason for that pricing was like

2190
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:25,198
it's basically like the price of a game

2191
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:26,639
right so it was meant to be kept around

2192
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:27,279
what people generally were used to

2193
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:30,400
paying

2194
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:32,800
for non-educational stuff

2195
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:34,559
just to keep it more in line with with

2196
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,199
standard pricing

2197
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,760
so the 200 thing was like if you bought

2198
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:40,238
like

2199
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:42,000
basically like a an umbrella package

2200
01:32:40,238 --> 01:32:43,519
right something that had all the modules

2201
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,279
in it

2202
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:49,360
um so that was more of a like special

2203
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:51,039
you know like like a kickstarter tier

2204
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:52,158
kind of a thing it's like oh the 200 one

2205
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:54,639
has like all the stuff

2206
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:56,399
and maybe some bonus content or early

2207
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:58,560
access to everything

2208
01:32:56,399 --> 01:33:00,479
um so you know if you buy the 200 one

2209
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:09,840
you get stuff early before it's actually

2210
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:09,839
bundled into a module that kind of thing

2211
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,800
my friend started working as a c plus

2212
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,280
programmer and he showed me the code

2213
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,119
base

2214
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:16,479
he has to work with and it was a jungle

2215
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:18,719
of classes templates

2216
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:19,519
std colon colon it was very slow to

2217
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:20,880
compile

2218
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,719
is this a common thing in industry to

2219
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:24,319
have this kind of code base i guess that

2220
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:27,520
is why software is a bad quality

2221
01:33:24,319 --> 01:33:29,279
um pretty much yes so um

2222
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,960
bad programming practices such as using

2223
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:31,679
the std library which is a terrible

2224
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,679
library

2225
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:35,520
no one should ever use it for anything

2226
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:36,079
um it's bad across the board it's bad at

2227
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,840
everything

2228
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:43,279
there are no good parts of std um

2229
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:45,440
uh it's just bad

2230
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:47,759
most of c plus is bad so classes and

2231
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:50,079
templates templates are okay

2232
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,719
in light usage sometimes but they're

2233
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:55,119
pretty bad in general just as a design

2234
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,319
classes are always bad assuming that

2235
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:57,760
you're actually talking about things

2236
01:33:56,319 --> 01:33:59,439
that were induced with classes

2237
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,199
structs and classes have no real actual

2238
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:02,399
difference between them

2239
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:04,158
it's only if you start using things like

2240
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:05,119
virtual private those sorts of things

2241
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:08,638
also all bad

2242
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:10,238
right um but that's the typical way that

2243
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:11,920
large code bases these days are

2244
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:12,559
programmed and the reason for that is

2245
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,960
not because

2246
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:16,159
they make large program large code bases

2247
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,880
better they actually make large code

2248
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:19,359
bases worse

2249
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:20,960
like the compiled time like you said but

2250
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:22,559
rather that

2251
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,480
the prevailing dogma is that these

2252
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,600
things are good so if you have a large

2253
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:26,718
code base that means you have a large

2254
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,079
number of programmers which means the

2255
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:30,800
majority of them

2256
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:32,079
will be subscribing to that dogma and

2257
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,960
checking in garbage

2258
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:35,679
like that so you just it's kind of

2259
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,880
unavoidable

2260
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:42,158
because any large code base will

2261
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,800
by default reflect the current day's

2262
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:44,879
dogma

2263
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,719
whether that dogma is good or bad it is

2264
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,560
also then oddly enough for flexibly used

2265
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,239
as a way to justify it it's like well

2266
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,159
you know big code bases are written this

2267
01:34:50,238 --> 01:34:53,279
way so it must it must be about scaling

2268
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:56,719
it's like no

2269
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:58,800
that's that's dogma scaling it's too

2270
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,719
hard to hire enough programmers who

2271
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:02,239
don't believe the current zeitgeist

2272
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,960
to do anything different what you're

2273
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:09,118
seeing is is a political effect

2274
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,439
not a a a programming effect but you

2275
01:35:09,118 --> 01:35:14,719
know

2276
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:16,319
again that's just

2277
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:17,920
is svg your full-time occupation now it

2278
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:19,039
is yes nowadays i've basically had to

2279
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,079
convert doing it full of time because i

2280
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:23,198
really need to get it done

2281
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:26,158
and out so i can move on um so

2282
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:27,839
you know do you think putting completed

2283
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:30,238
start code galaxy on a resume will be

2284
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:33,360
valuable

2285
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:36,718
um gosh uh

2286
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:40,839
that probably will depend entirely on

2287
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:45,359
how well it manages

2288
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:57,840
to reach sort of a wider audience

2289
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:57,839
so i really don't know

2290
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:00,960
would it be easy to show some of the

2291
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:02,158
industry who sticks to those beliefs

2292
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,198
that cutting off

2293
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:08,799
most of the siblings bs is beneficial um

2294
01:36:05,198 --> 01:36:09,519
no it's not easy and the reason why it's

2295
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,719
not easy

2296
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:15,520
is because as far as i can tell people

2297
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:16,079
don't hold those beliefs rationally they

2298
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,920
hold them

2299
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:21,039
irrationally right so nobody who uses

2300
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,199
std

2301
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:24,960
has ever done any tests to determine

2302
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:26,638
whether std was a good thing

2303
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,158
they never tested compile time they

2304
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:30,239
never tested performance

2305
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:31,279
they never tested scalability they never

2306
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:33,198
tested anything

2307
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:34,319
right they just used it because it was

2308
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:37,039
standard

2309
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:37,840
um so it's very hard to convince them to

2310
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:39,279
not do it

2311
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:41,279
because they didn't base their decision

2312
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:44,158
to use it on any actual

2313
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:44,880
science to begin with so what are you

2314
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:48,679
going to do

2315
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:51,760
right so some people who just did that

2316
01:36:48,679 --> 01:36:52,960
non-thinkingly and then when you say hey

2317
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,159
we should think about this maybe they're

2318
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,679
like oh yeah we should

2319
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:57,519
those people will probably be reachable

2320
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:00,319
pretty easily but everyone else

2321
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:01,679
is just going on dogma anyway so what

2322
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:02,719
are you gonna say they're not gonna be

2323
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:04,960
like oh

2324
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:06,319
suddenly i'm suddenly interested in

2325
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,198
actually evaluating this thing because

2326
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:10,880
they weren't

2327
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:10,879
they wouldn't have used it if they were

2328
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:21,840
right

2329
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:45,118
i mean another way to say that would be

2330
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:48,319
if you ask most people

2331
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:51,118
why they use

2332
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:52,158
a lot of these practices they don't have

2333
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:55,599
a

2334
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:57,599
not like a science-based answer for you

2335
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,760
like they don't have in answers that

2336
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,360
like we evaluated these things and here

2337
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,800
were some metrics we used

2338
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:08,639
compile time performance executable size

2339
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:10,480
bug count none of that stuff so

2340
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,840
if you don't fundamentally have a

2341
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:14,319
science-based answer

2342
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,679
as to why you did do something it's

2343
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:17,759
pretty hard to imagine

2344
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:18,719
how you would convince someone

2345
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,520
scientifically

2346
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:23,439
to stop doing that thing because that's

2347
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,960
obviously not how their brain works

2348
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:26,638
like they obviously aren't making

2349
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:30,239
decisions based on metrics

2350
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:32,560
so what are you going to show them right

2351
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:34,399
um what i think you would have to do is

2352
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,320
just change the zeitgeist like you have

2353
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:38,158
to change the dogma

2354
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:39,359
first because they're the kinds of

2355
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:40,879
people who will just go along with

2356
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,880
whatever the industry dogma is

2357
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,159
so you'd probably have a much better

2358
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:47,440
likelihood of succeeding

2359
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:50,319
by changing the dogma over time

2360
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:51,198
rather than trying to change particular

2361
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:53,920
people who are

2362
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:55,198
dogma followers to stop them from

2363
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:57,679
following dogma

2364
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:59,118
right i mean maybe you could but then

2365
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:00,399
what you're really doing is just making

2366
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:01,599
them follow your dogma

2367
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:04,399
but you haven't really fixed the

2368
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:06,000
situation that well necessarily

2369
01:39:04,399 --> 01:39:07,679
still because it's they're still just

2370
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:11,118
doing a dogmatic thing

2371
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:12,880
right they're not actually evaluating

2372
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:14,238
so i don't know like i i don't know that

2373
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,760
there's that much resolution i think

2374
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:16,799
this sort of thing just happens the way

2375
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,039
it happens

2376
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,039
right

2377
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:27,839
i used some temples in my siblings code

2378
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:29,520
to avoid large amounts of code

2379
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,079
duplication by struggle with compile

2380
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,360
times

2381
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:32,719
could you recommend any material on meta

2382
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:33,118
programming c plus plus do you think is

2383
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,960
good

2384
01:39:33,118 --> 01:39:36,559
no no i mean this is why i say like c

2385
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:39,679
plus plus just just sucks

2386
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:41,119
it's a crap language um the reason i

2387
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:42,079
don't use templates is not because i

2388
01:39:41,118 --> 01:39:43,599
don't want

2389
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:45,679
meta programming it's because it's just

2390
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,400
a bad it's a bad language for meta

2391
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:49,440
programming

2392
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:50,960
so you're just kind of screwed like like

2393
01:39:49,439 --> 01:39:52,638
there's a lot of meta programming stuff

2394
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,158
you would want to do templates are very

2395
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:55,359
bad at it

2396
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:57,198
first of all they make it unnecessarily

2397
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:59,198
difficult to do what you want to do

2398
01:39:57,198 --> 01:40:00,479
and then second the compile times are

2399
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:04,319
terrible

2400
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:09,839
yeah often times the error messages are

2401
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:09,840
also terrible

2402
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:13,118
do you used to use standard lips and

2403
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,840
then switch to the hamburger style uh

2404
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:16,880
yeah

2405
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:19,039
so i kind of like bounced over or

2406
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:20,960
like boomerang through it so i used to

2407
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,238
program basically this way

2408
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,079
i did some programming with sleepless

2409
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:24,799
plus for a while so like inheritance

2410
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:27,760
hierarchies

2411
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:29,840
and templates and crap and then i like

2412
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:32,239
actually evaluated all of them

2413
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:33,679
uh at a project at rad i was like okay

2414
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:35,519
we're gonna try like

2415
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:38,000
seeing how the code comes out by like

2416
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:39,360
using and not using these various things

2417
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,039
and what i determined that basically

2418
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:43,039
like the only things that i thought c

2419
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:44,639
plus plus had added that were useful

2420
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:46,319
were operator overloading for math

2421
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,800
operations which i do think is a good

2422
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:49,519
idea

2423
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:52,880
it makes the code much more legible and

2424
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:54,880
can be compiled relatively cleanly

2425
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,960
um and the other thing was declare

2426
01:40:54,880 --> 01:41:00,560
anywhere

2427
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,560
which c now also has

2428
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:06,480
but that's it so inheritance not good uh

2429
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,840
i wouldn't recommend it templates have

2430
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:10,718
some benefits but the

2431
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:12,319
costs outweigh the benefits so also not

2432
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:15,840
good on the whole

2433
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:17,359
um the newer things that see so like

2434
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:20,719
lambdas

2435
01:41:17,359 --> 01:41:23,599
um or like uh

2436
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:24,560
you know auto were not around at the

2437
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:27,280
time

2438
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,880
so something like auto is probably fine

2439
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:31,599
would be my guess

2440
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,639
um because it doesn't really do anything

2441
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,800
it's just a

2442
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:35,760
simpler shorthand for not having to type

2443
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,639
in a type

2444
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,159
when the type would obviously be known

2445
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:42,079
so i would have a hard time believing

2446
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:43,839
auto isn't fine to use but

2447
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:46,158
it wasn't in the set of things i tested

2448
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:48,159
at that time because it didn't exist yet

2449
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:50,719
smart pointers are garbage there's no

2450
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:50,719
need for them

2451
01:41:51,760 --> 01:42:01,840
for sure

2452
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:16,638
declare anywhere is just the fact that

2453
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:18,319
so in the original versions of c

2454
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:19,760
all of the variables for the function

2455
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:20,719
had to be declared at the top of the

2456
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,079
scope

2457
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,840
and you could make a new scope and

2458
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:24,639
declare functions at the top of the

2459
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,119
scope

2460
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:28,079
but you could never declare like you

2461
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:31,439
couldn't do like

2462
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:34,238
int a equals five a times equals two

2463
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:35,039
into b equals four because there was an

2464
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:36,638
expression

2465
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:38,399
in between two declarations that was

2466
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:39,440
illegal all the declarations had to come

2467
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:42,799
at the top

2468
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:44,638
right um and that's just kind of

2469
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,639
annoying like there's really no good

2470
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:49,199
explanation for why you would need that

2471
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:51,600
it doesn't really do much for you maybe

2472
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:55,439
there's some arguments about

2473
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:57,520
it enforces good programmer you know

2474
01:42:55,439 --> 01:42:58,960
discipline or something but like i don't

2475
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,719
tend to like arguments like that

2476
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,239
like i don't tend to like arguments that

2477
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,679
are like the reason we do this is

2478
01:43:02,238 --> 01:43:05,279
because it results in a good programming

2479
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:07,199
practice like i'll decide what the good

2480
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:09,359
programming practices are thank you

2481
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:11,039
what i want from the language is the

2482
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:12,799
ability for me to

2483
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:14,800
take programming practices that i think

2484
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:16,320
are good and do them i don't want you to

2485
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,920
decide that because i'm pretty sure you

2486
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:19,840
don't know better than i do

2487
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,279
what the good programming proc practices

2488
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,560
are for my project

2489
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:28,319
right um

2490
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:28,320
so basically like you know

2491
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,479
would you recommend rust over c plus

2492
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:40,080
plus i mean i haven't really used rust

2493
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:42,238
probably not rust seems like a pretty

2494
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:43,600
bad language to me i don't understand

2495
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:45,359
why people think it's good

2496
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:48,239
oh well i kind of maybe understand why

2497
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:51,439
why people think it's good i think those

2498
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:56,158
thoughts are misguided but

2499
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:57,759
um so no i mean

2500
01:43:56,158 --> 01:43:59,839
it's six and one half dozen of the other

2501
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,280
though like if you look at russ versus c

2502
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,199
plus plus like they're both i think

2503
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:05,279
languages that aren't designed very well

2504
01:44:03,198 --> 01:44:06,399
but they probably if we really want to

2505
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:09,439
start nitpicking

2506
01:44:06,399 --> 01:44:11,839
there's probably like a similar number

2507
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:14,319
of things done poorly versus done well

2508
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:16,079
so i doubt you know i also wouldn't tell

2509
01:44:14,319 --> 01:44:17,039
you to definitely use c bus plus over

2510
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:20,079
rust or something

2511
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:23,600
i think they're both lousy languages

2512
01:44:20,079 --> 01:44:25,118
um so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna get in

2513
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,920
an argument about which one is better

2514
01:44:25,118 --> 01:44:28,238
because i

2515
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,199
a don't care and b don't know that you

2516
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:32,799
could make

2517
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:32,799
a particularly coherent argument either

2518
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,840
way

2519
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:39,839
given that handmade hero is running for

2520
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,679
quite a while doesn't it seem unfeasible

2521
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,880
for solo indie des to go with a custom

2522
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:44,719
engine especially since you're more

2523
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:48,079
experienced

2524
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:51,679
um i mean i don't know like probably

2525
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:54,158
not at all i mean handmade hero is

2526
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:56,719
not even completed in a single year of

2527
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:59,279
programming yet

2528
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:00,960
right we haven't even spent a year on

2529
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:04,079
this engine yet

2530
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:06,000
if you add up the hours even including

2531
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:08,319
the explanation time

2532
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:11,840
right we haven't even gotten to a

2533
01:45:08,319 --> 01:45:11,840
full-time year of programming yet

2534
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,840
so and we have a crap ton of stuff in

2535
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:17,840
the engine

2536
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:26,880
um so so we haven't even gotten to a

2537
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:30,079
year yet

2538
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:33,359
well i don't even know what we're at um

2539
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:35,118
but it's probably not a full year

2540
01:45:33,359 --> 01:45:36,639
if you actually tried to count the hours

2541
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:38,079
right you assume you program like 40

2542
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:42,880
hours a week

2543
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:42,880
30 hours a week something like that um

2544
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:48,319
right so

2545
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:00,479
i mean i should also say like uh kind of

2546
01:45:59,198 --> 01:46:01,039
separately like one thing that i

2547
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:03,519
definitely think

2548
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:04,158
like perspective wise is i i literally

2549
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:07,920
don't care

2550
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:09,118
either right um so one way to look at it

2551
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,560
is like like i don't care

2552
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:12,399
what people want to do or don't want to

2553
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:15,600
do um

2554
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:17,359
meaning like someone who wants to do

2555
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,400
solo indie development

2556
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:22,559
they should they should do whatever they

2557
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:22,559
want right i don't care at all uh

2558
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:27,839
you know i could i could vaguely try to

2559
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,640
you know

2560
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:32,639
analyze your choices for you um

2561
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:35,119
[Music]

2562
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:36,719
and and you know i don't know but but i

2563
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:38,559
don't care like to me programming is

2564
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:41,840
about the fact that i like programming

2565
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:44,560
it's not about it's not about business

2566
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,840
you know um i'm not a business person

2567
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,119
i'm not here to tell you how to maximize

2568
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:49,600
your returns or something

2569
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:50,559
right so asking me like what you should

2570
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:52,960
use for an engine

2571
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:54,400
is really not that useful so at this

2572
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,600
point i tend to just tell people like i

2573
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:56,719
literally don't care like it's not

2574
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:59,760
really my thing

2575
01:46:56,719 --> 01:47:01,760
i don't care at all about what you use

2576
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:03,600
um if i had to guess i would say you

2577
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:05,940
probably want to use the unreal engine

2578
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,600
or game maker um

2579
01:47:05,939 --> 01:47:10,079
[Music]

2580
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:11,039
from what i've seen yeah i probably say

2581
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:13,039
that's what you would do

2582
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:14,399
if you aren't going to roll your own i'd

2583
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:16,000
use one of those

2584
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:17,519
wouldn't probably use unity i think

2585
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,960
unity is probably

2586
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:22,400
headed for a i would say unity

2587
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,480
is not long for this world like if you

2588
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:26,000
look at their company's financials

2589
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:28,718
they're a public company publicly traded

2590
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,279
company now their financials aren't good

2591
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:32,800
they don't make money on selling tools

2592
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:33,599
to game developers they make money on

2593
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,480
ads

2594
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,360
on advertising and such so i i just i

2595
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:39,359
mean i think putting

2596
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:40,559
yeah like i would bail from unity as

2597
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:43,359
soon as you possibly can

2598
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,800
that that'd be my like vague looking at

2599
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:48,079
reading the tarot

2600
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:49,440
you know cards reading the tea leaves

2601
01:47:48,079 --> 01:47:50,880
i would say bail from unity as soon as

2602
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:52,158
you can and build a pipeline based on

2603
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,000
something else that something else

2604
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:55,679
doesn't have to be your own

2605
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,679
right like it doesn't have to be your

2606
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:59,520
code base it could be the unreal engine

2607
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:01,199
which i think will be very stable they

2608
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,480
make a crap ton of money they make like

2609
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:04,879
infinite money

2610
01:48:02,479 --> 01:48:05,678
um they're not going anywhere and their

2611
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:08,639
entire

2612
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:09,279
revenue stream is basically built off of

2613
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:12,480
game

2614
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:15,198
game stuff right

2615
01:48:12,479 --> 01:48:15,839
um so so maybe unreal engine it's also

2616
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:18,399
in a lot of

2617
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:19,199
high-end stuff so that's fine so i might

2618
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:20,479
think about that

2619
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:22,079
you could think about just just a

2620
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:23,279
smaller scoped tool so you know if you

2621
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:24,079
get away with something like game maker

2622
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:25,359
a lot of people have a lot of

2623
01:48:24,079 --> 01:48:27,198
positioning to say about that

2624
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:29,198
a lot of games i play in game maker seem

2625
01:48:27,198 --> 01:48:29,759
to run pretty well unlike unity unity

2626
01:48:29,198 --> 01:48:31,359
games

2627
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,159
oftentimes unless they're done by by

2628
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:33,839
people who really know what they're

2629
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:34,638
doing who clean up a lot of unity

2630
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,239
garbage

2631
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:37,840
they often play play really crappy

2632
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:41,118
they're either slow

2633
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:42,239
buggy messy they're like you know um

2634
01:48:41,118 --> 01:48:43,519
game maker doesn't feel that way game

2635
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:45,359
maker feels pretty solid a lot of times

2636
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:48,480
i play gamer it feels pretty solid

2637
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:49,679
right um so

2638
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:52,000
i would say look at game maker look at

2639
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:53,760
unreal i think those

2640
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,920
would be potentially reasonable things

2641
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,159
to base you know your

2642
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,600
your engines off of whatever you're

2643
01:48:58,158 --> 01:49:01,279
doing

2644
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:02,639
i like i think at this point i was

2645
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:04,639
strongly advised against unity

2646
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:05,920
i don't see that going positively in the

2647
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:09,199
long run

2648
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,399
um i don't have a enough insight into

2649
01:49:09,198 --> 01:49:12,000
some of the new things like there's the

2650
01:49:10,399 --> 01:49:13,598
godot engine people have been working on

2651
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,319
that

2652
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:17,119
there's like other engines that that

2653
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:18,880
were like

2654
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:20,319
uh i don't even remember what they all

2655
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,520
are but there's like other engines out

2656
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:26,000
there

2657
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:28,239
um i just don't have any insight into

2658
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,039
but that's your decision and i don't

2659
01:49:28,238 --> 01:49:30,799
care

2660
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:33,599
um you know use whatever you want that's

2661
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:36,400
just my basic uh thing

2662
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:37,679
and i can't really tell you what's the

2663
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:39,519
right decision for you

2664
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:40,719
i like programming so i'm probably never

2665
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,960
gonna ship something ever

2666
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:44,560
that's not on something that i wrote

2667
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:47,118
whether it's a game or otherwise

2668
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:49,360
it's just not what i do and i don't care

2669
01:49:47,118 --> 01:49:50,799
i'd rather fail to ship a game on my own

2670
01:49:49,359 --> 01:49:51,679
engine than succeed in shipping on

2671
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:55,360
someone else's

2672
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:58,719
because i don't prioritize that

2673
01:49:55,359 --> 01:50:02,319
right um i don't

2674
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:05,198
enjoy using engines so

2675
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:06,319
i would if i was gonna do that i would

2676
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:09,039
just go do something

2677
01:50:06,319 --> 01:50:09,599
that made money just purely to make

2678
01:50:09,039 --> 01:50:12,800
money

2679
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:14,000
right um i'd i'd go do a web startup or

2680
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,840
something

2681
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,920
and just try to rake in the cash if i

2682
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:20,639
was going to do that i wouldn't

2683
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,079
say how what's the most economically

2684
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:24,079
feasible way to make this

2685
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:26,319
game because to me that just doesn't

2686
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:28,880
interest me i i don't care

2687
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:30,000
about that at all um and so that's

2688
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:34,000
really not something i can

2689
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
i can make much um

2690
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:39,919
of a of a recommendation on so

2691
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:41,599
so yeah so my only recommendations is

2692
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:43,118
what i just said um

2693
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:44,319
and that's based solely on just looking

2694
01:50:43,118 --> 01:50:45,839
at what i what i would anticipate

2695
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:47,439
unity's future to be and i just don't

2696
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:51,199
see there being one for games

2697
01:50:47,439 --> 01:50:53,919
i don't see that being likely right um

2698
01:50:51,198 --> 01:50:55,198
but i do see i do think you will have

2699
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:57,520
options

2700
01:50:55,198 --> 01:50:59,919
um game maker and unreal seem like solid

2701
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:03,119
options for the future to me

2702
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:04,480
um the problems with unreal engine are

2703
01:51:03,118 --> 01:51:07,679
that it's like this massively

2704
01:51:04,479 --> 01:51:09,839
over complicated sprawling mess right

2705
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:10,880
um so you know you want to make this

2706
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,480
game that's

2707
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,719
pretty simple because you're an indie

2708
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:16,319
dev and here comes this gigantic code

2709
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:17,118
base that people use for shipping

2710
01:51:16,319 --> 01:51:21,840
gigantic

2711
01:51:17,118 --> 01:51:21,839
aaa titles right um

2712
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,760
so you know i can appreciate that that's

2713
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:27,118
why i always try to say like you know

2714
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,560
like some stuff like game maker

2715
01:51:27,118 --> 01:51:29,839
it seems pretty solid if you just want

2716
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,880
to work on a game you don't want to

2717
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:33,360
think about coding you don't want to

2718
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:36,480
think about engines and stuff

2719
01:51:33,359 --> 01:51:40,079
um i would say

2720
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:41,359
like if you if you can get away with

2721
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:44,158
like a 2d

2722
01:51:41,359 --> 01:51:46,000
like you're doing a 2d platformer kind

2723
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:46,319
of a thing is in your wheelhouse you

2724
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
know

2725
01:51:46,319 --> 01:51:49,439
take a look at game maker because it

2726
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,880
just seems like it's the kind of thing

2727
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:52,238
that's easy to get running quickly and

2728
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,960
it produces a pretty quality product at

2729
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:55,919
the end of the day

2730
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:56,319
reasonably in my opinion unreal engine

2731
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,920
is

2732
01:51:56,319 --> 01:52:00,000
obviously just massive and sprawling and

2733
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:02,319
is probably more

2734
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,840
technical expertise and you want to

2735
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:05,599
really take on as an indie dev

2736
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:07,199
but you know if you're trying to do a 3d

2737
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:09,520
thing i don't know what other option i

2738
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:12,000
really don't think it's solid to base

2739
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:13,599
uh your future on a unity based engine i

2740
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,840
just i think it's a huge mistake these

2741
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:17,840
days i really think it's a huge mistake

2742
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:39,119
if you keep your unreal game to just

2743
01:52:37,279 --> 01:52:40,719
stuff achievable and blueprint it seems

2744
01:52:39,118 --> 01:52:42,479
pretty accessible if you want to do c

2745
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:46,239
plus plus code then it's very nuts yeah

2746
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:46,238
that could be true um

2747
01:52:46,479 --> 01:52:49,598
like like if you're just trying to make

2748
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:50,960
like a skin on a first-person shooter

2749
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:53,199
like you know kind of all that stuff's

2750
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:57,039
like already in there right

2751
01:52:53,198 --> 01:52:58,638
um and so so i could easily see like

2752
01:52:57,039 --> 01:53:00,238
there being certain tranches of games

2753
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:01,440
where it's like okay unreal engine is

2754
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:02,000
pretty easy for us to use we just kind

2755
01:53:01,439 --> 01:53:03,439
of like

2756
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,800
we just kind of run the pre-built

2757
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:05,678
executables we don't really program

2758
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,360
anything in c

2759
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:09,440
we use blueprint to just just do some

2760
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:11,759
light like game logic on top

2761
01:53:09,439 --> 01:53:13,598
and that's the game you know or it's

2762
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,560
like a walking simulator it's like fire

2763
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:16,159
watch or something

2764
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:17,920
right it seems like you could just do

2765
01:53:16,158 --> 01:53:19,279
that right because there's no game in

2766
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,399
the game it's just we walk around

2767
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:21,920
environments

2768
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:24,238
and we trigger some sound effects and

2769
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,920
that's the game like

2770
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:27,919
you probably nowadays could get away

2771
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:30,079
with like no programming basically like

2772
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:31,359
just some graphs and blueprint i would

2773
01:53:30,079 --> 01:53:31,760
imagine would get you where you need to

2774
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:34,399
go

2775
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:35,280
so again like like some things to think

2776
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:37,118
about are like

2777
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:38,479
like what are the actual technical

2778
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:40,238
requirements for this game

2779
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:41,839
and can we get away with not really

2780
01:53:40,238 --> 01:53:43,198
doing anything you know

2781
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,960
might be true there's plenty of games

2782
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:48,960
that are that way

2783
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:51,279
um so again really don't know uh

2784
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:52,319
and and don't care like i really don't

2785
01:53:51,279 --> 01:53:54,639
care

2786
01:53:52,319 --> 01:53:56,399
what people do i'm only interested in

2787
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:59,920
people who want to learn to program

2788
01:53:56,399 --> 01:54:00,479
engine code and i want to show them how

2789
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:02,639
to do it

2790
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:04,319
i don't care about people who don't want

2791
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:07,359
to make engine code

2792
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:09,359
they should go not make engine code

2793
01:54:07,359 --> 01:54:12,559
right and i'm definitely not interested

2794
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:16,319
in trying to convince people

2795
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:17,280
um to do something else like they should

2796
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:23,840
do whatever they want

2797
01:54:17,279 --> 01:54:23,840
you know

2798
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:51,839
all right

2799
01:55:02,399 --> 01:55:04,879
all right thank you everyone for joining

2800
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,560
me for the episode of handmade heroes

2801
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:07,679
pleasure coding with you as always if

2802
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,639
you would like to follow the series at

2803
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:10,118
home

2804
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:11,840
you can always print the game on

2805
01:55:10,118 --> 01:55:13,359
handmadehero.org and it comes with

2806
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:14,239
source code so you can follow along with

2807
01:55:13,359 --> 01:55:18,960
it

2808
01:55:14,238 --> 01:55:20,399
um we got better results today than i

2809
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:23,039
was expecting

2810
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:23,839
so i guess i don't even really know next

2811
01:55:23,039 --> 01:55:24,960
week if we

2812
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:27,599
will keep working on the collision

2813
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:28,560
sector that might actually be sufficient

2814
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:31,119
for

2815
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,320
pretty much most of our development that

2816
01:55:31,118 --> 01:55:35,439
seemed pretty solid

2817
01:55:32,319 --> 01:55:37,519
collision section wise um so

2818
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:39,678
next weekend we might stop working on

2819
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:41,599
that uh the only thing we

2820
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:42,960
might do is introduce a spatial

2821
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,560
partition so that the collision sector

2822
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,840
will scale better right now it's it's

2823
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,719
literally checking all the entities in

2824
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,960
the active set

2825
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:50,399
all of them every time it does that

2826
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:51,599
collision check which is way too many

2827
01:55:50,399 --> 01:55:53,679
entities

2828
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:56,639
computers are crazy fast it's insane

2829
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:58,000
that it runs real time like it does

2830
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:00,560
especially when you open up a web page

2831
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,279
the thing can barely run um

2832
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:04,960
what can i say uh so so that probably

2833
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:06,719
should get handled we probably should

2834
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:09,279
put a space partition just to to keep

2835
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:11,760
that under control i think we

2836
01:56:09,279 --> 01:56:13,359
don't want to have this thing where we

2837
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,320
started adding a bunch of entities to

2838
01:56:13,359 --> 01:56:15,439
the world and then

2839
01:56:14,319 --> 01:56:16,880
the collision detector becomes a

2840
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:18,000
bottleneck so we should just put a space

2841
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:22,400
partition to keep it

2842
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:24,000
like nice and 01 style uh cost

2843
01:56:22,399 --> 01:56:25,439
um and then so i think that's probably

2844
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,679
what i'll do next weekend and then we'll

2845
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:30,559
move on to just gameplay

2846
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:32,079
glove programming and fighting uh to try

2847
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,639
and try and make some enemies that are

2848
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:35,679
fun

2849
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:36,880
to engage with with the glove um

2850
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:38,480
which is the reason we built the clutch

2851
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:39,840
inductor in the first place so we'll try

2852
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:41,279
to do that

2853
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:44,000
and come up with how we want that to

2854
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:47,118
work we'll work on that

2855
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,399
and uh uh so next week's space partition

2856
01:56:47,118 --> 01:56:51,039
weekend after that

2857
01:56:48,399 --> 01:56:51,679
uh doing some stuff with like collision

2858
01:56:51,039 --> 01:56:53,198
response

2859
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:54,800
what happens when you hit somebody with

2860
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:56,879
a glove how do we want the glove control

2861
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:58,480
to work uh do we want like enemies to be

2862
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,800
like pushed by the glove and things like

2863
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:00,238
that

2864
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:01,840
so now that we have a collision detector

2865
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:03,118
what do we actually do with the

2866
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:05,039
information we get back to the picture

2867
01:57:03,118 --> 01:57:07,039
besides just keeping things from going

2868
01:57:05,039 --> 01:57:08,158
into other things what do we actually

2869
01:57:07,039 --> 01:57:10,639
want the results

2870
01:57:08,158 --> 01:57:12,638
of those collisions to be in a game play

2871
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:14,639
logic sense is what we'll do after that

2872
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:16,000
so that's the robot going forward uh

2873
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:18,480
hope to be back here for that

2874
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,479
un until then have fun program everyone

2875
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:23,359
and i'll see y'all on the internet

2876
01:57:20,479 --> 01:57:25,839
um and and so on so take it easy

2877
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:25,839
everybody
