1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:10,830
okay thank you everyone for joining me

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,809
on today's very special handmade hero

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,280
episode I don't actually know that it's

4
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:16,559
going to be very special but isn't

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,799
everyday kind of special at the end of

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:24,479
the date like I mean if every day is

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,010
precious I i think that there's probably

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,570
some kind of weird spiritual book you

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,039
could read somewhere that says something

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,660
like you need to treat every day as

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,780
precious or special or some other

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,750
nonsense like this and so I feel like if

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,270
today isn't special then really no day

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,820
is special and who wants to live in a

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,469
world where not every day is special or

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,649
that they never have a special day I

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,090
mean furthermore why would you want to

18
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,128
have only some days be special when

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,199
every day could be special I think it

20
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,179
just doesn't even make any sense so I

21
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:55,979
feel like this is going to be a very

22
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,140
special episode of Hamid hero just like

23
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,599
every episode of handmade hero is

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,030
incredibly incredibly special almost

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,140
oppressively special if you will so

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,840
special that it's specialness may in

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,299
fact render everything else that you do

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,700
in your life sort of inconsequential and

29
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:20,759
dismal by comparison that's not my fault

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,950
that's just how special we are here so

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,140
let's go ahead and get started because

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,299
we have some work to do today it's day 2

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,359
65 and you're going to want to unpack

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,650
the very special code from day 2 64 into

35
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,700
a directory somewhere if you're trying

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,840
to follow along with what I'm doing

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,400
because that's the code i'm starting

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:44,879
with and honestly it's pretty special so

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:47,820
here comes our code and i'm going to

40
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,548
compile it and then i'm going to run

41
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,548
nope not like that and then i'm going to

42
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,159
run it using the very special and i mean

43
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,500
that in sort of a different way now

44
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:01,530
microsoft visual studio so let's go

45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,659
ahead and get that running here where we

46
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,310
left off is we had made some little

47
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,759
buttons right that we could use to

48
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,460
interact with our profiler or really

49
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,759
anything else that we wanted to and

50
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,320
we we just put those in and we have a

51
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,389
number of things now where we've got

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,250
like sort of debug control stuff that we

53
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,019
can use we can pause the game and jump

54
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,219
around and that sort of stuff but we

55
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,200
kind of need to clean a little bit of

56
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,150
this up first of all we have to clean up

57
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,599
the layout thing a little bit because we

58
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,150
never got the we never really did a

59
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:39,930
proper abstraction for lines that have

60
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:43,730
stuff glommed on to themselves because

61
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,260
as you can see our first one is

62
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:48,689
erroneously not indented all these

63
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:50,280
should have been indented right and

64
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:53,879
similarly we sort of have a weird

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,229
situation where we these are kind of we

66
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,639
can't even tell if these are buttons so

67
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:59,489
I think what we want to do is just

68
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,649
expand this UI a little bit and make

69
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,330
this work a little bit better just kind

70
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,400
of clean it up now that we know what it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,620
looks like and have some things that use

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,200
it the other thing that we might want to

73
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,750
do and i'm not sure if we really care

74
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,459
about this or not well you know we could

75
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,080
do to the other thing we could do is put

76
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,340
that off a little bit and what we could

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,990
do is also make a profile top list where

78
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,819
we could base to say like give us what

79
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,400
functions are taking the most time and

80
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:30,150
stuff like that which is pretty handy as

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,010
well right so those are just some things

82
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,599
that we could do I'm not sure exactly

83
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:37,560
what we will do but that's kind of where

84
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,530
we are at and what all this what this

85
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,560
means for for you the the glorified

86
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,599
listener is that today will be a sort of

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,939
a debug profile you I'd a word one way

88
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,489
or the other one thing that I do wonder

89
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:53,340
is do we still have the ability to do

90
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:56,370
all this fancy stuff we do that's pretty

91
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,289
cool I really like how we can tear

92
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,599
things off it's like oh do you want

93
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:03,109
another profile like is this not enough

94
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,280
profiling for you maybe it's not

95
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,380
sometimes you know you just need a

96
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,990
little more profiling so what you can do

97
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,780
is you can just say like oh I want

98
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:17,699
another profile here let's go ahead and

99
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,709
and grab that off we go and now I think

100
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:23,459
if I'm not very much an error which may

101
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,230
be I am you can actually these are

102
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:28,709
totally separate which is kind of

103
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,720
awesome too so I can have two of these

104
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,759
and I can like drill down in one of them

105
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,430
right and it doesn't affect the other

106
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:40,560
one which is also pretty cool right I

107
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:42,209
like that a lot um you know it's just it

108
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,780
just means I think we did a pretty

109
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:54,509
reasonable job on the architecture you

110
00:04:45,779 --> 00:05:01,079
know what I'm saying anyway yeah anyway

111
00:04:54,509 --> 00:05:03,930
uh let's go ahead and and dive in here

112
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,990
so the first thing we need is we need to

113
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:10,918
add into our debug control we need a way

114
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,150
of putting some some pause like we don't

115
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:16,228
really have a way to do the pause

116
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:18,959
control right now and I need to have

117
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:21,149
that happen so what I want to do is say

118
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,569
well we have these boolean buttons so

119
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:27,288
I'm going to make in our debug control

120
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:29,879
wherever that wherever that nonsense is

121
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:37,009
debug control where where are you at

122
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:40,589
it's like frame slider like that oops

123
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:42,810
rain slider in our debug control I want

124
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:46,709
to make some buttons that go with the

125
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:49,860
frame slider that makes sense and I want

126
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:53,038
those to be able to do some operations

127
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,800
for us right so what the first thing I

128
00:05:53,038 --> 00:06:00,228
want to do is make like a pause button

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:03,629
that's that reflects the state of the

130
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:07,680
the debug pause right so we'll just say

131
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:10,288
debug state pause is the state of that

132
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,269
so if it's true then it's paused if it's

133
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:15,418
false it won't be and then in here we

134
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,819
just need a thing which says what kind

135
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:20,549
of interaction we want to do and I guess

136
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,040
in this case we want to do like set u

137
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,689
int32 in Iraq

138
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:29,480
maybe and we just say we want to change

139
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:32,029
the pause to I guess whatever not

140
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,009
whatever isn't right so whatever it

141
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:39,199
isn't right now is what we would change

142
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:41,659
it to and we can just say this is a UN

143
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,750
32 interaction oops it means that close

144
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,510
that pensais will just make one of these

145
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,459
so what I'm going to do here just so you

146
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:51,889
can sort of follow along with what I'm

147
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:53,509
thinking what I'm going to do here is I

148
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,639
want to make ways of just making these

149
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:56,839
interactions pretty easy to create so

150
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,329
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

151
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,399
make a generous interaction that's a UN

152
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:02,599
32 interaction where I pass in what the

153
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,859
type of unit that you and 32 or

154
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,220
interaction is than anything that does

155
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,259
that can can use this function to

156
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:17,230
generate one so in this case I'm going

157
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:17,230
to do debug pause you know or set pause

158
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:25,760
and so in here i'm going to say debug

159
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:29,360
interaction set pause and that's going

160
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,069
to toggle the paws on and off so that's

161
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,530
all I really needed that to do and

162
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:46,849
similarly i'll do another one here which

163
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:51,259
is like let's see I maybe do something

164
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,580
like a set you know to be honest with

165
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,139
you we can even do these fairly

166
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,899
generically like these could be just

167
00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:00,279
like if I wanted to set a value in the

168
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:03,979
debug state I could just make it so we

169
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,989
pass an address so we could do something

170
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,300
even more ridiculous which is just like

171
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,090
you can just do totally generic stuff

172
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,900
here like set you and 32 which is like

173
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:18,319
anything that's a UN 32 it can set right

174
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:21,529
in fact this set element type could even

175
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,230
be written in terms of set you and 32 if

176
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:27,219
that's what we wanted and that kind of

177
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,420
seems like kind of cool to me actually

178
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,490
because then it's literally just a

179
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,950
straight up that it does that anyone can

180
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,519
use so i can say Oh what I wanted to do

181
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,950
was I want

182
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,889
set a particular thing I want to set

183
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,440
whatever the debug pause value was and I

184
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:46,139
want to set it to whatever the debug

185
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,060
pause value is not like whatever the

186
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,669
opposite of it is I can do something

187
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:53,179
like that and I could leverage that same

188
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:56,639
interaction to make some action buttons

189
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:59,879
that were like that allowed me to jump

190
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:03,809
the viewing frame to the various frames

191
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:08,730
that we actually have like these so if I

192
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:11,309
want to jump to oops if I want to jump

193
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:16,200
to the oldest frame then what i could do

194
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:19,919
is say well set you in 32 interaction

195
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:26,400
debug ID I want to set a the viewing

196
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:29,189
frame ordinal and I want to set that to

197
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,220
whatever the oldest frame worried

198
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,110
ordinal is and again that's just kind of

199
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,350
its it's just like a poor man's lambda

200
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:40,550
right I you know if you wanted to start

201
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:43,710
using crazy c++ features which I detest

202
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:46,529
you could imagine making a lambda out of

203
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,120
these for example and you know or some

204
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,309
other kind of a closure if you're in a

205
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:55,230
language that was had better closure

206
00:09:50,309 --> 00:10:05,209
support and that sort of thing so

207
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:05,210
something like this ah you get the idea

208
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:12,689
that's not what I wanted those trees

209
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:15,600
frame ordinal and so then all I'm really

210
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,820
saying is well you know much like we had

211
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,990
and I guess I should get rid of these

212
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:26,250
those don't wait what I'm saying here is

213
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:27,690
that instead of having to make a bunch

214
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,120
of interactions that are specific to

215
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,650
what it is that I'm doing if I just take

216
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,629
a look at like set element type

217
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:35,909
interaction for example and what that

218
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:37,649
does I can make this much more generic

219
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:39,689
by saying instead of set element type

220
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:42,120
interaction I can just make this be a

221
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,260
set you in 32 interaction and instead

222
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,669
it's just like what's the UN 32 target

223
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:48,220
like what am I going to overwrite and

224
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:50,439
one

225
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,360
gonna override it with right and then

226
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,850
instead of having the concept that the

227
00:10:52,360 --> 00:11:03,399
debug element is a separate thing that's

228
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:04,899
like you know more more specialer what

229
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,299
we can do instead is sort of have

230
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:09,399
basically binary functions any kind of

231
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,679
binary function can be represented here

232
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,379
relatively straightforward right we can

233
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,870
do void star target and then we can just

234
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:18,820
sort of say well whatever the the value

235
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:24,070
is that we're going to store goes in the

236
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:27,490
other place and off we go right so at

237
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:29,410
that point I can say okay whatever the

238
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,149
target is that goes into the targets

239
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:35,409
lots of a set of element it's just

240
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:37,750
target now like so whatever the value is

241
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:40,209
goes into the value slot and in this

242
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,490
case we can just generically treat you

243
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,870
at 32 s this way but we'll can have

244
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:48,220
other functions that take other things

245
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:52,149
sighs you in 30 tues like so and that's

246
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,769
a lot more generic right so now when we

247
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,769
go in here instead of set element type

248
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:59,350
we wouldn't even have that one we would

249
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:02,350
just have sent you in 32 then what we

250
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,759
can do is say well the target has to be

251
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,710
the same instead of the element having

252
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:10,629
to be the same and then again can test

253
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:15,660
that generic element there okay so let's

254
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:18,669
push forward so an element interaction

255
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:20,919
itself I guess we can still have for the

256
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:24,219
time being since that's not particularly

257
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:27,969
unusual we can still put that in here I

258
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,100
do think though I'm going to not quite

259
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,320
replace that just yet because I want to

260
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,060
do a couple of things first so when we

261
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,980
do a set profile graph route that is

262
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:40,959
probably another example of a place we

263
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,539
could have done a set if this just be a

264
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,940
set pointer right you could imagine this

265
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:49,839
just being a set pointer interaction so

266
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:53,740
we could do something like set pointer

267
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:57,070
interaction and we would just say well

268
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,200
whatever the element is that we're

269
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,410
talking about here we know that it'sit's

270
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,100
grid that's the thing that gets set

271
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:08,919
we know that the graphs profile root

272
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,240
node we know what that is because that's

273
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:14,708
what are our graph view information

274
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:22,000
tells us unfortunately guess I don't

275
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:31,149
know if I have that in here I can easily

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:33,850
get it right because here's that debug

277
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:35,889
view so if I want to I can say alright

278
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,600
well we'll get the debug view then in

279
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,709
fact I could even if I want to I guess

280
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
do it a little higher up although

281
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:43,059
there's no really need to do that unless

282
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,500
we're actually in the rectangle in

283
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:47,018
question so i might as well as leave it

284
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,419
there but point being I can do this zoom

285
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,970
interaction instead by essentially just

286
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:53,559
saying I want to do a set pointer

287
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,480
interaction that's that pointer

288
00:13:53,559 --> 00:14:00,188
interaction is going to set the view

289
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,709
route grid whatever that thing is let's

290
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:07,110
see what that actually is I'm going to

291
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:11,438
look for a set for cloud graph route

292
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:13,810
here so set profile graph route what I

293
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:15,759
want to do is do exactly this so I want

294
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:18,179
to set the profile grid I'm just going

295
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,610
to say hey here's that profile graph

296
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:24,549
grid I want you to overwrite that with

297
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:31,800
my grid that I'm looking at right now

298
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:34,809
and that's all I have to say about that

299
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:37,229
so this all goes away and now we are

300
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:41,979
just left with this which is much nicer

301
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:50,079
right so again that means we can get rid

302
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:52,629
of some of these interactions oops we

303
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:58,269
can we can get rid of all of these

304
00:14:52,629 --> 00:15:01,049
really like these are gone we could in

305
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:03,578
fact get rid of probably even this one

306
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:07,929
but przemek I'm going to keep going

307
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:12,568
first so let's go ahead and say what

308
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:12,568
else we got here so debug interaction

309
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:18,470
here's another zoom interaction for set

310
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:26,690
profile graph root right again this is

311
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:31,310
exactly the same thing as before it's

312
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:33,950
just this code and we should probably

313
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:37,579
pull this out anyway this is some common

314
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:46,820
code that we don't really need to have

315
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:48,410
multiple copies of right i mean these

316
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,760
we're not getting anything out of that

317
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:55,179
duplication it's just wasted so here we

318
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,519
are at element interaction i believe

319
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:00,439
element interaction is probably still

320
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,210
fine like i said we're gonna probably

321
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,590
put that back and i just want it to be

322
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,370
gone for now so i can look at all the

323
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:09,019
debug errors let's see here element is

324
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:14,720
not a member what's going on here why am

325
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:16,730
I not there we go a debug ID undeclared

326
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:26,810
Jennifer I thought we had debug ID its

327
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:29,389
graph ID I guess but what were we using

328
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:32,209
for these interactions before we should

329
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:34,779
have been able to have a debug ID for

330
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:37,040
them why don't we have one at the moment

331
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:42,889
that's a little bit weird we're we

332
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:47,029
actually using the graph ID in this case

333
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:48,470
I guess we never made another debug ID

334
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:52,339
for these guys which we should have

335
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:54,940
because they have one right they do have

336
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,960
debug IDs it's the stored event pointer

337
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,600
not the sort of n pointer it's the

338
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,810
element pointer is a more accurate one

339
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,480
than the graph so graph truss element

340
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:07,899
pointer would be a good debug ID like to

341
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,900
do here too

342
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:30,808
ah yes element is done a number of debug

343
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:37,439
interaction sorry debugger idea I'm

344
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:53,490
cardona fire all right graph ID and same

345
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:55,799
thing here set pointer interaction and

346
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,690
if I not found that's true I'm going to

347
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:02,369
I'm going to grab these guys and just

348
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:07,009
pull them up to the top out to where

349
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:14,359
we've got our interactions somewhere

350
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:14,359
we're going to we're probably up here

351
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:23,629
and I'm going to make two of these so

352
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:32,179
we've got set pointer interaction and

353
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:35,400
that's just going to have you know a

354
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:39,240
pointer to pointer unfortunately see is

355
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:42,450
bad at this c++ i should say c is not

356
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,299
bad at c++ because like i said they

357
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,880
always get everything wrong and so

358
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:50,039
that's actually one that's going to be a

359
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:56,520
little annoying as you'll see but it's

360
00:18:50,039 --> 00:19:00,178
okay to do set pointer and set unit 32

361
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:06,049
and then that's I think I'll we should

362
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,050
need for what we're trying to

363
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:18,049
what is the actual definition here I

364
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:27,129
guess we can just use generic well you

365
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:29,808
know I'm going to make another one okay

366
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:38,390
debug interaction set pointer I didn't

367
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:43,039
make one of those decided all right

368
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:45,700
let's keep cruising here oops yeah and

369
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:50,480
so this is the annoying part like I

370
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:52,730
don't know why they insist on doing that

371
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,039
I assume that it has something to do

372
00:19:52,730 --> 00:20:03,470
with the inheritance pointers being

373
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:05,029
different but it would be nice if you

374
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,558
could have a this is a pointer to a

375
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:13,579
pointer all pointers are the same size

376
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:16,730
trust me stop complaining because

377
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:19,189
pointers you know could be different

378
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,690
sizes in other you know some kind of

379
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,058
weird implementation of some other

380
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,730
feature but I want the version where I'm

381
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:29,420
saying no I'm telling you all my

382
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:32,690
pointers are the same size stop your

383
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,870
whining but there's no way to do that

384
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:40,179
that I know of that is relatively

385
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:44,239
straightforward anyway so let's continue

386
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:47,090
here this is the slider ID stuff again

387
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:52,789
this interaction we can just use set use

388
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:55,549
and 32 interaction again this is a again

389
00:20:52,789 --> 00:21:00,379
totally trivial I can just say whatever

390
00:20:55,549 --> 00:21:07,190
i'm doing i'm going to set the debug

391
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:10,400
State viewing frame ordinal and I'm

392
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:13,009
going to set that to the frame index and

393
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,929
this will no longer pause when we click

394
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:16,129
but that's okay because I don't really I

395
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:17,720
never really wanted that I just did that

396
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,280
because we didn't have a way to do click

397
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,900
pause if that makes sense

398
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,049
I'm sorry we didn't have a way to

399
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:27,019
actually manually pause what I want to

400
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:32,569
do is like manually pause because most

401
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:35,150
of time I'm not scrubbing all right so

402
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:42,139
let's see this is set profile graft

403
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:46,180
route so this is this is the graph so

404
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:46,180
what is the actual value their graph

405
00:21:46,299 --> 00:22:00,619
let's see you profile graph Fergus to

406
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:03,500
scrap wood so what I want to do here is

407
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:06,799
I want to do set pointer interaction I

408
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,970
want to set the graph wid and I want to

409
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,480
set it to nothing so that it you know

410
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,480
just get cleared

411
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:25,639
what is the same and also I suppose now

412
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:31,100
I can just make this this can actually

413
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,560
just come in here and do this okay so

414
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:37,939
set element type interaction this is

415
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:39,349
really just to set you in 32 now and I'm

416
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:49,009
just setting whatever the element type

417
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:53,240
is and this doesn't need to be there

418
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:56,029
anymore let's see set pointer

419
00:22:53,240 --> 00:23:01,190
interaction of course yes thank you so

420
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:08,119
much for reminding me of that and the

421
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:10,970
problem is so if you just set it to

422
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,839
avoid star because I could just do avoid

423
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:16,759
star but then you would oftentimes

424
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,649
accidentally forget it and do that what

425
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,660
you don't want so you want to generate

426
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,580
it in the error if you don't do this but

427
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,740
you don't want to have to cast it every

428
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:29,569
time for no apparent reason it's really

429
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:37,220
annoying I hate that anyway let's see

430
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:39,730
boolean button it doesn't take three

431
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,730
arguments

432
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:49,160
really it doesn't

433
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:56,279
oh you're right it doesn't so why are we

434
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,270
oh because it couldn't compile that you

435
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:05,160
and 32 okay that's fine all right can't

436
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:15,119
convert debug type to you in 32 that

437
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:20,070
when I suppose is okay pause is it just

438
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:21,719
called debug Paul's know what's it

439
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:24,089
actually called we have that pause I

440
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:37,490
know we do because it's in there pause

441
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:40,259
duh so let's see set UN 32 interaction

442
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:43,940
cannot convert are going to be 32 to you

443
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:43,940
32 that's fine too

444
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:59,829
something accidentally put a period

445
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:03,580
instead of a comma and let's see a lot

446
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:06,668
of modify variable most you submit to

447
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:09,009
the hydrogen element so this we have to

448
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:12,460
reinstate which we will so that'll be

449
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:15,278
fine in a second profile graph root

450
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,509
boobs profile graph root is not

451
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:24,990
something we need anymore we only need

452
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:27,490
set unit 32 which is going to do a

453
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:31,058
simple right it's going to say the

454
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:36,149
interaction target equals the

455
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:40,269
interaction UN 32 like so this will

456
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:42,428
disappear this will cast to au 32 so

457
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:44,908
they can write it and the Zach same

458
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:48,820
thing will happen in the pointer case

459
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:52,570
like so it'll take the target like this

460
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:57,819
and it will write the pointer into it if

461
00:25:52,569 --> 00:26:05,589
that makes sense all right so getting

462
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:14,980
down to very few errors now that is

463
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:19,869
is also fine and so is that and we are

464
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:22,329
done so that's good so that's all

465
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:24,788
finished so now all I have to do is pop

466
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:32,319
back up here and allow there to be a

467
00:26:24,788 --> 00:26:39,278
data member who is the element and never

468
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:42,339
done alright so let's see if we're still

469
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:47,259
working we still work like that pretty

470
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:50,829
well we can still zoom I believe it yet

471
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:54,759
looks fine what else can we do here we

472
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:57,009
can now test to see whether our debug

473
00:26:54,759 --> 00:27:00,908
control works at all here's our jump

474
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:03,009
commands here's our paws so what I'm

475
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:06,220
going to do there sit pause and see we

476
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:10,089
stop pause again we keep going so that's

477
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:14,819
good I can jump to the oldest the most

478
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:16,898
or the most recent in either case right

479
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:19,898
should really make what when you're

480
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:20,918
viewing show up more but because it we

481
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:22,599
should probably make that be like an

482
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,149
outline across the thing so you can see

483
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,839
what the filled color is anyway a lot of

484
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:34,418
stuff we could do there to improve it

485
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:37,418
but basically all good all right so

486
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:42,009
that's all happy now what I think

487
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:46,899
probably we should do is I'd like to go

488
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:49,028
ahead and clean up the layout code now

489
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:52,119
because like you saw the layout codes a

490
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:53,980
little bit busted there I am wondering

491
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:56,709
if now might be a good time to split

492
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,419
this into a second file as well because

493
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,370
we've got like a bunch of code that's UI

494
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:03,009
code and a bunch of code that's

495
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:06,969
collation code and I am just wondering

496
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:10,898
if maybe it's at the point where the you

497
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:13,319
know the UI code can sort of be included

498
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,319
separately

499
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:22,759
so I'm thinking anyway and we could sort

500
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:25,779
of start that right we could sort of

501
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:28,160
start that and so maybe I'll do that

502
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:33,559
let's take a look at what would happen

503
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:40,400
if i was to pull out let's see here so

504
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:45,349
oops not for quota let's say I was going

505
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:49,040
to go and copy this file at that age I

506
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:56,619
copy this into handmade debug you i dot

507
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:56,619
cpp or something and then i will load

508
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:10,399
code you i dot cpp let's see here okay

509
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:11,839
uh so I've got this file now and i'm

510
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:16,480
just going to start pulling these things

511
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:19,189
out i'm going to include a handmade

512
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,240
debug you I Daisuke in here I don't know

513
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,029
exactly where I'm going to occlude it

514
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,279
yet i don't care at the moment but i'm

515
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:28,430
going to start pulling out some of the

516
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:32,750
code that i would need for for this

517
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:36,380
stuff to work right so let's take a look

518
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:39,650
at a given row like that sort of stuff i

519
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:47,650
want to grab some of these out here so

520
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:47,650
let's take all of this stuff

521
00:29:54,220 --> 00:30:13,159
and maybe even all of this stuff and put

522
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:15,499
it out here all right and let's take a

523
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:18,200
look here interactions I don't know

524
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:22,249
where interactions really make the most

525
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,889
sense to be we even have such thing as a

526
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:27,079
variable iterator anymore we do it's in

527
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:28,579
this nonsense debug draw main menu

528
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:30,978
should really be recursive and we should

529
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:33,019
get rid of this this stuff there's no

530
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:34,848
reason why we to do it that way anymore

531
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:37,548
I think I was just showing how you could

532
00:30:34,848 --> 00:30:43,398
do it that way or something I don't know

533
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:45,888
it was dumb yeah a lot of this stuff is

534
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:47,689
just kind of sticking around I don't

535
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:49,939
even think we use that debug statistics

536
00:30:47,690 --> 00:31:02,320
stuff anymore either anyway put that in

537
00:30:49,940 --> 00:31:02,320
there I guess I'll also maybe copy this

538
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:21,079
and make this a place where we can store

539
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:27,349
the thus trucks okay so here's the

540
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:29,298
layout code that we have so far and if

541
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:32,869
we counter the interactions as part of

542
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:39,740
it which maybe we do also want to do we

543
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:41,000
would grab these out as well so these

544
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:46,159
are probably first because everyone else

545
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:50,269
talks about these usually and these are

546
00:31:46,159 --> 00:32:00,049
all for the collation stuff except for

547
00:31:50,269 --> 00:32:02,269
maybe this and the debug tree I guess we

548
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:04,398
could also say was maybe well not really

549
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:05,480
it the rendering of it and the structure

550
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:10,729
of it I'm going to keep them a little

551
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:19,179
bit separate for now just cuz do we use

552
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:19,179
debug string anymore but what is that

553
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,519
that appears nowhere in here

554
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:36,438
I don't really know what that does or if

555
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:38,389
anyone uses it anymore I don't think

556
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:42,798
anyone does you know what we're going to

557
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:44,058
do here we're going to comment this out

558
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:51,918
for a moment and then we're going to

559
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:57,348
delete it if nobody uses it I don't know

560
00:32:51,919 --> 00:33:01,219
if anyone does anyway so yeah so what we

561
00:32:57,348 --> 00:33:08,558
can do here is we could say well this

562
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:15,489
code you know can include debug handmade

563
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:24,368
debug you I that H and compile that and

564
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:27,858
obviously we got up pre declare that and

565
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:30,288
that looks like about it interaction is

566
00:33:27,858 --> 00:33:32,808
hot is not found that's because we

567
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:43,338
actually didn't copy that over probably

568
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:47,229
should interaction is hot and okay all

569
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:50,479
of you should come over here

570
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:52,639
interactions are equal also and debug

571
00:33:50,479 --> 00:34:02,439
kick all of that stuff should probably

572
00:33:52,638 --> 00:34:10,788
be in here right so debug that CP

573
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:13,579
actions are equal and all of this stuff

574
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:17,720
debug event to text I don't know about

575
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:20,079
that let's take a look debug IDs are

576
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,078
equal

577
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:28,699
that should probably just be something

578
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,940
that is included in the H file I'm

579
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:37,308
guessing right that's probably something

580
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:55,398
that should be in here so I need debug

581
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:58,369
get text size and probably debug text

582
00:34:55,398 --> 00:35:01,818
out at like probably text app all this

583
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:15,019
stuff should probably be in there right

584
00:35:01,818 --> 00:35:18,079
I would be my guess x 0 is this oh man

585
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:20,238
we still have like highlighting control

586
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,450
escape codes in here who was it that

587
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:27,289
made me add those that I remember that

588
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:29,868
was ridiculous but somebody was like can

589
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:33,289
we make it have like color codes in

590
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:34,369
there and I'm like what yes but why and

591
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:38,509
I don't know that they ever actually

592
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:42,318
provided me a why that I'm actually okay

593
00:35:38,509 --> 00:35:46,548
with but but we did it anyway and now

594
00:35:42,318 --> 00:35:52,748
it's in there clogging up the code okay

595
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:57,259
so debug get States debug text out at is

596
00:35:52,748 --> 00:35:59,768
that can we make debug text out at take

597
00:35:57,259 --> 00:35:59,769
this now

598
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:07,039
is there actually anywhere that matters

599
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,150
like what even is the above text line is

600
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,210
that something we even need because I

601
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:21,059
don't think we need it anymore right yet

602
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:22,860
nobody uses that goodbye and debug text

603
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:24,860
out at everyone always has the debug

604
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,240
state when they're actually calling that

605
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:29,760
so it's just a holdover from the old

606
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:42,209
days that we were ever calling that in a

607
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:45,260
way that didn't have all right so now

608
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:48,720
we've isolated that stuff which is good

609
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:50,280
that's step one so now I can like sort

610
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,949
of see what we've actually built here

611
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,780
for our system in a little more concise

612
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:56,279
fashion which is kind of nice right

613
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,620
again people often ask me how do you

614
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,570
divide files up as if there is a magic

615
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:05,190
answer but there is no magic answer my

616
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,110
procedure is just a divided files up in

617
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,460
whatever way makes it easiest for me to

618
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:11,300
concentrate on the information I want

619
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,829
some day after Allen Webster is done

620
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,920
pounding editors into the ground with

621
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:19,139
his raw and meaty fists we probably

622
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,510
won't even ever think about files again

623
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:23,039
because why would you there's no files

624
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,330
are stupid they don't even make any

625
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:25,880
sense I don't know why we're still

626
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:28,349
programming with them it's ridiculous

627
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,789
you'll just be programming along and

628
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:31,289
you'll say i want to see these four

629
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,480
functions and those will be the

630
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:35,489
functions you see that's like how any

631
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,760
sane person would have made code editing

632
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:42,019
if they weren't from 1950 but you know

633
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,640
what are you gonna do anyway point being

634
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:46,769
since we're still stuck with text the

635
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,299
way i organize files is I separate them

636
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:51,199
by the stuff that I want to see together

637
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:55,110
that makes it easy for me to think about

638
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:56,849
how that system is working like quickly

639
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,260
see it which is a little harder on

640
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:01,460
stream because I have a lot less screen

641
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:04,350
space since I have to use a big font in

642
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:08,550
1920 x 1080 but it's still the same

643
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:09,869
thing applies alright so the first thing

644
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,340
I'm going to do here is get rid of the

645
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:14,509
stupid debug prefix that I put on

646
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,510
everything for no apparent reason

647
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:24,350
and so that was like functions here so

648
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,490
it's going to call that tech stopped

649
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:27,869
because they all take a debug state is

650
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:30,239
the first parameter so there's really no

651
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:32,069
reason for it we know that operator

652
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:33,989
overloading you know I'm not trying to

653
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:38,370
they're only in here for this particular

654
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:42,479
code anyway you know what this why is

655
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:47,940
this function even here text out at he's

656
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,440
just the same as debug text up so yeah

657
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,670
it's kind of a sure game anyway that

658
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,990
should definitely be in line doesn't

659
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:56,789
really do anything its translates one

660
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:59,519
call on to another so yeah these guys

661
00:38:56,789 --> 00:39:04,409
are just these guys are just shorthand

662
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:06,599
and that's fine okay so i'm just going

663
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:11,009
to change those quickly and then i'm

664
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:13,429
going to sort of zoom through and trim

665
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,430
that coat off

666
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:20,978
there we go

667
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:42,449
and the last one I think okay again

668
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:45,809
nothing should have changed as you can

669
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:47,939
see and so now I want to go ahead and

670
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:51,179
make this layout system a little bit

671
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,920
more robust so I'm going to take a look

672
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:56,009
at everywhere where I'm actually using

673
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,300
this looks like there's a couple of the

674
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,130
things that I that should probably still

675
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,160
also be pulled over like this is all UI

676
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:08,809
code right so this stuff should get

677
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:08,809
pulled over we've got like what what is

678
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:12,989
deep quest of interesting oh so that's

679
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:15,239
our stuff for testing whether you want

680
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:22,409
to put something alright so this stuff

681
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:26,389
should get moved over as well like so

682
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:32,449
and let's go ahead and grab the set a

683
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:34,679
frame slider draw element drum a menu

684
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:36,000
well so there's a couple of weeks I

685
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:37,949
could look at this and I don't know

686
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,630
which one I want to do I guess what I

687
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:41,369
probably want do for now is maybe not

688
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,410
pull those things out leave those in

689
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:46,969
here and say that this is just for sort

690
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:49,679
of the generic UI code at the moment

691
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:51,059
let's just say that that's true just

692
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:52,559
temporarily I don't know that I want

693
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:56,039
that to be permanently true but I'm

694
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,630
going to leave it that way for now so if

695
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:59,969
I take a look at where we're doing

696
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:01,320
layout again like I was saying I think

697
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:03,059
this is the only place that ever

698
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,769
actually opens a layout at the moment

699
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:07,139
everything else is kind of gets it from

700
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:09,389
cascading away from the main menu stuff

701
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:10,679
so what I want to do here is I want to

702
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:13,379
change this to being something where it

703
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,419
actually initializes this thing a little

704
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:19,019
more formally right so I want to have a

705
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:22,460
thing where i'm like oh hey when you're

706
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:25,619
going to make one of these layouts I

707
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:28,619
want to want you to specifically call me

708
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:32,449
so I want you to say begin layout and

709
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,449
maybe I want you to say n layout as well

710
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:45,849
and this layout obviously has some stuff

711
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:48,850
that has to go into it so for copying

712
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:50,380
this information here then probably what

713
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:53,858
I would need to pass is I need to pass

714
00:41:50,380 --> 00:42:00,010
the debug state I need to pass the mouse

715
00:41:53,858 --> 00:42:06,420
key I need to pass where I want it to be

716
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:09,220
like the upper corner of the layout and

717
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:11,559
that's about it the rest of the stuff i

718
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:15,459
think is not different if that makes

719
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:18,369
sense so here's the upper left corner

720
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,960
bit there's the mastery bit there's the

721
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:23,920
debug state bit and then I just return

722
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,900
that okay and that way we can change

723
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,309
this a little bit more freely now and

724
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:32,530
not have to worry about it so here's

725
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:35,108
debug state here's Mouse p here's three

726
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,369
uip and we might make that a little bit

727
00:42:35,108 --> 00:42:39,269
different in the future but for now

728
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:41,769
that's the way that's going to be okay

729
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:44,320
so that calls begin layout and then at

730
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:48,489
the end of all of it in case it was

731
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,960
important we would call em layout and so

732
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:53,289
in n layout we just passed the layout

733
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,900
that we initialized originally so that

734
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:58,300
does what I wanted there and now

735
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,059
everybody as far as i know is actually

736
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:04,090
going through this layout system so now

737
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:07,929
i can clean it up you know tidy it up a

738
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:09,760
little bit and make it a little more

739
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:12,069
sane so that it can do the layout that

740
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,960
we want because they like we sort of

741
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:16,150
just ad hoc did it and now that we know

742
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,130
everything that we need in there we can

743
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,710
just kind of like lock it down if that

744
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:22,119
makes sense so I'm going to grab the

745
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,800
begin layout in n lae i'm actually going

746
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:26,079
to move those down so i can look at all

747
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,150
of these guys together so we can kind of

748
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:34,029
see here's all of our stuff like begin

749
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:36,309
layout n layout element rectangle and I

750
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:38,590
don't know so begin element rectangle I

751
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:40,179
think an N element are the pair there as

752
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:43,200
well we've got advanced element and so

753
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:43,199
on so

754
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:55,439
what I would like to do is start moving

755
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:55,440
these things into slightly more a

756
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:03,250
slightly more coherent places so what I

757
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:07,120
want to do is say if I'm going to do

758
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:09,730
begin element rectangle then what I need

759
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,589
to do at that point I need to sort of

760
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:15,550
have an opinion about how I'm going to

761
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:18,880
store how I move across the system right

762
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:21,070
and there's two ways i can do that one

763
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,530
ways i can say that when you call begin

764
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:25,539
i figure out where you should be you

765
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:28,210
know and do indentation if you need to

766
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:30,460
do indentation at that point another way

767
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,289
that i can do it is i can say well I'm

768
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,059
you're always going to draw elements

769
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:36,940
where you are right now and then only

770
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:39,509
when you like go to the next line will

771
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:45,190
any sort of changes that you've made

772
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:47,860
take place if that makes sense and the

773
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:54,400
other thing that I think where is the

774
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:56,380
depth stuff here yeah so the depth stuff

775
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,599
is kind of busted as well because that's

776
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,960
just hard coded into the layout right

777
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:04,239
now and I don't really want people

778
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,829
setting that depth manually which is

779
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:09,039
what they're doing now so I'm just going

780
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:10,900
to make it be an underscore and that way

781
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,719
we can know when people want to change

782
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:21,510
the depth if that makes sense so like in

783
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:26,529
here we could just say set up like so

784
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:28,030
right and yet this is I think exactly

785
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:31,570
the thing that I sang for I've complain

786
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:33,130
about this in the past and people don't

787
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,600
believe me I'm not sure why they don't

788
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:37,420
believe me oper Torian people get

789
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:40,960
absolutely livid when I say this but I

790
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:44,170
don't know what to tell them you saw how

791
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,539
long that took me to change right so I

792
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:48,579
have no idea why anyone ever makes

793
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:51,250
getters and setters for everything up

794
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:54,369
front instead of just only doing it when

795
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:57,099
you actually need one it saves you so

796
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:58,989
much time in development it's crazy

797
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:01,299
that you would ever do it another way

798
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,619
the only time you ever make a getter and

799
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,360
setter is if you know that the thing

800
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:07,480
that's changing actually does something

801
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:09,430
or will do something right if you don't

802
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,750
think it ever will you should never make

803
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:12,309
a getter and setter or if you don't

804
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,619
think the probability is like ninety

805
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:17,320
percent right because it costs nothing

806
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:18,880
to fix you change the name of the

807
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,530
variable you replace all the places

808
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:25,079
where it gets called to set call and

809
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:27,220
that's it right I don't know they're

810
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:32,170
they're an interesting Bunch those

811
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:34,539
lobster native programmers they they've

812
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:38,139
got certainly have their way of doing

813
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:40,900
things so anyway I I just want to do

814
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:45,129
that because I don't know I I feel like

815
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:47,740
that hmm I want the latitude here to

816
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:51,490
know that when we call set depth I may

817
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:56,349
have to set a flag to say readjust what

818
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:58,119
you're doing right and I and I don't

819
00:46:56,349 --> 00:47:00,219
really know exactly how that's going to

820
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:07,779
work like so in this case for example if

821
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:10,149
we were going to do a system where you

822
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,760
know not now I think about two if we did

823
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:16,150
a system where where we only actually

824
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,890
start when you call begin element I

825
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:29,160
wouldn't even have to make a set desk

826
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:29,159
all right because if I want to do this

827
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:39,780
yeah if I want to do that I think I

828
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:39,780
actually can because here's my thinking

829
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:48,940
what I could do is say ab32 new line or

830
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:52,539
something like this and it's basically

831
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:54,010
just a latch that says when you tell me

832
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:58,300
that I'm supposed to go to the next line

833
00:47:54,010 --> 00:48:00,100
I'll latch that right and then when you

834
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:03,039
call begin element I'll know that you

835
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:05,469
know if that latch is set I need to do

836
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:09,880
my indentation computation and if it's

837
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:12,039
not set than I don't write and so that

838
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,349
actually seems like I wouldn't I won't

839
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:17,409
even need you know if you wanted cold

840
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:20,319
set the depth you just can I think that

841
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:22,239
probably just works so let me try it

842
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,010
first with that before I unnecessarily

843
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,479
make someone go through an interface

844
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:32,020
that doesn't actually do anything for no

845
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:34,210
reason hmm let that seems fine to me so

846
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:37,900
I'm going to go ahead and set lay out a

847
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:42,340
new line equal to true on startup and

848
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:43,869
that way or you know what I could even

849
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:51,870
do it I can do it with a thought I can

850
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:57,579
do a line initialized and that way Wow

851
00:48:51,869 --> 00:49:00,789
initialized cannot type program type

852
00:48:57,579 --> 00:49:04,150
program cannot all right so i initialize

853
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:05,710
and set that to true or rather i'm not

854
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,510
gonna said anything it'll say false and

855
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:10,030
that way I'll know when the line has not

856
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:15,910
been initialized so when it calls begin

857
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:19,300
element rectangle in this case you know

858
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:20,710
we'll start doing stuff will do are all

859
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,150
of what you know whatever we have to do

860
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,099
here where we do our interactions and

861
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:26,380
then what we'll do is when we say n

862
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:30,460
element and we're computing where this

863
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:35,920
thing should go at that point is when we

864
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:39,670
can initialize the indentation of the of

865
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:42,970
the system right so what I can do here

866
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:46,480
is say alright we've come in here I'm

867
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:49,959
going to say if the layout system has

868
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:54,130
the line initialized unset then I'm

869
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:57,059
going to initialize the line so it won't

870
00:49:54,130 --> 00:50:02,410
happen again and I'm going to set the at

871
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:04,360
equal to the indentation level that

872
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:06,750
we're currently at which is this thing

873
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,750
right yeah

874
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:12,679
so that'll basically say like okay if

875
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:13,940
the line is initialized the line is

876
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:16,759
going to equal well it's going to equal

877
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:23,240
this right it's going to equal the base

878
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:27,380
corner plus the layout depth and a yeah

879
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:29,269
and and off we go although I guess I'm

880
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:33,410
saying in this case going to be X is

881
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:34,849
that way so that's what's going to

882
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:40,789
happen to line malicious lies similarly

883
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:42,589
what I might say here i guess the line y

884
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:44,059
stuff is okay as it is it's a little

885
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,010
janky i wonder if i should clean it up I

886
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:49,039
don't know if I don't need to and we're

887
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:51,470
almost out of time anyway i only got

888
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,630
about 12 minutes left so that's probably

889
00:50:51,469 --> 00:50:54,799
fine anyway that that will do the line

890
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:58,039
initialize stuff so then what i need to

891
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,930
do is say well if we're doing no line

892
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:02,150
feed then we just advance the X if we

893
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:05,989
are doing line feed then we need to

894
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:10,190
advance the y but we can set our line

895
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:13,039
initialize to to false and clear it out

896
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:15,200
similarly we can say that the next y

897
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:20,300
delta since we don't know what it is we

898
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:21,949
can make that happen here and so the

899
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,350
thing that I don't know is why I decided

900
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:27,409
to do it as a delta I'm not one hundred

901
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:29,989
percent certain uh what the real point

902
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:31,819
of that actually is I guess it was

903
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:35,769
easier to do it that way maybe I'm not

904
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,769
sure anyway

905
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:47,420
so yeah so now we've fixed our

906
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:51,639
indentation bugs as well look all of

907
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:53,659
those are gone which is good and yeah

908
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:55,219
what you know what I might do because

909
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:59,029
our profile I might make our profile

910
00:51:55,219 --> 00:52:10,159
default to not go behind my head since

911
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:20,360
that seems like a good thing where is

912
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:25,969
that code debug that's a QP so this

913
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:28,010
thing frame slider frame Slatter so I'm

914
00:52:25,969 --> 00:52:31,039
gonna say like okay let's maybe make it

915
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:32,570
fourteen hundred because well you know

916
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,429
this is the debug system is supposed to

917
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:39,440
be quick and easy I don't really want to

918
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:44,210
have to keep fussing with it okay so off

919
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:48,190
we go of course that makes these pretty

920
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:51,320
tiny we could store less back frames

921
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:53,720
certainly if we wanted to but now at

922
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:59,809
least by default it's not behind my head

923
00:52:53,719 --> 00:53:02,449
which is nice right alright so all of

924
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:06,199
that's good and this all feels much

925
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:07,250
better now and I don't really know that

926
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:08,989
I have anything else say about the

927
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,190
layout stuff other than we probably want

928
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:14,209
to make our buttons look a little bit

929
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:16,610
more like buttons that's probably it so

930
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:21,949
I could do that that's actually pretty

931
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:28,519
easy where is my button it's not here

932
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:31,730
here we go debug you lied SVP button sew

933
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:36,679
buttons are basically these basic text

934
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:42,139
elements basic text elements are drawing

935
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:45,819
stuff with debug text out and if I just

936
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:49,819
said why don't you return me the

937
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:52,260
dimension of the button I guess

938
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:55,440
that would make it pretty easy for me to

939
00:53:52,260 --> 00:54:00,170
make the button that I need so let's say

940
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:09,179
we return the dimension does the element

941
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:16,320
have anything else in it it just as

942
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:17,460
pointers to the dimension yeah i'm just

943
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:21,900
going to go ahead and return just the

944
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:26,240
dimension itself for now so in here if I

945
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,240
say action button or boolean button I

946
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:37,140
think what I want to do here is make it

947
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:39,059
so that i can i'll try the action button

948
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:41,009
first we'll say that here is the

949
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:43,519
dimension of the action button i kind of

950
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:46,070
want there to be more of a border to it

951
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:48,059
so I want to do kind of a Minkowski

952
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:57,350
situation here I want to do something

953
00:54:48,059 --> 00:55:01,079
like our to like a border I know

954
00:54:57,349 --> 00:55:03,360
enlargement and so when I come through

955
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:07,380
here and I've got this dimension what I

956
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:10,050
would like to do is sort of increase it

957
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:13,890
by by twice that so I want to do like a

958
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:16,230
Minkowski diameter on that and say that

959
00:55:13,889 --> 00:55:19,069
why don't you make that bigger I think

960
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,070
I've got one of those right

961
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:32,920
just called it's called ad radius 2

962
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:36,250
there we go so I want to add the radius

963
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:39,670
I want to enlarge that all around and

964
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:41,949
then when I do get max corner and you

965
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,840
know a justice thing what I want to do

966
00:55:41,949 --> 00:55:47,589
here is just say well i'm going to

967
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:49,570
offset it by the radius because

968
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:51,490
obviously I want it to be centered

969
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:57,100
inside there when I print the actual

970
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:59,139
text so that seems good you know what I

971
00:55:57,099 --> 00:56:02,769
could do to i could just make this even

972
00:55:59,139 --> 00:56:07,989
more ridiculous why not I mean it seems

973
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:11,320
reasonable so action button here what's

974
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:15,250
the highlight what's going on here so

975
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:16,780
highlights yeah I could just say well

976
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:19,179
the action buttons get a highlight to

977
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,340
you know why wouldn't they to think

978
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:24,429
about that how I want to do that and

979
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:27,850
then there's a border option that gets

980
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:29,169
set here right and the border option is

981
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:34,719
going to be like I don't know whatever

982
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:38,860
the button border is let's say the

983
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:41,739
button borders like for pixel border and

984
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:45,130
the color of the back thing is I don't

985
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:48,069
I'm so totally making this up as I go

986
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:51,490
along here I'm just trying to give you

987
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:54,300
what the idea is you know there's a

988
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:56,919
border color so that I can have that

989
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:59,890
because everyone likes it when you have

990
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:02,920
colors and things and stuff and so

991
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:07,750
there's a border and then there's this

992
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:09,670
is the the backdrop color and by default

993
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:12,789
I'll just say the backdrop color is

994
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:14,200
invisible and so when we do all this

995
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:16,389
nonsense here and we come up with a

996
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:17,679
particular size for these things we do

997
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:21,670
plus radius you know I don't know why I

998
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:25,029
didn't do a plus radius here but I

999
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:28,000
should have so that's a mistake well is

1000
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:29,290
it a mistake it's get max corner it

1001
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,539
actually should be this it's get Matt

1002
00:57:29,289 --> 00:57:36,300
corner- radius minus that

1003
00:57:32,539 --> 00:57:40,279
I then want to do a push rekt right I

1004
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:43,680
want to do a push back to fill that

1005
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,750
rectangular dimension so the element

1006
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:49,759
bounds I want to actually fill them with

1007
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:54,360
something and so let me go ahead and and

1008
00:57:49,760 --> 00:58:04,230
grab the code for that as well so we

1009
00:57:54,360 --> 00:58:07,530
have the backing transform here so if I

1010
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:09,269
say all right draw to the render group

1011
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:14,130
with the backing transform draw the

1012
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:17,009
element bounds please and draw them with

1013
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:18,840
the backdrop color and oh by the way you

1014
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:24,900
don't have to do that if the backdrop

1015
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:28,410
color W is not at least you know if you

1016
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:31,289
just don't want one and you pass zeros

1017
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:34,829
for the Alpha it won't draw it won't

1018
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:36,989
even bother recording it we probably

1019
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:40,139
should make the render or do that to be

1020
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:42,239
honest but anyway we'll do that for now

1021
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:46,829
i guess i can still return the dimension

1022
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:49,439
why not but that should do it so let's

1023
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:50,819
see add radius to what are you

1024
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,119
complaining about oh this is not

1025
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:55,980
actually a rectangle it's just a dim so

1026
00:58:54,119 --> 00:59:03,359
what I actually want to do is I suppose

1027
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:07,610
make the the I want to make the the dim

1028
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,610
just add two times the radius

1029
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:15,939
right I was thinking add a rectangle but

1030
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:28,360
i don't i guess i could also just to

1031
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:33,369
this radius is not radius i really want

1032
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:40,200
to call that radius don't i only have

1033
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:47,529
three minutes left highlight highlight

1034
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:52,109
for the action button that's actually

1035
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:52,110
not right so the highlight for this guy

1036
00:59:53,429 --> 00:59:59,109
this is this is not supposed to be this

1037
00:59:57,099 --> 01:00:08,710
way the highlight for this guy is

1038
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:10,720
actually just supposed to be more like

1039
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:13,300
this where we just have that's the color

1040
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:21,579
that normally is and here's the color

1041
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:24,000
that it I don't know so like that cannot

1042
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:24,000
convert

1043
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:37,319
from floats to that's true so this has

1044
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:43,349
to also take a hot color so we'll make

1045
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:47,420
that happen as well and there we go all

1046
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:50,130
right so not much time left here but

1047
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:53,539
there we go so now we actually have some

1048
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:53,539
buttons which is nice

1049
01:01:00,429 --> 01:01:05,299
but since we have multiple buttons on

1050
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:07,250
the same thing we're probably also need

1051
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,780
to there's a little work going to have

1052
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:12,230
to do for making sure these highlight

1053
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:15,200
properly that's separate issue though

1054
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:18,190
but soon we can do some more fancy stuff

1055
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:21,739
here anyway alright so that's good and

1056
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:23,780
that's fine place to leave it we're

1057
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:27,679
almost done with all the layout things

1058
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:31,070
we need here so that's fine and yeah

1059
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,909
okay and I'll uh I'll leave it there we

1060
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,309
don't really have much time for

1061
01:01:31,909 --> 01:01:36,500
questions but I'll take a couple real

1062
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:38,358
quick ones if they're quick and then

1063
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,039
we'll be cuz we'll go back and finish up

1064
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:45,340
some of that stuff tomorrow and we can

1065
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:45,340
take more at that point

1066
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:14,940
prefer to include your new Casey custom

1067
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:19,950
in the repo yeah I gotta go get it from

1068
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:23,119
the other machine sent me an email just

1069
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:23,118
send me an email

1070
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:43,960
is in sohbat spoilery the witness right

1071
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:47,489
now what is in so about doing that's in

1072
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,490
crate that's amazing

1073
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,499
long billion could you explain your poor

1074
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:09,018
man's lambda how it works how it is like

1075
01:03:06,498 --> 01:03:13,968
a lambda and how it is not so basically

1076
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:16,728
like one of the things that C and C++ do

1077
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:18,380
very poorly even though C++ is kind of

1078
01:03:16,728 --> 01:03:22,248
started to try and go down this route

1079
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:25,369
but just not very well is they don't

1080
01:03:22,248 --> 01:03:27,318
allow you to defer something you might

1081
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:31,249
want to do to a later part of the

1082
01:03:27,318 --> 01:03:35,329
program something that lets say in

1083
01:03:31,248 --> 01:03:37,968
Erlang would be stupidly easy like I

1084
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:39,289
want like a co routine or something

1085
01:03:37,969 --> 01:03:40,909
where you're just saying I want to like

1086
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:45,979
do a little bit of this and wait or

1087
01:03:40,909 --> 01:03:48,259
something things that would be very easy

1088
01:03:45,978 --> 01:03:49,998
in languages that support full closures

1089
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:51,650
and stuff like that are like incredibly

1090
01:03:49,998 --> 01:03:53,899
difficult in C++ because it just was

1091
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:55,338
never thought through and they don't

1092
01:03:53,900 --> 01:04:00,798
give you the good the features you need

1093
01:03:55,338 --> 01:04:04,038
to actually SQ them properly so you can

1094
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:06,978
either start using what C++ has four

1095
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:08,778
lambdas now and what a lambda is in c++

1096
01:04:06,978 --> 01:04:10,038
if I remember correctly in terms of what

1097
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:12,889
they actually implemented out of

1098
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:16,400
closures was like if you have a function

1099
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:18,018
and you would like to create a little

1100
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,599
snippet of code that refers to some

1101
01:04:18,018 --> 01:04:22,879
things in that function and then pass it

1102
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:26,869
to some piece of code that you're going

1103
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:29,059
to call and allow it to execute so it's

1104
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:37,099
basically a pointer back up into a

1105
01:04:29,059 --> 01:04:39,499
parent stack you can do that right and I

1106
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:41,959
don't know if they can do the thing that

1107
01:04:39,498 --> 01:04:45,978
we're doing here I think maybe they

1108
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:47,538
could because i think it well no so my

1109
01:04:45,978 --> 01:04:49,939
guess and i don't really know but my

1110
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:54,199
guess is that c++ just doesn't have

1111
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:55,699
enough stuff to make this work I don't

1112
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:59,329
really know I couldn't tell you I have

1113
01:04:55,699 --> 01:05:01,219
no idea um I don't know what they didn't

1114
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:03,019
didn't implement in a language with full

1115
01:05:01,219 --> 01:05:04,729
closure support what you can do is you

1116
01:05:03,018 --> 01:05:06,048
can just write any piece of code and no

1117
01:05:04,728 --> 01:05:08,509
matter what you happen to be referring

1118
01:05:06,048 --> 01:05:12,108
to it will simply know how to get back

1119
01:05:08,509 --> 01:05:13,489
to that stuff right and so you can write

1120
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:15,019
a snippet of code and pass it to

1121
01:05:13,489 --> 01:05:16,579
somebody as a like a

1122
01:05:15,019 --> 01:05:19,880
bundle and say I need you to execute

1123
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:21,049
this later so to what extent you can

1124
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,579
actually do that with the new supa

1125
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,580
sizers I don't know I know they don't

1126
01:05:22,579 --> 01:05:26,960
support foreclosures for obvious reasons

1127
01:05:24,579 --> 01:05:30,079
but I don't know how much they actually

1128
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,550
do support so what I did and what the

1129
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:36,739
reason that I say that it's kind of like

1130
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:39,230
a poor man's closure is because what I

1131
01:05:36,739 --> 01:05:41,149
do is I say well alright in this case

1132
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:42,829
I'm doing some stuff we're like we're

1133
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:45,530
drawn this frame slider or whatever and

1134
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:50,630
I have a thing where I want to sort of

1135
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:53,330
say if this if I want to do an

1136
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:56,000
interaction that takes place when you

1137
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:57,949
click inside where I am right now I want

1138
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,030
to remember the stuff i would have done

1139
01:05:57,949 --> 01:06:04,250
a moat the most straightforward kind of

1140
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:06,860
a immediate mode user interface design

1141
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:09,639
would be that I just do it in here so I

1142
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:13,940
do something like you know if mousedown

1143
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:16,900
do the actually a sign frame ordinal

1144
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,900
like I do this

1145
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:32,900
right that would be the fully the least

1146
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:35,869
complex version of the immediate mode do

1147
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:36,980
I for this so I'm in the rectangle I see

1148
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:40,759
the mouse is down I just do the

1149
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:41,900
operation this is a little bit tricky

1150
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,720
because then you end up in situations

1151
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:46,730
where it's hard to do certain more

1152
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:49,789
complicated operations when that happens

1153
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:51,679
right so I was just kind of showing you

1154
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:53,599
how you could defer things to later in

1155
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,960
case you're interested in being able to

1156
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:59,089
do that kind of operation in your UI

1157
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,210
coding what I do is I say well let's

1158
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:03,500
make a structure that could remember

1159
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:06,889
some information about what we wanted to

1160
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:10,039
do so I can do it later when I actually

1161
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:12,079
go to process the UI right so what I'm

1162
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:13,909
doing is right here I'm bundling up the

1163
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,440
fact that what I wanted to do was I

1164
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:17,569
wanted to take this frame ordinal and

1165
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:22,159
set it to this so it's a poor man's

1166
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:25,039
closure in that sense that i'm taking a

1167
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,629
snippet of code and i can't just use the

1168
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:29,599
language to bundle it up because the

1169
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:31,309
language is too dumb but i can make my

1170
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,989
own struck that records what i wanted to

1171
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:34,489
do and know how to play it back and so

1172
01:07:32,989 --> 01:07:38,469
for some limited set of things that'll

1173
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:38,469
just work does that make sense

1174
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:57,880
thus Isaac do you ever turn on unused

1175
01:07:54,010 --> 01:08:04,690
function variable warnings not normally

1176
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:06,430
no woodman see I am currently working on

1177
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:08,320
a 3d OpenGL project and implementing

1178
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:09,849
collision detection I've been introduced

1179
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,519
to the idea of changing my vector space

1180
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:15,309
so my character is a perfect unit sphere

1181
01:08:12,519 --> 01:08:18,539
which should make detection easier do

1182
01:08:15,309 --> 01:08:21,460
you have any opinion on this approach

1183
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:24,338
well my first suggestion would be I

1184
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:33,730
don't think Spears are very good

1185
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:36,670
colliders but I mean I mean maybe a

1186
01:08:33,729 --> 01:08:38,889
sphere is okay usually people use a

1187
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:44,230
cylinder for the player which is harder

1188
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:45,609
than a sphere to be sure but you have I

1189
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:47,669
mean a sphere has a bunch of weird

1190
01:08:45,609 --> 01:08:51,490
problems like it means that your guy

1191
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:56,350
things that are you know it leads to

1192
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:59,079
some unusual things it means that you

1193
01:08:56,350 --> 01:09:00,730
know if I'm if here's the wow that's

1194
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:04,778
really bad ground if here's the ground

1195
01:09:00,729 --> 01:09:06,849
right and here is something that I'm

1196
01:09:04,779 --> 01:09:09,759
going to bump into and i'm using a

1197
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:11,829
player's sphere well if this thing is

1198
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,199
this high off the ground it means i can

1199
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:16,149
only go this far before i hit it but if

1200
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:18,789
it's this high off the ground it means i

1201
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:20,679
can go essentially all the way to like

1202
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:22,509
you know i could go i guess to like

1203
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:24,490
right there i can go like right here

1204
01:09:22,509 --> 01:09:26,920
before i hit it so it's really kind of

1205
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:28,719
weird because usually it doesn't make

1206
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,949
much sense to have it it doesn't make

1207
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:32,020
sense the player that if this thing

1208
01:09:29,949 --> 01:09:33,039
moves up a little bit all of a sudden

1209
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:36,040
they can walk much further in that

1210
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:37,778
direction so my first thought is player

1211
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:42,430
sphere are you sure have you thought

1212
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:44,790
that through would be my first thing to

1213
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:44,789
say I

1214
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:55,860
and there is no warp that's going to

1215
01:09:51,088 --> 01:09:57,180
make there is no like a fine like

1216
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:59,069
there's no vector transform your going

1217
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:02,510
to do that that makes a sphere a

1218
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:02,509
cylinder into a sphere so

1219
01:10:29,448 --> 01:10:36,079
all right I'm gonna close this up ah

1220
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:36,079
let's see

1221
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:51,069
there we go all right thank you everyone

1222
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,750
for joining me for another episode of

1223
01:10:51,069 --> 01:10:57,759
handmade he wrote show where we code a

1224
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:59,109
complete game live on stream i feel like

1225
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,000
i should say that because i don't think

1226
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:02,710
i said it at the opening i think i just

1227
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,590
said that it was special which is true

1228
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:07,119
if you want to follow along the source

1229
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:09,819
code you can always do so at handmade

1230
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:11,470
here org you can pre-order the game and

1231
01:11:09,819 --> 01:11:13,210
it comes to the source code so if you

1232
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:15,820
want to do that you can do that it is

1233
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:18,369
right there we also a forum site you can

1234
01:11:15,819 --> 01:11:19,960
go to where you can ask questions we

1235
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:21,729
have a patreon page and go to sports

1236
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,289
video series we have a tweet bot that

1237
01:11:21,729 --> 01:11:27,009
tweets to schedule at you when they

1238
01:11:23,289 --> 01:11:28,869
don't reboot my server and speaking in

1239
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:32,289
the schedule i'll be back here 5 p.m.

1240
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:35,349
pacific daylight time tomorrow until

1241
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:36,609
then have fun programming and i will see

1242
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:38,820
you guys on the internet take it easy

1243
01:11:36,609 --> 01:11:38,819
everyone
