1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:09,150
all right welcome everyone to another

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,269
episode of handmade hero the show we cut

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,480
a complete game live on stream it is day

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,009
294 I don't really know what we should

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,449
be working on today but I think I still

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,660
wanted to play around with the movement

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,840
mode stuff some more we have a bunch of

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,460
little like entities sort of working I

9
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:32,219
don't I don't know I don't know what

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:37,770
we're gonna do I really don't you know

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,910
what forget that unpacked 80 to 93

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,020
source code if you want to follow along

13
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:44,578
at home you know what I want to do today

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:47,730
actually I want to attack something I

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,628
think that seems like a good idea to me

16
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:55,019
so let's put combat in I think that's a

17
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:57,359
good idea so what I want to do here is

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,559
I'm going to load up where we were at

19
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:05,609
and just make sure everything is still

20
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:08,188
kosher yeah so here we go we've got mr.

21
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,019
snakey poo I'm gonna go in those snakes

22
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:12,449
are too darn long they take up way too

23
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,629
much room for testing purposes so I'm

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,590
gonna I'm gonna make those snakes a

25
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,670
little bit shorter here 12 is absurd so

26
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,020
I'm gonna make I'm gonna make those

27
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,500
snake considerably shorter so they're

28
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:28,828
not clogging up everything so there's

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,290
the snakes and and I'm I'm here hopping

30
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,578
around and so what I'd like to do is I'd

31
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,060
like to go ahead and get it so that I

32
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:37,618
could attack something because that's a

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,960
major thing that we haven't done really

34
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:42,509
we did we played around a little bit

35
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,099
with this with throwing a sword kind of

36
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,359
a thing way back in the early days when

37
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:49,048
we were just kind of working on entity

38
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,390
systems in a sort of very basic way but

39
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,520
I haven't really ever implemented it for

40
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,019
real so let's let's do that and now that

41
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,468
we have our brain system this is a

42
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,569
pretty easy thing for us to do as well I

43
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,209
think so

44
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:06,779
let me go I'm just gonna make I think I

45
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:08,038
don't know what we've got for for art

46
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,659
assets in there right now at some point

47
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,539
we're gonna have to switch up to a new

48
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:14,310
art asset pack but

49
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,889
I think I'll just make like a little

50
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,900
square that I can use just a little I

51
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:19,768
won't even use like a bitmap for it cuz

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,658
I don't know if we have anything

53
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,700
appropriate I don't really want my dude

54
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:27,750
to attack with a copy of his own head

55
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:29,009
which of course we could do but I want

56
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,229
to make something where I can attack and

57
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:33,060
so what I'd like to do is I want to make

58
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:36,688
it so that you know I've got my dude

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,459
here and when I'm when I'm sort of

60
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:41,128
hopping around right now you can sort of

61
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:44,250
already see that I face in whatever

62
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:48,358
direction I push the you know the arrow

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:51,060
keys but and the WASD keys is what I was

64
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:52,859
using to move around right but what I

65
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,989
actually want the arrow keys to do

66
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:57,150
although they may also additionally set

67
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,829
that facing Direction what I want them

68
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,539
to do is I want them to actually do the

69
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:03,750
attack in the direction that I push

70
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:06,239
right and you can see that these guys

71
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,889
have hit points here like that dude

72
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,829
who's bouncing around like a maniac

73
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,969
right he's got three hit points I've got

74
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,439
three hit points they're just throwing

75
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,750
us those little red squares under there

76
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:18,299
and so while I'm gonna probably have to

77
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,430
slow this guy down because he's kind of

78
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,680
crazy fast at this point we haven't

79
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,729
really done anything in terms of making

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,870
monsters or do a reasonable thing but

81
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:29,040
point being I should be able to make

82
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,129
something where I can go up there and

83
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,858
kind of whale on him right and and hit

84
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:37,048
the monster so that would be good

85
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,060
because if we get that going that would

86
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,250
also motivate us to sort of get our

87
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,568
collision detection stuff a little more

88
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,818
solidified which is another big thing

89
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:46,138
that we want to do you know it's if

90
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,939
there's some of it in there already but

91
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,340
it was really not made for the current

92
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,469
state of affairs and so we want to take

93
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,530
another look at that anyway and kind of

94
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:57,269
get that going as well so let's let's

95
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,579
let's see what happens here let's see

96
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,430
what's going to happen so the first

97
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:06,000
thing is the way that the the hero

98
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,409
attacks in general is there's a couple

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,180
pieces of the hero right there's the

100
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:13,500
head of the hero there's the torso and

101
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,000
there's the cape part right and the the

102
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,798
idea behind the heroes you could see

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,649
from the intro sequence we haven't

104
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,689
played the intro sequence in a while

105
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,319
although I guess I could play it right

106
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:26,310
now just to just to point that out right

107
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,810
because if I go back here

108
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,060
it just goes to the quote-unquote title

109
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,240
screen that no one's drawn yet but then

110
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,639
it I think goes in to the attract mode

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,590
right it should yeah there it goes

112
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:44,189
so you know the the the point here the

113
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:47,729
the the idea of of what's supposed to

114
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:50,069
happen is the hero has this little glove

115
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:53,220
this magical glove that Krampus of

116
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:57,050
course gave him and that glove is what

117
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:01,350
he uses to attack so I want that piece

118
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:03,030
to be floating by him all like it should

119
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,300
actually be on the screen so that's

120
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:08,039
gonna be like an actual separate entity

121
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,280
and depending on what glove you have at

122
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,710
any particular time you know it should

123
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,459
be visible there right it should it

124
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:19,589
should be clear like oh i i've got this

125
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:21,959
in this particular type of glove or

126
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,609
whatever it looks you know visually

127
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,959
distinct and you can sort of say okay

128
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,300
that's that's the glove that i'm using

129
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,629
at this particular point in time

130
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,550
floating next to me and so when the when

131
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:38,519
i push in a door in one of the arrow

132
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:43,020
keys then i want the sort of I want the

133
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:45,930
glove to do that at an attack in that

134
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,219
direction like a punch right so it

135
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,509
should kind of pray it should probably

136
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,660
be I'm guessing something like a swipe

137
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:57,930
sort of a thing I don't know like kind

138
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,300
of an arc like motion in whatever the

139
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,009
direction is that I push and depending

140
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,990
on the type of glove obviously it's

141
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:09,060
going to do different things but that's

142
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:11,579
the basic attack method so given that I

143
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,199
need to create an additional entity for

144
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,259
the glove and I need that entity to kind

145
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,038
of float around by the hero and it'll

146
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:22,949
probably be relatively lockstep compared

147
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,418
to where the hero is so it won't be like

148
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,459
the head and the body where they can

149
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:29,038
kind of float separately it'll probably

150
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,810
be just wherever the body is the hand is

151
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,879
like floating right next to it always

152
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,098
and as the body moves the hand moves

153
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,009
directly with it and then when you

154
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:40,139
attack that it does it does that swipe

155
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:41,908
motion probably quite quickly and I'm

156
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,460
guessing that we'll probably have like

157
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:46,769
sort of a blurred swipe because you know

158
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,959
probably it won't take long enough to

159
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:52,198
swipe to really be all that visible so

160
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:56,068
I'd probably like blur across you know

161
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,620
some kind of a swept also have to look

162
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,718
to it but anyway yes so plate being this

163
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,449
is this is the the magic glove kind of

164
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:06,120
thing and so I want that thing to be

165
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:08,009
hovering nearby to the hero as

166
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,959
adventurers around and you know we'd

167
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,028
probably attach some particle effects to

168
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,818
it because you can kind of see the art

169
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:17,459
can you know the the conception of it

170
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:20,009
artistically speaking is that it's kind

171
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:22,228
of got these particle trails on it and

172
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:25,259
it's sort of glows and so you know we'll

173
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:28,408
probably make that be reflected in the

174
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,080
actual programming of it all right so

175
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:40,228
that's what we're doing

176
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:43,408
so let's go to add hero or sorry add

177
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:45,478
player and so really all I want to do

178
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:58,019
here is say that there's going to be a

179
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:59,938
glove as well and you can see that we've

180
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:03,168
sort of got a lot of residual stuff in

181
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:09,569
here right these like Collider things

182
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:11,818
you know a lot of these flags I feel

183
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,649
like and and how the collision stuff

184
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,750
works now is probably going to be the

185
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:17,370
time for us to solidify that because now

186
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,110
we'll actually have we have everything

187
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,728
in place and how it's working we can

188
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,750
make some decisions here I don't know

189
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:25,228
that all these are gonna be necessary

190
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,908
right I don't because we may you know

191
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:28,889
now that we specify a collision thing

192
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:30,120
maybe you don't ever need to say that I

193
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:34,259
have a collision thing but I don't

194
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,459
collide it's like if I don't collide I

195
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:37,559
wouldn't need a collision thing right

196
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,809
and that might not be true if I need to

197
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,208
have the notion of things that collide

198
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,799
with other things if they have their

199
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,059
collision flag set but the other things

200
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,250
don't collide in the reverse if they

201
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,169
don't right so there's ways we might set

202
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,269
those there's ways those flags might

203
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:52,509
mean something but it's also highly

204
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,149
likely that they want

205
00:08:52,509 --> 00:09:00,578
so anyway we've got our glove and it's

206
00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:05,980
brain slot is going to be brain Kiro

207
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:11,049
glove and it's brain ID is obviously the

208
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:13,149
brain ID of the hero and what I'm gonna

209
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:17,859
do now well in addition to closing out

210
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:20,948
the entity obviously is I'm gonna need

211
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,509
to give it some sort of asset I don't

212
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:24,729
know like I said I'll double check just

213
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:28,470
to see what kind of assets I have

214
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:32,709
because maybe there was something in the

215
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,570
in the asset system that I can use here

216
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:39,159
so what would that have been in I think

217
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:42,519
that was in file formats so I've got a

218
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:47,250
shadow a tree a rock grass tough stone

219
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:51,789
head cape font so I you know I could use

220
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,549
a liquid asset sword even though we

221
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:56,500
didn't have a sword in there so I could

222
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:58,469
grab a rock you could just use a rock

223
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,948
that's what we were using before I think

224
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:07,899
so I'll just add boobs I don't want to

225
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:12,519
edit that I want to copy it and I guess

226
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:14,429
we'll just say okay there's a rock and

227
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,190
we'll see what happens

228
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:21,009
alright so if we create a rock there and

229
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,839
we've got that floating next to the to

230
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:26,198
the hero we now just need a little bit

231
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,790
more information this won't be all so I

232
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:29,859
guess this guy would be kind of floating

233
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:40,679
off the ground but that's a separate

234
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:40,680
issue so anyway the glove of the hero is

235
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:48,189
is going to need a slot in the brain

236
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:52,539
system because we want the hero to know

237
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:55,630
about his glove and I think let's see

238
00:10:52,539 --> 00:11:00,509
here Oh something collision here a body

239
00:10:55,629 --> 00:11:00,509
collision let's see

240
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:11,509
we'll know love collision and we don't

241
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,540
really know how this stuff is gonna play

242
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:18,919
out so I'm just going to continue making

243
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:20,149
you know a dummy for here and then we

244
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,469
can turn it onto something because we're

245
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:28,360
gonna need to know when it collides

246
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:28,360
right so now in theory we should get oh

247
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:42,399
these have to be retired in the same

248
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:44,659
order when we actually build things and

249
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,649
I'm glad we put that assertion in there

250
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:48,439
to catch that because I would have

251
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,070
totally forgotten so this has to be

252
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,290
retired

253
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,028
yeah first right because when you open

254
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:59,088
one of these you then have to close it

255
00:11:53,028 --> 00:12:01,730
and it keeps track of those so yeah all

256
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:05,089
right so now what we've got to do I

257
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,339
don't know why we don't see that entity

258
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:13,610
here though we should have seen it I

259
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:15,080
think we did and it's here we did add

260
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,330
that I guess I don't know I should

261
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,170
probably double-check that there

262
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,170
actually is

263
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:32,640
okay there it is so I guess the rock

264
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:37,110
there just isn't a rock asset at the

265
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:39,689
moment is that true cuz it looks like if

266
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,700
I set it to rock we don't get one so

267
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:46,790
that may be true maybe I need to use

268
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:51,120
sword oh my god

269
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:54,899
alright that's a little bit large let's

270
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,139
let's be honest that's too big that

271
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:01,769
needs to be significantly smaller so

272
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:04,439
let's try that one more time okay so

273
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:07,679
that's much better so now we've got a

274
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,740
stupid rock there that's not very

275
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,509
interesting but we've got it and so now

276
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,759
what I want to do is I want to make that

277
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:16,740
follow me around and swipe when I push

278
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:21,240
in a direction right so that's what I

279
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,799
would like to do and so I'm going to

280
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,080
need a couple things for this first of

281
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,500
all in the brain code for the hero I

282
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,710
need something that places that thing in

283
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,659
a particular location right so when I'm

284
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,550
walking around I want to do something

285
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,889
here you can see that I've got sort of

286
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:41,159
this notion of the entity parts I can

287
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:44,909
grab my glove out of the entity part so

288
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,829
if I if I have a glove here it is if I

289
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:48,509
have a glove I can I can do something

290
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,220
with it and so what I might do is say

291
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:52,889
well okay if I've got a glove let's just

292
00:13:50,220 --> 00:14:00,389
put it next to the body that's why I say

293
00:13:52,889 --> 00:14:03,350
like okay if I have a glove and I know

294
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:07,409
where am i but my actual body is right

295
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:10,440
and and I guess I could sort of do it

296
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:13,469
could follow the head as well I don't

297
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,670
know which it would follow I think it's

298
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,629
the body that it should follow

299
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:20,669
personally so I'm gonna say body so if I

300
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:25,009
have the body what I need to sort of

301
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:27,750
know is what is the facing direction and

302
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:30,750
that facing direction will probably

303
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:33,600
determine where I want to place it

304
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,820
because you know as the as the character

305
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,019
rotates I want it to be sort of off to

306
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,050
the side of where the care

307
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,240
there is but what side you know what is

308
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:44,029
the side of the character is determined

309
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,190
by the direction the characters facing

310
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:49,230
so at first I'll lock it in but then

311
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,090
we're gonna want to change that up so

312
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:55,529
the first thing to do is just say well

313
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:57,899
whatever the glove whatever the body

314
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,639
position is the glove position is just

315
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,980
going to be the body position plus some

316
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,970
fixed offset right and let's say that

317
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:09,090
fixed offset is you know some some sort

318
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:12,899
of very basic thing whatever that is

319
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:22,139
right and you know maybe I'll get rid of

320
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:25,019
this this offset for now and so now you

321
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:27,149
know when I walk around that sort of

322
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,220
thing we'll be off to my side now it's

323
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:31,860
not in a great location right now I

324
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,820
think I might argue that that should be

325
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:38,909
let's see here brain argue that that

326
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:45,560
should be a little bit further up right

327
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:45,559
um which I can do let me

328
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:55,600
let me just tweak this here so I should

329
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:57,039
be able to you know move this up to

330
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,690
roughly where it should be you think

331
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,689
that was pretty good

332
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:14,709
so now I think that's roughly you know

333
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:16,299
that's that's sort of what we might want

334
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,070
you know if you imagine to putting a

335
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:22,209
real glove asset in there it should

336
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:24,010
probably hover right about there and as

337
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,070
I'm moving around you can see it just

338
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:30,519
kind of stays just on that outside and

339
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:33,600
what I want is I want it to move so that

340
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,129
it's gonna whatever direction I'm facing

341
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,220
you know it will it will align to that

342
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:43,000
side properly so we we do know the

343
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:46,120
facing direction of the character at any

344
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,220
given time right we've we sort of set

345
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,210
that facing direction here but that

346
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:56,080
facing Direction is is actually a like a

347
00:16:52,210 --> 00:17:03,970
scalar like it's a it's an angle and we

348
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:04,809
don't really I don't really know if we

349
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,209
want it to

350
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:10,688
well maybe we do I don't know let's try

351
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:12,910
just using the angle directly right so

352
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:16,180
I'm just gonna take that angle and I

353
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,939
think we already have sort of an armed

354
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,500
construction here right so if I say I'm

355
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:24,279
gonna take an angle which is whatever

356
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,470
the facing direction is of the body and

357
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:32,139
I want a vector that's like pointing out

358
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:33,940
in that direction now I could say well

359
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,960
if I have something pointing in that

360
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:40,750
direction I now want to to take that

361
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,880
displacement instead of this 0.6 here

362
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,400
right I want to take that displacement

363
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,860
and I want to use that plus whatever the

364
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,080
upward thing is and that upward thing

365
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:51,909
should really be going in the Z but we

366
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,220
still haven't fixed our Z and so maybe

367
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,779
this you know honestly this this glove

368
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,640
situation could actually be the thing

369
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:59,109
where we just use this as the emphasis

370
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,100
to finish both things the collision

371
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:01,808
detection and our Z

372
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:03,038
determination which is the other you

373
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:06,279
know is other big thing that really

374
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:08,890
isn't it hasn't been nailed down yet in

375
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,538
the renderer right we've we've toyed

376
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,960
with that Z displacement a ton and that

377
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:15,490
and I said a few weeks ago I was like

378
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,350
here's the final way that it's gonna

379
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:21,220
work and so now we actually have to go

380
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:25,990
in and do that right all right so I

381
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:29,470
could do arm X here and arm why like so

382
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,620
now arm X and arm Y in this case they're

383
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:35,500
going to mean something specific so

384
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:37,658
facing Direction is is giving me a

385
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:42,000
direction that's what we're the hero's

386
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:42,000
facing so if it was 0 you know it's it's

387
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:54,370
we're talking about something where it's

388
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,759
like this is zero degrees right and then

389
00:18:54,369 --> 00:19:00,729
we kind of come around as as we go so

390
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:05,079
you know this would be 180 right or you

391
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:07,960
know or PI right and this would be PI

392
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:12,099
over 2 up here and this would be 3 PI

393
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:17,679
over 2 or in terms of towels right this

394
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:19,298
would be 1/4 tau 1/2 to 3/4 tau so you

395
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,759
know this is the circle we're talking

396
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:26,859
about if the hero is facing this

397
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:30,940
direction then I want the arm to be you

398
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:36,819
know off to the side so really we want

399
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:39,940
to take 3/4 tau and add it to that

400
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:43,389
facing direction so that we can get the

401
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:52,120
direction we actually wanted right we

402
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:54,580
basically you know we want that right is

403
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:57,039
the actual thing and just to underscore

404
00:19:54,579 --> 00:20:00,819
that point let's let's go ahead and and

405
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:05,230
and turn that term off temporarily and

406
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:09,659
you can see so here's the thing and it's

407
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:13,539
right it's displaced out to the side

408
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,519
right but it's displaced in the

409
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:17,500
direction I am facing at any given time

410
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,960
which is not where I want my glove to

411
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,079
actually be so we need to add that

412
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,710
displacement to the angle to sort of

413
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:28,480
swap it to be to my side right and now

414
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,000
it's to my side now I don't want it that

415
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,640
far out so again I kind of want it to be

416
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,079
a little closer into the hero by default

417
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,780
it would have been one unit but I want

418
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,289
it more like half a unit and so there

419
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,869
you go

420
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:43,119
so now I'm holding that you know my

421
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:46,599
quote/unquote glove which is actually a

422
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:49,928
weird plate rock thing now I'm holding

423
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:55,178
that you know kind of to the side where

424
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:56,530
I am and as I move around I can I can

425
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:58,809
sort of face in a direction and there it

426
00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:00,700
is but now I need to be able to kind of

427
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:03,160
swipe attack

428
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,049
that thing out in front of me right I

429
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,210
need to be able to do sort of an arc

430
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:09,899
attack and then what I also want to do

431
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:13,870
is I need to know when that thing

432
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:16,630
collides with another object right

433
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:19,509
because I'm gonna need to come over here

434
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,430
and punch this thing right this and and

435
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:24,970
when I you know we need some way of

436
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:29,590
knowing whether I hit it or not right so

437
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:35,589
that's another it's another situation

438
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:38,619
that needs situation Inge right alright

439
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:42,279
so let's think about how we're gonna do

440
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:44,849
that in here we already know when I push

441
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,859
in that direction because we have

442
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:50,469
information about how the hero was

443
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:53,199
pushing I believe we called it like

444
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:57,309
sword push or whatever yeah you can see

445
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:01,900
it here right here's a bunch of sword

446
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:04,389
information so d sword tells us what the

447
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,300
user was trying to do in terms of

448
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,530
pushing in a particular direction and

449
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:11,859
you can see me setting the facing

450
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:14,170
direction here using it now

451
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:16,179
you'll also note of course that we do

452
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:18,220
something kind of stupid which is this

453
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:22,000
is one of those hey we eight and two to

454
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,350
get an angle and then we can we cosine

455
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,960
sign it out again later

456
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:28,509
huh so you know not the most efficient

457
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,610
thing you but we don't really care about

458
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:31,629
that sort of thing now but just you see

459
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:32,769
some of the times that thing and

460
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,000
programming you're like oh hey maybe I

461
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:37,180
should start just storing this as a

462
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,599
vector instead but yeah we need the

463
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,160
atan2 for lookups for other reasons so

464
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:46,209
you know it's not it's not the end the

465
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:48,400
world anyway so when I push this button

466
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:52,750
I want to initiate a strike right I want

467
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,460
to initiate a swipe of that thing and we

468
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,920
have this concept of movement mode in

469
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:03,779
entities and I think that's probably a

470
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,779
good movement mode to have and you know

471
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:12,519
maybe it's swiping or attacking I don't

472
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,200
know tax swipe I'm not sure and so what

473
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:18,539
I'd like to do is I'd like to set the

474
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:23,200
hand into that swipe mode because

475
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:25,869
essentially when it's while you're doing

476
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,059
that swipe you can't Reese wipe right

477
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:30,879
like you're committed to the attack for

478
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:33,069
a couple frames and you just have to let

479
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,930
it run its course you can't retry to

480
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:36,669
attack in a different direction until

481
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:40,210
the attack in the direction you

482
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:43,330
initially specified is done so this is

483
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:48,279
going to be very similar to the hopping

484
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:49,750
code only instead of going between

485
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:52,210
occupied regions

486
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:56,259
it's it's really not occupying anything

487
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:59,440
it's just it's just doing this arc

488
00:23:56,259 --> 00:24:03,039
motion so let's go ahead and get that in

489
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,590
there first world mode and you know what

490
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,480
to this stuff this world mode stuff

491
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:10,689
might be time to pull out into the

492
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:16,750
entity code because this is really all

493
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:18,759
entity code but you know not sure that

494
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,380
really matters all that much but you see

495
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,140
how we've got sort of like X cube brain

496
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,210
this could now be a simulate enemy call

497
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,160
right because this is all just something

498
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,299
that happens on an entity and so if we

499
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,769
want to pull it out over there we

500
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:33,190
usually could I don't know if it makes

501
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:35,139
sense to do so but we certainly good so

502
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,370
yeah if I've got movement mode hopping

503
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,080
there now let's say that I've got

504
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:39,909
another movement mode and the movement

505
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:43,149
know that I have here is that attacks

506
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,830
life mode and then in here I want to do

507
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:49,870
the same exact stuff that I was doing

508
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:52,929
before so you know essentially I want to

509
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:58,149
say well when I get to the end of the T

510
00:24:52,930 --> 00:25:00,759
movement phase of things right I I want

511
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,440
to go back to whatever mode I was you

512
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:06,230
know whatever the neutral mode is right

513
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,910
so I want to say

514
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:13,890
movement mode equals movement mode

515
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:15,630
planted probably and so while we're in

516
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,540
that movement mode and we say we've

517
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:22,320
gotten above here or sorry when we're

518
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:24,809
not above here then we do the swipe

519
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,669
behavior and then as soon as like we

520
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:30,079
Everest done we go back to planted so

521
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:33,560
the way the swipe behavior would work is

522
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:36,929
again like you know the entity P is

523
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:42,000
gonna probably be based off of some kind

524
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:43,740
of a you know I I got to figure out some

525
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,259
kind of parameterization what I'm saying

526
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,640
I want this thing to attack I need some

527
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:56,129
notion of how that attack is supposed to

528
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:58,290
you know play out right speaking of that

529
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,190
I do wonder if this came from makes any

530
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,690
sense anymore

531
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,720
I feel like this came from should

532
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:06,620
perhaps no longer be a actual

533
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,620
traversable reference

534
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:19,839
that's beside the point anyway

535
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:23,140
so we need some way of parameterizing

536
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:25,689
this sort of arc and or thinking about

537
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:29,170
this and so you know if mike euro is

538
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,880
here and I've got the the glove here and

539
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:40,740
I'm talking about this kind of motion

540
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:40,740
right it pretty much needs to go out and

541
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:47,079
you know I had toyed with this I don't

542
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:49,178
know I I think I'm gonna go ahead and

543
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:51,279
say that this is how this works too I

544
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:54,130
feel like it probably should do

545
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,200
something like you swipe and it goes to

546
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,150
this side and then you swipe again and

547
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,490
it comes back to this side so you're

548
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:05,370
kind of doing left and right side

549
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:12,339
swiping as you alternate through right

550
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:17,459
and so I want a way of saying Arc around

551
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:24,339
and then arc back and and that's really

552
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:25,539
yeah that's really good so yeah so in

553
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:28,480
this case when we're doing this

554
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:30,190
operation really this is a relative

555
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,860
space thing so I got to think about how

556
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,960
I want this to work while we're in the

557
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,759
attack swipe phase you know I don't

558
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,789
really one of the things that I kind of

559
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:43,240
find is I'm I'm I'm finding that like as

560
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:44,349
I code these things they're very you

561
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,929
know I kind of want to just code them

562
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:48,639
custom but then I usually want to reuse

563
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:50,980
them and so it's always a kind of a

564
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,110
question of exactly how that should go

565
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,279
I'm gonna stick with the the thing I've

566
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:56,769
been doing which is just write it

567
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,779
explicitly first and then make it more

568
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:01,299
reusable as we as we sort of move

569
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:04,899
forwards so if I want to do that attack

570
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:06,490
swipe motion I feel like I want to leap

571
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,160
you know I want this to stay

572
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,890
parametrized in a very similar way you

573
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:15,940
know to this this sort of thing here and

574
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:19,960
so I would say that we probably want you

575
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:22,330
know something like this and what we

576
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,179
want to do is we want to interpolate the

577
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:27,788
angle based on that

578
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:31,899
that team movement that that team

579
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:36,069
movement information right and so that

580
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:41,319
team movement if we go to the entity is

581
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:47,579
gonna have something like you know angle

582
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:52,509
target like you know swipe angle start

583
00:28:47,579 --> 00:29:02,489
or swipe angle target something like

584
00:28:52,509 --> 00:29:02,489
this right and and

585
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:28,690
I guess what I would say about this is I

586
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:31,599
don't know exactly how I want the facing

587
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:33,670
direction all right so here's what I

588
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,219
think I actually I dunno

589
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:38,620
so the facing direction will stay fixed

590
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,789
during a swipe even if you push in

591
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:41,769
another direction you won't change

592
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:44,379
facing direction all right so that's

593
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:46,119
fine so yes so we have a swipe angle

594
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,600
start and we have a swipe angle target

595
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:53,829
and it'll go between these two and I

596
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:59,109
think that'll be fine that's that's my

597
00:29:53,829 --> 00:30:02,949
that's my assertion there and you know

598
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:05,589
I'll be honest it might be that it might

599
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:09,069
be that this is kind of just always

600
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:11,349
capable of working this way I don't know

601
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:13,419
we'll see this is this is again code

602
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:15,219
that I'm not super I don't normally

603
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,259
write a lot of enemy code and so it's

604
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,150
always a little bit when we're going

605
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:22,059
through this you're kind of watching

606
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,620
literally me decide as I go like how do

607
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:26,109
I like this do I not like this and and

608
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:28,449
see how things shake out so I'm

609
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:30,129
constantly like evaluating where do I

610
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,569
want to put this piece of code and I'm

611
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,000
trying to let it sort of organically

612
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:38,039
settle into place so I can make good

613
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,500
decisions about that all right so anyway

614
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:45,250
if we were going to use this this attack

615
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:48,579
swipe mode and I wanted to make the arm

616
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,890
be placed in this angular way what I

617
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:53,409
could say is like well okay so there's

618
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:56,770
you know there's a movement mode

619
00:30:53,410 --> 00:31:00,009
you know angle offset or something

620
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:01,750
and an angle attack swipe and these are

621
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:05,650
for things that are sort of relative ARM

622
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:10,049
based move movers you know and so this

623
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,050
oops what just happened

624
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:23,448
there we go so this code right here

625
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:26,389
right you know is is the constant angle

626
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:29,179
offset version and this would be like

627
00:31:26,388 --> 00:31:31,578
off of the the you know the facing

628
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:33,409
direction that would be set in the brain

629
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:38,808
so it would be saying like oh let's take

630
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:42,289
the facing direction and let's let's set

631
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:46,459
you know the gloves facing direction

632
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:49,338
maybe to the bodies facing direction so

633
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:51,859
that you know they're always facing in

634
00:31:49,338 --> 00:31:53,868
the same direction and then here we

635
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:56,148
would just say like oh okay the entities

636
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:59,358
facing direction I'm gonna take those

637
00:31:56,148 --> 00:32:02,468
angle interpolant and I'm gonna to use

638
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:04,519
those two to change what's going on and

639
00:32:02,469 --> 00:32:06,859
you know even as I'm saying this I'm

640
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,699
sort of thinking - well couldn't I just

641
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:13,098
actually move the entities through like

642
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:15,129
I couldn't I just animate the facing

643
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,128
direction

644
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:31,389
yeah that's tricky well I'm gonna keep

645
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:32,440
going I'm gonna keep going to see how it

646
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:33,668
shakes out but I'm pretty sure we're

647
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,139
gonna go through a couple of revisions

648
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:36,850
here because I kind of sense like oh

649
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:38,740
yeah I kind of see how this should go

650
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:42,668
and it's not quite what I'm what I'm

651
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:52,538
typing in right so let's keep going down

652
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:57,240
this path though so if we were gonna do

653
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:57,240
this literally I would just say okay

654
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:06,700
excuse me here's the angle offset

655
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:09,610
movement mode I'll let these cases drop

656
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:15,999
through here's how we position one of

657
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:17,378
these things right and we'll parametrize

658
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:21,940
as much as you want right now we don't

659
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:25,028
really have to do much of that yet but

660
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:29,019
you know we'll see how that goes so yeah

661
00:33:25,028 --> 00:33:31,859
I can just say whatever my what was I

662
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:31,859
saying starting angle

663
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,900
so whatever my starting angle is plus

664
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:55,399
whatever my facing direction is is going

665
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:55,400
to be where I place myself and off we go

666
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:59,809
or maybe I should do something like this

667
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,559
so this is basically just creating a

668
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:18,059
relative reference frame off of wherever

669
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:21,179
my facing direction is I'm going to take

670
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:24,590
my angle that I am currently at I'm

671
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:27,559
going to displace the thing there and

672
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:31,380
presumably we would parameterize this

673
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:34,110
more specifically later right and so

674
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:40,590
then my entity P here is just going to

675
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:43,950
be a my edit EP is going to be a

676
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:55,530
displacement off of whatever my you know

677
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:57,809
my my base is and so then in the brain I

678
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,850
would sit with those are whatever I want

679
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:04,590
those to be so I'm saying that the

680
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:10,170
gloves base angle base is going to be

681
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:14,400
the body's PD location and then I'll set

682
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:16,260
its entity p equal to these just like we

683
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,000
were doing before so really very

684
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,090
straightforward then in the attack swipe

685
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,730
and like I said I think this isn't great

686
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,980
and I'll kind of touch on why I think

687
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,590
there's a better way to do that a little

688
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:31,139
later on anyway so then we're when we're

689
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,850
in the attack swipe face again we would

690
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:35,759
then switch we would regress back to

691
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:38,670
angle offset but when we were done I

692
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,670
similarly here we would want to

693
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:46,769
initialize our movement mode of the

694
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:49,230
glove to movement mode angle offset and

695
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:52,079
so that when we actually create

696
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:54,480
the entity in the first place can add

697
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,539
player that's something that you know we

698
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,079
would want to put in here right so when

699
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:03,449
we are creating this glove in the first

700
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,559
place we'd say hey the movement mode of

701
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:06,029
the glove is going to be the angle

702
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,298
offset movement mode that's how it's

703
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,490
placed in the world so then when we do

704
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:13,739
the attack swipe the attack swipe is

705
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:17,219
really nothing more than saying that you

706
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:21,058
know the entity angle current equals the

707
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:24,389
lerk of and I don't remember what we

708
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:28,260
actually call just I never do we called

709
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:34,250
it lerp this is going to be the lerp

710
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,250
between whatever the start angle is

711
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:43,068
we're gonna take that entity T movement

712
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:43,068
and we're gonna make the angle and

713
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:52,588
target again we're gonna alert between

714
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,808
those and at the very end of it we'll

715
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:58,889
make sure that the angle current equals

716
00:36:54,809 --> 00:37:01,920
the angle target in fact I guess we

717
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:07,739
could say that this is what we do when

718
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:11,338
it's less than one is this and otherwise

719
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:13,348
we do this right so we do that T

720
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:18,328
movement lerp I don't really remember

721
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:20,369
how that gets actually incremented like

722
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:24,900
who is actually incrementing T movement

723
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:26,010
and when this is this this I ask you

724
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:31,430
right

725
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:31,430
somebody has to to update T movement

726
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:38,250
there it is so for the attack swipe we

727
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:42,359
have to also increment T movement at

728
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:45,798
some point as we go right I don't know

729
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:52,650
whether this is the right policy for it

730
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:55,730
exactly when this is happening but yeah

731
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,730
I could clamp it here as well

732
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:07,699
and that looks like something that we

733
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:10,909
should pull off as well okay so yeah

734
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:13,548
that's that's the the T movement stuff

735
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:15,768
that'll give us the the looping that we

736
00:38:13,548 --> 00:38:17,748
want there and then when it gets to the

737
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:20,719
angle target it will just sort of record

738
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:24,469
that now we're like I said we kind of

739
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:27,679
flip flop around between those and so

740
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:31,518
our angle target when we go to actually

741
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:38,358
execute one of these our angle target is

742
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:40,879
going to it's going to sort of toggle

743
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:44,420
back and forth so what I kind of want to

744
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:53,930
do is say well whatever the whenever we

745
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:56,240
get a decent to do so first of all I

746
00:38:53,929 --> 00:39:03,768
never want to set the gloves facing

747
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:07,098
direction in a case where I'm I'm doing

748
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:08,538
an attack right so what I kind of want

749
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:12,559
to do is say okay if I've got a glove

750
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:15,099
and I've got a body and you know what I

751
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,539
should probably just copy all this stuff

752
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:19,579
well we'll see we'll see how we won't do

753
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:23,660
it in a second they'll leave that down

754
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:24,950
there I've got if okay so I've got a

755
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:26,899
glove in a body I know I'm gonna set the

756
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:34,998
angle base I know missed at the facing

757
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:36,920
direction but I also know that if I'm in

758
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,868
the middle of a swipe I don't want to

759
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,298
change the body spacing direction right

760
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:47,528
so what I kind of want to do here is say

761
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:50,949
that well if the gloves you know

762
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:50,949
movement mode

763
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:02,929
is movement mode angle offset right then

764
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:06,500
I'll set it but otherwise I don't want

765
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:08,029
to set it because until the swipes done

766
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,579
I don't want to update the facing

767
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:15,470
direction of the of the body right I

768
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:20,349
mean yeah to be that of the head attack

769
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:20,349
swipe undeclared identifier is that so

770
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:47,480
you're right you're right sorry I just

771
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:52,460
wanted to actually make that start

772
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:56,469
happening okay so now we actually need

773
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:59,949
to set those other angles up and so to

774
00:40:56,469 --> 00:41:06,139
start off with when the hero is first

775
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:09,129
created right I want at the same time

776
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:13,909
when I do the angle offset I want to set

777
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:19,608
the starting angle or I guess the

778
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:21,858
current angle I want to set that to be

779
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:24,079
the angle I actually wanted the hand to

780
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:27,559
be at and so you know we'll start off

781
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,819
right-handed and then it'll switch to

782
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:35,199
left-handed on the first punch and

783
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:35,200
vice-versa so that's just this right

784
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:41,139
and now you can see that it's it's in

785
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,690
the it's on the right side always

786
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:45,670
wherever I'm pointing and so now when I

787
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:49,210
do that D sword I want to initiate that

788
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:54,300
attack so I'm gonna go into the brain

789
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:54,300
and when we do the D sword initiation

790
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:13,269
which is in here and I think what I want

791
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:17,050
to do is say something like attacked was

792
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:22,030
false and in here I would say that if we

793
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:29,380
attacked that we set that to true so if

794
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:40,960
we attacked then I'm going to set the

795
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:42,369
facing direction right if we are in fact

796
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,679
I guess now I think about that would be

797
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:47,049
the better place to do this so probably

798
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:50,199
we always take the heads facing

799
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:53,470
direction so it's more like if we

800
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:56,980
attacked if we tried to attack we're

801
00:42:53,469 --> 00:43:04,089
gonna see if the glove movement mode is

802
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:06,730
angle offset if it's if it's not we'll

803
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:08,980
turn attack to false right so basically

804
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:12,099
like if we don't have a glove or if the

805
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:15,670
glove is at rest or if the glove isn't

806
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:20,409
at rest then we didn't attack right or I

807
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:23,889
should say we will say that the attack

808
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:25,420
did not occur if we have a glove and

809
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:27,129
it's not capable of attacking right now

810
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,079
otherwise we'll say that we did because

811
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:32,710
maybe there's some other meaning of that

812
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:34,000
I don't know maybe we need to be more

813
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,860
explicit about this as well there might

814
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,559
be at two different kinds of attack but

815
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:44,680
we'll see so if we actually do get into

816
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:47,769
the attacked face then we will set the

817
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:50,079
facing direction and similarly if we're

818
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:54,070
in the attack phase and we have a

819
00:43:50,079 --> 00:44:00,789
of right in fact I guess we could do

820
00:43:54,070 --> 00:44:02,769
this in here well maybe not so if we

821
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:05,460
have a glove and we have an attack that

822
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:13,570
occurred then I'm going to set the glove

823
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:19,380
to a movement mode that it reflects the

824
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:19,380
the angle 1 right the angle slight swipe

825
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:32,170
and I want to set the starting angle to

826
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:34,269
be whatever the current angle is well I

827
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:36,880
should call it current angle but some

828
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:41,320
reason I didn't call it that and I want

829
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,900
the angle target to be you know it's

830
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:46,780
either gonna be that it's other gonna be

831
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:49,000
75 or negative 25 right it's either

832
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:54,190
gonna be I started scaling to be 75 or

833
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,940
25 but the way round goes is going to

834
00:44:54,190 --> 00:45:01,960
matter I suppose should think about this

835
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:06,460
a little bit actually so if this is the

836
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:09,070
facing direction I probably wanted to

837
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:12,519
call that negative 25 now that I think

838
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:15,760
about it so that it goes from 25 to

839
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:20,860
negative 25 seems like a better idea so

840
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:26,880
let's call this 25 and what I want to do

841
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:26,880
is say well where is the glove currently

842
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:38,890
and I'm either gonna pick negative 25 or

843
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:41,109
25 and in a pic based on which side of 0

844
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:42,730
I'm on so if the glove is on the left

845
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:44,800
side of the hero it'll swipe towards the

846
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:49,769
right side if the glove is on the right

847
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,769
side it'll swipe towards the left right

848
00:45:50,449 --> 00:46:05,118
that's that's what I'm gonna try to do

849
00:45:52,099 --> 00:46:07,910
anyway now there's a little weirdness to

850
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,950
this and I don't know whether I like it

851
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:11,179
or not and we'll have to sort of think

852
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:15,588
about this first of all it's way too

853
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:17,268
slow so I got to speed that up a lot but

854
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:23,949
otherwise that's doing essentially what

855
00:46:17,268 --> 00:46:23,949
I wanted it to do let's take a look to

856
00:46:26,528 --> 00:46:36,108
you movement mode mint I just want to

857
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,748
change the swipe speed so there's that a

858
00:46:36,108 --> 00:46:39,588
tax wipe so I want that to be quite a

859
00:46:38,748 --> 00:46:41,298
bit faster

860
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:47,679
um so I'm just going to speed that up a

861
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:47,679
bit that's much better

862
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:03,400
might even need to go a bit faster

863
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:20,930
that's probably about right okay so

864
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:24,650
anyway having my little punching glove

865
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:26,598
here punching is good it probably needs

866
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:30,170
to go out a little bit from where I am

867
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:32,329
though as it goes and so when we do the

868
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:34,400
swipe attack I might add a little bit of

869
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:38,420
arm motion in there a little bit of arm

870
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,369
extense right so that's pretty easy to

871
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:44,450
do right you can see in here we've kind

872
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:46,400
of got this notion of of the

873
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:47,960
displacement and so maybe what I'll do

874
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,220
is say well alright so these aren't

875
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:54,349
exactly the same they aren't exactly the

876
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:55,848
same thing there is a displacement and

877
00:47:54,349 --> 00:48:01,880
well you know what I could still leave

878
00:47:55,849 --> 00:48:03,859
it to be honest it's probably fine what

879
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,150
I can do is say well inside the entity

880
00:48:03,858 --> 00:48:07,598
because I'm already gonna want to do

881
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,599
this anyway

882
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:22,179
where are you there we go

883
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:25,119
we would want like something like angle

884
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:28,839
based distance or something and angle

885
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:32,949
swipe distance and so in here we could

886
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:38,860
say well and then we'd also need the

887
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:40,989
current distance right distance so we

888
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,930
just feel like all right you know this

889
00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:50,909
right here this 0.5 is actually going to

890
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:53,199
be the entity angle current distance

891
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:55,420
right it's just polar coordinates here

892
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:58,329
right so I'm saying this is how far out

893
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:00,820
the thing is from the body and in here

894
00:48:58,329 --> 00:49:05,079
we could say that the entity angle

895
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:09,160
current distance maybe is some kind of a

896
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:12,369
like interpolation that you know gives

897
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:14,409
me at 0.5 you know it kind of goes out

898
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:15,670
and then back in again right so it kind

899
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:25,269
of like comes out from the body and then

900
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:26,980
comes back so we'll worry about that

901
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:31,150
part in a second but this is going to be

902
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:33,670
something right it's not gonna be a lerp

903
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:39,250
we would probably call this you know

904
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:41,590
like a triangle or a parabola 0.5 or

905
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:43,030
something like that we would want to do

906
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:45,130
some kind of a parabola thing where we

907
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:47,860
say okay it's the same kind of thing as

908
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:50,710
our lerp function it's gonna take the T

909
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:54,250
movement and it's going to take the

910
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:58,900
angle based distance and the angle swipe

911
00:49:54,250 --> 00:50:00,190
distance and it's gonna you know it's

912
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,840
gonna interpolate between them and it

913
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,490
sort of a you know you know like gets

914
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:09,940
bigger in the middle and falls off again

915
00:50:03,489 --> 00:50:12,039
at the end right and yeah I think that's

916
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:15,460
all I really need to do there and then I

917
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:18,070
just need to set those things when I

918
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,400
actually create this so when I create a

919
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,400
player

920
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:26,070
I'm going to go in here and say we've

921
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:31,400
got the angled face distance and the

922
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:35,670
angle swipe distance and the angle

923
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:38,910
current distance and this will be 0.5

924
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:46,530
the base distance will be 0.5 the swipe

925
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:51,179
distance will let's say be 1.0 right so

926
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:52,560
now all I need is a parabola function or

927
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:54,049
some other me doesn't have to be a

928
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,210
parabola for any particular reason

929
00:50:54,050 --> 00:51:06,720
let me see where's my where's my work

930
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:09,449
right there in the line 32 and really

931
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:11,609
you know rather than phrasing it this

932
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:14,669
way probably the better thing to do

933
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:20,250
would be to say lerp right and then do

934
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:22,079
parabola go 5 map on just the T value so

935
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,429
that way you can use it with any of the

936
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,960
lerp functions no matter what they're

937
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:27,000
lurking whether they're vectors or

938
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,579
whatever and you don't have to introduce

939
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,719
another function that has multiple forms

940
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:38,299
right so when you when you plug in a

941
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:40,589
t-value here let's take a look at this

942
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,620
right what I want to do is a function

943
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:46,140
that kind of looks like that right and I

944
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:47,819
could I suppose maybe I don't want a

945
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:50,460
parabola I don't know maybe I want more

946
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:53,700
of a cosine arc right because that's

947
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:56,490
what that would be right so maybe I want

948
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:58,949
a cosine arc that's that's just

949
00:51:56,489 --> 00:52:03,299
normalized so it goes from 0 to 1 right

950
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:07,549
so it's just like cosine of t over pi

951
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,550
basically write something like this

952
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:20,608
that kind of thing seems as reasonable

953
00:52:19,289 --> 00:52:33,929
as any now it's a little more expensive

954
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:38,239
unfortunately but you know so that seems

955
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:38,239
to still be evaluating

956
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:55,039
that seems to be evaluating oddly

957
00:52:52,210 --> 00:53:02,539
because I would not expect that I would

958
00:52:55,039 --> 00:53:05,210
expect that to stay at 0.5 ah well

959
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:07,329
that's not exactly true if my parabola

960
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:10,820
function is busted which it probably is

961
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:13,099
I like that I called it parabola 0.5 and

962
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,240
then in a cosine curve that's that's

963
00:53:13,099 --> 00:53:22,670
wonderful

964
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:25,399
nice work but yeah in theory when we do

965
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:27,349
this we should and I and I guess this is

966
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,599
probably something I should do more like

967
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:46,579
this I should probably keep these the

968
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:48,170
same in theory it should return it

969
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:54,380
should it should regress back to base

970
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:56,180
distance which is 0.5 right which you

971
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,559
can see that it now does because I hard

972
00:53:56,179 --> 00:54:01,129
set it but it wouldn't have otherwise

973
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:04,570
and if I slow down the T here you can

974
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:04,570
see that the movement is totally wrong

975
00:54:07,059 --> 00:54:10,159
right so that this this is not at all

976
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:12,259
correct

977
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:13,849
so my angle base distance to my angle

978
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:19,190
swipe distance and my parabola functions

979
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:20,869
or not not right at all and so let me go

980
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:27,200
let me double check to make sure they're

981
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:29,659
created properly the base distance is

982
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:32,089
0.5 and the swipe distance is 1.0 right

983
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:35,989
so those are what I would have thought

984
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:38,990
they should be so the question is is my

985
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:41,750
parabola function busted it might be see

986
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:43,909
here of course is not a parabola for one

987
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:45,320
thing but let's just double check let's

988
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:47,389
see what happens if I just always return

989
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:51,230
zero I should say it at point five the

990
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:52,009
whole time and I do and similarly if I

991
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,650
return one

992
00:54:52,010 --> 00:55:00,130
I should be four all the way out the

993
00:54:54,650 --> 00:55:00,130
whole time yeah Jimmy

994
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:09,199
so then for some reason I'm not sure why

995
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,610
when I duty from 0 to 1 ah I did it

996
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:16,159
backwards right I want it to go to PI I

997
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:24,650
want it to go from 0 to PI so my cosine

998
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:28,250
curve would be would be this right T

999
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:29,599
starting at 0 and also great I want it

1000
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:31,849
to start it Syria so it's a sine curve

1001
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,219
not a cosine curve even better great day

1002
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:35,929
to day Casey nice work so that's

1003
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:38,269
actually correct that's what I actually

1004
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:39,799
wanted to do the problem is this is

1005
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:42,800
called parabola and that's not a

1006
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:45,019
parabola so I should probably do like

1007
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:49,910
sine 0 1 or something like that is

1008
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:51,349
actually what that should be called it's

1009
00:55:49,909 --> 00:55:53,779
also probably better to use a parabola

1010
00:55:51,349 --> 00:56:05,509
cuz signs are a lot more expensive have

1011
00:55:53,780 --> 00:56:06,320
been parabolas but you know but that's

1012
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:08,450
pretty good

1013
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,050
and I don't know that might actually be

1014
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:16,309
a little bit more eccentric than it

1015
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:17,810
should be I'm not entirely sure like or

1016
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:22,420
a little less eccentric than it should

1017
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:25,730
be so maybe like 0.5 isn't even enough I

1018
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:27,380
don't know it's a good question and I'm

1019
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:29,510
not sure so like it could be that maybe

1020
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:32,930
you know this should be like even as low

1021
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:37,540
as zero point three I'm not entirely

1022
00:56:32,929 --> 00:56:39,799
sure but we could check it out and

1023
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:41,779
presumably the swipe distance would vary

1024
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,190
per gloves well right like some gloves

1025
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:45,190
have higher swipe distances

1026
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:55,460
so probably you know this stuff the base

1027
00:56:52,670 --> 00:57:01,269
distance swipe distance current distance

1028
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:07,070
stuff I'm just guessing that basically

1029
00:57:01,269 --> 00:57:09,050
all of these things would it would sort

1030
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:14,059
of be things that that change as part of

1031
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:15,910
the entities setting but I think that's

1032
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:19,190
basically it

1033
00:57:15,909 --> 00:57:21,109
so really the next phase would just be

1034
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:23,150
let's attach the collision detector to

1035
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:29,630
that and then I can start to swipe

1036
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:31,420
things right and you can kind of see why

1037
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:33,320
there's a number of kind of weird

1038
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:36,409
gameplay things that are somewhat

1039
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,210
interesting too about the way that this

1040
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:39,469
game is designed not necessarily saying

1041
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:43,220
they're good because I am NOT a game

1042
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:46,219
designer but the way that the hero works

1043
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:48,079
is kind of unusual right like because

1044
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:51,230
the thing you attack with is not the

1045
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:56,690
thing you're moving there's like a fair

1046
00:57:51,230 --> 00:58:00,110
bit of of kind of like strategic thought

1047
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:01,820
involved in where you are going to place

1048
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:03,740
your head versus your body and what

1049
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:07,220
direction you're going in at any given

1050
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:08,379
time if that makes sense so it'll be

1051
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:14,629
interesting to see kind of how that

1052
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:16,039
shapes up right we'll see anyway so

1053
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,960
that's all I really wanted to do anyway

1054
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:19,670
and like I said I think we're pretty out

1055
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:23,860
of time so we'll just work on the

1056
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:26,269
collision detection next week and yeah

1057
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:28,309
we're getting pretty close though I

1058
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,719
would like that - probably Bob up and

1059
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:31,340
down as well like it should kind of be a

1060
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:34,669
little floaty so we can maybe get that

1061
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:37,789
back in there but that's that's roughly

1062
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:42,650
it and like I said you know that value

1063
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:46,429
can be sort of amped up quite a bit

1064
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:49,670
you know the swipe distance when when

1065
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:53,509
this thing attacks like in here or

1066
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:55,970
whatever you know I can make that that

1067
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:58,849
can increase that distance if for some

1068
00:58:55,969 --> 00:59:01,488
gloves right that wanna

1069
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:03,229
have more of a sweep to him I feel like

1070
00:59:01,489 --> 00:59:06,409
that's one reason use a parabola you can

1071
00:59:03,228 --> 00:59:08,178
kind of see how it it flies out quite a

1072
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:10,188
bit at the end and I feel like you kind

1073
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:13,910
of want it a lot narrower than that

1074
00:59:10,188 --> 00:59:15,739
potentially so you know maybe I don't

1075
00:59:13,909 --> 00:59:18,678
want that as the function either let me

1076
00:59:15,739 --> 00:59:23,900
just see what some other functions look

1077
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:30,519
like there so let's do like triangle

1078
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:35,449
zero one and this would just be you know

1079
00:59:30,518 --> 00:59:40,338
if as as T goes from zero to one I want

1080
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:43,068
it to actually be when it's at at 0.5 I

1081
00:59:40,338 --> 00:59:45,259
want it to be at 1 right so I want the

1082
00:59:43,068 --> 00:59:47,418
result to actually be twice T so it goes

1083
00:59:45,259 --> 00:59:55,369
up there quickly but then if it's

1084
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:58,818
greater than right if it goes past point

1085
00:59:55,369 --> 01:00:02,778
5 I want to diminish back down so I want

1086
00:59:58,818 --> 01:00:06,708
to basically say like if result is it's

1087
01:00:02,778 --> 01:00:14,630
greater than 1 then I want to subtract

1088
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:18,078
it from 2 right so to make a little

1089
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:21,459
notch triangle and I don't know that

1090
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,459
might be better

1091
01:00:35,668 --> 01:00:40,629
and that does feel a little better

1092
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:48,130
although it may want to be even more

1093
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:50,459
eccentric than that all right I'm not

1094
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:50,459
sure

1095
01:01:03,728 --> 01:01:09,218
alright let's go ahead and go to the Q&amp;A

1096
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:57,588
with support Nintendo's power gloves I

1097
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:57,588
probably not because I don't have one

1098
01:01:58,789 --> 01:02:03,679
nor do I think I have the leet hacks or

1099
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:06,500
skills necessary to plug it into a PC

1100
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:09,500
but I gotta cut some wires and do some

1101
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,500
splicing

1102
01:02:16,949 --> 01:02:21,960
soy sauce the kid our chain attacks

1103
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:26,730
going to be in by any chance

1104
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:28,559
ie slash slash thrust no not in that

1105
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:31,500
sense and the reason for that is there

1106
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:35,820
isn't well there aren't multiple attack

1107
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:38,369
buttons if that makes sense the attack

1108
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:42,059
the buttons for attack are the direction

1109
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:44,099
to attack there isn't a button that does

1110
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:47,099
a different type of attack

1111
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:51,539
it's that make sense so they'll probably

1112
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:54,750
be some things code wise a little bit

1113
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:56,730
like that which are based on like the

1114
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:59,039
pattern in which you may have hit the

1115
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:00,420
attack button for example double tapping

1116
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,130
the attack button will probably be

1117
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:06,920
different than single tapping the attack

1118
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:06,920
bucket button but there won't be like a

1119
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,769
you know X X Y kind of a thing

1120
01:03:15,699 --> 01:03:19,489
no VIN what are your thoughts on

1121
01:03:17,748 --> 01:03:23,048
switching to simulating adjacent rooms

1122
01:03:19,489 --> 01:03:26,150
rather than using the simulation apron

1123
01:03:23,048 --> 01:03:28,699
well my thought is that we probably want

1124
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:34,400
to set the apron to be the adjacent

1125
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:37,429
rooms but not actually explicitly code

1126
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,709
it as such and the reason for that is

1127
01:03:37,429 --> 01:03:43,848
because we may want to reserve the

1128
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:47,690
flexibility to change the size of rooms

1129
01:03:43,849 --> 01:03:51,410
and if we hard-code a bunch of stuff to

1130
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:53,778
be like simulate the next room over it

1131
01:03:51,409 --> 01:03:59,389
might be a little unclear what that

1132
01:03:53,778 --> 01:04:01,639
actually means in situations like where

1133
01:03:59,389 --> 01:04:03,588
there isn't a clear room or heaven

1134
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:06,458
forbid we decide that a certain room is

1135
01:04:03,588 --> 01:04:10,429
smooth scrolling and goes on for a while

1136
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:14,228
so I'm thinking that apron may be the

1137
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:18,919
best thing for the time being but you

1138
01:04:14,228 --> 01:04:21,318
know I don't really know since we don't

1139
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:25,039
care like the sim region code doesn't

1140
01:04:21,318 --> 01:04:28,940
care how you do the gather we have a

1141
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:30,920
pretty like we can make that decision

1142
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:33,139
right up until they until we ship the

1143
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,430
game right it's like we don't have to

1144
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:37,969
make that decision at any particular

1145
01:04:34,429 --> 01:04:43,748
time so when we see how the game is

1146
01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:48,949
playing way on down the line you know

1147
01:04:43,748 --> 01:04:51,978
200 episodes from now we can make that

1148
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:53,930
call then and it's not going to really

1149
01:04:51,978 --> 01:04:56,528
change any of the rest of the code I

1150
01:04:53,929 --> 01:04:56,528
don't think

1151
01:05:18,659 --> 01:05:23,409
how is the familiar intended to attack

1152
01:05:21,489 --> 01:05:25,328
some kind of projectile or doing some

1153
01:05:23,409 --> 01:05:28,269
kind of glide move and physically

1154
01:05:25,329 --> 01:05:32,880
getting a foe I'll be honest I have not

1155
01:05:28,269 --> 01:05:32,880
really thought that much about familiars

1156
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:36,849
we will probably have them in the game

1157
01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:40,480
but they're not a part of the design I

1158
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:42,789
really worked on very much there'll be a

1159
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,920
post on Mali rocket forums not this week

1160
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:47,338
but probably the next week that actually

1161
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:49,858
has a lot of information about some

1162
01:05:47,338 --> 01:05:51,909
handmade hero stuff that's happening

1163
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:56,798
that will give a little more insight

1164
01:05:51,909 --> 01:05:59,259
into that sort of stuff but basically

1165
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:01,750
what I'd say is the reason I put

1166
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:03,220
familiars in there during this coding

1167
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,750
session was not because they were this

1168
01:06:03,219 --> 01:06:06,539
big part of the game design but rather

1169
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:08,650
be just because they were a nice

1170
01:06:06,539 --> 01:06:11,170
understandable thing that everyone knows

1171
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:13,180
what they are so that we could just play

1172
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:18,389
with coding one and make sure that our

1173
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:18,389
system allowed that to happen right

1174
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:47,349
will there be a boot to match the glove

1175
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:52,450
no there's only gloves at the moment for

1176
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:53,650
particle effects for the glove are we

1177
01:06:52,449 --> 01:06:55,210
going to be doing something similar to

1178
01:06:53,650 --> 01:07:00,249
what we did or similar to what we did

1179
01:06:55,210 --> 01:07:03,999
earlier using head assets yes and no the

1180
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:06,179
yes part is that we you know the basics

1181
01:07:03,998 --> 01:07:10,768
of a particle system are always the same

1182
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:16,690
the no part is we probably don't need

1183
01:07:10,768 --> 01:07:21,368
some of the we don't really need the oil

1184
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:24,639
Arian grid-based stuff for something

1185
01:07:21,369 --> 01:07:26,528
like glove particle effects so a lot of

1186
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:29,739
the particle effects will be simpler

1187
01:07:26,528 --> 01:07:31,778
than the stuff we implemented as the

1188
01:07:29,739 --> 01:07:33,309
when I did the sort of like here's an it

1189
01:07:31,778 --> 01:07:40,119
here's how to do particle systems kind

1190
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:41,109
of just example stream so the particle

1191
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:44,680
effects of the glove will probably be

1192
01:07:41,108 --> 01:07:50,949
much simpler than that but otherwise

1193
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:52,748
yeah they'd be similar mid blue I'm

1194
01:07:50,949 --> 01:07:54,219
wondering if it could be cool mechanic

1195
01:07:52,748 --> 01:07:56,409
if you could swipe and change your

1196
01:07:54,219 --> 01:07:58,028
facing direction while you swipe thus

1197
01:07:56,409 --> 01:08:02,288
prolonging the swipe into a potentially

1198
01:07:58,028 --> 01:08:06,998
never-ending spinning punch so there are

1199
01:08:02,289 --> 01:08:08,799
sort of the control of the glove will be

1200
01:08:06,998 --> 01:08:12,608
different depending on which glove you

1201
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:17,259
have and I would like to try some after

1202
01:08:12,608 --> 01:08:21,068
touch on it but at the moment it's a

1203
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:23,158
little early for me to say what of those

1204
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:25,420
kinds of things are gonna go in the game

1205
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:28,539
because I kinda have to play with them

1206
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:30,759
and see like stuff like that is a little

1207
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:33,670
too feel based to really know what's

1208
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:36,779
going to be good or bad in actually

1209
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:36,779
playing the game

1210
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:46,710
have you played Planescape torment your

1211
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:53,010
handmade hero totally needs a Mort style

1212
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:54,720
familiar I I guess maybe my my

1213
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:58,730
preference would would actually probably

1214
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:08,909
be if I was gonna get familiars would be

1215
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:25,979
HK 47 from kotor I liked his vantur more

1216
01:09:08,909 --> 01:09:29,369
than mort's to be honest willing Guzman

1217
01:09:25,979 --> 01:09:31,979
will attacking the interrupt such as

1218
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:33,989
attacking an unanimity entity or someone

1219
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:36,779
attacked the player from behind in it

1220
01:09:33,989 --> 01:09:44,760
jump opposite to the attack example old

1221
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:47,489
Zelda so are you talking about the way

1222
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:51,800
that it pushes the player I'm not sure

1223
01:09:47,489 --> 01:09:51,800
what aspect of it are you talking about

1224
01:09:55,988 --> 01:10:03,639
I'm not sure I know exactly what you're

1225
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:06,710
asking in general attacks will not

1226
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:08,800
interrupt the player probably unless

1227
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:11,930
they were a very special kind of attack

1228
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:16,579
but attacks may interrupt enemies so if

1229
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:18,650
the enemy was doing something the enemy

1230
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:20,059
may get knocked back or whatever now

1231
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:24,259
sometimes the player might get knocked

1232
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:26,660
back as well but you you know probably

1233
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:28,820
most you know enemies wouldn't often

1234
01:10:26,659 --> 01:10:29,809
have that kind of ability just cuz I

1235
01:10:28,819 --> 01:10:35,238
think it's kind of annoying to

1236
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:37,400
constantly be pushed around but but you

1237
01:10:35,238 --> 01:10:40,309
may get gloves that do that and then you

1238
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:42,229
would have more you know when you had

1239
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:46,910
that ability you could use it often and

1240
01:10:42,229 --> 01:10:49,189
that sort of stuff duro I'd say why not

1241
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:52,159
leave the glove swipe to the artist

1242
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:55,969
animator of the game so because there is

1243
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:59,059
no animator if there is an animator then

1244
01:10:55,970 --> 01:11:03,829
you have to make a little bit of a

1245
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:05,180
trade-off there meaning even if you have

1246
01:11:03,829 --> 01:11:08,569
an animator it doesn't mean you always

1247
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:10,070
want to leave everything to animations

1248
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:14,929
and the reason for that is animations

1249
01:11:10,069 --> 01:11:17,899
are not parametric they don't have any

1250
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:20,000
logic in them right and so for something

1251
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:22,789
as crucial as say the way the player

1252
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,329
hops around and or the way that the

1253
01:11:22,789 --> 01:11:28,189
glove swipes you know there's only so

1254
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:31,340
much you can do in a can set of

1255
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:35,210
animations and I don't know that I want

1256
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:38,390
I don't know that I would want those to

1257
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:42,829
be canned even if there was an animator

1258
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:46,730
on the game because you know I might

1259
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:48,890
want I want there to be more logic to

1260
01:11:46,729 --> 01:11:50,779
how it like restores and what it does

1261
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:53,119
and I also want to be more parametric so

1262
01:11:50,779 --> 01:11:55,250
it's like every glove that you might get

1263
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:57,199
is animated differently depending on

1264
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:59,390
stats and things like that and I think

1265
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:01,550
for you know the hopping in the glove I

1266
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:04,010
think I would probably want to hand code

1267
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:05,960
how those worked to a large extent even

1268
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:07,880
if it was a game that was being hand

1269
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,500
animated by somebody for other things

1270
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:12,460
like monster attacks

1271
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:15,920
thing which are perhaps less interesting

1272
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:18,699
from the standpoint of hand coding the

1273
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,699
animation but

1274
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,710
it looks like there's really no

1275
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:36,229
programming questions here so I'm just

1276
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:42,649
gonna go ahead and wind down let's go

1277
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:43,968
ahead close this out all right thanks

1278
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:45,469
everyone for joining me for another side

1279
01:12:43,969 --> 01:12:47,659
of a handmade hero it's been a pleasure

1280
01:12:45,469 --> 01:12:50,149
coding with you as always if you would

1281
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:51,380
like to follow along at home you can

1282
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:53,809
always peer out of the game on handmade

1283
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:56,569
hero Oregon it comes with the source

1284
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:59,449
code so you can play around with it at

1285
01:12:56,569 --> 01:13:01,579
home even as we are building it we have

1286
01:12:59,448 --> 01:13:02,779
a forum site you go to ask questions if

1287
01:13:01,579 --> 01:13:04,850
you have questions about the programming

1288
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:06,170
we also have a patreon page you can go

1289
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:08,390
to if you want support the video series

1290
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:09,590
you have a schedule bot where we tweet

1291
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:11,630
the schedule if you want to catch the

1292
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:14,090
stream live and we have an episode guide

1293
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:18,170
by our very own Niblo who you can also

1294
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:20,989
support on patreon if you want to catch

1295
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:23,449
up with past videos in the series that's

1296
01:13:20,988 --> 01:13:27,439
about it for this week of handmade hero

1297
01:13:23,448 --> 01:13:30,009
we'll be back next week - well I think

1298
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:34,539
we've got two big tech things to do

1299
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:38,840
before we can sort of consider our

1300
01:13:34,539 --> 01:13:40,909
entity stuff fairly fairly solid and

1301
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:44,119
that is we got a deal with our Z

1302
01:13:40,909 --> 01:13:48,170
placement stuff and we've got to deal

1303
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:49,609
with our collision detection so those

1304
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:51,140
will be some pretty big topics which

1305
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:54,049
will probably start delving into next

1306
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:55,670
week but it's pretty cool I mean we're

1307
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:57,170
already at the point now where the game

1308
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:59,810
is starting to look a little bit more

1309
01:13:57,170 --> 01:14:01,969
gamey and the world already has that

1310
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:05,120
weird feeling of being a little bit

1311
01:14:01,969 --> 01:14:08,060
active and alive even though there's

1312
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:10,399
really not very much code in there for

1313
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:12,680
it it's just kind of interesting you

1314
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:15,859
know I mean it's weird right

1315
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:17,989
if you run if you just run even what

1316
01:14:15,859 --> 01:14:20,238
we've got right now it's weird the

1317
01:14:17,988 --> 01:14:22,909
transition to once things are active in

1318
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:25,609
the world it just kind of feels like

1319
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:27,109
something a place all of a sudden that

1320
01:14:25,609 --> 01:14:28,789
it didn't feel like before and now that

1321
01:14:27,109 --> 01:14:31,488
there's stuff happening and especially

1322
01:14:28,789 --> 01:14:33,500
when something happens like somebody

1323
01:14:31,488 --> 01:14:36,500
comes down from the top you know and

1324
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:39,920
onto the screen it adds this weird like

1325
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:42,479
sort of I don't know

1326
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,890
it's sort of I guess what I'd say is now

1327
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,979
that we've done sort of the entity brain

1328
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:48,480
stuff the the world inside handmade hero

1329
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:49,949
has crossed that threshold to me to

1330
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:53,879
where it feels like it's actually a

1331
01:14:49,949 --> 01:14:56,989
thing and and that's kind of fun so I'm

1332
01:14:53,880 --> 01:15:00,239
looking forward to kind of getting our

1333
01:14:56,989 --> 01:15:02,760
tech stuff finished up the few remaining

1334
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:05,639
issues we've got that I want done before

1335
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:08,070
we move forwards with specific gameplay

1336
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:09,360
things because I think it's gonna be fun

1337
01:15:08,069 --> 01:15:12,739
to just start dumping a lot of stuff in

1338
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:16,319
there that's just my opinion

1339
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:20,130
so anyway of course as I say that now

1340
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:23,340
Jude never came down why don't you come

1341
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:28,319
down to visit us ever what did we ever

1342
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:35,029
do to you mr. worm creature he's just

1343
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:37,170
kind of chilling out there isn't he yeah

1344
01:15:35,029 --> 01:15:40,079
all right anyway I don't even know why

1345
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:42,210
I'm focusing on that point being so I

1346
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:45,899
think it's kind of cool and I'm looking

1347
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:48,480
forward to just you know basically

1348
01:15:45,899 --> 01:15:50,460
dumping it's fun to when you have art

1349
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,769
assets like you know it'll be fun to

1350
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:55,409
dump into some monsters and and then

1351
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:56,790
start fighting them or whatever and so

1352
01:15:55,409 --> 01:15:59,489
it's kind of cool to see that starting

1353
01:15:56,789 --> 01:16:01,699
to come together anyway that's about it

1354
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:04,229
I will see you guys back here next week

1355
01:16:01,699 --> 01:16:05,939
check the schedule bot for the schedule

1356
01:16:04,229 --> 01:16:08,519
if you would like to catch those streams

1357
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:10,019
until then have fun programming and I

1358
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,830
will catch you guys on the Internet

1359
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,830
take it easy everyone
