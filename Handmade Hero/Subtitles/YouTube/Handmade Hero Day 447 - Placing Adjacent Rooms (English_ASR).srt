00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,778
Hero show Rico to complete-game live on

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:09,449
stream we're just starting in on level

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:14,280
layout stuff laying out rooms in our

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:15,838
game today we're just getting started we

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,919
don't really know much about how this

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,560
stuff's gonna work or what we're gonna

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,230
be able to do here but we wrote some

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,479
code that just does some simple stuff

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,710
with level layouts and we're kind of get

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,230
trying to get to the point where we can

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,539
see what we can reasonably do with

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,070
procedural generation of how rooms are

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,020
laid out and so on

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,250
much like the lighting algorithm we're

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,050
not going to this with any preconceived

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,299
notions we're just trying some things

18
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,468
and we're gonna see what happens and

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,359
later on we may take a look at the

20
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,679
literature as well and see what we can

21
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,200
learn from that and integrate that into

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,399
what we're doing but at the moment we're

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,160
just trying to get our feet wet and see

24
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,120
like what we like what seems to be the

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,759
right set of utilities for something and

26
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,589
how it goes alright so let's go ahead

27
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,869
and see where we left off if you

28
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,439
remember from yesterday we had gotten to

29
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:06,929
the point where we actually had a sort

30
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,949
of full system sketched out for doing

31
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,909
some size computations and we just

32
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,320
finished it at the end of the last

33
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:18,509
stream so and we were overtime because

34
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:21,688
you know I didn't want to keep dragging

35
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,000
it on make the stream too long we didn't

36
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:26,129
actually get a chance to run it so where

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,750
we're at right now is we're at the same

38
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,859
place we were yesterday because we if

39
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,140
zero that code out but we changed the

40
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:35,310
the way that rooms are defined to match

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,259
the way that we think we're going to

42
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,759
want to so again same place starting

43
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,840
places yesterday but now we've got all

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,459
this code in there that we can now turn

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,649
on and so what we want to do is turn

46
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,509
that code on and then try to get it to

47
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,340
the place where it's sort of working and

48
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,659
we can start playing around with it so

49
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,659
I'm going to go ahead and remove our if

50
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,939
zeroes here's our code and there's a

51
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,118
couple things we have to implement the

52
00:01:53,938 --> 00:02:00,179
there's a stack thing that we made that

53
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,578
we were using to sort of track rooms as

54
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,259
we crawl out along the network of rooms

55
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:09,030
and we want that to to sort of be our

56
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,818
little utility we can use whenever we

57
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,699
want to crawl rooms so that we didn't

58
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:14,229
implement

59
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:16,208
never quite got there so we've got a

60
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:17,829
couple of things like that that we want

61
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,229
to implement so for example this push

62
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:25,060
room call is the thing that puts

63
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:26,500
something on to that stack right and so

64
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,840
what that wants to do is that's just

65
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,269
gonna take a room and if you remember

66
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,709
correctly this stack is just real simple

67
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,170
right it's just a thing that says oh

68
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:37,090
I've got a point nurses in memory arena

69
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:39,039
that I can just dump things onto and I'm

70
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,680
just trying to keep you know track of

71
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,568
what the stock is we also know right

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,629
that we had the pop room version so we

73
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:48,669
know we've got both the push and the pop

74
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,139
that we want to do and so let's just put

75
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,719
those both in here and write the both at

76
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:55,359
the same time these are just crazy

77
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,269
simple right there's nothing interesting

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,360
about them we're literally just making a

79
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,890
simple little stack here and so if we

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,690
want to write the straightforward

81
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:06,250
version we just say well we know that

82
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:09,219
there's a room stack entry that gets

83
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,719
generated every time we push so we just

84
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:12,939
say all right we want one of those of

85
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,129
course we have a free list so we can

86
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:17,530
just do first free if it turns out that

87
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:19,719
there is something on the free list but

88
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,549
we take it and we're pretty much done we

89
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:26,049
just say okay the first free is now the

90
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:30,370
whatever comes after this one in the

91
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:32,590
free list and off we go and that's all

92
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,259
we have to do to get one but if we don't

93
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,430
have one then we need to allocate one so

94
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:39,189
then we would end up in a situation

95
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,069
where we're not going now what I can do

96
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:44,530
here is sometimes when I like to I don't

97
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:46,149
like to write it this way sometimes what

98
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,560
I'd rather do is make it so it always

99
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,469
succeeds I think this is just a little

100
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,329
more fun and a little easier to read if

101
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:56,799
I just say look if there isn't one let's

102
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:58,780
just put one on right so if there isn't

103
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,239
something on the free list but then I'll

104
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,370
just do a push truck using the memory

105
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,530
that I've got and I know that I want one

106
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,959
of these Jen room stack entries right

107
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,060
and that gets me something on the free

108
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,319
list so basically saying look let's just

109
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,509
say we always get it out of the free

110
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:17,199
list that we just know and so we always

111
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:19,810
do this exact thing every time that we

112
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,819
do it but instead we're just gonna you

113
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,918
know seed the free list with a with the

114
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:26,259
free with a available thing if there

115
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,549
wasn't went on there to begin with right

116
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,860
and so that's just an easier way to

117
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,650
write that in my opinion so I tend to

118
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,979
write it that way fairly often all right

119
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:38,799
so now once we get on once we actually

120
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:40,508
have the thing we're gonna fill out we

121
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,960
know we've got entries here and we want

122
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:45,520
to basically put a room on that that's

123
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:47,049
the thing we're trying to store and then

124
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,839
the previous entry is whatever was

125
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,889
behind us in the stack right and so we

126
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,478
know what's behind us in the stack

127
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,610
because we've got the stack top pointer

128
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,228
so we know that the top is what was

129
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,538
there and so we just want to go ahead

130
00:04:56,228 --> 00:05:00,068
and replace the top with ourselves and

131
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:01,779
so this is just creating a backwards

132
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,120
pointing list that just as the stack

133
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:05,439
grows I just push your stuff back there

134
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,959
so then once we wouldn't need to pop a

135
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,189
room again really really simple here if

136
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,538
you've been watching handmade here at

137
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:12,908
all hopefully this is just a no-brainer

138
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:14,378
to you and it's very simple if you don't

139
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:15,759
watch him you hear that often maybe this

140
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:17,530
is just like whoa I don't know I just

141
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,810
you know doubt I just use something from

142
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:21,788
the the STL I don't know what a stack is

143
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,978
okay no big deal

144
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,978
it is not scary right all this thing is

145
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:31,269
it's just just a chain of pointers

146
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,098
that's it right it's a pointer to the

147
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:35,918
top and each one has a pointer to the

148
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:37,300
one that was before it so if we want to

149
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,859
find out what the thing is on top of the

150
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,370
stack we know we can get that really

151
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:45,788
easy we just say okay the top comes from

152
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,288
stack top right and right now we don't

153
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:49,120
really need to do it this way if in the

154
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:50,348
future I'm gonna leave it like this just

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,000
cuz it's in the future you want to get

156
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:54,579
multiple things out of it we may want to

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,978
do that but really all we need is the

158
00:05:54,579 --> 00:06:00,399
result here and so we can really just

159
00:05:56,978 --> 00:06:01,658
say that and get all that we were you

160
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,628
know all we're gonna do is pull that

161
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:06,218
room out and then return it but you can

162
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:08,020
imagine if there was more data in here

163
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:10,718
eventually we would want to maybe snap a

164
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:11,829
pointer to it so you know six of one

165
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:15,519
half dozen the other but that's true for

166
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:17,769
the way we want do it now well you know

167
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,168
what here so I think probably we should

168
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:24,430
just assert on failure when you try to

169
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:29,649
pop the room because we have a like a

170
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:32,560
check for it oh you know what let's do

171
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:35,348
it this way and I'll let you try to pop

172
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,088
an empty stack I'll just let that happen

173
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:38,789
okay and then there's there's a good

174
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:40,589
reason why we put the top on

175
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,470
right because now we're gonna check the

176
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:45,899
top and then if the top has something in

177
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,340
it then we get it right and so that

178
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:48,629
seems reasonable because then you know

179
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,779
off we go

180
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:53,639
so anyway once we get one of these

181
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,589
things off the stack we're not quite

182
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,810
done because while we have given you

183
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:59,789
what the the room was there's on top

184
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,170
stock we have not popped the stack and

185
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,390
this is called pop room which means it

186
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,069
should take the top thing off the stack

187
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,479
so the next time someone looks at the

188
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:09,060
top of stack they're gonna get something

189
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,879
different right so what I want to do

190
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,750
here is save okay

191
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:18,360
we know that now whatever the top

192
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,670
pointer is should be the next thing

193
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,949
right we want to move it down the chain

194
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,350
and furthermore we don't want to lose

195
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:27,629
that piece that we've got we'd like to

196
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,730
recycle that memory the next time you

197
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:32,550
try to push a room so in addition we can

198
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:35,550
just take the first free and remember

199
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:39,509
that by saying oh whatever the first

200
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:44,189
three thing was that was on there its

201
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:45,899
previous I'm sorry whatever the first

202
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,149
three thing that was on there that can

203
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,219
be our previous right so basically

204
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:51,569
whatever the thing was at the top or the

205
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,710
first free list which again is just this

206
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,980
big long list of pointers are gonna

207
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:57,509
freed ones of these let's just remember

208
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,730
what that was and then stick ourselves

209
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,949
on top of the free list right so this

210
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,780
basically really what pop room ends up

211
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,969
doing at the end of the day is this just

212
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,739
managing two lifts it's taking off one

213
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,660
and putting on the other and push room

214
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,519
is the exact opposite it's it's just

215
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,780
we're just cycling between we're just

216
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,810
moving things from one list to another

217
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:18,750
right so this way we never take more

218
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,180
memory then we absolutely need to

219
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,699
because we're always gonna just recycle

220
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,819
something if we had a free one available

221
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,099
right we're gonna stick it back in there

222
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:30,089
all right so again let's just go over

223
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,040
those really quickly now that you've

224
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:33,569
seen him so we do push through and we

225
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,598
say look is there anything on the free

226
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,520
list if there is then great if there

227
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,550
isn't what we need to do is add a new

228
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,809
one so we use the memory point the the

229
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,329
memory arena that we know we're supposed

230
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:46,739
to use we just make a new one and again

231
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,259
this will clear to zero so we know that

232
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,210
it comes to is all zeros here not that

233
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:51,838
it matters we can tell it not to clear

234
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,430
in fact

235
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,139
if we were carried about the speed you

236
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:57,138
know you could do this I think we've got

237
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:07,139
right we can just say don't clear and

238
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,188
that way we won't waste the time because

239
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,139
we know we're gonna fill out everything

240
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:12,509
in here so we could do that too it's up

241
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,829
to us so we come in here and we say all

242
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:15,720
right let's add to it for this we don't

243
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:17,489
have one but we then get the thing off

244
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,889
the free list which would either be the

245
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,299
one that's just been there or it's the

246
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:22,740
one we just put and it depends on

247
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,528
whether there were any free available

248
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,959
right so then we say okay after we grab

249
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:30,720
that one we want to advance the free

250
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:33,568
list one forward if we just added one

251
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,040
right oh well I guess you know what that

252
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:39,088
is a reason why we would want to clear

253
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,559
it right because we need this free

254
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:41,910
pointer to be zero so we might as well

255
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,159
let it clear if that's what we wanted

256
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:46,469
anyway and hey we're clearing this a

257
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,509
little bit much but romping zeros is is

258
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:53,399
probably best in this case anyway all

259
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:55,019
right so off we go we look at the the

260
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,089
first three we grab it we move the first

261
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,220
free to the next pointer we've got the

262
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:01,410
room here we record which room it is we

263
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,028
got the preacher we say all right the

264
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,558
previous thing is whatever was on the

265
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:07,438
top of the stack and now we're the top

266
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:09,509
of stack done for popping room same

267
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:11,308
thing in Reverse we say all right what's

268
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:13,019
at the top of the stack if there wasn't

269
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:14,519
in the top of stack we do it otherwise

270
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,629
we don't now notice the structural

271
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,889
difference here why is there a

272
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,449
structural difference here the structure

273
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:21,629
difference is because push room must

274
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:23,609
succeed right anytime you push a room we

275
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:26,430
must succeed so if we need more memory

276
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,289
we'll get it pop room just doesn't do

277
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:31,198
anything if there wasn't anything on

278
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:33,629
stack right so we want an actual if

279
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:34,889
around the whole operation because if

280
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:36,659
there were something to have attack we

281
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:37,829
don't do anything so that's the

282
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,969
difference everything else is the same

283
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:44,308
we take the thing off the off the top

284
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,829
right we say all right let's take

285
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:48,629
whatever the thing was that was right

286
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:50,308
before this one that had previously been

287
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:52,579
the top of stack that's now the top of

288
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:58,438
the stack and then we also say all right

289
00:10:52,578 --> 00:11:00,328
whatever the the whatever the thing is

290
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:03,599
that we pulled off which is this top

291
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:05,338
right I don't like you know what

292
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,379
I don't like the fact that it's called

293
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,380
top because it's not the top anymore

294
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,529
how does that look better so we pop this

295
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,420
guy that we're gonna you know we're

296
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:20,850
gonna remove off we say okay get the

297
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:23,250
popped room that's the result the stack

298
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,959
top is now whatever we popped previous

299
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,750
so the one that used to be on the top is

300
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,939
now on the top again our previous

301
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:33,000
becomes whatever the free list is and

302
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,790
the free list points to us done right

303
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,828
now if we wanted to we could also fill

304
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:49,309
the room with an invalid pointer right

305
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:54,328
so like if we wanted to we could do this

306
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:57,659
and that way if somehow you tried to use

307
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:59,370
it accidentally you would know you'd

308
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:02,578
fault because we'd be like trying to

309
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,328
look at zero memory so we could do that

310
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:05,698
as well

311
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:07,620
it's ineffectual because in any well

312
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:09,299
working version of the program the only

313
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,399
person who ever writes to it is here and

314
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,399
this is always nonzero in fact we could

315
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:20,129
ensure that's true

316
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:23,579
and you know we could ensure that's true

317
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:26,009
here as well so you know we can add a

318
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:28,679
little layer of carefulness there if we

319
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:30,870
want to don't have to but we can so

320
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,289
that's our pushing pop rooms and how

321
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,990
those work and now we can finish the

322
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:40,289
rest of the stuff that needs to be there

323
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:42,209
so let's see we have the room stack

324
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:43,980
there that's fine all right and so now

325
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:47,879
we get down into the place room stuff

326
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:52,129
that we were looking at before and seem

327
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:57,649
to have some parentheses problems here

328
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:57,649
and there was two men

329
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:09,090
okay there we go we also got some news

330
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:14,549
for us to be pointers it looks like and

331
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:14,550
we did not do that yeah

332
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,769
alright and so now we're back down to

333
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,680
like I said just a couple things we need

334
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:24,789
to do here it looks like stack probably

335
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:29,139
needs address up there

336
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:31,120
so now we're back down to the we're back

337
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:33,699
down to the functions that we wanted

338
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,830
that we hadn't actually typed in yet and

339
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:41,320
so what I'm gonna do is actually break

340
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:45,400
those out here so can be Direction is

341
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,230
gonna be stubbed at the moment so and we

342
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,679
could actually just go put this in for

343
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,649
real

344
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:56,829
I suppose which is originally when we

345
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,389
wrote the stub code when we said here's

346
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,830
the rooms here's how the rooms are

347
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:05,830
connected what we didn't specify is why

348
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:08,440
which directions those rooms were

349
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:11,320
allowed to be connected so for example

350
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,440
all connections would Allah would be

351
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,300
allowed to be staircases up and down in

352
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,920
the current system because all you say

353
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:20,079
is this room has to be connected to this

354
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,879
other room but that's realistically now

355
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,590
we probably want for game design for

356
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:25,120
game design it makes a big difference

357
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,149
whether something is connected up or

358
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,429
down or not because they feel different

359
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:33,850
and they have different implications to

360
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:37,359
us in terms of our mental understanding

361
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:40,899
of the world for example a forest cannot

362
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,970
stack on top of a forest not in most

363
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:44,740
cases anyway right so the player would

364
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,480
perceive something odd if you had a

365
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,899
forest with a stairwell and a forest on

366
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,700
top of it right so depending on the type

367
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:52,629
of room that it is and the way that

368
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,700
connection is supposed to be played out

369
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:57,039
we oftentimes want to restrict

370
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,890
connections to either up and down only

371
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,939
if it's like a bunch of rooms they're

372
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:04,929
supposed to stacked on top of each other

373
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,720
or sideways only so most connections are

374
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:09,938
probably going to say either I can be

375
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,479
north south east west or I can be

376
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:14,738
up down most will not be both and so

377
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,389
that was the thing that we sort of

378
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:18,609
realized when we were typing in the

379
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:23,709
actual room connection code and so

380
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:27,549
that's why we want to be more specific

381
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:30,158
here right so we want this

382
00:15:27,548 --> 00:15:32,308
directionality to be respected in that

383
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:35,558
sense right now what we're going to do

384
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:37,448
is just kind of leave it blank I think

385
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:40,478
and then we'll take a look at that in a

386
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:42,578
second but we also have to deal with has

387
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:44,499
entries which is the way you tell

388
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:47,198
whether or not the room stack anything

389
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:48,189
in it and we already really know exactly

390
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:52,389
what that's going to look like right

391
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:53,408
because it's the wrong key there if you

392
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:55,839
don't get the wrong key

393
00:15:53,408 --> 00:15:59,739
then what you can see is that the stack

394
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:02,139
already has the code for whether it

395
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:04,209
could pop it's this right here right if

396
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:06,038
the stack top pointer points to

397
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:08,558
something then it's got entries if it

398
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:09,879
doesn't it doesn't so the answer to

399
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:12,188
whether a stack has anything on it

400
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:15,069
accomplished is pretty darn simple it's

401
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:26,500
just whether or not this is a valid

402
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:28,959
pointer that's it makes sense okay

403
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,549
so now we've got everything in there and

404
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,190
we just need to deal with our concept of

405
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:34,240
direction now what I want to do to deal

406
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,740
with this constant direction it's gonna

407
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,180
pull this function up a little bit and

408
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,220
I'm just gonna talk about this in terms

409
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:41,259
of how we actually connect rooms so if

410
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,420
we go over here and we take a look at

411
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:48,789
room connection what I want to do is

412
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:51,069
introduce a mask here or a direction

413
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:55,750
mask I guess I should say and I'm going

414
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:58,240
to sort of have a an idea of what these

415
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:03,220
directions should be and I'm gonna kind

416
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,230
of talk about them semantically as well

417
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,720
now if I remember correctly we've done

418
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:11,470
exactly this thing for exactly this

419
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,779
thing and where we did it was we had

420
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:17,559
this we had this notion and I don't

421
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:20,440
remember exactly what it was called but

422
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:33,190
it was basically like a thing that lets

423
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:42,210
you get a box sides it was for the

424
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:42,210
lighting surface index that's what it is

425
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:54,710
it's this thing right here so if you

426
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:57,199
remember this thing it had like a

427
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:01,009
surface index right and the surface

428
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,450
index was decrypted in this fashion and

429
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:04,970
so what you ended up saying was like

430
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,680
okay I pass in a surface index the axis

431
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:10,069
and the positive or negative are like

432
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,049
interpreted this way well I'm a big fan

433
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:13,759
of just once we have a way to do

434
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:16,009
something let's keep doing it that way

435
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,869
unless we have a real reason not to

436
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:19,129
because chances are if there was a

437
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:20,569
reason we did it that way the first time

438
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,090
they'll probably be reason to do it that

439
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:25,429
way this time so what I'd like to do is

440
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:30,409
come up with a way of sort of

441
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:32,060
abstracting this this exact behavior and

442
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:36,009
then we'll just use it in both cases

443
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:41,690
right so we'll have this notion of what

444
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:43,910
direction is like a box you know surface

445
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,190
mask or something like that and we'll

446
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:49,330
we'll grab this out and we'll make this

447
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,769
be sort of our definition of that right

448
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:54,399
and that way we and what you know what

449
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,400
else do it like this

450
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:06,488
all right uh so this will tell us

451
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:13,389
essentially what we mean by these things

452
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:15,069
the axis in this case is the x y&amp;z and

453
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:21,278
it's positive or negative which way it's

454
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:26,288
pointing right and so we might want to

455
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:29,440
give a little more I don't know anyway

456
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:31,210
point being if we just stay consistent

457
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,919
with this then this is the information

458
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,979
that we actually want to know which is

459
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:37,479
axis index and positive and so what we

460
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:39,970
can do is make something that translates

461
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:43,450
to and from that we can basically make a

462
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:46,089
struct here which encapsulate those two

463
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,710
things for example and we can return

464
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:52,108
those when you actually want to know

465
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:57,190
what they are so for example I can say

466
00:19:52,108 --> 00:20:04,569
box surface parameters something like

467
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:07,109
that right and what we can do is say Fox

468
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,108
service parameters

469
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:28,490
and you just pass the index and back

470
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:34,769
come these two so that's a way to go

471
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:37,500
Jimmy that's a way to go sort of in and

472
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:40,559
we need a way to go out right

473
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,200
so well maybe we'll call this out and we

474
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,539
need to wait to go in if you will so

475
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,569
what I want to do is make a way to do

476
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:53,849
get surface index and pass the params

477
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:57,869
right but really we probably don't need

478
00:20:53,849 --> 00:21:01,399
to bundle them you can probably just do

479
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:04,500
it like that and then it's why I type I

480
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,590
then what we can do here is just say we

481
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:11,400
know how to produce one of these we just

482
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:14,059
say that we do the opposite of what's

483
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,070
going on here so positive we assert

484
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:20,309
positive is less than or equal to one

485
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:22,799
right I mean another way to say that

486
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:24,899
would just be that it's equal to zero or

487
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,089
one and that acts as index has to be

488
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,880
less than or equal to 2 because we 0 1

489
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:33,019
or 2 right and then the result is just

490
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:36,290
going to be the surface index shifted up

491
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:36,289
and a word

492
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,320
so that's a way to go in and out of this

493
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,500
thing

494
00:21:44,319 --> 00:22:02,439
and for what it's worth you're right I

495
00:21:47,500 --> 00:22:04,440
can do this and now that's using the

496
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:10,058
same code so I know that it's consistent

497
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:12,370
right so that's really all I'm talking

498
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:17,980
about there I'm gonna go ahead and pull

499
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:20,979
these in here I don't know really where

500
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:27,130
we want to put that we could choose to

501
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:29,170
put stuff sort of wrap it up into its

502
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,120
own thing at some point if we want to

503
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:34,179
but I don't know

504
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:38,199
anyway the box surface mass that you

505
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:42,840
have here we could call these names as

506
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:47,440
well so if we think about what these are

507
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:51,639
x-axis negative is like west x-axis

508
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:56,519
positive is east y-axis positive and

509
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,520
negative are like north and south right

510
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,910
and ZX is positive and negative are like

511
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:08,860
down and up so if we want to we can

512
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:18,279
think about these in that way and these

513
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:21,459
are the these are sort of the individual

514
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:24,879
in the indexes that make up what we're

515
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:29,110
talking about right now the problem with

516
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:34,120
them is we have two ways that we want to

517
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:37,509
refer to them and so we have to kind of

518
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:41,649
think about how they will end up in a

519
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:44,349
mask these produce indexes where zero

520
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:47,440
one two three four five are the six

521
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:49,750
directions we're talking about but if we

522
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,558
wanted to order them together we would

523
00:23:49,750 --> 00:24:00,190
need to generate

524
00:23:50,558 --> 00:24:02,349
asks out of them this is Ike I just want

525
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:33,788
both so let me put it let me do it this

526
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:34,990
way something like this and the reason

527
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:36,878
that I'm doing this is just because I

528
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,829
want to be able to refer to both of

529
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:41,259
these things quickly and easily and

530
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:43,058
they're two different things right so

531
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:44,980
one is the surface index and those are

532
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:47,769
the actual values the other is the mask

533
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:56,710
and that's just the index whatever it is

534
00:24:47,769 --> 00:25:01,118
right I in mask for so you see what I'm

535
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:02,740
doing there one is just zero one two

536
00:25:01,118 --> 00:25:05,109
three four five

537
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:08,308
the other is one shifted up that many

538
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:10,748
places so that I can order them in write

539
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:12,308
very very straightforward but it allows

540
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:13,829
me to kind of like play with that and

541
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:16,589
figure out what's going on there right

542
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:22,859
so what I want to hear is say all right

543
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:22,859
west east south north down

544
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,389
and at this point this is getting

545
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:35,048
ridiculous enough that I think I may

546
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:41,469
just go ahead and make handmade box you

547
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:46,808
know what let's just go ahead treat

548
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:49,889
yourself to a fresh file and then I can

549
00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:49,888
just put all this stuff in there

550
00:25:53,869 --> 00:26:15,619
oops yeah and I can put those worlds in

551
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:15,619
functions in there as well there we go

552
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:28,440
and now we can look at lightbox surface

553
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:30,690
and pull that in and now this stuff is

554
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,309
kind of all just in one place and we can

555
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:47,490
start to build up more things about this

556
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:51,389
as we want as well right all right thank

557
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:54,359
you so hopefully this all makes

558
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,320
reasonable sense now we've got the

559
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,500
ability to talk about all these things

560
00:26:55,319 --> 00:27:02,389
and I will go ahead and add them to the

561
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:11,130
handmade hero list of being food files

562
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:16,560
that we use and it's probably a pretty

563
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:21,860
easy generic thing so it probably should

564
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,859
be pretty high up on the list

565
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:42,388
what is it saying oh semicolon all right

566
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,259
so now that we've consolidated that

567
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,579
stuff in there and that's all pulled out

568
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:50,499
into a nice little box file that we can

569
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:51,730
use to do stuff with boxes and we

570
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:53,169
probably will want to do some other

571
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,690
things with boxes in the future right

572
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:57,159
but this is just a nice way of like

573
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,840
summarizing our notation so if anyone

574
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,730
wants to know how we're talking about

575
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,949
boxes in any part of the code they can

576
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:05,259
just look in here and it's pretty clear

577
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,720
how it works and what it does and why

578
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:10,028
right and furthermore here are the

579
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,788
functions that you can use on it nice

580
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:14,558
and easy to read right and I do like

581
00:28:12,788 --> 00:28:14,950
that stuff so you notice on handmade

582
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:16,749
Hiro

583
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,239
I don't fetishize any of those sorts of

584
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:21,940
things and we never do it earlier than

585
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,350
necessary but once I'm obviously at a

586
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,239
point where I'm like this is how we're

587
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:27,668
talking about stuff I do like to bring

588
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,929
things out and sort of pretty them up

589
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:30,970
and make it so that it's nice and like

590
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:34,440
alright we know that's how that happens

591
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:34,440
now off we go

592
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:44,889
so let's go ahead and take a look stir

593
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:46,358
mask so here's the derp mask what I want

594
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:53,738
to do is say all right the connection

595
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:56,558
derp mask needs to be set for whatever

596
00:28:53,739 --> 00:29:00,190
the surface index is what's the surface

597
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:02,668
index for this thing right well now we

598
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,710
know we can just say get surface index

599
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:07,028
and here we go we pass the axis and

600
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,569
whether it's positive so there's Tim

601
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:14,009
inside and then that tells us and we're

602
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:18,579
done right so that's pretty handy and

603
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:20,259
it's really that's it yeah not much not

604
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:22,089
much else to it

605
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:25,509
so that's all good this of course

606
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:28,538
doesn't actually need to be any specific

607
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:30,519
size I suppose so in here our can be

608
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:33,009
Direction now works unfortunately our

609
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,179
code would not work at all now even if

610
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:35,589
we didn't have any bugs in the stuff

611
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:37,530
that we've wrote and never tested which

612
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:39,929
we kind of need to start testing

613
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:41,490
certainly but this basically means we

614
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:44,779
could never lay out any rooms at all the

615
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:47,609
reason for that is our connect function

616
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:50,029
has no idea what to do right it's

617
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:52,349
putting in a 0 for that der mask and

618
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:54,960
because it'll just be cleared so that

619
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:57,750
means the direction can't exist in any

620
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,600
way and so what we need to do here is

621
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:02,670
start actually specifying what the der

622
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,309
mask is when we connect rooms together

623
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:07,590
now what we can do is by default we can

624
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:13,139
say a particular thing that should be

625
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:20,159
the general mask which is whether we

626
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:22,530
want planar or I guess vertical motion I

627
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,170
don't know but we can see that we've got

628
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:30,200
a planar box mask which is just gonna be

629
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:35,160
you know boss Bach's mass west east

630
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:37,529
south and north combined together and

631
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:48,420
that's our planar mask and then we've

632
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:52,920
got an up and bound version and I guess

633
00:30:48,420 --> 00:31:00,680
one thing that's a little confusing

634
00:30:52,920 --> 00:31:00,680
about this is really the direction mask

635
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:09,119
has to be stated relative to somebody so

636
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:13,110
suppose you wanted a connection where a

637
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:17,879
was on the bottom and B was on top well

638
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:21,929
if I just say box mask up that's not

639
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:24,540
really what that means because how did

640
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:29,549
you know which one was supposed to be

641
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:31,109
the up right so we probably want now

642
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:34,619
that I'm thinking about it to make the

643
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:43,679
name of this more explicit

644
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:47,059
so mask on direction from a or like

645
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,060
direction from a mask

646
00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:00,769
because you can it's always symmetric so

647
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,530
when you specify one mask we know what

648
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:05,960
the other person's mask is right because

649
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:08,000
if you say that this can be west or east

650
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,380
then that by default means that the

651
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,240
other one could be west or east

652
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,740
whichever the opposite is if you say

653
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,279
it's only west then that means the other

654
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:18,319
one had the only East right so we kind

655
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:20,569
of know that they correspond so we don't

656
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,279
need to specify both but we do need to

657
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:24,259
say specifically which one we were

658
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,789
specifying it for because otherwise it's

659
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:27,259
very ambiguous to someone coming along

660
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:29,450
and looking this code what do you mean

661
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:34,339
direction mask a thing goes in two

662
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:36,500
directions right so in a sense we need

663
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:38,480
to be able to specify and again we don't

664
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,400
want to specify bilaterally directions

665
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,819
because we do want to say did you mean

666
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:46,070
upward you mean down we need to know

667
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:49,189
relative to a room though first right it

668
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:52,189
goes up from a so I think it is roughly

669
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:54,080
what we want in that case but we do kind

670
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,330
of need to be able to obey it a little

671
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,710
bit more specifically there now there is

672
00:32:56,329 --> 00:33:01,720
another way we could have done that and

673
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:05,450
that is to just have three different

674
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:08,269
bits one for up-down one for east-west

675
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:15,170
and one for north-south right we could

676
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:16,579
have done that and if we did that then

677
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,240
we would just specify one of those and

678
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,240
we wouldn't need to know

679
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:32,079
there's pros and cons to each but I

680
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,700
think this way probably ends up being

681
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,009
better because it doesn't introduce

682
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,860
another set of ways of talking about the

683
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:41,169
directions we already know that plenty

684
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:44,259
of our code wants to talk about specific

685
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:46,059
surface indices so just having this code

686
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:47,980
also use that anomic nature I think

687
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:50,019
probably will prove to be right because

688
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:53,679
I think both ways are a little messy

689
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:55,359
neither solution is perfect and so I

690
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,490
think that just picking the one that can

691
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:59,319
be used in more places more often is

692
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:01,750
probably the better choice when faced

693
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:03,158
with two imperfect solutions and so

694
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,450
unless we find something a little bit

695
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:06,280
further down the road that really makes

696
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,108
us go wait a minute no it should be the

697
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:22,480
other way I think we wanted to stay with

698
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:25,829
something that's more explicit so yeah I

699
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,809
don't know what we want to call this

700
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:31,148
like what do you what are up and down

701
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:32,769
you know the problem one of the real

702
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:35,440
problems is that in the real world be

703
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:38,050
used terms like vertical to mean things

704
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,730
that go up and down but in the game

705
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,820
world when you're looking at a screen

706
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,378
oftentimes horizontal and vertical

707
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,539
neither of them are up and down right

708
00:34:44,378 --> 00:34:56,168
they're both used to describe lateral

709
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:58,230
motions that are in the plane so I don't

710
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:58,230
know

711
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:08,259
yeah I don't know we're gonna leave like

712
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:11,050
that for now cuz that's just it's what I

713
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,820
can think of so there's our mask and

714
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,500
here's our indices those are all nice

715
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,720
and tidy now and now we have a direction

716
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:20,050
mask from a and what I'm gonna say is

717
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,639
that the direction mask from a and I

718
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,080
suppose I can just call this entire mask

719
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:25,179
from a don't need to get too verbose

720
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,889
there what I could see there is when we

721
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:31,230
connect two rooms together and you can

722
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:33,519
kind of see where I'm going with this

723
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,960
99.9% of the time the way that we're

724
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,590
gonna connect rooms probably I'm

725
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,320
guessing is to just say look it's gonna

726
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:43,030
be planar right so and in fact all of

727
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,620
the connections we did so far were all

728
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,970
planar connections we didn't have any

729
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:48,279
other specialty but they weren't in

730
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:52,029
America so I think that that's a

731
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,200
reasonable way to do it because most of

732
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,870
the time that's what it's gonna be

733
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,669
so all of our code right now is now

734
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:02,019
implicitly saying these two have to be

735
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:07,119
plain early laid out right so now I

736
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:10,710
think we're good but can be direction

737
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,269
because of that sort of realization that

738
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,789
der masks kind of has to be relative to

739
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:18,670
something if we want to be using

740
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:21,610
specific directions when we specify it

741
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:24,700
can be Direction is not really

742
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:26,829
sufficient right the reason is not

743
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:30,009
sufficient is because when we're talking

744
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:33,250
about a connection we don't know whether

745
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:35,740
we're a or B if all we specified was the

746
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:40,480
connection so what we need to do here is

747
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:44,739
say alright we need to talk about can be

748
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:47,010
direction from a particular room and so

749
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:49,119
when we say could we go this direction

750
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:52,210
we need to know which we're talking

751
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,400
about here now can be direction for this

752
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,619
particular thing which which one are we

753
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,680
talking about right and that's crucial

754
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:01,869
here are we talking about you know how

755
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,819
are these rooms getting placed and so

756
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:06,429
what we're doing is we're placing this

757
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:09,490
room and so what we want to do is look

758
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:12,819
at how we wrote this code if we come in

759
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:15,039
here on axis 0 positive false

760
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:20,740
essentially right so dim 0 sy

761
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:23,050
zero if the side parameter was one came

762
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:25,809
in here if the side primeros zero it

763
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,640
came in here and so that's saying that

764
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:31,119
well we're we're gonna try and place

765
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:34,859
ourselves in the case of a negative axis

766
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,869
means our minimum has to be less than

767
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:43,230
the maximum value of the other room

768
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:46,630
right which means we're sort of to the

769
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:50,820
min side of it in the case where we're

770
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:55,420
negative so that to me suggests that

771
00:37:50,820 --> 00:38:04,510
we're talking about this sort of

772
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:07,450
backwards if you will because can be

773
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:16,870
Direction is sort of saying oh if I've

774
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:18,699
got can be Direction is saying here is

775
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:21,039
the side in axis I want you to tell me

776
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:24,489
whether I could place the room in that

777
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,929
direction right so that means that a has

778
00:38:24,489 --> 00:38:32,709
to be the room that's plate that's

779
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:36,089
that's given here in a sense so probably

780
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,090
what I just need to do is

781
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:47,840
probably what I need to do is allow you

782
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:47,840
to ask either one right

783
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,579
I'm pretty I'm pretty sure of that and

784
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:02,108
so if we take a look actually how that

785
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:04,269
works I'm just going to go back here to

786
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:06,159
action box so what's interesting about

787
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:11,099
this is these are all sort of like

788
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:18,420
complementary so basically if you just

789
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:18,420
switch which ones you're talking about I

790
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:26,818
think at that point you're fine

791
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,470
so I think we can bitwise do this let me

792
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:45,659
go ahead and sketch that out for you so

793
00:39:43,469 --> 00:39:48,149
if I want to ask if I can go from A to B

794
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:49,829
that I just used the mask as it is if I

795
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,139
want to ask whether I can go from B to a

796
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:55,739
I have to do an inversion of the mask

797
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:59,779
right that flips these directions but

798
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:59,779
that's actually pretty easy to do I

799
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:09,410
don't know what to call this getfox mask

800
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:09,409
compliment maybe

801
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:25,799
so in this case I need to construct a

802
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:28,889
result and what I want the result to be

803
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,289
is I want it to be East if it was west

804
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:32,609
or west it was east north of it was

805
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:34,320
south south it was north right I just

806
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:36,660
want to flip those and what you can see

807
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,600
is they're lined up right I've got two

808
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:41,159
bits for West and East the next two bits

809
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,420
for North and South next two bits are up

810
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:50,940
and down right so what I can do is I can

811
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:55,650
mask off half the bits and half the bits

812
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:57,780
right by being creative so I can make a

813
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:03,300
thing called a half bit mask here which

814
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:06,440
is box matte oops and I suppose I could

815
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,440
really just do it this way

816
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:19,659
right so I'm just taking one in the

817
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:26,690
bottom zero one zero one right which is

818
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:33,469
west south and down and what I can do is

819
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:34,220
mask those out right and then mass the

820
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:42,949
other ones out

821
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:47,000
so just west south down just east north

822
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:48,589
up right space what we're doing here

823
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,630
otherwise like I could also say just

824
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:56,599
odds just evens right and I can call

825
00:41:53,630 --> 00:42:05,570
this the odd bit mask you know I'm

826
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:09,470
saying I guess if we wanted to say bit

827
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:18,980
zero bit one bit maybe you would call

828
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:25,000
this thing it depends what you want the

829
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:25,000
one bit to be called 1 or 0 and the

830
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:41,409
uh here's here's what we'll say how's

831
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:43,389
that now there's no anomic nature so

832
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:45,489
what I want to do is say all right let's

833
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:47,949
take the Box mask and end it with the

834
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:51,549
bit mask and let's take the box max and

835
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:55,149
end it with the bit mask shifted up by

836
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:56,769
one right so when I end it with this bit

837
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,990
mask what I'm going to get is just a

838
00:42:56,769 --> 00:43:00,579
zero two and four bits and when I end it

839
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:01,809
with the bit master fit up I want I'm

840
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,690
gonna get just the one in the three and

841
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:21,969
the five right and all I do now just

842
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:23,679
swap them out again really easy so all

843
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:27,429
I'm doing is saying okay once I've

844
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:30,460
masked out the high bit in each pair I

845
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:32,199
can shift this up and or it in and have

846
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,349
moves a little bit to the high bit in

847
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:37,659
each pair the same is true for the

848
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:39,368
opposite if I have the high bit in each

849
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:40,839
pair I can shift it down and or it in

850
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:43,390
and now I've swapped the high bit with

851
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:46,000
the low bit right so this just moves the

852
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:47,259
ones to where this moves the low bits

853
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,608
where the high bits was and the Hybris

854
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,359
where the world it's just a Swizzle just

855
00:43:48,608 --> 00:43:56,199
a two-bit Swizzle well that's it right

856
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:58,989
and yeah that's all I wanted to do so to

857
00:43:56,199 --> 00:44:01,929
get the Box mask complement all you have

858
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:04,839
to do is just this bit pattern here it's

859
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:08,259
very simple right

860
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,470
so what I can do in terms of going back

861
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:14,890
to my world Jen I can now ask either way

862
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:20,739
whichever one I want so I can say Jen

863
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:23,710
room from so I can say can go direction

864
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:27,539
or something like that or can or maybe

865
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:31,358
like could go direction from this room

866
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:37,179
over this connection and then what I can

867
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:40,989
say is well we need to compute adder

868
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:43,089
mask it could be this one which is the

869
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:57,189
one that's already in there

870
00:44:43,090 --> 00:45:01,150
but if if the connection isn't a so if

871
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:09,460
it's actually B or something right then

872
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:17,019
I need to do the complement of it to

873
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:19,050
flip it all the way around and that's it

874
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:21,789
so now I think I can ask that question

875
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,140
however I want and that's good because

876
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:24,960
that way all the rest of the code

877
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:28,599
doesn't have to think about it anymore

878
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,030
which is pretty important right I

879
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,380
thought I did change it to der mask from

880
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:42,880
a did I not

881
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:52,690
oh dear mask from a there we go and so

882
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:54,820
now we can just call it go direction now

883
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:57,340
we can pass whichever room we want here

884
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:00,010
and then pass the other things so what I

885
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,380
want to know I think I wrote this like I

886
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,540
said the other way round so what I was

887
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,950
saying is we're placing this room so I

888
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:08,349
want to know if I could go the direction

889
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:12,099
from the other room so what I'm actually

890
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:14,559
saying I think is this can I go from the

891
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:17,079
other room to the room I'm placing in

892
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,469
that direction that I'm saying here

893
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:19,469
right

894
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,590
and so now I can just ask that question

895
00:46:21,429 --> 00:46:27,460
the way I wanted to and I think this

896
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:29,760
falls out so we'll we'll verify that

897
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,760
later

898
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:48,570
just to make sure side is correct there

899
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:50,429
I think it is but yeah you know don't

900
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,470
quote me on that

901
00:46:50,429 --> 00:46:54,989
so all that stuff it's fine when we get

902
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:58,559
down here and we're gonna do our max

903
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:59,159
aloud dimension one of the things that

904
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,529
this

905
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:05,219
I think fails to take into account and I

906
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:10,830
wish that it would so far is this

907
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:14,609
doesn't really handle the first room

908
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:15,960
very well so when we get to the first

909
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:19,950
room you could put it anywhere you want

910
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:22,380
you know and maybe it's fine to stick it

911
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:27,029
all the way at the very earliest part of

912
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:30,900
the you know at negative two billion or

913
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:32,400
whatever maybe that's fine but it seems

914
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,380
like we maybe want to place it more

915
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,829
centrally around zero you know what I'm

916
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:43,289
saying so I think in some sense we may

917
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:45,389
want to special case that first room so

918
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:48,809
that it starts out more towards the

919
00:47:45,389 --> 00:47:54,469
center and we actually can do that I

920
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:54,469
think without really doing much else

921
00:47:56,030 --> 00:48:02,720
what I could do is just here have

922
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:02,720
something like place room in volume

923
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:26,639
it's just sort of an understanding of

924
00:48:25,108 --> 00:48:28,920
what's happening there and what I could

925
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,679
do is say look let's just place the

926
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,889
first room wherever we're gonna place

927
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:37,169
the first room as a seed point and then

928
00:48:34,889 --> 00:48:41,009
we'll go from there so when we actually

929
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:43,829
this is not the room Tina I wanted so

930
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:48,200
when we actually put the first room on

931
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:52,079
the stack let's actually place the room

932
00:48:48,199 --> 00:49:05,250
in some volume that we want and let's

933
00:48:52,079 --> 00:49:07,470
also set its yeah let's do this let's

934
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:11,880
not push that room let's push the

935
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:15,289
connected rooms instead and we'll set

936
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,289
its generation index right

937
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:26,719
and that's just so I can sort of say

938
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:29,719
where I want layout to start and I

939
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:33,379
realized that that's not maybe actually

940
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:35,179
necessary but I just want to do it so

941
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:38,390
that I can control where the first one

942
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:41,118
goes for now we may undo that assumption

943
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:53,929
a little later on but for now I just

944
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:56,088
want to do it I don't know what we want

945
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:57,440
this initial room to be quite yet and

946
00:49:56,088 --> 00:50:00,199
again we're gonna kind of play around

947
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:04,309
with that a little bit later on but for

948
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:07,059
the moment I just kind of want to do

949
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:07,059
this manually

950
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,520
yeah we're gonna have some problems with

951
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:23,479
this but I just want to do it manually

952
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:26,838
for now so that room goes from negative

953
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:29,420
4 to 5 maybe well maybe 4 to 4

954
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:32,559
let's just do that and that's where the

955
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:37,369
rooms gonna be for now and we'll

956
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:41,259
consider that placed and we'll push it's

957
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:41,260
connected rooms on and that'll be bad

958
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:12,599
so that's all folks that's not what I

959
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:18,119
wanted so that's all fine and and dandy

960
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:22,849
and I think that should give us the

961
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,849
ability to start debugging the code now

962
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:33,450
so let's go ahead and step in what I

963
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:41,250
want to do is start debugging at the

964
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:46,078
place where we do the layout and I'm

965
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:48,568
sorry that that oh you know why we're

966
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,809
compiling in release mode which I don't

967
00:51:48,568 --> 00:51:50,808
wanna do

968
00:51:59,268 --> 00:52:08,308
so let's go through here and let's take

969
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:12,059
a look at our stack you know I just

970
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:14,419
thought of two before we start I want to

971
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:19,109
do something even more ridiculous

972
00:52:14,418 --> 00:52:22,889
actually now I think about it when we

973
00:52:19,108 --> 00:52:24,179
talk about the rooms here what we're

974
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,618
doing this is gonna be real pain in the

975
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:28,588
butt because we have no idea what we're

976
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:40,739
looking at right and so what I might do

977
00:52:28,588 --> 00:52:46,078
here is something like this I'm just

978
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:51,329
gonna stick a debug label in there you

979
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:53,729
know and then when we do our actual room

980
00:52:51,329 --> 00:52:59,939
creation so you know when we're down

981
00:52:53,728 --> 00:53:03,629
here in the Jen room sort of phase of

982
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:07,489
things I'm just gonna pass what the what

983
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:07,489
the room was right

984
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:35,260
and you know we can be as descriptive as

985
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:38,519
we want here because these things don't

986
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,520
get

987
00:53:40,530 --> 00:54:01,510
maybe I'll go caps and this way because

988
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:03,730
the first thing we're gonna do is we're

989
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:06,310
gonna see a stack of stuff I want to see

990
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:08,320
what they are right what's in that stack

991
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:16,449
and we're gonna have no idea there's

992
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:17,650
gonna be a bunch of bundles of volumes

993
00:54:16,449 --> 00:54:18,039
and we're gonna have no idea what they

994
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,840
are

995
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:22,690
this way I'll actually be able to see

996
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:25,870
what they are so then what I can do is

997
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:28,960
go up to the general function and I'll

998
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:32,079
just define the general function to

999
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:35,050
actually be a macro and so that way what

1000
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:37,529
I can do is say well in there's actually

1001
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:40,530
going to be two versions of this thing

1002
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:40,530
and

1003
00:54:47,068 --> 00:54:57,400
when you call Jen room either you are

1004
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:59,288
gonna call the version that has the Jen

1005
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,630
the spot and I guess this will be the

1006
00:54:59,289 --> 00:55:15,970
internal version spec and the name and

1007
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:17,588
the label I should say or you're going

1008
00:55:15,969 --> 00:55:26,288
to call the version that doesn't have

1009
00:55:17,588 --> 00:55:28,119
that and that way it'll just get

1010
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,349
stripped off so when we're not compiling

1011
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:33,099
the internal version it'll just go away

1012
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:35,380
and that'll be the end of it right no

1013
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:36,999
big deal so then all we need to do is in

1014
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:40,079
the case where we did actually have one

1015
00:55:36,998 --> 00:55:40,078
let's assign it

1016
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,769
and who knows maybe we'll decide this

1017
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:51,088
isn't a debug label and eventually we'll

1018
00:55:49,769 --> 00:55:53,639
just print the name of the room like

1019
00:55:51,088 --> 00:55:54,869
maybe that comes up in the game and then

1020
00:55:53,639 --> 00:56:06,838
I'll just get rid of that and we'll

1021
00:55:54,869 --> 00:56:10,970
always have that good do oops okay

1022
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:10,969
so now we can be a little bit more

1023
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:16,650
introspective here so the side alley is

1024
00:56:15,568 --> 00:56:19,500
the thing that's getting placed first

1025
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:23,130
and then if you look at the spec I'm in

1026
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:26,940
stack what we should see is justice you

1027
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:28,140
know we we can predict what we want to

1028
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,460
see on the stack if the code is working

1029
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:31,828
properly

1030
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:34,470
the orphanage specifically says that the

1031
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:38,280
side alley right is connected to the

1032
00:56:34,469 --> 00:56:39,509
forest entrance and the backdoor path so

1033
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,579
the two things that should have been

1034
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:43,589
passed there are two things that should

1035
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:49,740
have been pushed on the stack those two

1036
00:56:43,588 --> 00:56:51,750
rooms Hey look we have nothing on our

1037
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:53,788
stack so obviously we have a bug

1038
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:56,010
so first place things first we can go

1039
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:59,160
ahead and go here and take a look at

1040
00:56:56,010 --> 00:57:00,960
what happened if we look at the first

1041
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:02,548
room here and we look at the connections

1042
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,730
you can actually see that there are

1043
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:09,949
connections so it does seem like the bug

1044
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:09,949
is just in push connected rooms right

1045
00:57:21,949 --> 00:57:33,139
oh well that's the problem we're looking

1046
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:34,609
at the wrong so as you can see here

1047
00:57:33,139 --> 00:57:38,058
we're pushing the other room but for

1048
00:57:34,608 --> 00:57:41,568
some reason testing this one well

1049
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:43,849
obviously this one has it set duh like

1050
00:57:41,568 --> 00:57:46,130
we're working on this one right now so

1051
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:47,920
that's a pretty simple book maybe that

1052
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:52,068
was the only book we'll see in a second

1053
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:53,510
so let's do this the stock top now here

1054
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:55,279
are the two things that are on the stack

1055
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:58,010
Orphanage backdoor path at orphanage

1056
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:01,579
forest entrance that's what we wanted

1057
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:04,549
well had it up here before let's get it

1058
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:05,809
back that's what we wanted right back to

1059
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:07,780
our paths and Forests entrance that's

1060
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:11,720
the two things clicked to the side alley

1061
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:14,930
so that's exactly what we want and let's

1062
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:17,539
go ahead and see what happens next so we

1063
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:22,578
grab a room off the stack and it turns

1064
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:24,338
out the room that we get should be one

1065
00:58:22,579 --> 00:58:26,720
of those right our furnish backdoor path

1066
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:28,099
so now what we need to do is push all

1067
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:32,298
the connected rooms onto the stack that

1068
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:34,039
are from that room right and so let's go

1069
00:58:32,298 --> 00:58:35,539
ahead and do that again we can look at

1070
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:40,460
the stack and see what's on there

1071
00:58:35,539 --> 00:58:43,308
if we look at the top prove I've got two

1072
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:46,099
rooms and so what we have here is we

1073
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:48,410
have the forest entrance and the

1074
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:49,099
orphanage main room as well that's

1075
00:58:48,409 --> 00:58:50,929
exactly right

1076
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:52,880
the orphanage forest entrance is

1077
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:55,818
connected to both the side alley and

1078
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:59,329
lure fridge main room again walking just

1079
00:58:55,818 --> 00:59:01,909
right let's go ahead and grab our mid

1080
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:03,740
max vols here so our minimum volume and

1081
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:07,608
our maximum volume start out they should

1082
00:59:03,739 --> 00:59:09,439
have the entire universe enclosed in

1083
00:59:07,608 --> 00:59:13,818
them and you can see that they do write

1084
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:16,068
negative maximum to positive maximum all

1085
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:18,048
well and good so now we need to figure

1086
00:59:16,068 --> 00:59:19,789
out whether we can place this room this

1087
00:59:18,048 --> 00:59:22,548
should succeed if we have no bugs

1088
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:25,400
because there's only one constraint on

1089
00:59:22,548 --> 00:59:27,048
where we place this room so it should

1090
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,980
work right now probably won't cuz you

1091
00:59:27,048 --> 00:59:32,809
probably do have a book but point being

1092
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:34,400
this one should work eventually we'll

1093
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:35,750
get to a placement that should fail

1094
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,940
because our

1095
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:41,059
current code is not good enough to

1096
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:42,470
handle loops and stuff like that and

1097
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:44,989
there's all other kinds of bugs it has

1098
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:48,129
it's not checking for overlap so our

1099
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:50,719
current code is not good enough at all

1100
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:52,820
to do the right layout but for this

1101
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:57,259
particular part of the layout it should

1102
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:59,119
work so here we go

1103
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,380
we step down into the place room

1104
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,990
function and we're talking about

1105
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:05,390
connections that this room has to have

1106
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:07,009
right so we start with the first

1107
01:00:05,389 --> 01:00:11,719
connection that it has to have and again

1108
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:12,920
thanks to that handy little debug label

1109
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:14,719
like I said this becomes a lot easier

1110
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,760
conceptually for us because we can kind

1111
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,118
of tell what we're talking about here if

1112
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,619
you look at the connections we can see

1113
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:23,690
what's connected to what or what's

1114
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:24,858
supposed to be connected to what by

1115
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:26,720
looking and seeing that we're talking

1116
01:00:24,858 --> 01:00:29,059
about a connection from the back door to

1117
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:31,848
the side alley right and we're trying to

1118
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:33,858
place the backdoor path so we're

1119
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:35,599
basically saying well let's look at

1120
01:00:33,858 --> 01:00:38,150
where the side alley is which i think

1121
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:40,280
was the first thing we placed right so

1122
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:41,630
we can see that that already got place

1123
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:44,540
because it's got a generation index of

1124
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:46,940
one and so we're talking about these two

1125
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:49,820
getting placed now this one that we're

1126
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:52,159
on right now getting placed so we look

1127
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,588
at these two we should see again that

1128
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:56,449
that should be the side alley and it is

1129
01:00:54,588 --> 01:00:59,210
so we're talking about the side alley

1130
01:00:56,449 --> 01:01:00,649
and again the backdoor path right and

1131
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:02,679
then we go through and we're now gonna

1132
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:05,780
try placing it on one of the sides so

1133
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:07,608
the first thing we do is say well if we

1134
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:10,519
were going to use the x-axis negative

1135
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:13,429
right and against that West you know if

1136
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:16,369
we were gonna place it west could we go

1137
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:17,779
west so let's go in there and see so we

1138
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:21,530
look at what the direction mask from a

1139
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:23,240
is the direction max from a is 15 that

1140
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:26,869
is what we'd expect right because all

1141
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:29,539
bottom bits are set east west north and

1142
01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:33,230
south all set so that's going to be

1143
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:36,440
everything up to the 16th bit set or the

1144
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:39,769
16 bit set right not the 16th bit 5th

1145
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:42,289
bit so all bottom 4 is set which is 15

1146
01:01:39,769 --> 01:01:46,730
it's what we expect so now we say look

1147
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:48,409
which one of these are we right it turns

1148
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:49,190
out that we are actually the B

1149
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:51,379
connection so we

1150
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:53,088
to flip it so we need to do that

1151
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:55,280
compliment so let's see if that code

1152
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:57,019
works right we've got a bit mascara you

1153
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:01,040
can see that bit mask is set to 21

1154
01:01:57,019 --> 01:02:04,190
because it's every other we mask out the

1155
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:06,259
the two halves of this right so we get

1156
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:09,019
the five and the ten sweat it up right

1157
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:10,910
and then we flip it around and as you

1158
01:02:09,019 --> 01:02:14,300
can see we get the exact same result

1159
01:02:10,909 --> 01:02:15,889
that's what we wanted because if you

1160
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,780
have north and south set and east and

1161
01:02:15,889 --> 01:02:19,219
west set but not up and down set then

1162
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:20,450
the complement of that should still be

1163
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:22,789
north south east west

1164
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:25,669
because again you can be any of those

1165
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:28,190
right so there we go

1166
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:30,139
now we want to look and see okay for

1167
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:32,450
this dimension inside which index is

1168
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:37,309
that well that's index 0 exactly right

1169
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:39,889
is that allowed in here right oh we have

1170
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:41,929
a bug could be found a book that's wrong

1171
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:46,250
this is the surface index not the

1172
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:47,809
surface mask now that was pretty obvious

1173
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:49,280
and pretty obviously a bug because this

1174
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:51,710
says get service index not good source

1175
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,599
mask to avoid that problem in the future

1176
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:55,579
or to make it easier for us to be more

1177
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:59,960
likely to do the right thing let's also

1178
01:02:55,579 --> 01:03:02,119
make a get surface mask right and that

1179
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:04,970
way we can call either of those two

1180
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:07,900
things and I feel like that would make

1181
01:03:04,969 --> 01:03:07,899
it a little easier

1182
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,889
[Music]

1183
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:24,779
and that's just again really really

1184
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:28,260
really really straightforward there's

1185
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:32,100
nothing interesting about it all we're

1186
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:38,760
gonna do is say that we take whatever

1187
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:46,259
the surface index is and make a mask out

1188
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:47,610
of it right okay let's jump right back

1189
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,500
in there as the first time you ever call

1190
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,940
that function so let's jump right back

1191
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,130
in there and make sure we do it right

1192
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:55,980
test mask is 1 now that's what it should

1193
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:57,720
have been not zero result is one which

1194
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,789
is true we can go that direction so

1195
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:02,730
that's good so then what we're gonna do

1196
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:06,480
is say all right let's make a new volume

1197
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:08,250
here and let's clip it so this is where

1198
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,929
we're going to place the new room we

1199
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:11,940
tested whether we could go in the

1200
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:14,719
negative direction from other room this

1201
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:19,500
means we need this to be placed to the

1202
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:25,559
west right so let's take a look we've

1203
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:28,230
got new min vol new max wall this is

1204
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:32,039
where the minimum can be placed so let's

1205
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:35,099
go ahead and see where that clips to and

1206
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:36,869
this basically says that the maximum for

1207
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:39,869
our volume can be placed at for the

1208
01:04:36,869 --> 01:04:44,599
minimum for our volume can be placed no

1209
01:04:39,869 --> 01:04:44,599
further than four now

1210
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:55,150
I feel like we got the sense backwards

1211
01:04:53,528 --> 01:04:59,199
so the thing that I was afraid of I

1212
01:04:55,150 --> 01:05:01,450
think is true right that's that's not

1213
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:04,028
correct these should be the other way

1214
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:08,768
around the reason I say that is because

1215
01:05:04,028 --> 01:05:13,568
this should be placed to the west this

1216
01:05:08,768 --> 01:05:15,778
placed it to the east you know I'm

1217
01:05:13,568 --> 01:05:15,778
saying

1218
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:28,858
so we've got the sense of that flipped

1219
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:43,240
so if we come in here and we're placing

1220
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:47,048
it in the positive direction we're

1221
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:49,269
setting the max2 clip downward so and

1222
01:05:47,048 --> 01:05:53,288
that's wrong so this is this should be

1223
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:59,369
the other way is what was messed up

1224
01:05:53,289 --> 01:05:59,369
about that right oops

1225
01:06:12,179 --> 01:06:17,068
and perhaps if we wanted to be more

1226
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:21,889
specific about it we could also use the

1227
01:06:17,068 --> 01:06:21,889
minimum room dimension in that direction

1228
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:43,760
so this is our max we also have a min we

1229
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:46,019
could actually pre constrain it well

1230
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,369
I'll just leave it like this for now but

1231
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:51,318
we may want to just pre constrain that

1232
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:54,059
part as well all right let's keep going

1233
01:06:51,318 --> 01:06:56,190
all right so we it could go direction

1234
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:59,970
now we're gonna clip it and we should

1235
01:06:56,190 --> 01:07:02,429
clip it properly this time I believe and

1236
01:06:59,969 --> 01:07:06,358
here you can see yeah this is right so

1237
01:07:02,429 --> 01:07:08,159
now we're saying the maximum right that

1238
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:10,588
the both the minimum and the maximum

1239
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:12,538
could have been would be at negative for

1240
01:07:10,588 --> 01:07:16,469
now right it can't go any further than

1241
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:20,839
that if that makes sense so I think

1242
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:25,500
that's that's what should have happened

1243
01:07:20,838 --> 01:07:28,818
let's keep going so if I look at how its

1244
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:31,650
flipping the other dims here's the

1245
01:07:28,818 --> 01:07:34,949
y-axis so now what we should see is it

1246
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:38,700
has to be overlapping that room somehow

1247
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:42,028
right so what we should see now is the

1248
01:07:38,699 --> 01:07:46,739
Y's should be set up so that between

1249
01:07:42,028 --> 01:07:50,630
negative 4 &amp; 4 you're gonna get those

1250
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:50,629
for your other dimensions right

1251
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:06,700
so that why max can't go any higher than

1252
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:08,230
three for the minimum of the room and

1253
01:08:06,699 --> 01:08:09,399
that's correct because if it went any

1254
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:14,260
further you wouldn't be able make a door

1255
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:18,310
and for the maximum volume you can't go

1256
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:21,520
any lower than negative three because

1257
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:24,160
then you wouldn't include negative four

1258
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:38,850
so you couldn't make a door I think

1259
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:38,849
that's right so that all seems saying

1260
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:58,149
what I will say is I think that I

1261
01:08:50,890 --> 01:09:08,740
probably want the starting room to just

1262
01:08:58,149 --> 01:09:11,199
be one high though oops not quite want

1263
01:09:08,739 --> 01:09:15,269
to get there yet I was trying to step

1264
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:19,059
through this code okay

1265
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:22,660
so after we've done one clip and we've

1266
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:24,910
got it in here right then what we want

1267
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:28,689
to do is get the maximum volume we could

1268
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:32,680
fit in here and so what that's going to

1269
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:36,339
be is is massive right it's it's

1270
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:40,470
something that could be really large

1271
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:51,100
really huge right if we wanted it to be

1272
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:53,310
and okay so is minimum dimensions for a

1273
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,310
room

1274
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:10,869
so this is a case where we're gonna have

1275
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:13,000
overflow right our problem here is that

1276
01:10:10,869 --> 01:10:18,719
this subtraction is going to produce a

1277
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:26,859
signed result which is bad for us

1278
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:29,670
because we need to have another way to

1279
01:10:26,859 --> 01:10:29,670
do this

1280
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:48,238
so what we want to see is if these are

1281
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:50,520
greater than four away from each other

1282
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:53,729
and the problem that we're having here

1283
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:56,850
is when you subtract the max from the

1284
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:58,349
men that number may be higher than is

1285
01:10:56,850 --> 01:11:03,000
representative all in a nest thirty-two

1286
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:07,230
right so there's a couple ways we can do

1287
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,930
that you know one way is just

1288
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:13,319
restricting the range to be smaller than

1289
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:16,199
that so what we could do you know the

1290
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:17,909
trivial way of avoiding the overflow is

1291
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:21,619
to just say that our infinity volume

1292
01:11:17,909 --> 01:11:26,670
isn't such an infinity after all right

1293
01:11:21,619 --> 01:11:29,099
and then we would be fine I think if

1294
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:30,899
that makes sense so when we now go

1295
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,130
through is minimum dimensions we should

1296
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:33,839
be able make it work although the fact

1297
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:42,750
that it's not maybe that code is buggy

1298
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:45,350
in some other way let me actually also

1299
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,350
do this

1300
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:01,319
so

1301
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:19,179
if I compute these dimensions first then

1302
01:12:12,948 --> 01:12:19,178
we can inspect them pretty easily and I

1303
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:29,380
should be able to see what's what so

1304
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:40,829
so that is actually backward so okay

1305
01:12:47,639 --> 01:13:00,800
so no overflow problem there that is

1306
01:12:55,649 --> 01:13:03,179
actually just busted so that's okay

1307
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,210
let's go ahead and see what's up with

1308
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:05,210
that

1309
01:13:09,609 --> 01:13:14,319
so if we look at our min volume

1310
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:39,849
yeah our max our max X can only go up to

1311
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:41,739
negative 4 for some reason so it looks

1312
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:44,640
like maybe we've got a bug in that

1313
01:13:41,739 --> 01:13:44,639
clipping routine

1314
01:13:55,689 --> 01:13:59,069
yeah let's take a look at that

1315
01:14:04,409 --> 01:14:12,389
so here's my Neumann volume that was not

1316
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:14,519
causing the problem yet here's my new

1317
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:21,690
max volume this was causing the problem

1318
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:25,350
right so what I'm saying here is if the

1319
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:31,729
maximum value that the maximum could

1320
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:35,100
have taken was greater than the minimum

1321
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:39,349
that this room is then I need to back it

1322
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,350
up to there right

1323
01:14:45,109 --> 01:14:54,689
so I guess I see what the problem is the

1324
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:56,039
problem is that the minimum volume well

1325
01:14:54,689 --> 01:14:58,729
no I I guess I don't see what the

1326
01:14:56,039 --> 01:14:58,729
problem is there

1327
01:15:04,599 --> 01:15:09,969
so that's still right so what I'm I'm

1328
01:15:08,078 --> 01:15:11,500
just getting confused because there are

1329
01:15:09,969 --> 01:15:13,420
so many values here it's hard to think

1330
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:15,698
all through that's still correct

1331
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:17,289
you can't the maximum value can't go

1332
01:15:15,698 --> 01:15:19,299
higher than that and the same would be

1333
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:28,649
true of the men right they're both going

1334
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:32,860
to be clipped there so that seems fine

1335
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:35,589
so when I get down here yeah having the

1336
01:15:32,859 --> 01:15:38,979
max the minimum volumes maximum is

1337
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:43,929
negative 4 and it's minimum so that's

1338
01:15:38,979 --> 01:15:50,759
the actual value that's wrong is the

1339
01:15:43,929 --> 01:15:50,760
mins are now non-negative

1340
01:15:56,029 --> 01:15:58,719
right

1341
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:12,869
so that's the problem is that divide is

1342
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:12,868
too sloppy

1343
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:31,060
right so the minimum value divided by

1344
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:42,670
four is not able to actually do the

1345
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:48,550
divided by four is it actually because

1346
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:50,289
of that I don't want to say why cuz I'm

1347
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:54,060
not sure why so let me just make sure

1348
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:54,060
this is just C doing its thing

1349
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:10,490
yeah so what was happening there and

1350
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:13,880
maybe so what we should do I guess to

1351
01:17:10,489 --> 01:17:18,460
maybe prevent that from happening in the

1352
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:22,220
future is just when we define those

1353
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:25,760
maybe we have to force them to be the

1354
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:27,289
values that they are the types that they

1355
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:31,699
are because what it was doing is it was

1356
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:33,199
converting that value to unsigned

1357
01:17:31,699 --> 01:17:38,809
integer and dividing it instead of

1358
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:41,510
leaving it signed through C's magic fun

1359
01:17:38,810 --> 01:17:44,840
internal promotion rules I'm sure so now

1360
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:47,659
that should be correct right

1361
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:52,550
and we still have a breakpoint set there

1362
01:17:47,659 --> 01:17:54,439
I hope let's see yes we do so now when

1363
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:57,680
we do is minimum dimensions it should

1364
01:17:54,439 --> 01:18:01,069
work and it did so now we can go in here

1365
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:03,800
and call place room on the next

1366
01:18:01,069 --> 01:18:10,279
connection I don't know if there was an

1367
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:13,880
X connection was there there was but it

1368
01:18:10,279 --> 01:18:17,119
doesn't have the generation set so we

1369
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:20,000
don't have to consider it oh but we

1370
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:22,369
don't keep chaining so we're gonna need

1371
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,729
one more thing here right we're gonna

1372
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:33,649
need a thing which continues to change

1373
01:18:25,729 --> 01:18:35,829
the room chain the room so here when we

1374
01:18:33,649 --> 01:18:39,529
went through and we said if room con

1375
01:18:35,829 --> 01:18:42,649
else right but what we actually need to

1376
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:46,130
also do is we need to continue placing

1377
01:18:42,649 --> 01:18:49,969
the room in the case where the

1378
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:52,550
generation index doesn't happen right so

1379
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:56,810
if we're skipping this connection we

1380
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:59,029
need to keep going so now I think about

1381
01:18:56,810 --> 01:19:01,820
it probably this is just a dumb way to

1382
01:18:59,029 --> 01:19:03,979
do this we could just speed this up a

1383
01:19:01,819 --> 01:19:07,899
bit by just assuming that that's always

1384
01:19:03,979 --> 01:19:11,769
the case and spinning on the room con

1385
01:19:07,899 --> 01:19:11,769
afterward right

1386
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,630
something like this

1387
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:34,329
so basically say look let's just walk

1388
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:47,900
let's just walk this thing until we find

1389
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:49,490
one you know I'm saying so we'll come in

1390
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:51,769
if we have a rim con

1391
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:53,750
we'll grab out what the other room is

1392
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:58,780
from that connection

1393
01:19:53,750 --> 01:20:01,829
if the generation index matches ours

1394
01:19:58,779 --> 01:20:01,829
[Music]

1395
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:10,340
then we can process it otherwise we keep

1396
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:12,609
going right I think that's all we need

1397
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:12,610
to do

1398
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:34,510
okay so this is correct because the

1399
01:20:32,979 --> 01:20:36,519
first room connection is one we can

1400
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:44,890
actually process so we go through we do

1401
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:47,710
our clipping as we wanted to and then we

1402
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:50,260
continue down recursively in this case

1403
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:53,170
we know that this other room hasn't been

1404
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:54,969
placed yet so we skip it and then the

1405
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:57,000
room con is null so and then we can come

1406
01:20:54,969 --> 01:20:59,710
down here and actually place our room

1407
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,529
which is what we want so we have a min

1408
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:07,679
and a max here that we create we know

1409
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:11,429
that they're going to be very oddly

1410
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:11,429
placed rooms here

1411
01:21:11,969 --> 01:21:19,170
yeah because that first one is it should

1412
01:21:15,158 --> 01:21:19,170
violate where we placed it

1413
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:38,619
oh this still seems wrong you take a

1414
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:43,600
look at min ball max ball so here's the

1415
01:21:38,619 --> 01:21:47,890
min ball and the min Vall says it can be

1416
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:53,230
anywhere from here to here right here's

1417
01:21:47,890 --> 01:22:00,420
the maximum volume and that's just that

1418
01:21:53,229 --> 01:22:00,419
doesn't make any sense does it

1419
01:22:08,408 --> 01:22:18,309
yeah so there's one additional element

1420
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:21,100
of the clipping here yeah yeah yeah when

1421
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:23,530
we say that this thing has to abut the

1422
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:25,510
other room we're not saying that the

1423
01:22:23,529 --> 01:22:27,460
maximum can any be anything less than it

1424
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:30,969
we're saying that the maximum has to be

1425
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:32,560
exactly that right so effectively what

1426
01:22:30,969 --> 01:22:34,000
we're saying here that's that was just

1427
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:37,780
nonsense what we just said right there

1428
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,229
right that that wasn't not correct what

1429
01:22:37,779 --> 01:22:43,509
we're actually saying is okay if you're

1430
01:22:41,229 --> 01:22:47,500
connecting on the positive side right

1431
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:56,949
then the minimum must line up with this

1432
01:22:47,500 --> 01:23:03,158
right so we have to be able to move the

1433
01:22:56,948 --> 01:23:05,829
minimum here right otherwise it wouldn't

1434
01:23:03,158 --> 01:23:09,789
be able to connect now this means we

1435
01:23:05,829 --> 01:23:17,439
could fail and that's one thing that we

1436
01:23:09,789 --> 01:23:19,420
weren't really accepting here but yeah

1437
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,399
so basically what we need to do here is

1438
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:24,190
say all right

1439
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:26,259
the maximum can still do whatever it

1440
01:23:24,189 --> 01:23:27,939
wants it can be as far out as it wants

1441
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:31,420
but it would have to be at least this

1442
01:23:27,939 --> 01:23:33,549
far so that's still fine the minimum

1443
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:35,469
volume on the other hand has to be

1444
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:37,270
exactly here and if I can't move it

1445
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:40,139
exactly here then we have a problem

1446
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:40,139
right

1447
01:23:40,539 --> 01:23:43,560
so if

1448
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:07,080
No so I think this time so that's all we

1449
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:12,510
have to say so if the minimum could not

1450
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:15,180
have been placed exactly here then we

1451
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:22,340
have an issue so we need to basically

1452
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:26,460
say if the minimum value is greater than

1453
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:30,079
the place that we needed to put it right

1454
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:37,710
if it can't if it already can't be there

1455
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:49,039
then we have a bug otherwise the minimum

1456
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:52,140
has to be there does that make sense

1457
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:54,810
we're basically saying this thing has to

1458
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:58,400
be placed literally exactly here there's

1459
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:58,400
nowhere else it can go

1460
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:14,490
and I think that's what we actually want

1461
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:18,689
and so if for some reason you weren't

1462
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:21,439
able to do that so if the if the minimum

1463
01:25:18,689 --> 01:25:24,449
value that we would have accepted before

1464
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:26,609
for where it was going to go doesn't

1465
01:25:24,449 --> 01:25:28,380
allow us to actually get here in the

1466
01:25:26,609 --> 01:25:39,750
first place it's already further that

1467
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:40,920
way then we're we're toast and I guess

1468
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:44,670
we don't really have to do anything

1469
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:48,420
about that now that I think about it

1470
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:50,600
that we can just do like Newman Vall you

1471
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,600
know

1472
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:15,550
or something like this so we can't just

1473
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:21,700
say like clear it out like it's it's

1474
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:24,250
over at that point the same would be

1475
01:26:21,699 --> 01:26:27,189
true on the other end so when we needed

1476
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:29,859
to connect the other way round we need

1477
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:33,909
to do the same thing so we need to say

1478
01:26:29,859 --> 01:26:43,000
something like well okay if I'm going to

1479
01:26:33,909 --> 01:26:47,069
compare the mins here I just need to

1480
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,069
make sure that the min can't be any

1481
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:51,369
worse than this but the same thing that

1482
01:26:49,869 --> 01:26:54,130
happened to the men up here has to

1483
01:26:51,369 --> 01:26:58,180
happen to the max which is to say that I

1484
01:26:54,130 --> 01:27:01,319
actually need to be able to set it to be

1485
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:01,320
exactly this value

1486
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:17,130
so whatever the minimum value was on the

1487
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:21,090
other room that has to be the maximum

1488
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:25,619
value on this room now it can't be

1489
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:27,869
anything other than that so I think

1490
01:27:25,619 --> 01:27:30,050
that's right and then again if for some

1491
01:27:27,869 --> 01:27:33,180
reason we can't do that we have to

1492
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:35,840
invalidate this volume and so it won't

1493
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:39,390
actually work later and it does anything

1494
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:41,699
the new max the test here is going to be

1495
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:49,820
similar to the test here which is to say

1496
01:27:41,699 --> 01:27:53,970
that if the maximum value was already

1497
01:27:49,819 --> 01:27:57,960
lower than this right meaning it could

1498
01:27:53,970 --> 01:28:00,119
not have been placed here then we're

1499
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:02,670
done there's nothing we can do about it

1500
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:07,250
right because we can't move it out to

1501
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:07,250
here at that point

1502
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:15,180
right

1503
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:23,679
so I think that's right and then we just

1504
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:50,789
need a way to basically make one of

1505
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:50,789
these and I think I can just do

1506
01:29:26,359 --> 01:29:32,309
all right so now we should be able to

1507
01:29:30,689 --> 01:29:37,710
step back through that and I have it

1508
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:39,810
work more like what I want it to do as

1509
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:43,260
opposed to what I wrote before which was

1510
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:48,239
not what I wanted to do let's just take

1511
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:52,050
a quick gander here what we actually end

1512
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:59,868
up with now that we're here so if we

1513
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:59,869
take a look at the minimum placement

1514
01:30:00,109 --> 01:30:06,149
here's the the minimum for everything we

1515
01:30:03,149 --> 01:30:08,219
take a look at the max placement and you

1516
01:30:06,149 --> 01:30:11,309
can see the difference now the max has

1517
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:17,698
to be basically exactly here right it

1518
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:18,690
can't be placed anywhere else so let's

1519
01:30:17,698 --> 01:30:20,899
see what we get for each of these

1520
01:30:18,689 --> 01:30:20,899
dimensions

1521
01:30:29,229 --> 01:30:35,019
and that looks about right again we have

1522
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:38,020
we're not doing anything special here to

1523
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:39,400
try and keep ourselves from creating

1524
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:41,469
large rooms it's just going to create

1525
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:43,238
the largest room it can in the space

1526
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:45,600
which is not good I mean it's not what

1527
01:30:43,238 --> 01:30:45,599
we want

1528
01:30:55,989 --> 01:31:05,899
although it looks like it still wasn't

1529
01:31:03,229 --> 01:31:07,039
quite able to place it let's try that

1530
01:31:05,899 --> 01:31:14,779
one more time well I see when that

1531
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:17,560
happened result is true so if this must

1532
01:31:14,779 --> 01:31:17,559
be this one no

1533
01:31:24,199 --> 01:31:34,059
so the mean is zero and the men volume

1534
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:34,060
max is zero

1535
01:31:53,600 --> 01:32:02,810
so I think we just have an off by one

1536
01:31:56,699 --> 01:32:02,809
error in that clip on the interior then

1537
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:08,480
it's actually probably just because of

1538
01:32:05,399 --> 01:32:08,479
how we're dealing with Z

1539
01:32:15,109 --> 01:32:29,819
because the maxi should be won and in

1540
01:32:23,099 --> 01:32:32,159
fact the Minzy and maxi should have to

1541
01:32:29,819 --> 01:32:39,089
be one there in order for them to line

1542
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:44,779
up right so those look actually a little

1543
01:32:39,088 --> 01:32:50,958
bit backwards to me take a look at that

1544
01:32:44,779 --> 01:32:50,958
so that's this code here so

1545
01:33:00,698 --> 01:33:05,678
so you can see it's setting the maximum

1546
01:33:02,859 --> 01:33:10,238
right it's saying if the maximum value

1547
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:13,960
is greater than whatever the apron value

1548
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:16,139
is there right then it has to be equal

1549
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,140
to

1550
01:33:39,838 --> 01:33:43,439
so I would have thought that this would

1551
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:45,569
have taken care of it if the max was

1552
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:51,659
less than or equal to the minimum of it

1553
01:33:45,569 --> 01:33:53,249
it has to be one over that I want to

1554
01:33:51,658 --> 01:33:55,458
step in here and see what these come out

1555
01:33:53,248 --> 01:33:55,458
to be

1556
01:34:02,819 --> 01:34:06,090
yeah but that looks like the only thing

1557
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:11,100
that's misbehaving so I'm gonna go ahead

1558
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:13,470
and get in there I'm gonna skip the Y

1559
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:19,410
for now I'm just gonna look at the Z

1560
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:21,539
value so here we're now on Z and when I

1561
01:34:19,409 --> 01:34:24,329
come through here I want to look at what

1562
01:34:21,539 --> 01:34:28,350
is gonna happen to these values so you

1563
01:34:24,329 --> 01:34:30,420
can see we've got the min Z and Max Z

1564
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:32,130
that these could be are totally wide

1565
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:36,619
open right there's no there's been no

1566
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:38,670
actual clipping of them whatsoever and

1567
01:34:36,619 --> 01:34:42,599
you know I'll be honest I don't know why

1568
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:45,029
this part hasn't happened yet

1569
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:47,390
oh whoops because I'm looking at the

1570
01:34:45,029 --> 01:34:47,389
wrong ones

1571
01:34:58,288 --> 01:35:07,139
so the Z values are not have been not

1572
01:35:03,069 --> 01:35:11,500
been changed at all as you can see now

1573
01:35:07,139 --> 01:35:12,519
how the X values and the y values 15o

1574
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,538
because we were already on that we've

1575
01:35:12,519 --> 01:35:15,340
already looped through that so we're

1576
01:35:13,538 --> 01:35:17,198
good so that's all good I think that's

1577
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:20,260
what we would expect so we've got

1578
01:35:17,198 --> 01:35:23,738
Menzies and Maxie's that are full range

1579
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:27,159
on both right now so as we step through

1580
01:35:23,738 --> 01:35:30,009
here and we do our clipping what we

1581
01:35:27,158 --> 01:35:33,960
first want to do is say all right then

1582
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:37,510
we're talking about where the minimum

1583
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:40,840
point can be placed and we say if the

1584
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:46,809
maximum Kier is greater than whatever

1585
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:49,000
the maximum of the other room is then we

1586
01:35:46,809 --> 01:35:51,788
would no longer overlap so we need to

1587
01:35:49,000 --> 01:36:01,029
make sure that it's far enough back

1588
01:35:51,788 --> 01:36:03,630
right so that sets the minimum the

1589
01:36:01,029 --> 01:36:08,819
maximum point that the minimum Z can be

1590
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:12,029
at zero that's correct because really

1591
01:36:08,819 --> 01:36:17,198
well no it's not

1592
01:36:12,029 --> 01:36:20,859
so I suppose since in this case we're

1593
01:36:17,198 --> 01:36:24,819
talking about these things as not being

1594
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:28,738
inclusive of their maximum it actually

1595
01:36:24,819 --> 01:36:28,738
still needs to be plus one

1596
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:38,719
right because that's not the maximum

1597
01:36:33,948 --> 01:36:40,729
value that the max could be it's one

1598
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:51,590
more than the maximum value that the max

1599
01:36:40,729 --> 01:36:54,259
could be I hate crap like this discrete

1600
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:57,679
math is the worst unfortunately it's

1601
01:36:54,260 --> 01:37:00,130
only thin computers can do anyway so

1602
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:03,710
when we actually do that clipping right

1603
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:06,289
if we want to be consistent here then

1604
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:08,239
the maximum always have to be one more

1605
01:37:06,289 --> 01:37:16,670
than what they would would otherwise be

1606
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:20,779
so this is actually still this because

1607
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:23,750
the max has to be placed at wherever

1608
01:37:20,779 --> 01:37:26,779
that location would be but +1 to include

1609
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:29,840
the room and then like I'm gonna put the

1610
01:37:26,779 --> 01:37:38,238
2 min ville updates sort of back to back

1611
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:44,210
here so right to set the minimum value

1612
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:46,539
for where the minimum can be we do move

1613
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:46,539
it back

1614
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:56,840
and that's yes so this is going to have

1615
01:37:54,439 --> 01:38:03,609
to be true in the other case as well so

1616
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:03,610
to set the minimum value value here

1617
01:38:16,509 --> 01:38:24,260
we need the min plus the interior apron

1618
01:38:21,159 --> 01:38:24,260
[Music]

1619
01:38:35,569 --> 01:38:41,340
yeah so we've got both problems here as

1620
01:38:39,479 --> 01:38:43,708
well so what we need to do we need to do

1621
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:46,828
a couple things first of all we need to

1622
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:48,090
make this line up right gap wise but the

1623
01:38:46,828 --> 01:38:49,590
other thing we need to do is we need to

1624
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:53,458
do the same thing we were doing here

1625
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:55,679
which is to say when we actually find

1626
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:57,929
one of these it has to be updated we

1627
01:38:55,679 --> 01:39:05,880
have to also make sure that the update

1628
01:38:57,929 --> 01:39:07,578
is legal right but I guess since we're

1629
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:12,300
only checking for the greater-than

1630
01:39:07,578 --> 01:39:13,920
that's already gonna happen but we need

1631
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:15,719
to cut like this needs to include

1632
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:21,868
failure as well I guess is what I'm

1633
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:27,748
saying so in both of these cases we kind

1634
01:39:21,868 --> 01:39:29,698
of want to be able to set an inverted

1635
01:39:27,748 --> 01:39:32,279
infinity volume in the case where we

1636
01:39:29,698 --> 01:39:40,738
find that we've failed right we don't

1637
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:43,590
ever want to set something in a way that

1638
01:39:40,738 --> 01:39:46,169
makes something legal again that was

1639
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:49,409
illegal previously because we always

1640
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:58,170
need to make sure that there's no way to

1641
01:39:49,408 --> 01:40:00,538
on do a person's constraint so when the

1642
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:02,939
box the boxes are only ever allowed to

1643
01:40:00,538 --> 01:40:05,279
get smaller right we're never allowed to

1644
01:40:02,939 --> 01:40:06,689
like push something out that would make

1645
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:10,198
something bigger than it could have

1646
01:40:06,689 --> 01:40:12,030
otherwise been so I guess anytime you

1647
01:40:10,198 --> 01:40:17,129
see this where you're taking a minimum

1648
01:40:12,029 --> 01:40:18,179
and you're pushing it out it's fine but

1649
01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:23,010
I have to make sure that we're never

1650
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:28,498
doing anything worse than that right so

1651
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:30,780
basically like this needs to always look

1652
01:40:28,498 --> 01:40:33,149
I guess like this so so you know it's

1653
01:40:30,779 --> 01:40:34,438
okay because we're always saying look if

1654
01:40:33,149 --> 01:40:42,179
the minimum was greater we're pushing it

1655
01:40:34,439 --> 01:40:47,820
back that's probably okay but if the

1656
01:40:42,179 --> 01:40:49,260
minimum if the maximum was already on

1657
01:40:47,819 --> 01:40:52,259
the other side of it we need to

1658
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:53,880
fail so I suppose right I mean that this

1659
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:57,180
is alls I'm trying to trying to say here

1660
01:40:53,880 --> 01:41:00,720
like this is we need to fail out here if

1661
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:04,920
we don't overlap I guess if that makes

1662
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:06,329
sense like we need to say oh it's

1663
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:17,720
minus-- greater than that then put it

1664
01:41:06,329 --> 01:41:26,569
here but if the max something like this

1665
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:31,560
if the max already says we can't do this

1666
01:41:26,569 --> 01:41:38,000
then we're also fail right meaning if

1667
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:38,000
the max was let's say setup such that

1668
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:44,039
the min can't possibly end up in this

1669
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:46,829
range then that's a fail that's the part

1670
01:41:44,039 --> 01:41:53,159
that we weren't doing before right so in

1671
01:41:46,829 --> 01:41:55,859
addition to this part we yeah we also

1672
01:41:53,159 --> 01:41:58,380
need to to nuke it in the other case so

1673
01:41:55,859 --> 01:42:04,309
if the maximum place that we would have

1674
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:08,400
put the minimum value before right is

1675
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:12,500
can't reach if it's if it's less than

1676
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:12,500
the place that we needed it to be

1677
01:42:19,699 --> 01:42:37,210
I guess we can call that the min min so

1678
01:42:26,149 --> 01:42:39,439
if the minimum value before this is

1679
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:42,350
mind-bending I hate writing code this

1680
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:44,419
way this is where you just want the

1681
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:46,820
diagram right because the diagram is

1682
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:48,739
perfectly clear but then when you

1683
01:42:46,819 --> 01:42:51,859
actually have to write the code it's so

1684
01:42:48,739 --> 01:42:54,769
the names are so obtuse and there's so

1685
01:42:51,859 --> 01:42:57,559
many of them that you are always getting

1686
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:59,810
some permutation wrong right where

1687
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:03,289
you're thinking like okay wait this is a

1688
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:05,360
test for greater than the minimums

1689
01:43:03,289 --> 01:43:08,090
minimum value you know and it's like

1690
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:10,189
that's just a horrible way to describe

1691
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:12,110
this because not only do you make a ton

1692
01:43:10,189 --> 01:43:14,119
of mistakes when you write it but anyone

1693
01:43:12,109 --> 01:43:16,009
who has to read it will never be able to

1694
01:43:14,119 --> 01:43:18,439
like map it properly whereas if it was

1695
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:20,570
just a diagram you'd be done right it

1696
01:43:18,439 --> 01:43:22,460
just feel like oh that's the things this

1697
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:24,969
has to go there that has to go here

1698
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:27,529
right it's like trivial when you draw it

1699
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:28,850
I'm not even bothering drawing it

1700
01:43:27,529 --> 01:43:31,130
because we all know what it would look

1701
01:43:28,850 --> 01:43:33,020
like when it was drawn but it's trying

1702
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:34,699
to like type in those things that

1703
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:36,320
becomes incredibly difficult and you end

1704
01:43:34,699 --> 01:43:38,000
up like having to alt tab back and forth

1705
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:41,329
your diagram all the time and still

1706
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:50,600
getting it wrong right so just yeah it's

1707
01:43:41,329 --> 01:43:54,350
maddening anyway so this is the location

1708
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:55,760
at the far end of the room and we're

1709
01:43:54,350 --> 01:44:02,950
saying that the minimum the minimum

1710
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:02,949
could be it's got to be less than this

1711
01:44:11,719 --> 01:44:18,529
and so if yes so this is just illegal

1712
01:44:15,738 --> 01:44:21,288
this is just wrong

1713
01:44:18,529 --> 01:44:25,448
I don't think these tests are set up

1714
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:29,328
right I think they're backwards so

1715
01:44:25,448 --> 01:44:35,978
here's what we want to say right we want

1716
01:44:29,328 --> 01:44:40,368
to say to me that if the minimum value

1717
01:44:35,979 --> 01:44:43,489
was passed there already then this is

1718
01:44:40,368 --> 01:44:44,899
just illegal right because if you're

1719
01:44:43,488 --> 01:44:49,069
seeing that the minimum value couldn't

1720
01:44:44,899 --> 01:44:54,529
soak so if this minimum value was

1721
01:44:49,069 --> 01:44:58,578
greater than or equal to what what we're

1722
01:44:54,529 --> 01:45:01,429
talking about here so the max it's got

1723
01:44:58,578 --> 01:45:11,389
to be back one from that and then back

1724
01:45:01,429 --> 01:45:14,840
one again right yeah if the minimum was

1725
01:45:11,389 --> 01:45:17,800
already greater than or equal to or sir

1726
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:23,059
sir if it was greater than that value

1727
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:25,248
then you can't place this thing because

1728
01:45:23,059 --> 01:45:30,969
there you're basically our constraints

1729
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:30,969
say it can't go there right otherwise

1730
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:49,720
we do know now that the minimum minimum

1731
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:51,869
has to still overlap the other bound of

1732
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:54,930
it right

1733
01:45:51,869 --> 01:45:54,930
[Music]

1734
01:46:00,609 --> 01:46:13,719
and that's really all we can say about

1735
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:19,900
the minimum minimum so I think this

1736
01:46:13,719 --> 01:46:22,510
actually looks more like this so the

1737
01:46:19,899 --> 01:46:30,399
other rooms volume it has a minimum and

1738
01:46:22,510 --> 01:46:43,449
a maximum and so we know that our

1739
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:45,549
minimum and minimum minimum value the

1740
01:46:43,448 --> 01:46:50,079
minimum value then it has to fall within

1741
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:55,510
a particular range and that range can be

1742
01:46:50,079 --> 01:47:00,250
anywhere prior to the max which is this

1743
01:46:55,510 --> 01:47:04,230
guy I suppose we don't need this guy

1744
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:04,229
yeah well I'm a second

1745
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:12,579
so if the minimum goes over that value

1746
01:47:10,689 --> 01:47:15,879
then it's illegal if it doesn't go over

1747
01:47:12,579 --> 01:47:17,439
that value well in I mean that's really

1748
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:21,000
it that's the only thing we're checking

1749
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:21,000
that value for right

1750
01:47:43,939 --> 01:47:48,949
yeah so basically we know that the

1751
01:47:46,969 --> 01:47:51,590
minimum value there has to be greater

1752
01:47:48,948 --> 01:47:53,538
than whatever this is I'm sorry can't be

1753
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:55,699
greater than whatever this is if it was

1754
01:47:53,538 --> 01:48:00,498
we would not be able to overlap the room

1755
01:47:55,698 --> 01:48:02,598
and we're done right the next thing we

1756
01:48:00,498 --> 01:48:14,889
want to check is the minimum volumes

1757
01:48:02,599 --> 01:48:18,979
maximum which is this and so the minimum

1758
01:48:14,889 --> 01:48:21,019
in this case I may describe this well

1759
01:48:18,979 --> 01:48:23,449
that's that is exactly what we're

1760
01:48:21,019 --> 01:48:26,539
talking about here so well no it's not

1761
01:48:23,448 --> 01:48:29,328
exactly so the min min here this is

1762
01:48:26,538 --> 01:48:34,719
where that is the maximum value the min

1763
01:48:29,328 --> 01:48:37,069
can be has to be greater than this now

1764
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:40,908
this is just wrong I don't know why we

1765
01:48:37,069 --> 01:48:43,880
wrote this I think that was part of the

1766
01:48:40,908 --> 01:48:45,828
bug right so the minimum minimum value

1767
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:51,979
is just whatever the interior apron is

1768
01:48:45,828 --> 01:48:53,868
here so then whatever the maximum value

1769
01:48:51,979 --> 01:48:57,110
or minimum can take meaning the farthest

1770
01:48:53,868 --> 01:49:06,938
we are allowed to slide our minimum

1771
01:48:57,109 --> 01:49:06,938
right that's right

1772
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:13,199
the furthest that we're allowed to slide

1773
01:49:08,859 --> 01:49:13,199
the minimum now has to be here

1774
01:49:39,559 --> 01:49:46,288
here's a question can't we just do this

1775
01:49:43,319 --> 01:49:48,618
in a simpler way because they look at

1776
01:49:46,288 --> 01:49:51,059
how much time getting spent on their and

1777
01:49:48,618 --> 01:49:53,998
I think it's mostly because I'm hand

1778
01:49:51,059 --> 01:49:58,168
coding the intervals effectively if we

1779
01:49:53,998 --> 01:50:00,809
just did the interval properly I wonder

1780
01:49:58,168 --> 01:50:07,648
if this would just work so if we think

1781
01:50:00,809 --> 01:50:16,050
about what has to happen here so what

1782
01:50:07,649 --> 01:50:17,939
are we saying in the case where we know

1783
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:21,739
we have to clip it to one side of this

1784
01:50:17,939 --> 01:50:25,949
volume right we're saying that that this

1785
01:50:21,738 --> 01:50:30,358
right the the maximum value here we're

1786
01:50:25,948 --> 01:50:32,598
saying that that the this thing has to

1787
01:50:30,359 --> 01:50:32,599
be

1788
01:50:40,029 --> 01:50:44,359
we're saying that this thing has to be

1789
01:50:42,198 --> 01:50:47,359
starting there and it can end anywhere

1790
01:50:44,359 --> 01:50:49,248
on the other side of it right that's why

1791
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:52,219
we have to do this inverted infinity

1792
01:50:49,248 --> 01:50:57,260
volume stuff here is to peg the value to

1793
01:50:52,219 --> 01:50:59,958
a specific location in this case names

1794
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:01,909
trying to think maybe it's okay the way

1795
01:50:59,958 --> 01:51:03,708
we were doing before because since we're

1796
01:51:01,908 --> 01:51:05,958
always updating the values they should

1797
01:51:03,708 --> 01:51:08,929
just cross in the case where they can't

1798
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:12,679
have happened so we shouldn't actually

1799
01:51:08,929 --> 01:51:15,639
have to check it right so let me just

1800
01:51:12,679 --> 01:51:15,639
see if that's the case here

1801
01:51:35,219 --> 01:51:42,659
okay so in this case since we're talking

1802
01:51:40,198 --> 01:51:57,859
about and let's just again move these so

1803
01:51:42,659 --> 01:51:57,859
that they're in the same place here sooo

1804
01:51:57,979 --> 01:52:04,468
if we're looking at these and talking

1805
01:52:01,859 --> 01:52:06,599
about always sliding them if we always

1806
01:52:04,469 --> 01:52:09,930
slide them the other direction we should

1807
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:12,570
be okay I think because in this case

1808
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:14,820
we're only ever clipping - we're not

1809
01:52:12,569 --> 01:52:21,210
having to peg we're just talking about

1810
01:52:14,819 --> 01:52:27,659
the range so we should be okay with that

1811
01:52:21,210 --> 01:52:30,719
right and if we wanted to hear I suppose

1812
01:52:27,659 --> 01:52:34,439
we could even do this the other way

1813
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:36,180
round I mean you just need both checks

1814
01:52:34,439 --> 01:52:38,609
that the problem was we were only doing

1815
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:40,560
one of the checks right but in theory

1816
01:52:38,609 --> 01:52:43,880
you could actually do that so you could

1817
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:49,489
say like this

1818
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:49,489
if the Newman ball

1819
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:09,869
right so if the minimum was less than

1820
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:22,079
this it becomes this right so we're

1821
01:53:09,869 --> 01:53:23,359
moving it forwards and if the new

1822
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:32,510
monville

1823
01:53:23,359 --> 01:53:32,509
max is greater than other room Vall

1824
01:53:37,819 --> 01:53:44,399
right so I think that's more like it

1825
01:53:42,449 --> 01:53:47,489
right the way that I should have been

1826
01:53:44,399 --> 01:53:48,389
writing this was you always just adjust

1827
01:53:47,489 --> 01:53:50,219
the bounds

1828
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:52,140
towards the direction they're only

1829
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:53,699
allowed to move one direction and then

1830
01:53:52,140 --> 01:54:00,360
the bounds just cross each other when

1831
01:53:53,699 --> 01:54:04,609
you get an invalid volume right so I

1832
01:54:00,359 --> 01:54:04,609
think that's I think that's it

1833
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:32,050
again so writing this other one the same

1834
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:35,529
way then we're just saying okay if the

1835
01:54:32,050 --> 01:54:37,570
max is greater than the max slides back

1836
01:54:35,529 --> 01:54:47,679
if the min is less than the middle moves

1837
01:54:37,569 --> 01:54:50,679
forward right and so probably what we

1838
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:53,230
should do is just make these be an

1839
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:54,760
actual routine we can call that would

1840
01:54:53,229 --> 01:54:56,109
clarify this a little bit better and

1841
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:59,079
make it so that it was less verbose

1842
01:54:56,109 --> 01:55:07,210
right where you're updating one of these

1843
01:54:59,079 --> 01:55:09,930
things and you can imagine what that

1844
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:09,930
would look like right

1845
01:55:21,619 --> 01:55:25,729
so this would be what that would look

1846
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:28,159
like meaning clip the minimum to this

1847
01:55:25,729 --> 01:55:45,759
and that that slides it forward if it's

1848
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:45,760
less right here's a way to clip the max

1849
01:55:55,029 --> 01:56:01,969
right and so that seems probably like

1850
01:55:59,479 --> 01:56:04,429
what I want and that way we can just say

1851
01:56:01,969 --> 01:56:08,270
like okay there's the function here it

1852
01:56:04,430 --> 01:56:16,579
looks like this it has volume it takes a

1853
01:56:08,270 --> 01:56:19,510
dimension and it takes a value and then

1854
01:56:16,579 --> 01:56:19,510
it just looks like this

1855
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:48,288
so now we've done a clip min and

1856
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:51,449
equipped max they operate inversely

1857
01:56:48,288 --> 01:56:54,238
comparison - right and what we couldn't

1858
01:56:51,448 --> 01:56:55,978
furthermore do I don't know if we really

1859
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:58,439
want to do this or not but what we could

1860
01:56:55,979 --> 01:57:00,539
do is incorporate the max version into

1861
01:56:58,439 --> 01:57:02,728
this so basically saying that like if

1862
01:57:00,538 --> 01:57:07,309
the max is supposed to clip Q this value

1863
01:57:02,729 --> 01:57:07,309
it actually clips to the next value

1864
01:57:09,229 --> 01:57:13,199
because we know that max whispy includes

1865
01:57:11,429 --> 01:57:16,340
this way if you clip the min and the max

1866
01:57:13,198 --> 01:57:20,289
to a value it would move one over right

1867
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:21,619
I don't think I want to do it that way

1868
01:57:20,289 --> 01:57:25,139
[Music]

1869
01:57:21,618 --> 01:57:33,978
but you could didn't understand why

1870
01:57:25,139 --> 01:57:33,979
someone might write so there's that oops

1871
01:57:39,288 --> 01:57:50,840
so here we have clipping the min and the

1872
01:57:42,349 --> 01:58:10,069
max to that value that just looks a lot

1873
01:57:50,840 --> 01:58:18,110
more straightforward now see now how

1874
01:58:10,069 --> 01:58:19,729
these are sort of split out so in one

1875
01:58:18,109 --> 01:58:21,948
case you clip the min and the max of the

1876
01:58:19,729 --> 01:58:24,138
min and you just put them in of the max

1877
01:58:21,948 --> 01:58:25,759
and the other ones you clip the max of

1878
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:30,590
the min and the min and the max of a of

1879
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:32,719
right the other two so one of them

1880
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:35,019
always gets pegged and the other one

1881
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:35,019
doesn't

1882
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:48,619
so again it's still really hard to read

1883
01:58:46,789 --> 01:58:50,239
like I say you you really want this to

1884
01:58:48,619 --> 01:58:52,699
look like a diagram because it's just

1885
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:54,319
you know I mean now it's a lot more

1886
01:58:52,699 --> 01:58:55,849
condensed and it's easier to see what's

1887
01:58:54,319 --> 01:58:57,979
happening but it's still really

1888
01:58:55,850 --> 01:59:00,710
confusing and the reason is because you

1889
01:58:57,979 --> 01:59:02,509
have mins and maxes of mins and maxes

1890
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:06,920
you're computing intervals of intervals

1891
01:59:02,510 --> 01:59:08,659
right and that's just very easy to see

1892
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:09,770
in a diagram and very hard to see in

1893
01:59:08,659 --> 01:59:11,269
code because you just got all these

1894
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:14,060
names flying around that's the only way

1895
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:15,710
to really refer to anything so then when

1896
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:17,770
we come in here though now we should be

1897
01:59:15,710 --> 01:59:19,789
able to simplify this a little bit more

1898
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:22,160
and think about what needs to happen

1899
01:59:19,789 --> 01:59:23,420
here so we've got two things operating

1900
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:26,149
the min vault with two things I forgot

1901
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:28,100
the maxval so what we want to do is we

1902
01:59:26,149 --> 01:59:36,109
want to in both cases clip the min and

1903
01:59:28,100 --> 01:59:39,640
the max of both things the question is

1904
01:59:36,109 --> 01:59:39,639
just what do we want to clip them to

1905
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:51,860
right

1906
01:59:48,618 --> 01:59:58,000
so what we want to see here is that the

1907
01:59:51,859 --> 01:59:58,000
lowest value the low can go right

1908
02:00:05,229 --> 02:00:12,729
should still be anything probably am I

1909
02:00:09,399 --> 02:00:16,359
wrong about that it's really just that

1910
02:00:12,729 --> 02:00:19,689
the maximum can't push past oh and the

1911
02:00:16,359 --> 02:00:27,309
minimum can't push past so the minimum

1912
02:00:19,689 --> 02:00:29,019
minimum value it just can't be past the

1913
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:31,930
location that we want to be before so

1914
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:34,000
the maximum minute so we just have to

1915
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:36,760
set we only have to set the maximum

1916
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:40,510
minimum value and say that the maximum

1917
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:44,550
minimum value or I should say the

1918
02:00:40,510 --> 02:00:44,550
minimum well no

1919
02:00:55,198 --> 02:01:06,638
the minimum value and the maximum value

1920
02:01:00,038 --> 02:01:10,658
of the minimum should in theory be able

1921
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:24,279
to be anywhere you want but the maximum

1922
02:01:10,658 --> 02:01:26,788
value of so yeah okay so now I'm

1923
02:01:24,279 --> 02:01:30,759
starting to see why this is is confusing

1924
02:01:26,788 --> 02:01:32,918
so really it doesn't really matter where

1925
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:36,429
the minimum maximum values are it just

1926
02:01:32,918 --> 02:01:39,340
matters that they overlap so if the

1927
02:01:36,429 --> 02:01:42,658
maximum value you just care where the

1928
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:46,809
maximum value of this thing is hostel I

1929
02:01:42,658 --> 02:01:52,348
somewhere within this if the minimum

1930
02:01:46,809 --> 02:01:56,079
doesn't and that's not representable by

1931
02:01:52,349 --> 02:01:58,748
an interval right so I think actually

1932
02:01:56,078 --> 02:02:00,399
the the nasty part about this that first

1933
02:01:58,748 --> 02:02:02,529
parts nice and clean now but the nasty

1934
02:02:00,399 --> 02:02:04,808
part about this is actually that we

1935
02:02:02,529 --> 02:02:08,668
can't really propagate this information

1936
02:02:04,809 --> 02:02:08,668
forwards can we

1937
02:02:16,729 --> 02:02:23,099
so the fundamental problem that I'm

1938
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:25,380
talking about is we know that we need to

1939
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:28,950
overlap this or the two rooms won't

1940
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:32,100
touch right so you know this is a room

1941
02:02:28,949 --> 02:02:34,649
that's already been placed if we need to

1942
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:38,940
overlap this the definition of

1943
02:02:34,649 --> 02:02:42,299
overlapping is just if the minimum lies

1944
02:02:38,939 --> 02:02:52,199
within it or to this direction then it

1945
02:02:42,300 --> 02:03:00,840
then it's in right well the minimum

1946
02:02:52,199 --> 02:03:06,029
value has to be such that its maximum

1947
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:08,159
never passes this right and the maximum

1948
02:03:06,029 --> 02:03:11,449
has to be such that its minimum never

1949
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:16,139
passes this and that we can represent

1950
02:03:11,449 --> 02:03:18,630
but once you have that satisfied you

1951
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:20,640
still don't know if you actually overlap

1952
02:03:18,630 --> 02:03:25,829
because let's say this is the region

1953
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:29,670
that you actually end up with right here

1954
02:03:25,829 --> 02:03:31,590
are the values plausible values for the

1955
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:33,600
minimum and here are the plausible

1956
02:03:31,590 --> 02:03:37,680
values for the maximum or something

1957
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:43,500
right it will always it'll always

1958
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:46,820
overlap if you instead say well here's

1959
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:50,369
the plausible values for the minimum and

1960
02:03:46,819 --> 02:03:52,469
or let's say here are the plausible

1961
02:03:50,369 --> 02:03:58,769
values for the minimum and here are the

1962
02:03:52,470 --> 02:04:00,780
plausible values for the maximum yeah I

1963
02:03:58,770 --> 02:04:02,610
mean I guess what I can say is we can

1964
02:04:00,779 --> 02:04:04,170
always ensure that you would include

1965
02:04:02,609 --> 02:04:08,189
this but you'd have to ensure that you

1966
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:11,430
include all of it is the problem meaning

1967
02:04:08,189 --> 02:04:17,729
a room that just looked like that would

1968
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:20,289
never be allowed right because if you

1969
02:04:17,729 --> 02:04:23,368
allow the

1970
02:04:20,289 --> 02:04:23,368
[Music]

1971
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:33,070
like if you allow I should say a room

1972
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:35,469
that looks like that would never be

1973
02:04:33,069 --> 02:04:40,448
allowed and the reason is because if you

1974
02:04:35,469 --> 02:04:44,350
allow the minimum to be down here once

1975
02:04:40,448 --> 02:04:47,229
it can go fairly far this way then you

1976
02:04:44,350 --> 02:04:50,739
no longer know if the maximum say could

1977
02:04:47,229 --> 02:04:52,869
be anywhere in this range or something

1978
02:04:50,738 --> 02:04:58,589
like that then you no longer know do you

1979
02:04:52,869 --> 02:04:58,590
whether you could place that room

1980
02:05:17,210 --> 02:05:21,000
yeah I don't know so let's let's think

1981
02:05:19,619 --> 02:05:23,479
this through let's actually just try it

1982
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:26,460
because I'm I find this very confusing

1983
02:05:23,479 --> 02:05:28,709
and I think I just need to work it

1984
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:31,500
through a little bit more carefully so

1985
02:05:28,710 --> 02:05:34,500
in terms of the minimum minimum it

1986
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:37,380
doesn't matter where it is right because

1987
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:39,989
any it as long as the room was long

1988
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:45,900
enough right you could put it as far

1989
02:05:39,989 --> 02:05:48,329
minimum as you wanted right so really

1990
02:05:45,899 --> 02:05:50,549
the minimums it's just the maximum is

1991
02:05:48,329 --> 02:06:01,079
the only thing that's clipped and the

1992
02:05:50,550 --> 02:06:10,409
maximum has to be the the the maximum

1993
02:06:01,079 --> 02:06:12,239
has to be such that excuse me when

1994
02:06:10,409 --> 02:06:16,109
you're moving the minimum you cannot

1995
02:06:12,239 --> 02:06:19,769
move it past the room so in this

1996
02:06:16,109 --> 02:06:21,689
situation like that it that's as far as

1997
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:25,220
it can go and it can't go any further

1998
02:06:21,689 --> 02:06:29,779
than that the maximum on the other hand

1999
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:29,780
is the other way round

2000
02:06:42,069 --> 02:06:47,719
the maximum value it can be as high as

2001
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:49,820
it wants right so we don't care how far

2002
02:06:47,719 --> 02:06:52,219
it goes the other way but when we're

2003
02:06:49,819 --> 02:06:56,269
actually moving it back we can't move it

2004
02:06:52,219 --> 02:07:02,000
back past where it would still over

2005
02:06:56,270 --> 02:07:03,230
overlap the room right I think that's

2006
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:08,229
right

2007
02:07:03,229 --> 02:07:14,889
so that location would be at the minimum

2008
02:07:08,229 --> 02:07:14,889
plus the entire apron plus one right

2009
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:21,800
so those two things are true right now

2010
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:25,550
once once we now the question is what

2011
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:26,929
about the other bounds because we're

2012
02:07:25,550 --> 02:07:29,960
talking about the region in which the

2013
02:07:26,929 --> 02:07:31,399
maximum could lie and so when we're

2014
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:33,230
talking about the region in which the

2015
02:07:31,399 --> 02:07:35,479
maximum could lie we know that the

2016
02:07:33,229 --> 02:07:37,369
minimum value for the maximum cannot go

2017
02:07:35,479 --> 02:07:40,089
past there but the maximum value for the

2018
02:07:37,369 --> 02:07:43,340
maximum could be as far away as we want

2019
02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:44,840
right I just don't think there's any

2020
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:46,789
limitation on that unless I'm thinking

2021
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:48,829
about the problem wrong because that

2022
02:07:46,789 --> 02:07:51,619
that box that includes it can be

2023
02:07:48,829 --> 02:07:53,569
arbitrarily large I think and the same

2024
02:07:51,619 --> 02:07:55,519
is true of the of the of the minimum

2025
02:07:53,569 --> 02:07:57,649
right it can be arbitrarily small on the

2026
02:07:55,520 --> 02:08:01,870
other direction so I think that's about

2027
02:07:57,649 --> 02:08:01,869
right that's what I'm going to say

2028
02:08:10,809 --> 02:08:16,610
so let me just see where we're at with

2029
02:08:13,130 --> 02:08:19,179
that in terms of the rectangle we now

2030
02:08:16,609 --> 02:08:19,179
come up with

2031
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:45,989
so let's see here

2032
02:08:41,488 --> 02:08:50,698
yeah looking at this again seems still

2033
02:08:45,988 --> 02:08:52,919
slightly off because I want it so I

2034
02:08:50,698 --> 02:08:55,379
think that's the interior apron problem

2035
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:59,279
again which is to say that the interior

2036
02:08:55,380 --> 02:09:01,199
apron actually needs to be zero on Z

2037
02:08:59,279 --> 02:09:04,408
because we don't have the same

2038
02:09:01,198 --> 02:09:18,599
requirements on Z so I guess we would

2039
02:09:04,408 --> 02:09:21,329
say that so let me just try that more

2040
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:29,730
time there right because we don't want

2041
02:09:21,329 --> 02:09:32,399
to like do the interior apron on Z's so

2042
02:09:29,729 --> 02:09:34,289
the min/max Z's are now set roughly

2043
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:36,799
correctly I think because the Minzy it

2044
02:09:34,289 --> 02:09:39,779
will overlap if it's anywhere negative

2045
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:41,850
anywhere to infinity but it can't go any

2046
02:09:39,779 --> 02:09:43,829
higher than zero right because it's got

2047
02:09:41,850 --> 02:09:51,510
a line up there and the same is true in

2048
02:09:43,829 --> 02:09:52,710
the other direction right the the rest

2049
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:55,350
of the values here I guess I think

2050
02:09:52,710 --> 02:09:57,390
that's all saying min X min Y yeah so

2051
02:09:55,350 --> 02:10:00,710
that looks relatively saying let's see

2052
02:09:57,390 --> 02:10:00,710
what room we come up with here

2053
02:10:10,139 --> 02:10:14,760
the minimum value for the Z is zero the

2054
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:25,170
minimize maximum value for the dimension

2055
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:27,389
two is wait that's not true oh it is

2056
02:10:25,170 --> 02:10:31,639
true so that's actually again that's to

2057
02:10:27,389 --> 02:10:31,639
be inclusive that has to actually be one

2058
02:10:33,979 --> 02:10:40,948
so how do we not get that so when we're

2059
02:10:38,158 --> 02:10:44,629
clipping in here to the maximum value

2060
02:10:40,948 --> 02:10:44,629
than the minimum value since it can be

2061
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:57,760
just trying to think it through here we

2062
02:10:55,720 --> 02:10:59,949
know that the we know what these values

2063
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:02,170
are so the minimum value in case of the

2064
02:10:59,949 --> 02:11:03,789
other mentioned is zero right so then

2065
02:11:02,170 --> 02:11:05,260
we're gonna add the interior apron which

2066
02:11:03,789 --> 02:11:08,859
is also zero and they're gonna add one

2067
02:11:05,260 --> 02:11:14,250
so it seems like that should just

2068
02:11:08,859 --> 02:11:14,250
produce one shouldn't it have

2069
02:11:24,038 --> 02:11:29,099
oh and the min volume of course is

2070
02:11:26,948 --> 02:11:34,419
getting clipped to the interpret minus

2071
02:11:29,099 --> 02:11:43,360
minus 1 which in this case I guess yeah

2072
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:48,309
is not what we were well okay but

2073
02:11:43,359 --> 02:11:53,710
looking at this so when we clip the

2074
02:11:48,309 --> 02:11:58,349
maximum of the minimum moving it to

2075
02:11:53,710 --> 02:12:00,969
whatever the max was we know we go back

2076
02:11:58,349 --> 02:12:03,190
the interpret and the reason we're

2077
02:12:00,969 --> 02:12:06,368
subtracting one there is because we're

2078
02:12:03,189 --> 02:12:08,259
setting the max and the max we know is

2079
02:12:06,368 --> 02:12:10,479
one past where we want to be so we have

2080
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:13,349
to go back one more further from that

2081
02:12:10,479 --> 02:12:13,348
right

2082
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:26,520
but this is clipping the maximum value

2083
02:12:23,399 --> 02:12:30,029
itself which already has that one built

2084
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:33,090
in that's a mind bender so it really

2085
02:12:30,029 --> 02:12:36,899
does end up being bad then when you clip

2086
02:12:33,090 --> 02:12:38,880
the max volumes minimum you're looking

2087
02:12:36,899 --> 02:12:42,710
at a minimum and you're clipping a

2088
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:45,750
minimum so you don't need the plus one I

2089
02:12:42,710 --> 02:12:47,189
don't think because you're starting with

2090
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:49,920
a minimum and you're saying you need to

2091
02:12:47,189 --> 02:12:53,009
be there right

2092
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:53,010
[Music]

2093
02:13:00,849 --> 02:13:05,150
but I suppose you kind of have the other

2094
02:13:03,319 --> 02:13:08,899
thing which is that you also are talking

2095
02:13:05,149 --> 02:13:17,269
about 2 mins man this is nasty

2096
02:13:08,899 --> 02:13:22,308
so so when you actually are talking

2097
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:30,920
about clipping these two you've got a

2098
02:13:22,309 --> 02:13:32,900
max value that is having these values

2099
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:34,069
where community might might be the

2100
02:13:32,899 --> 02:13:35,299
better way to go here just looking at

2101
02:13:34,069 --> 02:13:39,469
how many crazy things you have to keep

2102
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:42,590
in your head cuz so it is the max value

2103
02:13:39,469 --> 02:13:44,480
but it's also the min volume that you're

2104
02:13:42,590 --> 02:13:47,690
clipping so it's where the minimum is

2105
02:13:44,479 --> 02:13:51,618
gonna be placed so if you assume that

2106
02:13:47,689 --> 02:13:53,118
you placed the minimum you need to allow

2107
02:13:51,618 --> 02:13:58,399
the room for the minimum to be placed

2108
02:13:53,118 --> 02:14:00,799
there so I guess that's okay the minimum

2109
02:13:58,399 --> 02:14:02,988
value has to be between there and when

2110
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:04,639
it's the max of it which it takes it so

2111
02:14:02,988 --> 02:14:10,250
I think that's okay this is just

2112
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:13,489
mind-bending there's too many flip-flops

2113
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:14,988
there in my opinion so I think we're

2114
02:14:13,488 --> 02:14:17,029
gonna need to look for an easier way to

2115
02:14:14,988 --> 02:14:20,029
talk about these I think it's just way

2116
02:14:17,029 --> 02:14:21,859
too mind-bending to think about that way

2117
02:14:20,029 --> 02:14:24,380
so maybe they need to be uniform values

2118
02:14:21,859 --> 02:14:25,880
it's really the only way to look at it I

2119
02:14:24,380 --> 02:14:29,469
don't know if that'll introduce other

2120
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:29,469
problems there as well

2121
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:34,000
but we'll see

2122
02:14:34,630 --> 02:14:42,590
so that's right that's right

2123
02:14:39,399 --> 02:14:42,589
[Music]

2124
02:14:46,149 --> 02:14:49,379
well no it's not

2125
02:14:51,649 --> 02:15:00,079
so technically that would not be

2126
02:14:54,559 --> 02:15:08,119
overlapping right so I do think it's

2127
02:15:00,078 --> 02:15:18,349
asymmetric in that sense let me just

2128
02:15:08,118 --> 02:15:20,779
double-check that yes so I think that's

2129
02:15:18,349 --> 02:15:22,849
correct because it has to be that if it

2130
02:15:20,779 --> 02:15:30,438
was zero that would no longer overlap

2131
02:15:22,849 --> 02:15:32,599
the other room but hey we placed that

2132
02:15:30,439 --> 02:15:35,989
room now and I think we place it in the

2133
02:15:32,599 --> 02:15:37,809
right location this will not will

2134
02:15:35,988 --> 02:15:47,388
eventually get to room it can't place

2135
02:15:37,809 --> 02:15:50,748
like so and I'm interested to now see

2136
02:15:47,389 --> 02:15:53,649
what we end up with with our kind of

2137
02:15:50,748 --> 02:15:53,648
ridiculous room sir

2138
02:16:00,079 --> 02:16:04,500
so I guess one thing and I neglected to

2139
02:16:02,699 --> 02:16:07,729
think about is we also have to figure

2140
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:13,500
out where we want to place our our

2141
02:16:07,729 --> 02:16:19,469
sausage gentlemen there what I'd like to

2142
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:21,750
do now is simplify this down to just

2143
02:16:19,470 --> 02:16:24,930
making two rooms that are connected to

2144
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:27,289
each other so if I got rid of all of

2145
02:16:24,930 --> 02:16:27,289
this

2146
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:58,700
and maybe actually I want to do this I'm

2147
02:16:57,260 --> 02:17:07,069
not sure where we place the camera

2148
02:16:58,700 --> 02:17:09,790
currently let's do this well actually I

2149
02:17:07,069 --> 02:17:09,789
can still leave it there

2150
02:17:25,148 --> 02:17:28,789
so this will just create two rooms that

2151
02:17:27,709 --> 02:17:43,759
are connected to each other the main

2152
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:46,910
room in the Harris bedroom right so now

2153
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:48,739
we should only place two rooms total and

2154
02:17:46,909 --> 02:17:50,209
we can actually step through those and

2155
02:17:48,739 --> 02:17:51,439
make sure the x/z are right so we got

2156
02:17:50,209 --> 02:17:52,968
the main room the hero's bedroom those

2157
02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:55,280
two are connected we've created those

2158
02:17:52,968 --> 02:17:58,159
two rooms and that's all we have to do

2159
02:17:55,280 --> 02:18:00,620
so now we can go ahead and and see what

2160
02:17:58,159 --> 02:18:02,269
actually happens there so when we come

2161
02:18:00,620 --> 02:18:04,519
down here and you know figure out how

2162
02:18:02,269 --> 02:18:07,099
we're gonna place this room the first

2163
02:18:04,519 --> 02:18:08,120
room is already placed and we don't know

2164
02:18:07,099 --> 02:18:09,260
which one that is let's see so that's

2165
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:11,510
the hero's bedroom so that's already

2166
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:13,819
placed so then we have to just place

2167
02:18:11,510 --> 02:18:15,349
whatever this other room is and this

2168
02:18:13,819 --> 02:18:16,849
should be the only other room right

2169
02:18:15,349 --> 02:18:21,710
there shouldn't be anything else on the

2170
02:18:16,849 --> 02:18:23,058
stack and there's not and now we can go

2171
02:18:21,709 --> 02:18:27,308
ahead and actually start placing them so

2172
02:18:23,058 --> 02:18:27,308
we come through here and we place them

2173
02:18:28,659 --> 02:18:40,879
there is no other connection to deal

2174
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:46,429
with than this one so we go ahead and

2175
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:48,138
clip it and we verify that it actually

2176
02:18:46,429 --> 02:18:53,659
is about volume so they come through

2177
02:18:48,138 --> 02:18:56,648
here now we try to place the room let's

2178
02:18:53,659 --> 02:18:56,648
see what the room actually says

2179
02:19:03,709 --> 02:19:09,129
seems pretty reasonable it has to be

2180
02:19:06,290 --> 02:19:09,130
between there and there

2181
02:19:16,270 --> 02:19:22,381
that all seems pretty good so we take a

2182
02:19:18,819 --> 02:19:25,029
look at the min and the max we know

2183
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:27,880
roughly where those have to be so let's

2184
02:19:25,030 --> 02:19:29,680
go ahead and compute those so then we

2185
02:19:27,880 --> 02:19:35,369
end up with a min of negative 53 and a

2186
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:35,370
max of negative 5 that makes sense

2187
02:19:41,430 --> 02:19:47,309
the next dimension we can place it

2188
02:19:45,251 --> 02:19:47,309
anywhere

2189
02:19:55,379 --> 02:20:00,930
and then we get down to Z negative to

2190
02:19:58,450 --> 02:20:00,931
positive

2191
02:20:08,350 --> 02:20:19,610
so that got placed so the room is now

2192
02:20:13,219 --> 02:20:20,599
placed and we're good so I think that's

2193
02:20:19,610 --> 02:20:24,771
all fine

2194
02:20:20,600 --> 02:20:27,920
the only problem that we have here is

2195
02:20:24,771 --> 02:20:29,600
that for reasons unknown to me probably

2196
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:30,500
just because there was so much stuff for

2197
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:33,290
us to think about there

2198
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:36,290
I just never finished the exit path of

2199
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:40,730
this right so what we want to do here is

2200
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:43,220
say well look if you place the room at

2201
02:20:40,729 --> 02:20:45,500
some point then you're done right

2202
02:20:43,219 --> 02:20:49,760
so we want all of these to sort of be

2203
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:53,420
predicated on the result and we want to

2204
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:55,399
stop looping right so if at this point

2205
02:20:53,420 --> 02:20:57,649
we could even return outside from

2206
02:20:55,399 --> 02:21:06,859
outside from inside there if you want to

2207
02:20:57,649 --> 02:21:08,479
but I'll just make it so these loops are

2208
02:21:06,860 --> 02:21:11,030
predicated on it so as soon as you get

2209
02:21:08,479 --> 02:21:12,199
one of those you're done right you stop

2210
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:14,540
looking

2211
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:21,230
when you find one of these results and

2212
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:23,740
off you go we could also turn this into

2213
02:21:21,229 --> 02:21:23,739
one loop

2214
02:21:34,149 --> 02:21:36,989
and we'll see

2215
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:49,750
all right so now we ostensibly are

2216
02:21:46,629 --> 02:21:52,799
placing two rooms and you can see that

2217
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:59,500
we actually did place two rooms there

2218
02:21:52,799 --> 02:22:02,829
here's the first room so right because

2219
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:04,271
we know because of its dimension and

2220
02:22:02,829 --> 02:22:08,469
then here's the second room that got

2221
02:22:04,271 --> 02:22:10,390
placed now it doesn't quite look like we

2222
02:22:08,469 --> 02:22:13,119
did it right because they don't quite

2223
02:22:10,389 --> 02:22:14,680
overlap right you can see that there's a

2224
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:17,740
gap here so we can see that we're off by

2225
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:19,720
one it's but otherwise it's correct it's

2226
02:22:17,739 --> 02:22:24,280
not probably great like it's not what we

2227
02:22:19,719 --> 02:22:25,899
want but it's okay and we also need to

2228
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:28,750
record the actual connection between

2229
02:22:25,899 --> 02:22:30,579
those rooms which is to say we need to

2230
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:32,709
place the connection at the location

2231
02:22:30,579 --> 02:22:34,809
where the rooms actually overlap so as

2232
02:22:32,709 --> 02:22:43,079
we unwind out of that we need to

2233
02:22:34,809 --> 02:22:43,079
actually do that right and I think

2234
02:22:43,139 --> 02:22:49,949
that's something we probably need to do

2235
02:22:45,250 --> 02:22:52,600
right here so if the room got placed

2236
02:22:49,950 --> 02:22:54,940
then we know that the connection that

2237
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:57,550
we're looking at here needs to actually

2238
02:22:54,940 --> 02:23:01,870
be put in the place where the two rooms

2239
02:22:57,549 --> 02:23:05,520
overlap because that's where you can

2240
02:23:01,870 --> 02:23:05,521
walk right

2241
02:23:18,899 --> 02:23:27,300
so that's fine as well but we yeah like

2242
02:23:24,390 --> 02:23:30,390
I said we still have a problem with the

2243
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:33,479
abutment so the abutment is going to be

2244
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:35,729
coming from here I believe because if

2245
02:23:33,479 --> 02:23:39,779
you looked at how it was erroneously

2246
02:23:35,729 --> 02:23:42,751
placed it was this one that was wrong so

2247
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:48,030
I suspect that the problem there is just

2248
02:23:42,751 --> 02:23:52,171
that like well we're placing the minimum

2249
02:23:48,030 --> 02:23:53,480
here and we're saying the minimum has to

2250
02:23:52,171 --> 02:23:57,690
be exactly

2251
02:23:53,479 --> 02:23:59,040
starting at the maximum and then here

2252
02:23:57,690 --> 02:24:03,989
replacing the maximum we're saying this

2253
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:06,630
has to be starting at the minimum back

2254
02:24:03,989 --> 02:24:10,761
one but okay so it looks like this case

2255
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:10,760
is wrong to me

2256
02:24:15,709 --> 02:24:30,500
you want the maximum value to actually

2257
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:33,970
be literally this value so I think

2258
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:33,969
that's what you're actually looking for

2259
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:42,739
yeah and that's correct now so now you

2260
02:24:39,260 --> 02:24:44,478
can see these two rooms join up and they

2261
02:24:42,739 --> 02:24:48,409
join up in the minimal way possible

2262
02:24:44,478 --> 02:24:49,849
right probably now we want to push this

2263
02:24:48,409 --> 02:24:51,500
in the way that I said we wanted to push

2264
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:56,239
it in so maybe you want something more

2265
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:58,100
like that and now when the rooms are

2266
02:24:56,239 --> 02:25:01,760
joined they should have to adjoin in a

2267
02:24:58,100 --> 02:25:06,530
way that affords more space you can see

2268
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:12,860
that and finally you know let's say we

2269
02:25:06,530 --> 02:25:19,070
maybe reduce this at the moment to more

2270
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:21,220
sensibly sized rooms so now we've got

2271
02:25:19,069 --> 02:25:21,219
that

2272
02:25:24,060 --> 02:25:29,699
why am I not there we go

2273
02:25:27,090 --> 02:25:32,489
so now we've got that and so now we

2274
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:35,659
should in theory also be able to extend

2275
02:25:32,489 --> 02:25:35,659
the number of them that we do

2276
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:53,799
oops I don't know if this will actually

2277
02:25:50,979 --> 02:25:54,850
work probably won't but actually you

2278
02:25:53,799 --> 02:25:56,229
know what we know it won't work cuz we

2279
02:25:54,851 --> 02:25:57,989
don't do overlap testing so this will

2280
02:25:56,229 --> 02:26:00,489
like place rooms on top of each other

2281
02:25:57,989 --> 02:26:02,351
right or something crazy like that

2282
02:26:00,489 --> 02:26:03,369
so actually we probably don't want to do

2283
02:26:02,351 --> 02:26:05,920
that just yet

2284
02:26:03,370 --> 02:26:07,630
because we know that won't work what we

2285
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:11,739
want to do instead is probably do

2286
02:26:07,629 --> 02:26:13,299
something like the forest path so that

2287
02:26:11,739 --> 02:26:20,860
we've got something that comes then out

2288
02:26:13,299 --> 02:26:22,090
of the main room you know what I you

2289
02:26:20,860 --> 02:26:24,190
know I've never mind I'm just not even

2290
02:26:22,090 --> 02:26:25,690
gonna bother because we need to first do

2291
02:26:24,190 --> 02:26:27,640
overlap testing before any of that makes

2292
02:26:25,690 --> 02:26:29,170
sense because there's no reason why it

2293
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:30,760
couldn't just stick it right on top of

2294
02:26:29,170 --> 02:26:38,829
the existing room that would just be

2295
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:39,550
totally illegal right yeah and that'd be

2296
02:26:38,829 --> 02:26:41,530
totally fine

2297
02:26:39,549 --> 02:26:44,799
so what we really need to do now to

2298
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:46,180
finish up and then all in the stream is

2299
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:47,679
we need to place the connection and we

2300
02:26:46,180 --> 02:26:49,950
need to place it in the region where the

2301
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:52,450
two rooms are actually abutting

2302
02:26:49,950 --> 02:26:54,521
somewhere in there and so if we knew

2303
02:26:52,450 --> 02:26:56,021
that door sizes are like two wide or

2304
02:26:54,521 --> 02:26:58,870
something like that or however one wide

2305
02:26:56,021 --> 02:27:02,079
even then all we need to do is we need

2306
02:26:58,870 --> 02:27:05,891
to look at which direction we were

2307
02:27:02,079 --> 02:27:10,840
trying to go and what the actual clip

2308
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:15,959
region now is for the two rooms so we

2309
02:27:10,840 --> 02:27:20,710
know we have other room ball and room

2310
02:27:15,959 --> 02:27:24,089
all right and what we want to do is we

2311
02:27:20,709 --> 02:27:24,089
want to intersect these two

2312
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:37,540
in a sense right like that's sort of

2313
02:27:35,409 --> 02:27:40,299
what we want to do but the two are sort

2314
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:43,300
of distinct they're not actually

2315
02:27:40,299 --> 02:27:45,399
overlapping they're just a budding so

2316
02:27:43,299 --> 02:27:48,069
what we need to do is we need to just

2317
02:27:45,399 --> 02:27:53,500
talk about the one intersecting the one

2318
02:27:48,069 --> 02:27:58,420
dimension that they that we're actually

2319
02:27:53,500 --> 02:28:00,851
trying to use right and we know that

2320
02:27:58,420 --> 02:28:03,190
they'll be separated by the dimension of

2321
02:28:00,851 --> 02:28:06,159
the connection right so we know that the

2322
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:08,170
dimension that we picked here we know

2323
02:28:06,159 --> 02:28:10,181
that they are distinct in that dimension

2324
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:12,431
but they should be overlapping in the

2325
02:28:10,181 --> 02:28:14,649
other ones so when we get this door

2326
02:28:12,431 --> 02:28:17,860
volume here we know that it doesn't have

2327
02:28:14,649 --> 02:28:20,949
any actual volume but it does tell us

2328
02:28:17,860 --> 02:28:22,540
the overlap right so the first thing we

2329
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:25,750
need to do to fix that is we know that

2330
02:28:22,540 --> 02:28:36,690
the door in the dimension in question

2331
02:28:25,750 --> 02:28:36,690
right I think

2332
02:28:41,101 --> 02:28:47,620
there we go so in the dimension in

2333
02:28:44,739 --> 02:28:53,890
question we now know that the the door

2334
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:56,561
should actually sort of take one from

2335
02:28:53,890 --> 02:29:00,011
each one into either side so it should

2336
02:28:56,560 --> 02:29:03,390
cut one into the room the middle side

2337
02:29:00,011 --> 02:29:06,851
and one into room on the Mac side right

2338
02:29:03,390 --> 02:29:24,609
so what we want to do here is say well

2339
02:29:06,851 --> 02:29:27,881
we know which side we were doing so if

2340
02:29:24,610 --> 02:29:30,461
we were talking about going in the

2341
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:34,180
positive direction so this thing is to

2342
02:29:30,460 --> 02:29:36,579
the to the east if you will then we know

2343
02:29:34,181 --> 02:29:39,671
that the minimum value of the door is

2344
02:29:36,579 --> 02:29:42,550
going to basically be the maximum value

2345
02:29:39,671 --> 02:29:46,601
of the source door of the source room

2346
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:49,210
right and furthermore

2347
02:29:46,601 --> 02:29:52,801
we know that's actually one pass we want

2348
02:29:49,210 --> 02:30:00,609
to recent want to back it up one right

2349
02:29:52,800 --> 02:30:03,540
and then the minimum value of that we

2350
02:30:00,610 --> 02:30:06,370
want to back that up one oops

2351
02:30:03,540 --> 02:30:08,949
when I say we wanted to back that up

2352
02:30:06,370 --> 02:30:14,051
when I actually mean we wanted to push

2353
02:30:08,950 --> 02:30:16,271
it one forward right so I believe what

2354
02:30:14,050 --> 02:30:22,501
we want to say there right is that the

2355
02:30:16,271 --> 02:30:22,501
minimum for this door no no I was right

2356
02:30:25,909 --> 02:30:30,500
yeah so that's correct so the other room

2357
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:32,329
we've got it to minimum we're pushing it

2358
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:33,559
one forwards and I guess now that I

2359
02:30:32,329 --> 02:30:39,110
think about it we don't even really need

2360
02:30:33,559 --> 02:30:42,289
to look at the other one at all right

2361
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:46,010
it's just that we're just going on

2362
02:30:42,290 --> 02:30:49,479
either side of it on the other hand we

2363
02:30:46,010 --> 02:30:49,478
would want to do the opposite thing

2364
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:57,200
or I mean I guess you could look at it

2365
02:30:52,370 --> 02:31:16,790
this way so we could actually say maybe

2366
02:30:57,200 --> 02:31:19,130
this does that make sense so basically

2367
02:31:16,790 --> 02:31:20,840
we know that one of the rooms is minimum

2368
02:31:19,129 --> 02:31:23,119
will be where it is but we just don't

2369
02:31:20,840 --> 02:31:24,409
know which one right so we just have to

2370
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:28,870
figure out which one it is and then at

2371
02:31:24,409 --> 02:31:28,869
that point we can just set this directly

2372
02:31:39,450 --> 02:31:45,069
so now we have placed it there the

2373
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:46,810
question is what do we want to do about

2374
02:31:45,069 --> 02:31:49,331
the rest of the overlap region right

2375
02:31:46,810 --> 02:31:51,489
when we intersect these two things which

2376
02:31:49,331 --> 02:31:53,890
sort of says what they are now what I'll

2377
02:31:51,489 --> 02:31:55,989
probably say is let's just leave that as

2378
02:31:53,890 --> 02:31:57,729
an intersection for now and we'll let

2379
02:31:55,989 --> 02:32:00,341
the whole space between them be

2380
02:31:57,729 --> 02:32:04,149
intersected there let's just do that

2381
02:32:00,341 --> 02:32:19,211
temporarily I'm gonna write doing a

2382
02:32:04,149 --> 02:32:28,779
section routine so if we have to

2383
02:32:19,210 --> 02:32:30,430
intersect two volumes basically what we

2384
02:32:28,780 --> 02:32:34,871
want to do here is just start with one

2385
02:32:30,431 --> 02:32:44,649
of them and then we just need to check

2386
02:32:34,870 --> 02:32:48,540
each of the each of the dimensions so

2387
02:32:44,649 --> 02:32:48,540
what we want to do now is say well okay

2388
02:32:48,870 --> 02:32:55,899
we know we've got each of these things

2389
02:32:53,921 --> 02:32:58,541
as a span and we want to sort of move

2390
02:32:55,899 --> 02:33:01,529
each one up to the other ones mins and

2391
02:32:58,540 --> 02:33:08,069
maxes right so what we want to do is say

2392
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:09,280
if the I guess I can even do it this way

2393
02:33:08,069 --> 02:33:13,029
right

2394
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:14,921
I can just say my results minimum for

2395
02:33:13,030 --> 02:33:21,221
this dimension is going to be whichever

2396
02:33:14,921 --> 02:33:24,640
one is less right so if a ZEM is less

2397
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:29,069
than B's minimum and I mean we can just

2398
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:29,069
say you know we just want the minimum

2399
02:33:31,220 --> 02:33:54,600
no no if we have an s 32 minimum that

2400
02:33:33,959 --> 02:33:59,640
was the only problem looks like we do

2401
02:33:54,601 --> 02:34:02,721
all right so all we need to do is do

2402
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:02,720
this for the minimum and the maximum

2403
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:08,790
right now this would be a union because

2404
02:34:06,989 --> 02:34:11,069
you'll be taking the minimum minimum and

2405
02:34:08,790 --> 02:34:12,210
the maximum maximum and that's not

2406
02:34:11,069 --> 02:34:13,890
actually the intersection the extra

2407
02:34:12,209 --> 02:34:16,199
intersection after that but I'll go

2408
02:34:13,890 --> 02:34:19,140
ahead and make that as well since I

2409
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:20,909
already checked it in right so if the

2410
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:24,060
intersection I actually want whichever

2411
02:34:20,909 --> 02:34:27,989
one is higher right I want to squish

2412
02:34:24,060 --> 02:34:31,170
these two so I'm taking the lowest

2413
02:34:27,989 --> 02:34:32,280
maximum and the highest minimum that

2414
02:34:31,170 --> 02:34:36,870
makes sense and we'll step through that

2415
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:38,400
in a second so the other thing I just

2416
02:34:36,870 --> 02:34:41,820
realized is we never actually recorded

2417
02:34:38,399 --> 02:34:44,609
this value so we need to actually take

2418
02:34:41,819 --> 02:34:46,470
the connection now so when we're looking

2419
02:34:44,610 --> 02:34:49,851
at this particular connection we need to

2420
02:34:46,470 --> 02:34:54,140
set the connections volume equal to this

2421
02:34:49,851 --> 02:34:54,141
tour sorry if I'm behind my head there

2422
02:34:57,180 --> 02:35:01,600
all right so now that should be right

2423
02:34:59,709 --> 02:35:03,429
although it doesn't it looks like we've

2424
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:07,059
got that backwards you can see it's

2425
02:35:03,430 --> 02:35:09,639
clipping out there which is wrong so

2426
02:35:07,059 --> 02:35:14,978
we're close all right so let me move to

2427
02:35:09,639 --> 02:35:16,568
the other side here so I thought I had

2428
02:35:14,978 --> 02:35:21,429
this right if the site is positive then

2429
02:35:16,568 --> 02:35:22,568
it's the other room minimum that were at

2430
02:35:21,430 --> 02:35:25,630
because we're going this way

2431
02:35:22,568 --> 02:35:29,648
right otherwise it's ours because we're

2432
02:35:25,629 --> 02:35:34,469
going the other way right

2433
02:35:29,648 --> 02:35:34,469
Oh nope that that is backwards yeah okay

2434
02:35:37,709 --> 02:35:42,278
that is backwards is we're going

2435
02:35:39,579 --> 02:35:47,020
positive that's our minimum since it was

2436
02:35:42,279 --> 02:35:49,658
going that yeah yeah so this stuff is

2437
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:53,109
just begs to be flipped all the time

2438
02:35:49,658 --> 02:35:56,079
accidentally so there you can see the

2439
02:35:53,109 --> 02:35:58,859
door being placed right and you can see

2440
02:35:56,079 --> 02:36:02,500
where the door actually got got put in

2441
02:35:58,859 --> 02:36:03,970
and that's all well and good and we can

2442
02:36:02,500 --> 02:36:07,439
go between the rooms as well and of

2443
02:36:03,969 --> 02:36:09,608
course our lighting being slow as it is

2444
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:11,229
unfortunately means if we're in debug

2445
02:36:09,609 --> 02:36:13,568
mode the lighting just takes up way too

2446
02:36:11,228 --> 02:36:15,278
much time to run that's speed but I can

2447
02:36:13,568 --> 02:36:19,778
compile in release mode and then we can

2448
02:36:15,279 --> 02:36:23,500
hop around properly right so you know

2449
02:36:19,779 --> 02:36:25,449
once we're set with that we now have the

2450
02:36:23,500 --> 02:36:26,559
ability to sort of correctly solve for

2451
02:36:25,449 --> 02:36:28,840
the daisy-chaining of these rooms

2452
02:36:26,559 --> 02:36:30,879
together and what we probably want to do

2453
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:33,130
is narrow the door down right because we

2454
02:36:30,879 --> 02:36:35,289
don't want the door to take the whole

2455
02:36:33,129 --> 02:36:37,179
overlap space we want to just be a

2456
02:36:35,290 --> 02:36:43,180
narrow passageway that you go between

2457
02:36:37,180 --> 02:36:45,398
right so we can work on that a little

2458
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:47,648
bit later I mean for now we can just

2459
02:36:45,398 --> 02:36:53,158
throw something in if we want which is

2460
02:36:47,648 --> 02:36:57,340
to say that the dimension of the door in

2461
02:36:53,158 --> 02:36:58,600
whatever the other dimension is well I

2462
02:36:57,340 --> 02:37:00,158
don't even bother because that's just

2463
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:02,140
gonna take a bunch more time so we can

2464
02:37:00,158 --> 02:37:04,059
go ahead and Q&amp;A now I would say the big

2465
02:37:02,139 --> 02:37:06,969
thing that I want to think about going

2466
02:37:04,059 --> 02:37:09,189
forwards is I don't like how Phoenix I

2467
02:37:06,969 --> 02:37:11,679
don't like the max and minimums being

2468
02:37:09,189 --> 02:37:14,289
treated differently like that it just

2469
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:17,949
the inclusive exclusive rule is just a

2470
02:37:14,289 --> 02:37:19,748
little too mind-bending and I feel like

2471
02:37:17,949 --> 02:37:22,390
it's just gonna be annoying and we're

2472
02:37:19,748 --> 02:37:25,020
gonna a maybe once you have the basics

2473
02:37:22,389 --> 02:37:27,538
worked out it's fine

2474
02:37:25,020 --> 02:37:30,779
[Music]

2475
02:37:27,539 --> 02:37:30,779
but yeah

2476
02:37:38,090 --> 02:37:47,568
it would be nice to deal with there's a

2477
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:50,199
little bit more a little bit more

2478
02:37:47,568 --> 02:37:50,198
succinctly

2479
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:27,988
we've now make you like low hi width be

2480
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:30,090
helpful you mean so that you would have

2481
02:38:27,988 --> 02:38:31,469
min and Max and low and high so you

2482
02:38:30,090 --> 02:38:36,329
could remember which one you were

2483
02:38:31,469 --> 02:38:37,709
talking about maybe or something weird

2484
02:38:36,329 --> 02:38:39,270
using a range of low values at a range

2485
02:38:37,709 --> 02:38:42,500
of high values for dimensions be easier

2486
02:38:39,270 --> 02:38:42,500
than having two volumes

2487
02:38:47,148 --> 02:38:53,648
I'm not sure what you mean you know can

2488
02:38:50,659 --> 02:38:55,728
you be more specific there

2489
02:38:53,648 --> 02:38:57,889
why are you pending x2 those types

2490
02:38:55,728 --> 02:38:59,209
that's just if I'm making a notation

2491
02:38:57,889 --> 02:39:00,648
that it doesn't matter if they're 32

2492
02:38:59,209 --> 02:39:03,379
bits just they have to be at least 32

2493
02:39:00,648 --> 02:39:07,430
bits right so if I say something is a

2494
02:39:03,379 --> 02:39:09,379
you 32 I mean ask me exactly 32 bits if

2495
02:39:07,430 --> 02:39:11,809
I say something to you 32 X I just mean

2496
02:39:09,379 --> 02:39:14,239
well anything 32 bits or above is fine

2497
02:39:11,809 --> 02:39:15,619
and technically I could I could be more

2498
02:39:14,239 --> 02:39:17,090
precise about that sometimes too I could

2499
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:20,600
say like actually this only needs to be

2500
02:39:17,090 --> 02:39:22,159
16 bits so it's a you 16 X or something

2501
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:26,290
like that and sometimes I go through and

2502
02:39:22,159 --> 02:39:26,289
actually do that in the code sometimes

2503
02:40:15,250 --> 02:40:19,329
you got to did you want to avoid a

2504
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:23,250
Christian uh in the mean the crawler I

2505
02:40:19,329 --> 02:40:26,379
did I didn't want this thing to recurse

2506
02:40:23,250 --> 02:40:30,360
and the reason I didn't want it to

2507
02:40:26,379 --> 02:40:33,009
recurse is because it's gonna have to do

2508
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:36,610
first of all it'll be deep sometimes

2509
02:40:33,010 --> 02:40:38,469
potentially and the other because of

2510
02:40:36,610 --> 02:40:40,900
it'll just you know if you have long

2511
02:40:38,469 --> 02:40:42,699
change with lots of branching you'll end

2512
02:40:40,899 --> 02:40:44,219
up with very large stacks and I just

2513
02:40:42,700 --> 02:40:46,480
kind of wanted to not worry about that

2514
02:40:44,219 --> 02:40:47,649
but the other reason is rip up and

2515
02:40:46,479 --> 02:40:49,959
replace is gonna have to go in here

2516
02:40:47,649 --> 02:40:51,430
somewhere and I feel like it's probably

2517
02:40:49,959 --> 02:40:52,959
gonna end up going in here and so I

2518
02:40:51,430 --> 02:40:55,630
don't really want recursion sitting in

2519
02:40:52,959 --> 02:41:00,339
there it's gonna be kind of nasty this

2520
02:40:55,629 --> 02:41:03,750
thing is just to get us started so it

2521
02:41:00,340 --> 02:41:09,460
may want to become non recursive as well

2522
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:10,750
but at the moment I don't care although

2523
02:41:09,459 --> 02:41:12,309
now that I think about it it doesn't

2524
02:41:10,750 --> 02:41:14,790
really need to be recursive for any

2525
02:41:12,309 --> 02:41:14,789
particular reason

2526
02:41:29,620 --> 02:41:33,520
so it could easily just use a stack as

2527
02:41:31,809 --> 02:41:36,909
well pretty easy pretty pretty simple

2528
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:38,590
stock but again I don't know we're gonna

2529
02:41:36,909 --> 02:41:46,840
have to see how we want to start doing

2530
02:41:38,590 --> 02:41:49,329
the harder parts of this first the hero

2531
02:41:46,840 --> 02:41:54,579
walk outside the rooms in this setup no

2532
02:41:49,329 --> 02:41:58,420
so the way that we do movement is very

2533
02:41:54,579 --> 02:42:03,639
specific right now you can only stand on

2534
02:41:58,420 --> 02:42:06,069
a legal square so you know if you tried

2535
02:42:03,639 --> 02:42:08,648
to walk outside anywhere you just

2536
02:42:06,069 --> 02:42:10,510
wouldn't be able to even though this is

2537
02:42:08,648 --> 02:42:14,108
just kind of preliminary stuff here I

2538
02:42:10,510 --> 02:42:17,939
suppose it still forces you to only do

2539
02:42:14,109 --> 02:42:20,260
the right things like you can't ever

2540
02:42:17,939 --> 02:42:22,780
stand on something that wasn't mark

2541
02:42:20,260 --> 02:42:25,510
stand a bowl which i think is generally

2542
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:27,520
better because it means even even when

2543
02:42:25,510 --> 02:42:30,489
we're just in the simple phases of

2544
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:33,340
laying out some rooms here and just have

2545
02:42:30,489 --> 02:42:35,228
a little debug hero hopping around you

2546
02:42:33,340 --> 02:42:37,450
still can't break the game in that way

2547
02:42:35,228 --> 02:42:39,309
which is nice as opposed to you know

2548
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:41,680
player unknown battlegrounds where a

2549
02:42:39,309 --> 02:42:43,119
year after supposedly shipping the game

2550
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:51,220
people fall through the world all the

2551
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:52,689
time right Neil said lo can be between

2552
02:42:51,219 --> 02:42:54,010
negative 30 and 5 and high can be

2553
02:42:52,689 --> 02:42:56,559
negative 40 and 20 as opposed to a

2554
02:42:54,010 --> 02:43:03,329
minion volume of negative 4 and 5 and a

2555
02:42:56,559 --> 02:43:03,329
max volume of negative 30 and 20

2556
02:43:16,700 --> 02:43:24,370
Neal I think that is what we're doing

2557
02:43:18,770 --> 02:43:24,370
though unless I'm misunderstanding you

2558
02:43:31,219 --> 02:43:36,738
we are doing the min volume is the min

2559
02:43:34,639 --> 02:43:39,049
and Max of the minimum so it's the what

2560
02:43:36,738 --> 02:43:42,618
the low value can be and the max volume

2561
02:43:39,049 --> 02:43:46,309
is the high volume it's but where the

2562
02:43:42,619 --> 02:43:47,600
high value can fall so isn't that what

2563
02:43:46,309 --> 02:43:49,129
you were saying or is maybe that in that

2564
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:50,658
what you're saying okay do you think

2565
02:43:49,129 --> 02:43:52,670
that languages that interact with a GPU

2566
02:43:50,658 --> 02:43:54,728
directly like Nvidia CUDA or AMD h IP

2567
02:43:52,670 --> 02:43:58,158
would be useful for game programming

2568
02:43:54,728 --> 02:44:00,398
yeah I mean some there's some reasons

2569
02:43:58,158 --> 02:44:02,449
why it's hard to use things like CUDA

2570
02:44:00,398 --> 02:44:03,708
potentially in game programming and

2571
02:44:02,449 --> 02:44:05,209
sometimes that's just because they

2572
02:44:03,709 --> 02:44:08,029
haven't optimized it for being like

2573
02:44:05,209 --> 02:44:09,680
frame coherent so we can say like we

2574
02:44:08,029 --> 02:44:14,180
gotta get this frame out on time sort of

2575
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:15,648
stuff because you know a scientific

2576
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:16,908
computing stuff doesn't care if they're

2577
02:44:15,648 --> 02:44:18,349
hitting a frame budget they just want to

2578
02:44:16,908 --> 02:44:22,309
compute as fast as possible and so on

2579
02:44:18,350 --> 02:44:26,328
right so sometimes the systems aren't

2580
02:44:22,309 --> 02:44:27,978
set up for that but at least CUDA is now

2581
02:44:26,328 --> 02:44:33,439
kind of set up so that you can do frames

2582
02:44:27,978 --> 02:44:35,769
on time I don't know about h IP but so

2583
02:44:33,439 --> 02:44:37,729
you can use them for game programming

2584
02:44:35,770 --> 02:44:39,408
unfortunately they're kind of specific

2585
02:44:37,728 --> 02:44:42,948
right and so they're not maybe what you

2586
02:44:39,408 --> 02:44:46,908
really want but you can use them or at

2587
02:44:42,949 --> 02:44:49,279
least CUDA you could I mean I don't know

2588
02:44:46,908 --> 02:44:51,498
what you do on Intel I don't know if

2589
02:44:49,279 --> 02:44:53,149
that runs CUDA at all right like I don't

2590
02:44:51,498 --> 02:44:56,350
know how you would necessarily ship a

2591
02:44:53,148 --> 02:44:59,358
game that way unless you just had one

2592
02:44:56,350 --> 02:45:02,689
for each so it's like oh we shipped CUDA

2593
02:44:59,359 --> 02:45:06,408
on NVIDIA and H IP on AMD and something

2594
02:45:02,689 --> 02:45:07,970
like that the jim-jams 40 off topic do

2595
02:45:06,408 --> 02:45:10,840
you miss some features that exist in C

2596
02:45:07,969 --> 02:45:15,498
but are absent in C++ no because I

2597
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:20,568
there weren't any of those really when I

2598
02:45:15,498 --> 02:45:26,590
learned C so no I mean there is one the

2599
02:45:20,568 --> 02:45:26,590
void star treatment in C++ is really bad

2600
02:45:26,738 --> 02:45:30,920
that's the only thing that was true in

2601
02:45:29,180 --> 02:45:40,578
the original see that they messed up in

2602
02:45:30,920 --> 02:45:43,760
C++ pretty bad which is like you kind of

2603
02:45:40,578 --> 02:45:45,529
got you were supposed to you needed a

2604
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:47,601
thing that was

2605
02:45:45,530 --> 02:45:50,450
a pointer that can convert to any other

2606
02:45:47,601 --> 02:45:53,540
pointer type once right

2607
02:45:50,450 --> 02:45:56,450
so in see a void star used to mean this

2608
02:45:53,540 --> 02:46:01,370
could be anything so if I assign it to a

2609
02:45:56,450 --> 02:46:03,771
foo star it will work C++ failed to

2610
02:46:01,370 --> 02:46:06,410
introduce when they got rid of void star

2611
02:46:03,771 --> 02:46:09,200
as that they failed to introduce

2612
02:46:06,409 --> 02:46:12,799
something to take its place and that was

2613
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:14,840
a mistake so when they first did that

2614
02:46:12,799 --> 02:46:17,289
change I do miss that I wish that was

2615
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:17,290
not the case

2616
02:46:28,829 --> 02:46:37,228
let's hear thoughts on DXR I already

2617
02:46:33,670 --> 02:46:39,760
talked about that in a previous episode

2618
02:46:37,228 --> 02:46:43,239
we ever get back to the nicely aligned

2619
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:44,620
grass rock bitmaps not exactly there is

2620
02:46:43,239 --> 02:46:47,279
something that will happen there but

2621
02:46:44,620 --> 02:46:49,870
I'll save that for a little bit later

2622
02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:52,000
but we won't be doing quite exactly that

2623
02:46:49,870 --> 02:46:55,380
but will we do something simple some

2624
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:55,379
that simply similar

2625
02:47:30,889 --> 02:47:34,319
so I could not exactly follow you but

2626
02:47:33,090 --> 02:47:37,319
can you guess at what makes the interval

2627
02:47:34,319 --> 02:47:39,000
computations tiresome yeah I mean the

2628
02:47:37,319 --> 02:47:44,159
thing that's the problem with them is

2629
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:47,639
that there's too many components to them

2630
02:47:44,159 --> 02:47:50,299
right and this is like a common source

2631
02:47:47,639 --> 02:47:57,029
of problems and a common source of bugs

2632
02:47:50,299 --> 02:47:58,500
and it's because whenever you're dealing

2633
02:47:57,030 --> 02:48:01,230
with something that has a lot of

2634
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:03,719
components so in this case we have a

2635
02:48:01,229 --> 02:48:06,389
minimum and maximum value for the room

2636
02:48:03,719 --> 02:48:09,029
location which itself has a minimum and

2637
02:48:06,389 --> 02:48:13,889
maximum value each of which is on three

2638
02:48:09,030 --> 02:48:17,190
different dimensions right programming

2639
02:48:13,889 --> 02:48:19,229
does not make it easy to clearly

2640
02:48:17,190 --> 02:48:21,239
articulate which of those you're talking

2641
02:48:19,229 --> 02:48:25,049
about any given time in a way a brain

2642
02:48:21,239 --> 02:48:28,680
works brains don't think about things in

2643
02:48:25,049 --> 02:48:31,979
terms of words when those things are non

2644
02:48:28,680 --> 02:48:34,739
semantic right so a brain doesn't like

2645
02:48:31,979 --> 02:48:36,930
think about this in terms of like a min

2646
02:48:34,739 --> 02:48:38,699
and a max and a radius and whatever

2647
02:48:36,930 --> 02:48:41,700
right it just looks at this and it's

2648
02:48:38,700 --> 02:48:43,500
like oh yeah the cylinder so the chance

2649
02:48:41,700 --> 02:48:45,329
that I hand this to somebody else and

2650
02:48:43,500 --> 02:48:48,000
they don't understand what the bottom

2651
02:48:45,329 --> 02:48:49,920
the top are is like zero right you have

2652
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:51,569
to be a fantastically stupid human being

2653
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:51,960
to not immediately know what I'm talking

2654
02:48:51,569 --> 02:48:53,699
about

2655
02:48:51,959 --> 02:48:55,409
on the other hand when you translate

2656
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:57,720
this into code there are so many

2657
02:48:55,409 --> 02:48:59,789
variables for all of the parameters here

2658
02:48:57,719 --> 02:49:01,289
the width of each of these individual

2659
02:48:59,790 --> 02:49:02,910
squares and the height of it and which

2660
02:49:01,290 --> 02:49:04,350
direction they're going and how it's

2661
02:49:02,909 --> 02:49:05,700
wrapped around here the fact that the

2662
02:49:04,350 --> 02:49:07,590
cylinder and the thing are on the

2663
02:49:05,700 --> 02:49:10,880
opposite sides of this and this thing

2664
02:49:07,590 --> 02:49:13,049
has a joint level right and whatever

2665
02:49:10,879 --> 02:49:17,189
when you just look at hundreds of words

2666
02:49:13,049 --> 02:49:20,609
in code it's easy to accidentally forget

2667
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:22,319
which one of those real-world things

2668
02:49:20,610 --> 02:49:24,300
you're talking about is mapped to the

2669
02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:25,920
word because there none of them are

2670
02:49:24,299 --> 02:49:28,439
words you would ever use in daily use

2671
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:32,309
you would never talk about the cylinder

2672
02:49:28,440 --> 02:49:33,899
that way you just Intuit what it is and

2673
02:49:32,309 --> 02:49:36,239
you point to it or you do things like

2674
02:49:33,899 --> 02:49:38,279
that right and very rarely do you have

2675
02:49:36,239 --> 02:49:41,010
to come up with words that specifically

2676
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:44,239
locate anything on here other than like

2677
02:49:41,010 --> 02:49:47,101
top bottom or something right

2678
02:49:44,239 --> 02:49:48,751
and so that's just a fundamental problem

2679
02:49:47,101 --> 02:49:51,931
with the way we do programming and

2680
02:49:48,751 --> 02:49:55,621
people don't appreciate it we've known

2681
02:49:51,931 --> 02:49:58,110
it for a long long time and just nobody

2682
02:49:55,620 --> 02:49:59,909
bothers to fix it right so people spend

2683
02:49:58,110 --> 02:50:02,730
all their time doing stupid stuff like

2684
02:49:59,909 --> 02:50:06,841
arguing over ridiculous things in the

2685
02:50:02,729 --> 02:50:09,149
C++ standard if they just deleted 90% of

2686
02:50:06,841 --> 02:50:12,381
the C++ standard and it says put all of

2687
02:50:09,149 --> 02:50:14,220
that effort into specking some visual

2688
02:50:12,380 --> 02:50:17,010
representation thing you could do with

2689
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:19,350
your programming it would have paid back

2690
02:50:17,011 --> 02:50:20,791
thousands of times versus anything

2691
02:50:19,351 --> 02:50:22,141
they've ever done in the language right

2692
02:50:20,790 --> 02:50:23,850
and that's just because they

2693
02:50:22,140 --> 02:50:25,261
fundamentally don't understand that the

2694
02:50:23,851 --> 02:50:28,980
hard parts of programming aren't the

2695
02:50:25,261 --> 02:50:31,351
things that they're looking at right of

2696
02:50:28,979 --> 02:50:32,909
all the time they've spent looking at

2697
02:50:31,351 --> 02:50:35,131
things like pointer lifetimes and stuff

2698
02:50:32,909 --> 02:50:37,319
like that which are so simple and never

2699
02:50:35,130 --> 02:50:41,399
really cause problems and are just

2700
02:50:37,319 --> 02:50:43,831
uninteresting this is the stuff that's

2701
02:50:41,399 --> 02:50:46,470
actually hard right this is stuff it's

2702
02:50:43,831 --> 02:50:48,149
hard for good programmers anyway maybe

2703
02:50:46,470 --> 02:50:49,831
they'd like to spend their time focusing

2704
02:50:48,149 --> 02:50:53,819
on stuff that's hard for bad programmers

2705
02:50:49,831 --> 02:50:55,440
I don't know right but if you actually

2706
02:50:53,819 --> 02:50:57,931
want to talk about what's hard for

2707
02:50:55,440 --> 02:50:59,791
everybody that it's just tends to be

2708
02:50:57,931 --> 02:51:02,131
difficult it's things with lots of

2709
02:50:59,790 --> 02:51:04,529
indices lots of names lots of different

2710
02:51:02,130 --> 02:51:05,850
parts many dimensions all these sorts of

2711
02:51:04,530 --> 02:51:09,480
things they're just really difficult to

2712
02:51:05,851 --> 02:51:11,280
program because you just have all of

2713
02:51:09,479 --> 02:51:12,899
this mapping you're costly doing in your

2714
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:15,421
head if you ever do one of those

2715
02:51:12,899 --> 02:51:17,431
mappings in your head wrong you've got a

2716
02:51:15,421 --> 02:51:20,610
bug right hopefully it's a bug that

2717
02:51:17,431 --> 02:51:23,211
shows up but you know if you're unlucky

2718
02:51:20,610 --> 02:51:23,211
it's not

2719
02:51:28,200 --> 02:51:32,710
do you feel it'd be worth to abstract

2720
02:51:30,398 --> 02:51:37,389
away subsystems input audio life psycho

2721
02:51:32,709 --> 02:51:40,569
with an event system well I mean I guess

2722
02:51:37,389 --> 02:51:44,108
I would sort of answer the question with

2723
02:51:40,569 --> 02:51:47,648
a question which is what do you think

2724
02:51:44,109 --> 02:51:49,809
the bonus of that abstraction why why

2725
02:51:47,648 --> 02:51:51,489
would you add events to them like is

2726
02:51:49,809 --> 02:51:59,319
there something in particular you think

2727
02:51:51,489 --> 02:52:02,170
you want to achieve can we try all the

2728
02:51:59,319 --> 02:52:04,270
rooms now uh no because they can't

2729
02:52:02,170 --> 02:52:06,819
possibly be set it's our thing isn't

2730
02:52:04,270 --> 02:52:10,329
satisfied isn't smart enough yet to be

2731
02:52:06,819 --> 02:52:11,978
able to satisfy them right and it will

2732
02:52:10,329 --> 02:52:16,200
just place rooms on top of each other

2733
02:52:11,978 --> 02:52:18,608
which will create a huge disaster right

2734
02:52:16,200 --> 02:52:21,060
so if you come in here and actually do

2735
02:52:18,609 --> 02:52:23,350
this you're in trouble right we've got

2736
02:52:21,059 --> 02:52:27,519
it first of all it should just assert

2737
02:52:23,350 --> 02:52:29,890
that it can't satisfy once it gets to a

2738
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:31,899
point where it needs to connect to rooms

2739
02:52:29,889 --> 02:52:34,599
and it can't connect them it's just

2740
02:52:31,898 --> 02:52:36,969
gonna fail right I don't know how many

2741
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:43,600
rooms had actually got to so I guess we

2742
02:52:36,969 --> 02:52:45,670
can sort of make that happen here but at

2743
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:47,590
some point right it's gonna it's gonna

2744
02:52:45,670 --> 02:52:51,359
hit that limit so you know I don't know

2745
02:52:47,590 --> 02:52:51,359
what it did it laid out some rooms here

2746
02:52:52,739 --> 02:52:59,228
and and hey they were placed and

2747
02:52:56,559 --> 02:53:04,739
connected properly so that's good but

2748
02:52:59,228 --> 02:53:08,789
again it can't that's weird

2749
02:53:04,739 --> 02:53:08,789
we have too many light points

2750
02:53:10,319 --> 02:53:16,590
hmm we must this must be like a very big

2751
02:53:13,290 --> 02:53:19,050
room or something you get that or

2752
02:53:16,590 --> 02:53:22,430
there's something bugging there let me

2753
02:53:19,049 --> 02:53:22,429
actually also take a look at this here

2754
02:53:26,909 --> 02:53:32,250
but anyway eventually it can't it

2755
02:53:29,521 --> 02:53:34,200
shouldn't be able to place some rooms

2756
02:53:32,250 --> 02:53:37,440
right so you can see exactly what it's

2757
02:53:34,200 --> 02:53:40,890
doing it's always just going ahead and

2758
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:42,659
using the first direction it finds its

2759
02:53:40,889 --> 02:53:44,459
placing placing placing placing

2760
02:53:42,659 --> 02:53:45,719
eventually it has to place a room which

2761
02:53:44,459 --> 02:53:50,549
connects back to one of these other

2762
02:53:45,719 --> 02:53:52,799
rooms and it can't do it right and so

2763
02:53:50,549 --> 02:53:54,899
it's just like fails what it needs to do

2764
02:53:52,799 --> 02:53:57,420
is actually be smarter right and either

2765
02:53:54,899 --> 02:53:59,279
try other permutations or have a

2766
02:53:57,420 --> 02:54:01,079
strategy for actually achieving that

2767
02:53:59,280 --> 02:54:05,640
otherwise it's just always gonna connect

2768
02:54:01,079 --> 02:54:08,430
them this way ad infinitum right so it's

2769
02:54:05,639 --> 02:54:12,270
not really a it's not really at the

2770
02:54:08,430 --> 02:54:14,489
point yet where we can try to create the

2771
02:54:12,271 --> 02:54:15,690
world the way we actually want to and

2772
02:54:14,489 --> 02:54:16,949
probably won't be for a little while

2773
02:54:15,690 --> 02:54:19,829
right because we're still just getting

2774
02:54:16,950 --> 02:54:21,420
into the generative part of it so two

2775
02:54:19,829 --> 02:54:22,950
rooms connected each others all we can

2776
02:54:21,420 --> 02:54:25,319
really do at this point in terms of what

2777
02:54:22,950 --> 02:54:28,620
the algorithms written for it's just the

2778
02:54:25,319 --> 02:54:31,190
basics of that and then we have to kind

2779
02:54:28,620 --> 02:54:31,190
of go from there

2780
02:54:36,850 --> 02:54:40,068
Jim zero have you ever made a

2781
02:54:38,779 --> 02:54:41,359
visualisation tool for working stuff

2782
02:54:40,068 --> 02:54:42,590
like this out I'm thinking of something

2783
02:54:41,359 --> 02:54:43,880
like live could end in combined with

2784
02:54:42,590 --> 02:54:45,199
showing values on screen and lurking

2785
02:54:43,879 --> 02:54:46,608
between previous values and new values

2786
02:54:45,199 --> 02:54:50,540
showing how the changes affect the seam

2787
02:54:46,609 --> 02:54:52,040
of the code reloads I yeah I would just

2788
02:54:50,540 --> 02:54:53,449
like that to be part of the programming

2789
02:54:52,040 --> 02:54:57,199
language though or part of the debugger

2790
02:54:53,449 --> 02:55:00,909
right I can only dream of that you know

2791
02:54:57,199 --> 02:55:00,909
I have never had time to make one myself

2792
02:55:02,228 --> 02:55:06,500
after all of this code on rendering in

2793
02:55:04,909 --> 02:55:12,350
this is code reloading still working

2794
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:14,568
yeah sure it depends which code you want

2795
02:55:12,350 --> 02:55:16,960
to reload cuz the room the stuff that

2796
02:55:14,568 --> 02:55:20,478
generates the world doesn't get run

2797
02:55:16,959 --> 02:55:22,339
again so you can't change that code I

2798
02:55:20,478 --> 02:55:24,769
mean you can change it but it won't do

2799
02:55:22,340 --> 02:55:25,579
anything but the other code you can

2800
02:55:24,770 --> 02:55:27,140
change just fine

2801
02:55:25,579 --> 02:55:28,609
so you know for example if you just

2802
02:55:27,139 --> 02:55:33,109
didn't want the lighting to run or

2803
02:55:28,609 --> 02:55:35,350
something like that you could just say

2804
02:55:33,110 --> 02:55:38,649
[Music]

2805
02:55:35,350 --> 02:55:38,649
let's see

2806
02:55:41,851 --> 02:55:47,650
right here inside lighting test I could

2807
02:55:44,351 --> 02:55:50,290
just return right so here's the lighting

2808
02:55:47,649 --> 02:55:51,279
running and I can recompile and then

2809
02:55:50,290 --> 02:56:02,080
when it's finished

2810
02:55:51,280 --> 02:56:04,271
syntax error when it's finished how do I

2811
02:56:02,079 --> 02:56:07,709
convince you to compile I if the

2812
02:56:04,271 --> 02:56:10,630
compiler ever would produce an actual

2813
02:56:07,709 --> 02:56:13,329
result there we go

2814
02:56:10,629 --> 02:56:15,310
then now we're just not outputting any

2815
02:56:13,329 --> 02:56:18,640
lighting at all right and there's just

2816
02:56:15,310 --> 02:56:23,289
garbage getting out getting output to

2817
02:56:18,640 --> 02:56:28,149
the textures and then if I recompile it

2818
02:56:23,290 --> 02:56:30,601
right we're back so code reloading still

2819
02:56:28,149 --> 02:56:30,600
works just fine

2820
02:56:57,300 --> 02:57:04,430
garbage your awesomeness dead lucky are

2821
02:57:00,540 --> 02:57:04,431
you doing custom memory management yes

2822
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:09,680
we do we do do custom memory management

2823
02:57:11,659 --> 02:57:21,261
in fact you will note that in the actual

2824
02:57:17,851 --> 02:57:23,700
code there are no calls to malloc or new

2825
02:57:21,261 --> 02:57:26,970
there's only some in the like

2826
02:57:23,700 --> 02:57:29,091
preprocessor so nothing with a handmaid

2827
02:57:26,970 --> 02:57:35,460
underscore in front of it is in there

2828
02:57:29,091 --> 02:57:37,229
right and we have two modes one of which

2829
02:57:35,460 --> 02:57:40,020
grows on demand that's the mode we're

2830
02:57:37,229 --> 02:57:42,421
using right now so it actually can't run

2831
02:57:40,021 --> 02:57:45,360
out of memory unless the system runs out

2832
02:57:42,421 --> 02:57:46,620
of memory there's another way we can run

2833
02:57:45,360 --> 02:57:49,829
it and we're not really doing that right

2834
02:57:46,620 --> 02:57:51,990
now which is where you fix it's a fixed

2835
02:57:49,829 --> 02:57:55,950
size and if you over flat fixed size it

2836
02:57:51,989 --> 02:57:57,751
stops and that did you know we haven't

2837
02:57:55,950 --> 02:58:01,221
really done much with that in a long

2838
02:57:57,751 --> 02:58:01,220
time just kind of is that way

2839
02:58:08,810 --> 02:58:12,869
so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it up

2840
02:58:10,860 --> 02:58:13,980
