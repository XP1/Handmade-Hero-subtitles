00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,028
all right hello everyone welcome to

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,680
handmade Hiro I am back for a second

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:10,500
stream today we're not really doing

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,769
handmade Hiro what we're doing is

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,120
working on the editor code again I'm

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,379
kind of streaming today just because I

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:23,640
thought it would keep my mind off the

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:27,769
fact I'm not letting any food and in 74

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,560
minutes I will have to start drinking

10
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:35,219
gavel ight see now for those of you who

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:39,210
don't know what gavel it--see is it's

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:42,289
not a planet it's basically just like

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:48,179
the medical version of a colon cleanse

14
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:50,960
so this is what it is I have no idea

15
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:55,170
what polyethylene glycol actually does

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,049
however the end effect of drinking a

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,109
bunch of gavel it--see over the course

18
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:03,569
of two hours is that you basically empty

19
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,400
out your entire colon which of course is

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,060
necessary for a colonoscopy

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,618
fun times from what I understand I've

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,109
never had a colonoscopy before this is

23
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:16,890
my first time from what I understand

24
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:19,438
apparently the act of drinking gavel

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,109
it--see in the amount that you have to

26
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:26,069
drink it which is a cup every 15 minutes

27
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:29,299
for two hours so basically eight ounces

28
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:35,069
every 15 minutes

29
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:36,868
apparently that activity is actually the

30
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:40,739
worst part people say that just having

31
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:43,618
to drink 8 ounces of this thing every 15

32
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,879
minutes is very unpleasant and I guess

33
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:50,129
it probably varies from person to person

34
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:52,618
the best they say the actual act of just

35
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:55,019
pooping continuously for a while after

36
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:58,170
it starts to work is apparently not that

37
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:01,259
bad they say the actual act of emptying

38
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,750
the colon like a colon cleanse is really

39
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,640
not that that bad it's it's not like

40
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,098
painful or annoying or anything like

41
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,789
that but the act of drinking the stuff

42
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,409
supposedly is so we're gonna find out

43
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,109
because

44
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:20,129
I'll actually stream it I'll go grab the

45
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:26,100
first two doses right eight ounces

46
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:26,609
mmm 15 minutes eight ounces I'll just

47
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,469
drink it

48
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,270
we'll see how bad it is and then you'll

49
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:35,009
know and off we go

50
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,540
so we still have 71 minutes of

51
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:41,849
programming to do before that kind of

52
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:42,599
excitement keeps in right so let's go

53
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,219
ahead and do it

54
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,229
and again remember I've had no food

55
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,240
today so I apologize if the programming

56
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:49,829
is a little slower than normal we're not

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,540
doing handmade here oh these are not for

58
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,700
posterity so I feel like it's okay

59
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:58,409
because we're just we're just doing for

60
00:02:53,699 --> 00:03:00,449
a coder upgrades right and that's all so

61
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,520
where we left off was pretty cool we had

62
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:04,199
just implemented the first step of the f

63
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,990
pins which I was talking about before

64
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,789
it's just kind of a little experiment

65
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:13,020
I'm doing to see if I can't improve some

66
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:14,609
of the editor flow from like even the

67
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,700
old days like I said for coders pretty

68
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,530
much caught up with Emacs for me now in

69
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,659
any way that matters for the most part

70
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,640
and so I'm kind of looking at ways of

71
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:28,079
pushing it beyond what I had you know

72
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:31,889
because Emacs is certainly not all that

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,110
I could imagine in terms of editing so

74
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,269
what I did is I made it so that we could

75
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,640
have these sort of bins here and then

76
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,430
you know if I was in something like

77
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,439
handmade Ray and I did a search for

78
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,650
something we made it so that now those

79
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,659
bins remember what's going on so if I

80
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,370
have different searches I can like

81
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,819
ping-pong back and forth between them

82
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,709
and then kind of like jump around right

83
00:03:52,819 --> 00:04:00,000
and that's really awesome because that

84
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:02,580
allows me to operate on sort of multiple

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,409
levels at once if I'm trying to do a

86
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,670
search and I'm trying to do a compile

87
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,590
and I want to jump around between

88
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,929
locations on the search and error

89
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,520
messages all that stuff will just work

90
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,439
now right because when I go to compile

91
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,060
it'll compile here and so I can keep

92
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,069
those things in bins and just switch

93
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,600
back and forth between them which is

94
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:22,949
great however in order to get the bins

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,160
to a place where I feel like they're

96
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,209
really effective and interesting there's

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,580
a bunch of things that we're

98
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:31,318
I have to do and so we need to start

99
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,810
kind of working towards that now we've

100
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,060
got the basic idea working and we need

101
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,160
to sort of expand it and so there's two

102
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,470
things I want to do first let's just fix

103
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,169
the drawing a little bit so it works I

104
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,449
don't know how I'm really gonna get for

105
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:48,149
coder to understand that it should

106
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,030
scroll one extra line and eventually

107
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:53,728
probably more than one extra line up to

108
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:56,250
support these mixed bins so to a certain

109
00:04:53,728 --> 00:05:00,089
extent we kind of have a little bit of

110
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:03,209
an issue there and I again don't really

111
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:05,879
know how I'm going to address it we're

112
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:07,829
gonna try to figure out some way to

113
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,719
address it but I don't guarantee that we

114
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:12,359
necessarily can we may have to edit the

115
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,099
core for that but we'll certainly try

116
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,620
not to touch the core if we can avoid it

117
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:18,629
you know don't touch the core the other

118
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,490
thing that I would have preferred and I

119
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:24,689
don't know if this is possible but I

120
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,699
probably would say that we can implement

121
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:29,579
our own buffer switcher now that just

122
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,348
wouldn't list f bar buffers so we

123
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,240
probably want to do that eventually too

124
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:34,139
because I really don't want these fyr

125
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,060
buffers in here

126
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,918
you're never meant to switch to them in

127
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,720
this way if we were going to support

128
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,008
switching to an f bar buffer what I

129
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,469
would do is just have it so that you

130
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:44,669
pick the active f bar buffer here and

131
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,740
then just have a command that's like

132
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:49,439
switch to that would bring it up into

133
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,468
your main window so we'd probably also

134
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,538
like to eliminate f bar buffer listing I

135
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:56,598
think that's probably possible now

136
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:58,978
because since we can list buffers

137
00:05:56,598 --> 00:06:00,360
ourselves using our own jump Lister it's

138
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,158
probably possible for us to do that

139
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,759
maybe we should just tackle that right

140
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:07,439
off the bat since I think that we can so

141
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,870
let me go ahead and jump back to our

142
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,120
actual stable for coder here that we're

143
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,069
actually using for editing so if you

144
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,408
look at how we're pulling up that jump

145
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:19,319
Lister in the first place that's doing

146
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:23,339
the listing for buffers that's assigned

147
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:26,250
right now when I when I do my switching

148
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:28,049
to modal B so basically if you have the

149
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,968
modal switch on it hit B and that's

150
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,650
going to interactive switch buffer now

151
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:34,860
interactive switch buffer is not

152
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:39,198
something that I implemented it's it's

153
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,199
actually let's see here

154
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:47,500
it's actually defined in for coder lists

155
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,090
and you can see what it does here is it

156
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,810
it's actually calling this begin

157
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:56,138
integrated Lister buffer list and that's

158
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:58,030
that's what's doing the actual work now

159
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,129
if I go ahead and clip that out because

160
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:02,918
I think I'm gonna maybe try to override

161
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,330
it we'll see if I can or if I can't we

162
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:05,978
know that that's what's normally

163
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:08,938
happening in here and so let's go in and

164
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:15,728
take a look at begin integrated Lister

165
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:18,099
buffer list it's a year there we go

166
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:21,818
so in here where we're looking at this

167
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:27,069
you can kind of see it's got kind of

168
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:29,468
another yet another line of sort of

169
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:31,120
another peel of the onion there where

170
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:35,098
I'm going to say alright let's begin the

171
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,500
the list that actually calls out to this

172
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:40,028
which gets these handlers here that are

173
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,060
going to be used for the buffer Lister

174
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:44,740
and it's called it calls into a generic

175
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,168
function at that point

176
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,750
this handlers dot refresh which is

177
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:51,878
generate all buffers list that really

178
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,408
looks like the money right there that

179
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,870
looks like what we're actually looking

180
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:59,519
for so if I come up here and take a look

181
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,168
at what this does you can see this thing

182
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,668
doing it's doing its thing here right

183
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:08,829
and inside here you can see that when it

184
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:10,628
when it loops over things it's just got

185
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:12,699
a certain way that it does does stuff

186
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:15,099
here's the part where it does the buffer

187
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:17,439
is starting with star bit there right so

188
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:19,088
first it adds all the ones that don't

189
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,028
have a star and then it adds the ones

190
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:23,709
that do have a star for our purposes

191
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:31,329
right we're probably going to start to

192
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:33,098
be a lot more like focused about how

193
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:34,028
we're dealing with buffers so I don't

194
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,209
really know that we're gonna have

195
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:40,299
buffers that have a star anymore that

196
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:42,819
concept may go away and we may just have

197
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:45,669
F bin buffers and non F bin buffers and

198
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:51,329
so what we really need to do here is we

199
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:53,439
really just need this part I think and

200
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:57,278
this part down here

201
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,800
just wouldn't be necessary I don't think

202
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:03,189
now the buffers that are opening views

203
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,620
part I guess what this is doing is it's

204
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,040
saying look for each of these things

205
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,470
here we're making a list of buffers that

206
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,870
are currently being viewed so we can

207
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,899
skip them when we build the list so that

208
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,370
they show up kind of at the end right

209
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,720
because you don't want to if you're

210
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,568
switching buffers you're not gonna

211
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,920
switch to a buffer you can already see

212
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:25,838
so we don't really need that and that's

213
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,338
why that's happening and then it's

214
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,569
getting appended kind of at the end

215
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,300
right

216
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:33,778
so really it's that buffer starting with

217
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:38,708
star part this is the part that we would

218
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:40,838
need to fix and I kind of wonder if

219
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:45,818
maybe this itself shouldn't kind of take

220
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:47,500
that as a kind of parameter now it can't

221
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:50,708
really take it as a parameter directly

222
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,559
because it's a list or call back and

223
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:55,119
this is the refresh right of that Lister

224
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,000
that says you know generate all the

225
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,818
buffers so we'd need to be parameter of

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,669
the actual Lister's the user data here

227
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:05,078
that you can see is being passed through

228
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:07,419
and it's being passed through as a zero

229
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:10,870
so there is no user data currently being

230
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:14,110
provided to this particular refresh

231
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,209
handler so it would have been free to

232
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:19,600
have there be some user data that had

233
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:22,059
parameters that discussed and generated

234
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,620
all buffers how these things were to be

235
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:28,629
filtered and so my first inclination is

236
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,278
really maybe this generate all buffers

237
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:33,338
list should be looking at the list or

238
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,659
user data and maybe it should be using

239
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:35,829
that to determine what it should be

240
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:39,850
doing in here

241
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:41,708
but to be fair I don't actually know to

242
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,920
what extent that actually needs to

243
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:48,008
happen for us because if we chose to

244
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,568
only eliminate F bin buffers that means

245
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:51,550
we would be specifically scanning for

246
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:53,318
start F bin not just our buffers and

247
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:55,088
we'd still list the other star buffers

248
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:56,769
so I'm a little bit torn as to whether

249
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:59,639
this really does what we need to do or

250
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:01,688
whether it doesn't I don't really know I

251
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,948
think I'm going to take the safe course

252
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:04,448
now because it seems like maybe

253
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:07,088
something that we're going to want to do

254
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:09,099
a little bit more

255
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,019
cific work on so I'm gonna go ahead and

256
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,800
pull that out in here and call this KC

257
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,850
generate buffers list and then what

258
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,588
we're gonna do is we're just gonna take

259
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,389
a look and see what this is doing and

260
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,879
simplify it down to just the things that

261
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:23,649
I actually want to have happen now you

262
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:32,709
can see the first Allen's doing here is

263
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:35,740
preparing some space I guess I don't

264
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:37,989
really understand why he does memory the

265
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,240
way that he does it in this it's not the

266
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,769
way I would have chosen to do it I would

267
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,289
just had a global arena here and you

268
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,879
just kind of push things on as you go he

269
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:47,528
does a little bit of a pre pass it looks

270
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,409
like he really wants to know how much

271
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:52,838
memory is gonna be used beforehand this

272
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:55,088
piece of code happens to be shareable in

273
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,529
either case because this is the maximum

274
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:00,069
amount of memory that you would need to

275
00:11:56,528 --> 00:12:02,019
use for buffer names and so I'm gonna go

276
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:03,370
ahead and propose here that really that

277
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,828
should be pulled out into a separate

278
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:11,678
function which is essentially like get

279
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:15,338
max buffered name storage right and that

280
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:19,509
here would be providing back to you just

281
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:21,399
this operation right here and I don't

282
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:24,490
know if buffer count still needs to be

283
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:29,278
done here I assume that it does it

284
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:33,419
doesn't so I guess that actually that's

285
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:35,948
kind of I guess it's not the surprising

286
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,870
so this piece of code right here I'm

287
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:40,149
gonna argue should really be pulled out

288
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,980
as a separate thing which is going to

289
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:44,698
return that memory size to you so you

290
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,188
would just pass it one of these right

291
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:51,370
and this would get back that max buffer

292
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:52,928
name storage for you now one of the

293
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,938
other things that it's doing here is

294
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:56,860
adding in the buffer count times the

295
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:59,349
size of the list or node part we don't

296
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,678
really want that part so I'm gonna claim

297
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,540
that that part is sort of the same in

298
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:07,360
either case right so that's gonna happen

299
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:09,879
outside here as well right or something

300
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,079
like this in fact I guess I'll do it in

301
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,600
this code down here and then we'll deal

302
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:15,219
with it after so if we do get back to

303
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,250
max buffer name storage that we'll just

304
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,350
take a look at all of the buffers here

305
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,950
and add them together so it's really

306
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,230
just this

307
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:28,570
and then this part I guess maybe we'll

308
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:31,300
say is retained right so we'll do this

309
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,850
is I guess what I'm saying we'll add to

310
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:35,409
it get max but for names the original

311
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,959
pass the app there and so this is

312
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:39,278
actually the preamble that allows to do

313
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,078
that now we don't actually need this

314
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,448
because the get buffer count is never

315
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:45,338
used again so if we want to we can

316
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:48,099
actually just say that can be placed

317
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:50,019
here and then similarly the memory size

318
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,540
itself is really now just a two-term

319
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:54,879
thing so why not just make that be

320
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:57,429
something that looks like this and off

321
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,039
we go so you can see it happen

322
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:06,359
here I don't know what the plus three is

323
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:06,360
I that's some magic that Allen must know

324
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:18,670
does anyone have any idea what the plus

325
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:20,139
three is yeah I got I got nothing

326
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:23,110
because we're only adding as many

327
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:24,009
buffers as there actually are I would

328
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,829
assume

329
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:29,559
and so I don't know what the plus three

330
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:38,439
is someone should probably explain that

331
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:40,778
to me at some point but anyway so again

332
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,880
I'm just trying to do some compression

333
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:44,679
oriented programming here and say look I

334
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,078
know what needs to happen here

335
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,629
I have Allen's code I don't necessarily

336
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:52,299
know exactly why he's doing everything

337
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:55,179
but I can see what he's doing and so I'm

338
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:57,009
just gonna preserve what he's doing but

339
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:59,439
pull it out into some functions that

340
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:02,500
make it easy for me to reuse just that

341
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,420
part so when I replace the part that he

342
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,679
wrote with something that I wrote that

343
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:08,139
does something a little bit differently

344
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,909
we're still calling the same shared code

345
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:12,759
here and then I can send this back and

346
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,620
say hey do you want to mainline these

347
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,299
changes and hopefully he says yes and he

348
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,120
says no we just pull them out into our

349
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:20,289
own code and live with it so either way

350
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,060
it's really not a big deal

351
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:23,679
but especially when I see mystery

352
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:25,208
constants like this plus three showing

353
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,769
up in here I don't know if that's

354
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,539
actually valid or if that should be in

355
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:32,110
there what's going on I have literally

356
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:34,149
no idea what's happening there but since

357
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,919
that is happening there

358
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:39,100
like hey we want the Lister node plus

359
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:41,679
three bytes I mean I have literally no

360
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,290
idea what that could be for and since I

361
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:47,379
have no idea what that could be for it

362
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:48,969
makes me want to make sure that's pulled

363
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,549
out because in case that's something

364
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:54,250
that's actually really important I need

365
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:56,500
to make sure that everyone who's gonna

366
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,139
be doing weird stuff here knows about

367
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,340
that and calls it right so it's just one

368
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:01,840
of those things that's like kind of

369
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,280
mildly terrifying and if you have

370
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,870
something mildly terrifying you want to

371
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,610
make sure that everyone is doing the

372
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,320
mildly terrifying thing the same way

373
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:12,159
that's usually the way I look at it

374
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,900
right um so we're gonna do get max

375
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,879
lister buffer storage there we're past

376
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:18,309
that in that's the new memory size part

377
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:20,379
there so there we go we've got the new

378
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:22,839
item set thing here and we've got this

379
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:25,539
sort of code that Alan was doing here

380
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:30,430
and so what we need now is we just need

381
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:32,529
a way to that you can see here he's

382
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:34,899
building like I said an array of what

383
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,179
buffers are being viewed I don't know if

384
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:40,720
that's actually necessary because I is

385
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:44,319
it really that hard like the views

386
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,720
themselves or er that thing so it seems

387
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,220
like you could do that just by asking

388
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:55,440
what views are viewing the buffer so I'm

389
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:57,370
not really sure that that's necessary

390
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,310
but again I don't really have touched

391
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:06,730
this code so I'm gonna say what if we

392
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:10,599
just did that and that and then out in

393
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:13,120
here again this stuff is stuff we kind

394
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:16,299
of need to pull back up into this part

395
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:19,149
of the code here as we kind of work it

396
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:22,509
in to something smoother when I generate

397
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,519
this buffer list I'm gonna see if

398
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,259
there's a way to do this a little bit

399
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:29,559
more direct way

400
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:31,900
so looping over the views that are

401
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,269
available or that are visible at the

402
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,269
moment feels like it shouldn't be too

403
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:40,720
hard to do there's only two views that

404
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:42,069
exist in my for coder world so to some

405
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,650
extent it shouldn't be very difficult

406
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:47,470
for me to find out what those actually

407
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,720
are and so if you look here

408
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:54,220
this is the code that actually does that

409
00:17:49,720 --> 00:18:00,339
and so if I am just going to look at

410
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:03,519
views that are that are not the F in bar

411
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:06,839
I don't know why I would need to build a

412
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:09,878
separate array that doesn't really seem

413
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,349
necessary unless that get view next call

414
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:16,119
is really expensive and we'll see if it

415
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:18,819
is so I'm gonna go ahead and open the

416
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:30,729
next tonic water here it's important to

417
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:32,349
remain hydrated kids alright so I'm

418
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,819
gonna see if that's really necessary

419
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:40,148
let's take a look like what does get

420
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:41,918
view first actually do I mean I guess

421
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:44,798
the problem I guess the problem is this

422
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,409
the problem is this fill view summary

423
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,569
right because we don't really want that

424
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:51,278
like what we want this is the whole

425
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:54,878
entirety of the code we want we just

426
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:58,720
want this panel because all we need is

427
00:18:54,878 --> 00:19:00,819
the buffer ID that comes from that panel

428
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,159
view and presumably the panel view

429
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:05,048
itself would do it so really you know I

430
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,610
might say that this is probably one of

431
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:08,349
those things where the API gets in its

432
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:10,388
own way a little bit these view

433
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:12,308
summaries are like really overblown for

434
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:14,138
what we need but a lot of things just

435
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:16,089
have to go through them so I can

436
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:18,069
understand why this is happening the way

437
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:21,490
that it's happening it's not but it's

438
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:23,079
really not what we would want because it

439
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:28,960
feels like you really shouldn't need it

440
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:33,788
you know I mean but we'll keep it for

441
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:36,669
now so this is all the same stuff I

442
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:39,339
don't know why this skip thing is

443
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:40,690
happening so basically like you're

444
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:44,798
coming in here and we're saying if it's

445
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:46,960
already there we skip out but why

446
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:51,278
wouldn't you just do the opposite thing

447
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,470
so again I'm looping through all of the

448
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:56,528
views here right so I say here's the

449
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,970
buffer that I'm looking at it wants to

450
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,859
do it's sort of doing the little N

451
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,420
squared let me not insert something that

452
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:03,189
I haven't already inserted right

453
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,289
as we assume that we want this to go

454
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,850
faster and we don't care if this is

455
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,879
slower right we're sort of making a

456
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:13,059
decision between those two and so when I

457
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:16,000
loop over those here and I look at this

458
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:20,799
thing this tells me whether or not I

459
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,779
need to insert it or not right and so my

460
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,230
first thought is like can we just not

461
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:28,509
care about that because I know I only

462
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,269
ever have three views so I feel like

463
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:34,200
this is probably just better because

464
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:36,759
most of the time it would be fine right

465
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,420
and so I think I'd probably just leave

466
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:42,730
it at that and not really care at the

467
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,890
moment right that seems just more

468
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,289
concise for me and I know I don't care

469
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,850
then when we go down here and we loop

470
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,759
over these buffers we're saying do any

471
00:20:48,849 --> 00:21:01,509
of them exist in this thing

472
00:20:50,759 --> 00:21:05,170
now why don't you think about this you

473
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:13,690
know if we just had some way of tagging

474
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:16,440
buffers here's a question for you so

475
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,799
let's say we look at this buffer summary

476
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,799
what's in there

477
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,640
so if you were to look at this stuff

478
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:43,919
you know I would almost say that because

479
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:45,599
this is a fairly important thing it

480
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,500
feels like you should be able to say for

481
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,429
a buffer

482
00:21:46,500 --> 00:22:14,700
give me the view that has this buffer

483
00:21:50,430 --> 00:22:16,640
like you know I just feel like there

484
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,740
should be a way to quickly get from a

485
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,230
buffer to a view of the buffer if there

486
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,779
is one right like that's something that

487
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:27,900
I would just track

488
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:27,899
[Music]

489
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:35,539
[Music]

490
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:50,819
oh no care about the gem plasterer

491
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:53,419
jumping let's see sorry get few yeah it

492
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:56,729
doesn't really seem to have that

493
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,729
[Music]

494
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:17,039
so there really is no way to get from a

495
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:19,199
view from a buffer to the view but I do

496
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,369
feel like that should be a thing like it

497
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,529
seems like that would be better than

498
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:24,079
doing it this way and it's the kind of

499
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:32,220
thing that people generally need to know

500
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:35,399
you know what I mean so I don't know

501
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,400
[Music]

502
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,259
so in here yeah we can do our filtering

503
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,640
we're gonna probably do exactly this

504
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:45,720
filtering and I think we're just going

505
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:48,450
to get rid of this and then the buffers

506
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,380
that are opening views part will just be

507
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:54,930
the same as it was before so you know

508
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,440
get those buffers so I guess the problem

509
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:00,810
here is so so this is why we would need

510
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,029
since we're using this right here this

511
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,649
is why we need to dedupe these so I

512
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:16,589
guess we can't really get away from D

513
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:18,570
duping them oh well I don't know that I

514
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:22,230
want to do this skipping around part of

515
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:23,789
that so I might just say that we do the

516
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:30,870
same thing we were doing here where we

517
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:38,420
do like you know this sort of thing grab

518
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:42,989
the view buffer ID if they're equivalent

519
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:44,100
and then we break out and there's a

520
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,039
couple different ways that I can

521
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:54,199
structure this probably if I want to

522
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:54,200
write I can probably just do this

523
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:20,889
and then I can just say look that's what

524
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:24,460
we're doing right so basically like grab

525
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:27,970
me the view buffer ID let's go through

526
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:31,509
all the ones we have so far and you know

527
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:36,460
if this thing matches the buffer ID that

528
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:39,460
we've got up here then don't store it

529
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:44,890
you know oh I want the opposite of that

530
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:47,590
so yeah and because this code is gonna

531
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,360
be the same pretty much every time I

532
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:54,609
kind of feel like maybe I'll just pull

533
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:58,779
it out here as well so actually am I on

534
00:25:54,609 --> 00:26:01,029
the right place here I'm not I was

535
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:05,039
accidentally modifying Alan's actual

536
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:05,039
code which is not what I wanted to do

537
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:12,029
it's a problem with doing the branching

538
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,029
sorry about that

539
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:31,700
put that back all right so I'm gonna go

540
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,009
ahead and restore this code to what it

541
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:49,190
was before before I started mucking with

542
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:51,980
it all right so we this will remain the

543
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,450
same this happens we come down here and

544
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,099
we'll just take a look at this I think

545
00:26:53,450 --> 00:27:01,680
if there's any other way to make that

546
00:26:55,099 --> 00:27:04,818
easier I guess I could say actually

547
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,818
[Music]

548
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:16,970
probably just something like this right

549
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:23,060
where I just say look give me the count

550
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:27,140
and give me the array and then we'll

551
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:29,750
just do this one time that just seems a

552
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,520
little bit better to me because then we

553
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,470
don't have to keep doing it over and

554
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:42,019
over again so in here we'll just say

555
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:45,170
look here's here's the test IDE we will

556
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:46,119
do it as a for loop here and we'll loop

557
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,150
over

558
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:52,189
however meaning you told us there were

559
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:57,400
like so and then we'll just have a

560
00:27:52,190 --> 00:28:01,779
result and in here if we ever find that

561
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,780
we see the one that we were looking for

562
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:09,529
we'll set the result to true and then

563
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:11,809
when we return we can we can use this

564
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:14,509
idea exists in now - kind of like

565
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:17,149
simplify all this code so basically we

566
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:21,259
can just say look if the ID doesn't

567
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:27,130
exist in our currently viewed buffer

568
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:27,129
count buffer is currently being viewed

569
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:41,509
view buffer ID right so if that's the

570
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:45,290
case then add it and that's nice

571
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:48,470
and then down here we can just do the

572
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:53,420
opposite so now we can say look if the

573
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:57,620
ID doesn't exist in this thing and some

574
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:59,450
other crap happens to be true like so on

575
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:02,000
so you can kind of see it all there

576
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,250
right you can get rid of the skips they

577
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
don't have to be there and then we're

578
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:11,599
just looking at the buffer buffer ID

579
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,869
like so and so that way this part here

580
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:17,929
where we're passing these guys down it's

581
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:24,139
a little verbose because you know see

582
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:27,289
doesn't have much support for like

583
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:29,750
closure style discussion of things but

584
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:32,000
that's fine so we could just say look if

585
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:36,880
this thing doesn't exist and these two

586
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,880
things are true off we go

587
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:45,699
and then finally at the end I think we

588
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,700
would say the same thing right

589
00:29:51,579 --> 00:30:00,429
I don't know why this wasn't doing this

590
00:29:54,309 --> 00:30:04,619
before that's a little confusing I feel

591
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,620
like you still want to check that

592
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,740
because I don't want to ever list those

593
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,190
even if they were being viewed in a view

594
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:18,849
I just don't want them so I think that's

595
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:20,140
actually not how that was supposed to go

596
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,369
I don't know maybe that's a bug in the

597
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,420
original or maybe that was intentional

598
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:28,989
not 100% sure but anyway now I think

599
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:32,100
that's more what we were looking at KCC

600
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:39,220
generate buffers list is now going to be

601
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:40,899
more of a command signified guess know

602
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,190
why I did this because I guess and I

603
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,420
think about it this kind of has to

604
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,769
happen like this

605
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,570
so I don't know why I merged those two

606
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:50,349
just wasn't thinking guess that haven't

607
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:53,079
eaten today so not great so do you mean

608
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:54,939
custom commands say now will Duke this

609
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:57,699
is interactive switch buffer this will

610
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,529
just be KC Interactive switch buffer and

611
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,029
so here we can do the same sort of stuff

612
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:02,740
we were doing before where we're gonna

613
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:04,149
do most of the other stuff and the

614
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,779
activates whichever part should probably

615
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:11,530
still be the same excuse me

616
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:14,500
the only difference here is that this

617
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:16,629
part here will is this code so we just

618
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,849
need to let kind of paste this down into

619
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:22,840
here where it belongs and eliminate this

620
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:25,029
part so there's the handlers getting

621
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:27,039
constructed here's like the user data

622
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:32,009
and target view nonsense right like this

623
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:35,980
stuff here that can just go away now and

624
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:39,099
now we have I think what we actually

625
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:42,220
need by default this will still call

626
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:44,289
Allen's Lister I'm gonna try that one

627
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:49,120
first just to make sure that it's that I

628
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:51,700
didn't totally destroy the world's but

629
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,099
then we'll keep going from there so

630
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,200
don't ask me why that's still in there

631
00:31:54,099 --> 00:32:00,069
it's not supposed to be that's supposed

632
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,900
to look like that and then we have to

633
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:12,839
actually return this course

634
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:18,060
so there we go okay that's good and I

635
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:20,579
want to test that doing the same jump as

636
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:24,269
before so if I come in here and hit B

637
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:25,649
right I should get totally wrong stuff

638
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,750
right like this is not what I want

639
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:30,180
listed but it should be exactly the same

640
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:35,269
as it was before I made these changes

641
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:35,269
and it does look like that's the same

642
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:56,149
sort of it does seem a little wonky I

643
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,519
don't know maybe not

644
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,980
anyway so I'm not sure if that's exactly

645
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,059
right I think it is

646
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:08,460
but anyway so if I now say that generate

647
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:12,569
all buffers list is like KC generate

648
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,890
buffers list instead so that basically

649
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:16,950
instead of calling this thing I'm

650
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:19,140
calling my version of that thing I'm

651
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,970
assuming that now I will have it so

652
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,680
that's not listing those buffers anymore

653
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,720
we don't have to worry about like

654
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,920
polluting that list with tons of f bar

655
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,980
nonsense right well that worked

656
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:36,870
phenomenally parentheses did not work at

657
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:43,440
all I don't know what I did wrong there

658
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:45,329
so KC generate buffers list Oh duh we

659
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:51,830
weren't calling it that was not a fair

660
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:51,829
test before oops let's try it again

661
00:33:53,329 --> 00:34:00,888
so let's switch to handmade hero I'll

662
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:02,899
switch buffers and we should see none we

663
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:03,378
should just see code and we do so that's

664
00:34:02,898 --> 00:34:06,229
good

665
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:07,998
yeah that's what I want similarly when I

666
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,918
first start up and I switch I should see

667
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:13,818
nothing just should be an empty buffer

668
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:17,259
list and it is okay so we've got that

669
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:21,588
out of the way now what we need to do is

670
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:24,440
in that bar at the bottom there we need

671
00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:36,318
to start making that bar actually you

672
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:38,599
know be some things that's we something

673
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:40,759
that we can use legitimately and it's

674
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,079
not gonna have like I have like trouble

675
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,490
seeing it and all that other sorts of

676
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:49,099
stuff so a couple things about that that

677
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:52,509
we need to address so first of all this

678
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:55,490
stuff this isn't working quite right and

679
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:59,359
the reason for that part is I kind of

680
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:02,409
want it to I wanted to go have a fixed

681
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:07,639
number of lines that would be visible

682
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:09,139
and it doesn't quite do that quite it

683
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,400
doesn't do that necessary correctly and

684
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:12,679
also then when you switch to this

685
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,539
version I want it to just be more

686
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:16,848
percentage based so it maybe takes two

687
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:18,980
thirds of the screen when you do this so

688
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:22,068
it's like four lines or two thirds of

689
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,510
the screen right and maybe it's not four

690
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:27,489
lines maybe it's actually five lines

691
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:31,520
will kind of see where we get to on that

692
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:36,409
so I'm not sure but you know four or

693
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:37,338
five lines probably five and so we need

694
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:40,429
to fix that

695
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:43,190
toggle as well now the way that toggle

696
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:47,568
is working is there's a function called

697
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:50,179
like set HUD line count and you call it

698
00:35:47,568 --> 00:35:53,358
with the number of lines that you want

699
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:55,338
the HUD to have the problem with that is

700
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,808
we want to set this in two different

701
00:35:55,338 --> 00:36:00,338
ways

702
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:06,769
so when we call set flood line count and

703
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:07,400
you can see if I do this where that's

704
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:10,480
being

705
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:14,990
so you can see it happening here and

706
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,789
here so what I want to be able to do

707
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:20,419
there is I want to be able to pass

708
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:24,230
something to this that will indicate

709
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,789
what it should do in both cases both the

710
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:28,099
case where I want to said to a number of

711
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:34,550
lines and the case where I want to sit

712
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:36,949
to a percentage my feeling on that so if

713
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:40,310
I look at global hood line count I'm

714
00:36:36,949 --> 00:36:45,679
probably just gonna cheese out and say

715
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:49,690
something like notes if default hull

716
00:36:45,679 --> 00:37:03,589
account is negative it's interpreted as

717
00:36:49,690 --> 00:37:08,389
a let's say over 64 because we're being

718
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:10,550
maximally cheesy right so what I'm

719
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:13,940
seeing curious look let's get default

720
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:15,680
hood line count to be something that we

721
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:19,460
can set it to a negative and then it'll

722
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:25,489
still do a percentage so that way we can

723
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:28,250
do defaults expanded hood line count I

724
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:32,359
can say if I do want to do something

725
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:41,989
like 3/4 of the display or 1/2 of this

726
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:45,650
way let's call it half for now and I can

727
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:49,929
even make that be a thing right so if we

728
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:53,559
now go to set HUD line counts and we

729
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:53,559
change how that like

730
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:57,980
since we're not using my cool search

731
00:37:56,269 --> 00:38:02,659
fins I've got to do this again

732
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:04,490
so in here we'll just say look if if

733
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:10,879
it's equal to that will pass the

734
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:13,429
expanded hood line count and that way we

735
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,500
don't really have to worry about it

736
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:17,359
so I think that would be okay and then

737
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,960
in here when we do this thing we'll say

738
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,780
all right assign it

739
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:33,699
you're out what's going on here and what

740
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:37,060
we'll say is what's the what's the count

741
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:40,929
set to in the case where the count is

742
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:44,500
greater than zero we'll set it this way

743
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:49,019
in the case where the count is less than

744
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,019
zero then we'll set it as a regular

745
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,550
proportion so we'll do count over and

746
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:58,529
this will be an f32

747
00:38:54,550 --> 00:39:04,510
and this will be an f32 of default HUD

748
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:06,910
lime divisor right so I think that's all

749
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,400
I would really need to do and then now

750
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:12,250
it should be able to set it to a fixed

751
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,349
halfway mark no matter what your screen

752
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,000
resolution is which is the important

753
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:17,080
part because we you know I have

754
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,420
different screens of different

755
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:21,190
resolutions I run for code or on so I

756
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:25,990
can't just hard code the number of lines

757
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:28,539
here needs to be aware so now if I set

758
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:29,439
do the insert okay that was completely

759
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:31,539
useless

760
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,740
it just isn't working at all so that's

761
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:38,079
great we totally crushed it good job so

762
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:43,569
what's going on there when I do view set

763
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,829
split proportion oh yeah if it's

764
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:47,190
negative we got to account for the

765
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:47,190
negative

766
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:58,719
there we go and so now no matter what

767
00:39:56,739 --> 00:40:00,639
the size of the window is right they

768
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,469
should both work so when it's this way

769
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,018
it should be about four lines and when

770
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:07,449
it's this way it should be about half no

771
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:09,098
matter what the circumstance is and

772
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,389
again that's a little bit tricky right

773
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:10,960
you see but you see why it used to be

774
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:13,480
that way

775
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,028
this needs four lines to display the the

776
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:19,150
F Bend the way I have imagined I want it

777
00:40:16,028 --> 00:40:21,670
and this is just trying to show more of

778
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,619
what's in the F bin and so it's just

779
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,298
arbitrarily I want to be able to say

780
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:27,420
look use this percentage of the screen I

781
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:29,710
don't care how many lines that is per se

782
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,710
because I don't know how big your screen

783
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,630
is it just needs to be roughly that

784
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:37,990
amount right roughly that proportion of

785
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,519
this visual area but so that's all good

786
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:42,548
and everyone's happy and that's fine

787
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:46,750
right so let's go ahead and and push on

788
00:40:42,548 --> 00:40:55,869
to the next thing uh so what I want to

789
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:59,409
do now is take a look at the way those F

790
00:40:55,869 --> 00:41:01,690
bins are working and start to try and

791
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:05,469
move some of the commands into them a

792
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:06,759
little bit more properly right and so

793
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:08,259
what I want to do is I want to think

794
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:11,440
about all the things that I currently

795
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:13,778
have that are commands that could be

796
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,329
pushed through the F bar instead of

797
00:41:13,778 --> 00:41:19,059
being pushed through the regular for

798
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:20,109
coder pathway that I have in there right

799
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,059
now

800
00:41:20,108 --> 00:41:26,170
and start to create a structure for

801
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:27,880
storing those things right and so the

802
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:30,730
easiest way for me to do that is just to

803
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,338
kind of look down at the Moodle setup

804
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:36,519
that I've got here and just think about

805
00:41:33,338 --> 00:41:42,159
what is actually gonna be you know

806
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:44,558
relevance so looking at the F bin H file

807
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:49,318
or the F bar H file I'm just gonna kind

808
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:52,028
of do something here like f bar commands

809
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:55,808
and then I'm just going to list the ones

810
00:41:52,028 --> 00:41:59,018
that I see they're relevant so looking

811
00:41:55,809 --> 00:42:01,390
at them right like set mark go to next

812
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:04,389
jump no skips KC clean and save change

813
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:07,598
active panel these are just not

814
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:10,750
that need additional explication so

815
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,059
they're just not appropriate for what's

816
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,980
going on here extended command

817
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:16,119
maybe but again those are supposedly

818
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,010
things that don't happen very frequently

819
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:20,170
so I think we should leave them off for

820
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:22,720
now if I just buffer find corresponding

821
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:26,019
file killed the end of lines just these

822
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:30,368
are not super important things at the

823
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:32,078
moment anyway so then looking down a

824
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:34,298
little bit further go to line doesn't

825
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,369
leave before people jump to index and

826
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:40,028
jump to definition those two things are

827
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:42,160
basically I would I would probably

828
00:42:40,028 --> 00:42:49,268
categorize them under the operation of

829
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:52,899
jumping right so you know we have this

830
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:55,868
idea of jumping to a particular keyword

831
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:58,809
there and so those are both things that

832
00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:00,160
that are probably going to be relevant

833
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:03,548
right those are going to be relevant

834
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:05,618
relevant commands and so I'm just going

835
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:07,679
to call that f bar jump for now so

836
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:12,430
that's just like saying I went somewhere

837
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:14,618
list all locations is probably also

838
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:16,509
thing so that's we're gonna have that be

839
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:20,430
a separate thing so there's a jump and

840
00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:20,429
then there's also a list of locations

841
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,338
then we've got list all substring so

842
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,028
guess who says save things save and make

843
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:29,048
without asking so that's an F bar build

844
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:33,670
which is another thing we want to be

845
00:43:29,048 --> 00:43:37,538
able to do we've got let's see query

846
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:43,690
replace and replace in range

847
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:48,009
those are both definitely ops so there's

848
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:57,068
like replace and there's also like

849
00:43:48,009 --> 00:44:02,009
search I guess search forward and search

850
00:43:57,068 --> 00:44:06,639
backward are probably different I'm not

851
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:10,650
100% sure about that let's say they're

852
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:13,210
not for now let's be Squinkie about that

853
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:17,460
undo doesn't matter switch buffer not so

854
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:21,010
much cut and paste is

855
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,570
kind of a whole other ball of wax let's

856
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:25,270
think about that in a second a little

857
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:27,460
bit later Interactive open redo yeah we

858
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:32,590
don't care about any of that stuff at

859
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:34,840
all moving around it's like a separate

860
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,460
ball wax so I think these are really the

861
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,960
ops that we're talking about here we

862
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:41,070
want to be able to jump to something

863
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:46,170
list all of the some things we have

864
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:46,170
builds commands replace and search

865
00:44:56,429 --> 00:45:01,048
guess if I had to be honest I'm not sure

866
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:01,940
that replacement search need to be two

867
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:05,338
different things

868
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:09,318
it's possible that they should be but I

869
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:13,078
don't actually know it seems like

870
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:16,798
replace is just a superset because you

871
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:19,619
can just have like do the operation or

872
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:21,179
do the OP like the searching you let go

873
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,039
backwards or forwards and then there's a

874
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:34,558
thing for like replacing the thing that

875
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:38,190
you're on they kind of seem the same III

876
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:43,619
think I'm gonna like call that one thing

877
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:46,130
for now and and we'll just see what

878
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,130
happens

879
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:01,690
so we've got those four what I haven't

880
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:05,250
really quite thought through is what

881
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:08,079
actually happens with cut and paste I

882
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:11,260
think I do want cut and paste in there

883
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,809
and the question is just that's not

884
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:17,740
really a command so I guess we're just

885
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:20,469
gonna call that like f bar insert so

886
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:24,639
like if you cut something out it will go

887
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:28,929
into an F bin and then hitting the

888
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:31,119
insert button or hit that F bin will be

889
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:33,399
called an insert F bin and if you hit

890
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:37,569
that button it would paste what you had

891
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:43,720
right back into the buffer wherever you

892
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:52,450
are I don't really know to be completely

893
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:59,429
honest with you I don't really know how

894
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:59,429
we should be working with these buffers

895
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:08,349
like if you did a bunch of cut and

896
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:17,200
pastes right so I keep like I cut things

897
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:20,670
out maybe I just want to append them to

898
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:24,989
the current F bin you know what I mean

899
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,990
and so

900
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,279
I feel like that's a difficult design

901
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:45,569
decision and I think we're probably just

902
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,720
gonna have to play with it to see which

903
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:51,600
way I would want to go because the

904
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:54,089
problem with it is that cut and paste is

905
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,069
like a very frequently used operation

906
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:58,710
and if you've got these F pins and

907
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:00,750
you're trying to work with them then the

908
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:02,070
last thing you want is every time that

909
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,710
you do any kind of cut and paste

910
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:09,809
operation at all it mucks with your F

911
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:11,699
pin set up right and so it seems to me

912
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:15,630
like you kind of want that to be like a

913
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:20,659
sideband thing and so at any time you

914
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:28,769
can always rotate what's in an F been

915
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:31,859
using you're like using that cut and

916
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:37,400
paste history to just pull things into

917
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:37,400
or out of the F pin in question right

918
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:54,619
and so I think what we really want there

919
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:56,690
is to say say maybe that's not a thing

920
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:59,630
and maybe the f bar has like an

921
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:01,610
additional concept here which is just

922
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:03,170
like every time we do cut and paste we

923
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:06,820
have the cut and paste history that was

924
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,820
already a thing in for coder anyway I

925
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:23,150
think and so maybe you can just use

926
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:30,529
these F pins it's like append buffers if

927
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:32,960
you want and we'll just kind of have

928
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:35,450
that be like a special case of of what's

929
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,990
going on so one of the commands that you

930
00:49:35,449 --> 00:49:43,549
always have is like insert the crap from

931
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:49,029
the current F pin into the end of the

932
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:49,030
buffer as a paste operation right

933
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:56,090
and I just I assume and I guess I don't

934
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:58,130
know but I assume that you don't want

935
00:49:56,090 --> 00:50:00,350
that to be something that interacts

936
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:02,210
directly with F pins ever so you don't

937
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:04,339
want to just assume that the active F

938
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:12,199
pin whatever it is is the thing that's

939
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:17,809
getting all of your like like all of

940
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:23,869
your cuts and pastes but again I really

941
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:25,460
just don't know and I feel like if you

942
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:28,250
have the concept that there's an active

943
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:30,650
F pin and a target F pin so that

944
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:32,539
basically all of your operations that

945
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:34,369
you're doing go to the target F pin but

946
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:36,199
the active F pins like add everything it

947
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:38,000
gets too confusing like you need to keep

948
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:40,219
it simple enough that it's usable and

949
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,949
your brain isn't like spending more time

950
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:44,480
for how to use the stupid thing then

951
00:50:42,949 --> 00:50:46,789
it's saving by having the additional

952
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,289
features so again it's just it's really

953
00:50:46,789 --> 00:50:50,289
just hard to conceptualize

954
00:50:54,188 --> 00:50:58,518
you know I mean it's really hard to

955
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:11,630
conceptualize and maybe the answer is no

956
00:50:58,518 --> 00:51:13,278
you really just want you really you

957
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:16,278
really just want that to work I don't

958
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:18,469
know I'm really at a loss my brain is

959
00:51:16,278 --> 00:51:19,668
not able to like hypothesize and it's

960
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:22,938
maybe again because I haven't had any

961
00:51:19,668 --> 00:51:27,798
food all day I'm not really able to

962
00:51:22,938 --> 00:51:30,108
conceptualize what the usage of this

963
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:31,898
will feel like in practice and so I

964
00:51:30,108 --> 00:51:36,348
can't really do a very good job

965
00:51:31,898 --> 00:51:37,759
pre-filtering you know and so I'm gonna

966
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:40,999
just have to experiment with it and see

967
00:51:37,759 --> 00:51:43,130
what happens what I will say is we

968
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:44,778
probably want the ability to save more

969
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:48,769
commands than there are F bins

970
00:51:44,778 --> 00:51:50,679
maybe so we probably want something like

971
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:54,768
[Music]

972
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:57,559
f bar command to be a thing and this is

973
00:51:54,768 --> 00:51:59,658
f bar command type right and the F R

974
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:04,729
command type is here and then there's

975
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:05,989
like the pram to it that we've got so

976
00:52:04,728 --> 00:52:08,208
like search or in place would have liked

977
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:15,338
to and you know jump would only maybe

978
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:15,338
have one and so on so yeah like

979
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:27,268
if we imagine that that's the case I

980
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:27,268
could say that every one of these things

981
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:34,539
has the command that's currently in that

982
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:37,868
F pen but then there's also like some

983
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:42,970
giant like circularbuffer of f bar

984
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:47,670
commands or some crap like this that is

985
00:52:42,969 --> 00:52:50,798
just you know the F in history count and

986
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:52,509
there's just you know some ridiculously

987
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:58,420
huge number of these things sitting

988
00:52:52,509 --> 00:53:00,579
around for me to like pull you know kind

989
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:03,700
of pull back you know you could do

990
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:07,240
something like that now the problem with

991
00:53:03,699 --> 00:53:08,980
that is that the strings themselves have

992
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:12,909
to be memory managed to a certain extent

993
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:20,769
right especially when those things get

994
00:53:12,909 --> 00:53:23,379
really large and so you know I almost

995
00:53:20,768 --> 00:53:29,679
want to say maybe we could do this in a

996
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:32,289
slightly different fashion and say

997
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:35,440
rather than try to manage the things

998
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:42,460
that way what if we just assumed that

999
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:46,809
the history was just a giant buffer that

1000
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:50,278
you save so if I were to say something

1001
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:50,278
like this

1002
00:53:57,528 --> 00:54:03,088
so using Alan's model of saying there's

1003
00:54:00,778 --> 00:54:05,460
a start in an end position inside the

1004
00:54:03,088 --> 00:54:08,248
buffer and we can query for what that is

1005
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:16,349
then in an fr command maybe what we

1006
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:21,588
actually store is just that and then we

1007
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:21,588
just have an infinitely long buffer

1008
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:40,890
that's the history now there's a problem

1009
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:43,650
with that and I use the term probably

1010
00:54:40,889 --> 00:54:45,239
sleee the problem with that is that

1011
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:48,509
history buffer will eventually be

1012
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:55,739
infinitely long just absolutely huge

1013
00:54:48,509 --> 00:54:58,528
right and you know you could imagine

1014
00:54:55,739 --> 00:55:02,098
wanting to remove stuff from the

1015
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:03,960
beginning of the history buffer and if

1016
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:06,059
you start to remove things from the

1017
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:09,989
beginning of the history buffer you have

1018
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:12,180
a cascading update problem where all of

1019
00:55:09,989 --> 00:55:17,909
a sudden all of your start and end

1020
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:19,828
positions are like wrong and so I don't

1021
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:26,460
really know to what extent we want to

1022
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:28,349
think about or deal with that but it's a

1023
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,269
real problem and we can't even really

1024
00:55:28,349 --> 00:55:31,650
rely on memory to save us because for

1025
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:34,048
some reason and I'm not sure what the

1026
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:38,009
reason is Allen doesn't allow 64-bit

1027
00:55:34,048 --> 00:55:44,579
buffers so you can't have just an

1028
00:55:38,009 --> 00:55:46,079
infinitely large buffer it won't work we

1029
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:50,400
would hit the 2 gigabyte limit

1030
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:53,269
eventually and all bets would be off

1031
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,269
right

1032
00:55:57,539 --> 00:56:13,119
and that's a real bummer because other

1033
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:14,920
than that one problem it'd be really

1034
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,489
nice because it means your history would

1035
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,490
get saved

1036
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:34,369
oh man

1037
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:52,030
I mean my first inclination is did you

1038
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:54,099
say screw it let's do that and then the

1039
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:57,369
other thing that we can do is just say

1040
00:56:54,099 --> 00:56:58,809
look if we use an offset because if we

1041
00:56:57,369 --> 00:57:01,329
wanted this thing to save and load

1042
00:56:58,809 --> 00:57:04,960
properly we would have to have a way of

1043
00:57:01,329 --> 00:57:08,019
saving what the actual indices into that

1044
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,150
buffer were because I don't want to get

1045
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:13,480
into the business of escaping them like

1046
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:15,130
having escaped strings and stuff so if

1047
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,338
we were going to save that information

1048
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:21,940
in addition to the data there then we

1049
00:57:18,338 --> 00:57:24,818
would also have to have those integers

1050
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:27,818
like for the params and stuff those

1051
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:30,630
would have to be stored if we were going

1052
00:57:27,818 --> 00:57:30,630
to store those

1053
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:41,700
then I guess there's no cost in just

1054
00:57:39,478 --> 00:57:44,608
storing them and storing an offset as

1055
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:46,739
well and then every time you want to

1056
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:53,338
remove stuff from the beginning you just

1057
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:59,039
do so in other words you do this and

1058
00:57:53,338 --> 00:58:02,909
then you have like history first history

1059
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:04,799
buffer start and so anytime you want to

1060
00:58:02,909 --> 00:58:07,048
pull something off the beginning you

1061
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:10,139
just Inc history history of ever start

1062
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:11,998
however far you wanted to go and then

1063
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:18,838
the fact that all of these guys are

1064
00:58:11,998 --> 00:58:21,088
happened to be a you know all of these

1065
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:22,889
things happen to be indices into later

1066
00:58:21,088 --> 00:58:26,248
in the stream is fine like it doesn't

1067
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:29,159
matter that that happens right um

1068
00:58:26,248 --> 00:58:31,108
and so we could just do that I don't

1069
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:32,548
know how good of an idea that is but you

1070
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:35,429
know if you imagine something like this

1071
00:58:32,548 --> 00:58:36,960
we've got an f bar command here and then

1072
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:41,659
you said like this was the history

1073
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:48,298
buffer and that I had the f bar command

1074
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:58,048
which is the history I mean I guess that

1075
00:58:48,298 --> 00:59:02,478
just works and you just do like and it's

1076
00:58:58,048 --> 00:59:05,748
just a rolling it's just a rolling index

1077
00:59:02,478 --> 00:59:05,748
into the thing

1078
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:14,260
I this could be a really dumb idea

1079
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:19,118
I am totally willing to believe that

1080
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:21,069
this is like really stupid so I'm just

1081
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,980
kind of thinking out loud and saying you

1082
00:59:21,068 --> 00:59:27,309
know maybe that's how it goes

1083
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:29,289
once you have that history then it seems

1084
00:59:27,309 --> 00:59:31,960
to me like you can just make a jump

1085
00:59:29,289 --> 00:59:35,409
Lister that's called like load command

1086
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:38,019
and it just shows you your last 4096

1087
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:40,118
commands that you did and then you just

1088
00:59:38,019 --> 00:59:42,250
load one into the F bin that you're

1089
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:47,500
currently on and that's a way to just

1090
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:54,338
kind of necro old commands right back

1091
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:59,469
into service right look I haven't eaten

1092
00:59:54,338 --> 01:00:02,380
all day I don't know what's going on so

1093
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:07,209
I feel like let's just go for it I mean

1094
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:08,619
what's the worst that can happen um so

1095
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:10,300
let's just see that's what's gonna

1096
01:00:08,619 --> 01:00:13,780
happen and then these F bark commands

1097
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:15,099
are basically you know some kind of you

1098
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:19,869
know there's some kind of nonsense like

1099
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:22,930
this and each one of the f bar things

1100
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:25,539
also has a buffer backing it if it's in

1101
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:27,489
the F bin so but that's not something

1102
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:33,250
that we will actually keep in there

1103
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:35,169
normally right and so we don't save the

1104
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:38,190
whole like search results or anything we

1105
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:40,510
just save the command to do the search

1106
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:43,480
into the history so it doesn't get like

1107
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:45,599
unreasonably large really quickly so I

1108
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,309
feel like that would probably be okay

1109
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:51,010
again the only real question here is

1110
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:54,818
what to do about the cut and paste and I

1111
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:59,740
don't know that part's pretty tough for

1112
01:00:54,818 --> 01:01:04,019
me to think through I I just don't have

1113
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:04,019
an idea of where that goes

1114
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,309
yeah look I just I just don't have a

1115
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,740
clear thought in my head for like where

1116
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:26,260
that goes for how that's happening

1117
01:01:20,739 --> 01:01:28,409
currently lake for paste so we're

1118
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:36,910
calling Casey paste and tab right now

1119
01:01:28,409 --> 01:01:44,649
oops and so this function here which is

1120
01:01:36,909 --> 01:01:54,279
the paste function I'm not sure I'm not

1121
01:01:44,650 --> 01:02:03,010
sure exactly what it does so if you look

1122
01:01:54,280 --> 01:02:11,950
at it yeah like there is this notion of

1123
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:14,290
a clipboard index and this is pretty

1124
01:02:11,949 --> 01:02:16,328
good right like what this does here is

1125
01:02:14,289 --> 01:02:18,308
it just lets you like rotate the pace

1126
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:25,359
that you just did to like a previous

1127
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:27,960
based right and so maybe I don't really

1128
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:33,460
need to worry about paste that much and

1129
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:37,798
it can just be you can just use what

1130
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:40,329
Allen's already did I don't actually

1131
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:44,980
know how well that works so let's just

1132
01:02:40,329 --> 01:02:50,230
try it so we've got Casey paste and tab

1133
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:55,298
and I'm gonna shove this pace next thing

1134
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:59,409
in there on e because I don't have

1135
01:02:55,298 --> 01:03:01,409
anything bound to e at the moment so we

1136
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:04,509
can just do that and see what it does

1137
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:06,489
and then we'll kind of go from there you

1138
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:08,170
64 it looks like I didn't define yet

1139
01:03:06,489 --> 01:03:10,419
I'll make one of those cuz I'm gonna

1140
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:15,010
need that probably for a bunch of stuff

1141
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:18,309
so if I go ahead and do a un 6040 and

1142
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:19,780
make that a u 64 then I can keep on

1143
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:27,040
keeping on

1144
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:28,510
if I run this and launch the thing let's

1145
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,929
see how that actually works in practice

1146
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:34,570
so if I switch projects to handmade ray

1147
01:03:31,929 --> 01:03:38,349
or something if I come in here and cut

1148
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:53,350
that and then cut this sorry copy and

1149
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:57,400
that cut and then I do like F so that's

1150
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:58,569
pretty good already I just didn't have

1151
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,519
anything bound to that because I don't

1152
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:06,670
think that existed when I first did it I

1153
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:09,039
think Allen added that so me me that's

1154
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:11,590
just good enough and maybe we don't

1155
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:19,779
really need to think too hard about cut

1156
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:26,200
and paste so maybe really mostly what I

1157
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:28,930
need is to just think about how can i

1158
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:30,309
display those down here so that it's a

1159
01:04:28,929 --> 01:04:33,789
little bit more clear what they are

1160
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:37,989
right so if we look at how these F bins

1161
01:04:33,789 --> 01:04:40,480
are set up you know you could imagine

1162
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:42,969
having like some extra room on the side

1163
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,690
for status that just shows what the

1164
01:04:42,969 --> 01:04:51,129
paste what the current paste setup is

1165
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:52,210
you know what I mean and there's a

1166
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:54,910
couple other things that I would want

1167
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:57,449
that for anyway like I would want to

1168
01:04:54,909 --> 01:05:00,579
know what the alt tab would have been

1169
01:04:57,449 --> 01:05:02,319
I've wanted that for a while so that as

1170
01:05:00,579 --> 01:05:04,239
I'm typing it just shows me what my alt

1171
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:07,600
tab would be if I hit it at any given

1172
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:10,869
time so I have to guess so some things

1173
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:13,119
like that that show what that is would

1174
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:14,859
be nice these would be getting kind of

1175
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:17,559
small at that point I don't know how

1176
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:23,349
much that actually matters to be

1177
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:25,000
completely honest with you but I also

1178
01:05:23,349 --> 01:05:26,710
don't know how many F pins I need in

1179
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,860
practice maybe that we don't really need

1180
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:32,619
12 F pins anyway like maybe 10 F pins is

1181
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:35,010
fine right

1182
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:37,630
so let's see what we can do with that

1183
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:41,980
we'll just start slow and by the way

1184
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:49,690
we're getting close right 8 minutes 50

1185
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:52,869
seconds so let's see what we can do with

1186
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:55,990
with how Alan's got this paste next

1187
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:58,329
things set up so like the way he's got

1188
01:05:55,989 --> 01:05:59,769
this now is he's got this paste index

1189
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:08,079
thing with the clipboard a next stuff

1190
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:11,409
I'm assuming mmm so I guess I don't know

1191
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:14,429
if I can just access what those things

1192
01:06:11,409 --> 01:06:14,429
are like

1193
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:37,070
and also this is what I actually need

1194
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:37,610
isn't it that's actually just the same

1195
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:40,010
thing

1196
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:44,349
so Casey paste and tab doesn't need to

1197
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:44,350
be here anymore either

1198
01:06:53,739 --> 01:06:57,769
so that's cool like that took away some

1199
01:06:56,239 --> 01:07:00,459
of the custom stuff and it's just in for

1200
01:06:57,769 --> 01:07:00,460
code of proper now

1201
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:10,880
so I guess what I would say is the part

1202
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:13,940
that I mainly don't know right I just

1203
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,849
I'm not quite sure I don't super

1204
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:19,519
understand how I would get these so it

1205
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:29,150
seems like clipboard index maybe is just

1206
01:07:19,518 --> 01:07:31,338
a thing that says when you do oh well

1207
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:33,108
actually maybe that's actually getting

1208
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:43,159
that thing I don't know let's go look at

1209
01:07:33,108 --> 01:07:48,338
clipboard index so is that a how is that

1210
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:48,338
defined cuz it's in here here it is

1211
01:07:58,809 --> 01:08:04,909
so yeah it looks like that just gets us

1212
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,920
what we want so if I just call clipboard

1213
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:09,049
index repeatedly and I guess I don't

1214
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:14,230
actually know how many of those there

1215
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:22,310
actually are but that's probably also

1216
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:25,750
explained in here because the paste

1217
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:30,530
index keeps getting incremented

1218
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:44,840
continuously I don't see anywhere that

1219
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:47,569
it wraps that yeah so I don't really

1220
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:50,750
know what I'm doing but that's okay

1221
01:08:47,569 --> 01:08:54,289
so let's just try this and see what what

1222
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:57,199
happens so if I go into the rendering

1223
01:08:54,289 --> 01:09:01,399
code and I just like but stop the first

1224
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:03,079
part of this buffer with my own

1225
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:10,429
rendering that shows what's what's in

1226
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:12,350
there let's just see what happens so in

1227
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:14,539
here we'll look if we're in the global

1228
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:16,250
HUD view and we do our little rectangle

1229
01:09:14,539 --> 01:09:17,420
dance again all this code is something

1230
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:20,119
that we're gonna have to improve

1231
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:24,560
substantially and that's fine but right

1232
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:26,000
now we want to get everything working so

1233
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,730
what I want to do is I do want to be

1234
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,510
able to get this this custom variable

1235
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:35,089
managed variable thing working because I

1236
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:38,570
need to be able to know like where we

1237
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:42,079
are in that ring so ideally I would have

1238
01:09:38,569 --> 01:09:45,309
something like this which is like here's

1239
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:49,250
what the previous you know paste index

1240
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:51,230
was just so I can get that and then I

1241
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:54,710
also have this which allows me to get

1242
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:58,250
like individual paste index stuff as we

1243
01:09:54,710 --> 01:10:02,960
go now this tells me how big it is I

1244
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:07,130
think and then I need to like have some

1245
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:09,409
room to grab it I guess but I don't

1246
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:10,969
actually want to do that anyway because

1247
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:13,039
I can only print

1248
01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:14,569
in this little summary view a few

1249
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:16,729
characters of it anyway

1250
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:20,059
so I can only really give the user like

1251
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:21,859
a hint about how I about like what it is

1252
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:24,320
and then I can also say how big it is I

1253
01:10:21,859 --> 01:10:29,029
guess I could add that as part of what

1254
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:30,649
I'm printing out perhaps but you know so

1255
01:10:29,029 --> 01:10:32,269
let's go ahead and do a four I loop here

1256
01:10:30,649 --> 01:10:38,839
and let's loop over a bunch of these and

1257
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:43,610
see what happens so if I say you know

1258
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:46,400
board index and I just say give me I

1259
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:50,448
don't know we're gonna show 16 of these

1260
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:52,819
who cares so I just go over each of

1261
01:10:50,448 --> 01:10:55,609
these in turn and I say give me this

1262
01:10:52,819 --> 01:10:58,099
particular one this will tell me how big

1263
01:10:55,609 --> 01:11:00,859
it is and then I can also say look give

1264
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:03,079
me the first 16 characters of it and I

1265
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:13,189
knew that I can't tell you any more than

1266
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:20,260
that then clipboard then when we do this

1267
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:20,259
here what's the 0 4 by the way is that

1268
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:28,969
clipboard ID so maybe there's multiple

1269
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:30,140
clipboards oh ok it should always be

1270
01:11:28,969 --> 01:11:35,899
zero it's probably four if there's

1271
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:37,520
multiple clipboards yeah all right so

1272
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:39,559
we're just gonna say look go through

1273
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,090
each of these let's find out what the

1274
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:48,050
length is that's good then let's also

1275
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:49,670
just get the thing right and then when

1276
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:52,070
we come out of here we should have the

1277
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:54,350
ability to print this thing right so I

1278
01:11:52,069 --> 01:12:00,920
can make a string here which is the like

1279
01:11:54,350 --> 01:12:04,910
this board equals make string of when

1280
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:06,649
temp and now I've got that why Ellen

1281
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:09,439
doesn't return strings I'll never know

1282
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:10,729
he seemed really reticent to do so but I

1283
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:12,919
think the string is a really useful

1284
01:12:10,729 --> 01:12:14,779
little thing he made here so I would

1285
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:18,730
just always return them because that way

1286
01:12:14,779 --> 01:12:21,619
you don't have to do this all the time

1287
01:12:18,729 --> 01:12:23,348
anyway once I have one of those I'm just

1288
01:12:21,619 --> 01:12:28,710
gonna draw it

1289
01:12:23,349 --> 01:12:32,739
and we'll see what happens so there is

1290
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:36,489
not going to deal with any of this I'm

1291
01:12:32,738 --> 01:12:44,019
just gonna put this at like zero zero I

1292
01:12:36,488 --> 01:12:45,879
guess and yeah that's it so I want to be

1293
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:47,949
able to move this down each time so I'm

1294
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:51,578
gonna make a wipe Ram here that I can

1295
01:12:47,948 --> 01:12:55,328
use for passing and so I'll start with

1296
01:12:51,578 --> 01:12:57,399
the wipe Ram being at the back region so

1297
01:12:55,328 --> 01:13:01,179
this is basically the border of the

1298
01:12:57,399 --> 01:13:03,819
thing I'm drawing into its gonna start

1299
01:13:01,179 --> 01:13:07,658
there and each time through I'll just

1300
01:13:03,819 --> 01:13:10,210
increment by however big one line is so

1301
01:13:07,658 --> 01:13:14,618
in Allen's parlance that's this thing

1302
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:17,078
right and so what I can do is just this

1303
01:13:14,618 --> 01:13:19,149
will let me move the thing down one each

1304
01:13:17,078 --> 01:13:22,479
time and I'll put an X in there as well

1305
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:26,049
which will just be for now the left

1306
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:27,879
flush border I think that will give me

1307
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:31,000
the ability to see everything in there I

1308
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,739
think I don't actually know again you

1309
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,939
know not my code I don't

1310
01:13:32,738 --> 01:13:41,709
I only know some basic stuff all right

1311
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:49,839
so I don't know what scope is here to

1312
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:54,630
what extent that is a thing it looks

1313
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,630
like it's for the particular view

1314
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:08,760
I don't really know so what I'm gonna do

1315
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:18,750
there is say look let's get that for the

1316
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:20,970
active view meaning not necessarily the

1317
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:22,920
view we're drawing but let's get it for

1318
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:26,280
whatever the active view is and and

1319
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:28,640
we'll go from there because that's the

1320
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:31,439
one we actually would care about I think

1321
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:38,880
and then when we do this nonsense here

1322
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:41,359
all right it's time hold on folks I will

1323
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,359
be right back

1324
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,900
you

1325
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:07,450
hello hello there we go alright so let's

1326
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:11,950
see what's gonna happen here this is 16

1327
01:17:07,449 --> 01:17:14,189
ounces of gavel ight see now I don't

1328
01:17:11,949 --> 01:17:18,309
actually know what gavel ight see is

1329
01:17:14,189 --> 01:17:22,719
however what I assume it is is some kind

1330
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:24,610
of a preparation of water that prevents

1331
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:27,460
all the water from being filtered out of

1332
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:29,589
your colon too soon so that you

1333
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:31,270
basically flush everything out because

1334
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:33,100
I'm assuming if you just drank water it

1335
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:35,110
would all get absorbed rather quickly

1336
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,400
and end up in your bladder which is not

1337
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:40,119
the thing you're trying to clear out

1338
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:42,399
right I don't know not a doctor

1339
01:17:40,119 --> 01:17:43,590
maybe that has absolutely nothing to do

1340
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:45,759
with it

1341
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:48,640
we could go read about it if we cared

1342
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:51,250
but we don't so again never done a

1343
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:53,289
colonoscopy before have no idea how this

1344
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:56,229
is going to be everyone says it's awful

1345
01:17:53,289 --> 01:17:57,789
I in the next half hour we'll have to

1346
01:17:56,229 --> 01:18:01,119
drink this whole thing I'm supposed to

1347
01:17:57,789 --> 01:18:03,579
drink 8 ounces every 15 minutes so right

1348
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:05,829
now what we're gonna do is drink it from

1349
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:08,559
the 16 ounce line down to the 8 ounce

1350
01:18:05,829 --> 01:18:11,140
line and then after another 15 minutes

1351
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:13,210
I've set the timer again I will drink it

1352
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:15,130
from the 8 ounce line down to the zero

1353
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:17,649
ounce line and the stream will basically

1354
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:19,210
be over once I have to go to the

1355
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:21,189
bathroom and start because I'm assuming

1356
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:22,510
that clearing out my colon will not be

1357
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:24,369
pleasant and I won't want a stream

1358
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:26,440
during it all right you ready for this

1359
01:18:24,369 --> 01:18:28,630
here we go and this is supposed to be

1360
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:30,159
awful people say it's annoying that to

1361
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:32,380
drink this much and it's disgusting or

1362
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:35,519
something so I will tell you how it is

1363
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,520
we'll see how it is

1364
01:18:45,849 --> 01:18:57,050
this is a weird flavor so I guess here's

1365
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:58,998
what I'd say it's really not bad so I'm

1366
01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:05,119
assuming that well either I'm just not

1367
01:18:58,998 --> 01:19:06,438
particularly sensitive to it or it's

1368
01:19:05,118 --> 01:19:10,578
just cuz you have to drink so much of it

1369
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:12,679
right by the time I get done with one

1370
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:14,478
gallon of this crap well half a gallon

1371
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:17,078
and then I guess I don't know it's split

1372
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:17,079
into two sections

1373
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:43,668
that's about right so what I would say

1374
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:45,228
is I'm assuming that the problem is not

1375
01:19:43,668 --> 01:19:49,010
so much that's discussing because that

1376
01:19:45,229 --> 01:19:50,599
is not disgusting like of the stuff you

1377
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:52,400
could have to drink for medical purposes

1378
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:52,880
I guarantee you that is not one of the

1379
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:54,708
worst

1380
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:58,609
I'm sure there's stuff that tastes a lot

1381
01:19:54,708 --> 01:20:01,880
worse than that so I'm guessing that the

1382
01:19:58,609 --> 01:20:05,748
problem is just that after you know the

1383
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:08,300
the fourth one of these you are pretty

1384
01:20:05,748 --> 01:20:09,708
unhappy with having to continue to drink

1385
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:14,179
something that tastes like that because

1386
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:16,130
it's certainly not delicious right so

1387
01:20:14,179 --> 01:20:19,489
anyway there that was it a happy

1388
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:21,050
birthday colonoscopy so yeah we still

1389
01:20:19,488 --> 01:20:23,058
got how much time in left in the stream

1390
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:24,829
you know maybe we can finish it maybe we

1391
01:20:23,059 --> 01:20:33,979
can't I think we still got a living in

1392
01:20:24,828 --> 01:20:34,819
an hour maybe I don't know I don't know

1393
01:20:33,979 --> 01:20:37,039
much time we got

1394
01:20:34,819 --> 01:20:42,738
but our timer thing probably would tell

1395
01:20:37,038 --> 01:20:44,779
us all right well feels weird to drink I

1396
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:49,149
guess is the thing that I would say most

1397
01:20:44,779 --> 01:20:49,149
of us just feels odd having drank that

1398
01:20:54,399 --> 01:21:02,029
all right hopefully that's supposed to

1399
01:20:58,038 --> 01:21:05,448
happen if I if I suddenly like die on

1400
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:08,599
stream someone please call the doctor

1401
01:21:05,448 --> 01:21:14,988
so anyway looking back at what we were

1402
01:21:08,599 --> 01:21:16,639
doing here a couple of things I don't

1403
01:21:14,988 --> 01:21:17,718
really know I don't know like where

1404
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:18,618
we're supposed to get this stuff from

1405
01:21:17,719 --> 01:21:20,029
like the scope

1406
01:21:18,618 --> 01:21:22,279
I assume er let's get it from the manju

1407
01:21:20,029 --> 01:21:23,868
throat from the active view because what

1408
01:21:22,279 --> 01:21:26,238
we're trying to ask or what we're trying

1409
01:21:23,868 --> 01:21:27,529
to display is if I was gonna pay

1410
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:30,288
something into the view I'm currently

1411
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:31,639
working on what would get pasted right

1412
01:21:30,288 --> 01:21:34,599
so that seems like pretty

1413
01:21:31,639 --> 01:21:37,550
straightforward to me I would assume

1414
01:21:34,599 --> 01:21:41,090
okay so now we come back here we don't

1415
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:42,769
really need to lend twice so I guess

1416
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:43,939
what I would say is this part here that

1417
01:21:42,769 --> 01:21:47,539
actually gets it I'm going to do that

1418
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:48,000
same trick so this length here is like

1419
01:21:47,538 --> 01:21:50,309
the

1420
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,520
to a length like the total length of the

1421
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:55,800
thing and then we got a string back and

1422
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,160
the string is actually not the whole

1423
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,079
thing

1424
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:59,760
right because we are intentionally not

1425
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,930
passing something that can actually hold

1426
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,640
the whole thing because we're not gonna

1427
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:04,640
actually do that right we're not gonna

1428
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:10,500
we we don't actually need to capture the

1429
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:13,470
entire thing because we don't have room

1430
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:15,539
display it so I may want to know how big

1431
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:18,750
it is because I may want to draw it in

1432
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:21,899
that regard but other than that right

1433
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:24,420
we're good so I'm gonna go ahead and say

1434
01:22:21,899 --> 01:22:25,979
let's do that I'm gonna call condense

1435
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:28,140
white space which is a function I wrote

1436
01:22:25,979 --> 01:22:29,459
that basically takes a string and

1437
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:31,260
removes all the white space from the

1438
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:32,399
beginning the end and anywhere that

1439
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,840
there was white space inside it

1440
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:38,429
condensed it down to a single space

1441
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:47,279
right and so I'm gonna try that and

1442
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:50,130
we're gonna see what happens I don't

1443
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:53,969
know why I did view.height this was

1444
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:56,010
supposed to be wine height sorry but

1445
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:56,250
again like you know not having eaten all

1446
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:58,770
day

1447
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:02,930
not a great not a great way to program

1448
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:02,930
not a great state for your mind to be in

1449
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:09,119
there's a reason that fasting monks are

1450
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:10,350
not are not people who programmed most

1451
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:13,699
of the things in the world it's because

1452
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:18,480
you really need you want food so anyway

1453
01:23:13,699 --> 01:23:20,039
let's just go through here and and get

1454
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:23,759
this basic part working and then we'll

1455
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:25,829
see whether this worked at all what is

1456
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:30,119
going on here

1457
01:23:25,829 --> 01:23:32,039
we have a let's see scope active view

1458
01:23:30,119 --> 01:23:36,210
active view IDE what's what is it

1459
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:42,210
complaining about oh we already have the

1460
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:43,770
active view is that true Wow awesome

1461
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:45,270
so I already have the active view so I

1462
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:46,880
really don't need to get it I can just

1463
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:50,360
use the one that I've already got their

1464
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,359
managed variable

1465
01:23:51,050 --> 01:24:00,960
alright so apparently the previous pace

1466
01:23:54,689 --> 01:24:04,949
index is not an in 32 so when this thing

1467
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:11,930
was doing a managed variable get where

1468
01:24:04,949 --> 01:24:11,929
was that it was just in pace next right

1469
01:24:14,279 --> 01:24:21,819
so when it's doing oh I see we pass it a

1470
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:24,279
thing to feed into I don't know why I

1471
01:24:21,819 --> 01:24:28,118
set it equal to something I guess I was

1472
01:24:24,279 --> 01:24:30,458
just being random so if I do previous

1473
01:24:28,118 --> 01:24:35,078
base lexical zero and then I get it

1474
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:38,670
this has to be apparently a unit 64 that

1475
01:24:35,078 --> 01:24:38,670
seems fine I don't care what it is

1476
01:24:39,279 --> 01:24:45,670
and then the make string needs to get

1477
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:49,059
Squinkie err so clipboard index is

1478
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:50,559
supposed to return the length I think I

1479
01:24:49,059 --> 01:24:57,729
just have the order of these wrong

1480
01:24:50,559 --> 01:24:58,989
because yeah and the total length isn't

1481
01:24:57,729 --> 01:25:04,030
used that's correct

1482
01:24:58,988 --> 01:25:06,939
so let's get rid of that oops so in

1483
01:25:04,029 --> 01:25:14,139
theory that's gonna work I agree it's

1484
01:25:06,939 --> 01:25:16,208
not a great theory so let's see I don't

1485
01:25:14,139 --> 01:25:21,479
know why that says temp temp temp temp

1486
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:21,479
temp temp temp did I do something stupid

1487
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:33,239
I don't think so so that's just what the

1488
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:45,779
clipboard is actually returning I guess

1489
01:25:33,239 --> 01:25:47,550
I don't know I wonder if that's a bug is

1490
01:25:45,779 --> 01:25:49,050
it supposed to be doing that like is it

1491
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:52,500
supposed to have temp and the clipboard

1492
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:53,550
the entire time I don't know let's go

1493
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,859
ahead and see what happens if I start

1494
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:59,550
using this now it's like cut and paste

1495
01:25:55,859 --> 01:26:05,989
that cut and paste that that's not

1496
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:05,989
looking good if we're honest right I

1497
01:26:07,069 --> 01:26:13,079
don't know what's going on there so

1498
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:15,390
we're not doing this right I don't know

1499
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:18,300
what it is exactly that we're not doing

1500
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:21,660
right but it's something

1501
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:25,130
and so clipboard index let's go back and

1502
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:25,130
look at how that's supposed to be used

1503
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:33,210
so here's one question

1504
01:26:30,329 --> 01:26:34,890
maybe clipboard index can't handle it if

1505
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:39,180
you don't pass something big enough to

1506
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:42,470
fit like maybe it isn't qualified it

1507
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:47,340
doesn't have the ability to truncate

1508
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:51,010
maybe I don't really know but let me see

1509
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:54,088
if I could find it so clipboard index

1510
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:54,088
[Music]

1511
01:27:06,899 --> 01:27:12,699
yeah I guess I don't know let's look at

1512
01:27:08,949 --> 01:27:15,539
the implementation so here's where it

1513
01:27:12,699 --> 01:27:15,539
actually happens

1514
01:27:23,479 --> 01:27:30,599
interesting so it first says give me

1515
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:32,480
back a pointer to an internal string

1516
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:37,380
that is the one that we're talking about

1517
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:39,899
right then it says if that was valid set

1518
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:43,350
the size equal to that size

1519
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:55,469
assuming they gave us a pointer make a

1520
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:56,640
string make a string that is the you

1521
01:27:55,470 --> 01:28:00,180
know what I don't know what that does

1522
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:03,140
make string cap off to look so it's

1523
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:07,260
creating an out string that's out of the

1524
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:10,289
district that's doing a copy between the

1525
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:15,360
two strings so that must just be making

1526
01:28:10,289 --> 01:28:16,859
a string oh you know what that probably

1527
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:19,049
stands for probably stands for make

1528
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:21,689
string capacity and it probably says

1529
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:24,900
look here's the buffer that we're using

1530
01:28:21,689 --> 01:28:28,049
here's the size it can accept and it

1531
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:42,239
doesn't have anything in it yet then do

1532
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:45,900
a copy right now the problem is it

1533
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:49,949
doesn't tell us how much it actually

1534
01:28:45,899 --> 01:28:51,119
filled so we would have to actually do

1535
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:52,409
that ourselves again this is why

1536
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:54,390
returning a string would have been nice

1537
01:28:52,409 --> 01:28:56,670
right because we don't know how much it

1538
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:58,260
actually filled so we have to actually

1539
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:59,699
do the comparison ourselves to see if

1540
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:02,159
the thing would have fit or if it

1541
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:05,750
wouldn't have fit and that's just kind

1542
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:07,920
of kind of annoying right

1543
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:11,279
so in lis here we get the total length

1544
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:14,279
we would know what that was coming out

1545
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:16,559
of here in this case here we now need to

1546
01:29:14,279 --> 01:29:18,899
make a string out of the total length

1547
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,770
this thing that it returns is not gonna

1548
01:29:18,899 --> 01:29:23,849
do it for us

1549
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:25,290
right so instead and I guess now I think

1550
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:27,090
about it we only need to call this once

1551
01:29:25,289 --> 01:29:30,420
as a result we can call it with the

1552
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:32,670
actual truncated version and then get

1553
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:35,220
the total length out this way remove

1554
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:36,180
that so in here now we will have a total

1555
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:39,900
length and what we

1556
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:41,490
would want to do is say the well I guess

1557
01:29:39,899 --> 01:29:44,369
I can do that directly in here when I

1558
01:29:41,489 --> 01:29:48,090
make this string here's you know the

1559
01:29:44,369 --> 01:29:49,829
actual contents in theory and then I

1560
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:53,130
need to say that the length is going to

1561
01:29:49,829 --> 01:29:57,479
be the total length if and only if it's

1562
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:59,489
less than the array count of 10 right so

1563
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:06,109
if it's less than the Iranian count of

1564
01:29:59,489 --> 01:30:06,109
temp then great use it if it's not oops

1565
01:30:06,449 --> 01:30:15,829
use the array count right I again don't

1566
01:30:13,229 --> 01:30:20,639
really think that's gonna fix my

1567
01:30:15,829 --> 01:30:22,680
problems though I mean maybe it will but

1568
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:26,850
I think we've got more going wrong than

1569
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:28,950
just that and yeah you could didn't you

1570
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:34,350
do that kind of see that's still wrong

1571
01:30:28,949 --> 01:30:36,119
so what am i screwing up here folks if

1572
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:37,890
the total length that comes back is less

1573
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:40,319
than the array account use it otherwise

1574
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:43,140
use your a count so shouldn't that I

1575
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:46,799
mean that should be returning zero to me

1576
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:51,720
right so the length of this thing should

1577
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:53,880
be zero I think because this should be

1578
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:57,960
zero and it should say if zero is less

1579
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:58,829
than or a count use zero as the length

1580
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,210
of the string

1581
01:30:58,829 --> 01:31:06,420
so maybe condense whitespace is broken I

1582
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:09,409
don't know could be so we passed the

1583
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:09,409
string to that thing

1584
01:31:16,369 --> 01:31:21,140
I mean I still think that should work I

1585
01:31:19,729 --> 01:31:22,759
don't have to step into this because

1586
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:24,260
I'll be completely honest I have no idea

1587
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:25,909
what's happening I don't know why we're

1588
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:28,789
getting that garbage in there doesn't

1589
01:31:25,909 --> 01:31:30,859
seem right I probably have like a stupid

1590
01:31:28,789 --> 01:31:32,029
typo and it probably has something to do

1591
01:31:30,859 --> 01:31:34,909
with the fact that I haven't eaten today

1592
01:31:32,029 --> 01:31:38,149
which is not good not not where I want

1593
01:31:34,909 --> 01:31:43,930
to be with my life also we only have

1594
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:50,210
actually you know what six five four

1595
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:54,530
here we go all right so now we gotta do

1596
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:58,880
this nastiness again so here is the

1597
01:31:54,529 --> 01:31:59,960
remaining eight ounces of gavel I see I

1598
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,480
don't know how much of this I have to

1599
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:05,149
drink total let's compute it real

1600
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:08,000
quickly we can in fact even use the math

1601
01:32:05,149 --> 01:32:11,389
features that I added so we know that we

1602
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:14,260
have two hours each hour contains what

1603
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:14,260
you don't let me drink at first

1604
01:32:30,109 --> 01:32:39,899
each hour contains four 15-minute blocks

1605
01:32:35,488 --> 01:32:44,039
and we have two hours right so we know

1606
01:32:39,899 --> 01:32:46,920
that we've got eight total blocks of 15

1607
01:32:44,039 --> 01:32:51,929
minutes each one of those we have to

1608
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:59,550
drink one eight ounce serving so that's

1609
01:32:51,929 --> 01:33:05,849
64 ounces of gavel 8c I don't know how

1610
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:09,289
many Ounces are in a gallon oh why did I

1611
01:33:05,849 --> 01:33:09,289
do it over here I just do it over here

1612
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:17,940
128 so basically what we're doing is

1613
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:19,800
we're drinking a half gallon of gavel

1614
01:33:17,939 --> 01:33:23,460
it--see and we're drinking eight ounce

1615
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:25,380
things every 15 minutes and I have a

1616
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:26,489
gallon of gavel it--see and I think what

1617
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:32,328
happens is tomorrow

1618
01:33:26,488 --> 01:33:35,519
I drink another gallon right medicine

1619
01:33:32,328 --> 01:33:40,558
could be worse that could be attaching

1620
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:41,940
leashes to me anyway so getting back to

1621
01:33:40,559 --> 01:33:44,880
where we're going what we're trying to

1622
01:33:41,939 --> 01:33:49,408
get working here so something is not

1623
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:50,880
going well for us right and I don't know

1624
01:33:49,408 --> 01:33:52,738
what it is because I feel like this

1625
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,900
should be working okay and I'm not sure

1626
01:33:52,738 --> 01:33:57,738
where we're getting off track because I

1627
01:33:54,899 --> 01:34:01,319
feel like this total length call here

1628
01:33:57,738 --> 01:34:05,789
this should be doing what we needed to

1629
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:08,130
do and it ain't so we got to figure out

1630
01:34:05,789 --> 01:34:12,809
why right we got to figure out why we're

1631
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:14,270
getting that we got to figure out why

1632
01:34:12,809 --> 01:34:17,010
we're getting that that error in there

1633
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:19,099
so let's go ahead and and and see what's

1634
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:21,480
going down

1635
01:34:19,099 --> 01:34:22,980
maybe it's the condensed whitespace part

1636
01:34:21,479 --> 01:34:25,649
I don't know let's just try to step in

1637
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:27,689
there and get a clue and what I'm gonna

1638
01:34:25,649 --> 01:34:34,500
do here is I'm gonna set a breakpoint on

1639
01:34:27,689 --> 01:34:37,469
condensed whitespace as a start and and

1640
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:40,078
we'll see what happens so let's see in

1641
01:34:37,469 --> 01:34:41,368
fact it is that in fact exact call

1642
01:34:40,078 --> 01:34:42,340
that's why I picked it cuz I was like I

1643
01:34:41,368 --> 01:34:46,000
think the only place that'll

1644
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:48,909
getting called at the moment is here so

1645
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,859
what's happening unfortunately we're in

1646
01:34:48,908 --> 01:34:53,138
release mode which of course visual

1647
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:57,279
studio is never able to really handle

1648
01:34:53,139 --> 01:35:00,219
but you know maybe we'll get lucky all

1649
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:06,429
right so this board came back with a

1650
01:35:00,219 --> 01:35:11,198
total length it says nine and total n

1651
01:35:06,429 --> 01:35:15,060
here is what's in the buffer that seems

1652
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:15,059
good to me

1653
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:21,179
that's what we would want so I'm not

1654
01:35:18,488 --> 01:35:26,939
sure why we be getting an error in

1655
01:35:21,179 --> 01:35:26,940
drawstring for printing that

1656
01:35:38,809 --> 01:35:49,380
that's a work right step in there or are

1657
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:51,738
we off by one here for some reason okay

1658
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:54,779
we hadn't actually done nevermind that

1659
01:35:51,738 --> 01:35:56,698
was misleading we hadn't actually done

1660
01:35:54,779 --> 01:35:59,729
that yet so here we are actually

1661
01:35:56,698 --> 01:36:03,178
performing the call to condense

1662
01:35:59,729 --> 01:36:07,348
whitespace so it is possible that we

1663
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:13,649
still screw this up great so let's go

1664
01:36:07,349 --> 01:36:33,360
ahead and do that we're copying a to

1665
01:36:13,649 --> 01:36:37,069
itself which seems safe so again that

1666
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:37,069
looks just fine

1667
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:45,629
yet color should be fine we're gonna hop

1668
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:50,609
into drawstring and we're passing the

1669
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:52,400
string down here is it still valid sure

1670
01:36:50,609 --> 01:36:56,339
seems like it

1671
01:36:52,399 --> 01:37:06,058
so when we actually step through the

1672
01:36:56,340 --> 01:37:09,389
code I don't know why we would be having

1673
01:37:06,059 --> 01:37:11,639
a problem with that so maybe we're

1674
01:37:09,389 --> 01:37:15,090
getting like an invalid font or

1675
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:17,010
something or I don't know but like it

1676
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:18,779
looks like we're passing a valid string

1677
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:23,579
down it's just the drawing doesn't seem

1678
01:37:18,779 --> 01:37:32,880
to be working and you can see it reading

1679
01:37:23,578 --> 01:37:35,340
off as it goes I don't know I guess

1680
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:39,029
maybe in translating fully process byte

1681
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:41,159
is it possible that that is generating

1682
01:37:39,029 --> 01:37:44,130
something bad like we have the language

1683
01:37:41,158 --> 01:37:48,078
set up wrong or something or the font

1684
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:48,078
pointers are garbage or

1685
01:37:49,078 --> 01:38:01,500
I mean that does look bogus there again

1686
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:03,150
this is release mode build some that

1687
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:06,539
100's certain it's actually has that

1688
01:38:03,149 --> 01:38:09,558
right but if it did it could because the

1689
01:38:06,539 --> 01:38:09,559
font is garbage

1690
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:29,339
I don't know what to make a bat

1691
01:38:33,689 --> 01:38:49,328
maybe our font is not getting maybe our

1692
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:51,159
font is not getting your 7o so so I

1693
01:38:49,328 --> 01:38:53,319
don't know like I was expecting to see

1694
01:38:51,158 --> 01:38:54,460
something else there I wasn't expecting

1695
01:38:53,319 --> 01:38:56,349
to see what I saw

1696
01:38:54,460 --> 01:39:01,179
so now I'm not sure where we're getting

1697
01:38:56,349 --> 01:39:04,900
that why we were getting that bug maybe

1698
01:39:01,179 --> 01:39:09,039
I ran the wrong version I know seemed

1699
01:39:04,899 --> 01:39:10,509
bad but let's see so here we go into

1700
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:17,019
handmade here I'm gonna start cutting

1701
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:22,360
and pasting things now so there we go

1702
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:25,989
like now it's broken but only just now

1703
01:39:22,359 --> 01:39:29,920
oh so is it just when something's too

1704
01:39:25,988 --> 01:39:32,678
long it's just when something's too long

1705
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:36,429
so it only seems to be happening if we

1706
01:39:32,679 --> 01:39:44,800
provide a buffer that is too small for

1707
01:39:36,429 --> 01:39:47,170
the copy that's coming in right so

1708
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:51,820
that's very interesting so if I rebake

1709
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:54,569
here that may give us some insight into

1710
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:54,569
the problem

1711
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:05,940
I'm gonna hop back here I'm gonna set a

1712
01:40:02,729 --> 01:40:09,719
breakpoint here and I'm gonna come in

1713
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:14,250
and see what happens so if I say total

1714
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:20,539
length its 27 that's what we expect

1715
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:20,539
what's inside the temp buffer is nothing

1716
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:27,420
so I'm gonna go ahead and say this is I

1717
01:40:25,529 --> 01:40:29,069
don't know if the word bug is

1718
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:30,569
appropriate here because maybe this

1719
01:40:29,069 --> 01:40:36,359
isn't what's supposed to happen but it

1720
01:40:30,569 --> 01:40:42,779
does seem like when we jump into this

1721
01:40:36,359 --> 01:40:46,199
part of the code here this doesn't seem

1722
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:47,759
to be copying in anything like it's

1723
01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:51,119
returning a science value that's

1724
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:54,210
completely bogus in a sense like it's

1725
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:56,039
telling us that it's this big and it's

1726
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:58,380
returning that size value regardless how

1727
01:40:56,039 --> 01:40:59,850
much of copies in so we then have no

1728
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:01,260
idea how much a copies and it doesn't

1729
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:05,280
seem to copy as much as it could have

1730
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:10,680
copied so what's happening inside that

1731
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:13,050
copy function let's take a look but that

1732
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:19,500
seems to be our problem so inside here

1733
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:21,690
where we call copy how do I get how do I

1734
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:31,050
get a look at that so I think that's a

1735
01:41:21,689 --> 01:41:33,539
string for quarter string oops and that

1736
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:36,060
would be from a string to a string so

1737
01:41:33,539 --> 01:41:46,859
that's that's this one here so that

1738
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:49,400
would call copy SS right copy checked SS

1739
01:41:46,859 --> 01:41:49,399
I guess

1740
01:41:50,238 --> 01:42:00,679
ah so yeah I mean that's gonna do it

1741
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:02,869
unfortunately what I would rather it

1742
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:08,960
have done there is clamped the size so

1743
01:42:02,869 --> 01:42:12,409
we could at least copy the rest of the

1744
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:15,069
thing like is there a reason we can't

1745
01:42:12,409 --> 01:42:15,069
just do this

1746
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:25,400
right

1747
01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:27,260
I mean copy as much as you can and I'll

1748
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:28,909
let Alan suss that out he's probably

1749
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:34,340
already got something that effectively

1750
01:42:28,909 --> 01:42:38,619
does that but you know basically what

1751
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:38,619
we're talking about is just saying hey

1752
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:53,060
copy size equals the destination size so

1753
01:42:50,949 --> 01:43:02,719
that's how much we're gonna copy in

1754
01:42:53,060 --> 01:43:11,660
right but if the copy size is or rather

1755
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:14,090
I guess I want to say the other way this

1756
01:43:11,659 --> 01:43:16,699
is how much we would like to copy if we

1757
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:19,279
would exceed this space that exists in

1758
01:43:16,699 --> 01:43:23,238
the buffer then we just set it to that

1759
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:25,639
much so it just clamps it down right so

1760
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:29,238
then we can just proceed as normal using

1761
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:31,640
this copy size and then it'll just work

1762
01:43:29,238 --> 01:43:35,799
in all cases and if we would have

1763
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:35,800
overflowed we only use like a

1764
01:43:41,109 --> 01:43:46,719
if it would have overflowed we just use

1765
01:43:43,448 --> 01:43:48,969
however much we could have used so the

1766
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,649
return value in this case is just to

1767
01:43:48,969 --> 01:43:53,050
tell us whether we could or couldn't fit

1768
01:43:50,649 --> 01:43:58,269
the whole thing we can still retain that

1769
01:43:53,050 --> 01:44:00,250
behavior by basically saying look assume

1770
01:43:58,270 --> 01:44:12,690
that we succeed and in the case where we

1771
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:15,880
have to clamp we fail right I guess

1772
01:44:12,689 --> 01:44:19,539
that's it so then what I would say is

1773
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:21,909
hey man like give give me you know

1774
01:44:19,539 --> 01:44:23,800
give me the as much as you can out of

1775
01:44:21,908 --> 01:44:25,299
the clipboard buffer and and then we

1776
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:30,070
don't have to worry about this so much

1777
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:34,980
right so now I think I would probably be

1778
01:44:30,069 --> 01:44:39,250
able to get this going right now I hope

1779
01:44:34,979 --> 01:44:42,729
if I start to get larger things then fit

1780
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:45,460
in the buffer it would just work so you

1781
01:44:42,729 --> 01:44:51,779
know if I cut that whole line all right

1782
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:51,779
or not ker what did I do wrong there

1783
01:45:00,038 --> 01:45:04,569
is the copy size is greater than the

1784
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:08,199
destination memory size the copy size

1785
01:45:04,569 --> 01:45:11,618
equals the destination memory size and

1786
01:45:08,198 --> 01:45:15,779
then befell our result the destination

1787
01:45:11,618 --> 01:45:20,518
string is what it is we copied that much

1788
01:45:15,779 --> 01:45:20,518
that all looks fine doesn't it

1789
01:45:25,769 --> 01:45:35,320
what's wrong with that oh I'll tell you

1790
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:37,989
what's wrong with that we're not

1791
01:45:35,319 --> 01:45:39,279
building for coder I had commented that

1792
01:45:37,988 --> 01:45:41,828
out because we were only working on a

1793
01:45:39,279 --> 01:45:46,599
custom layer so that change wouldn't

1794
01:45:41,828 --> 01:45:50,500
take effect now it will have all right

1795
01:45:46,599 --> 01:45:56,250
so if I go ahead and run hopefully now

1796
01:45:50,500 --> 01:46:04,179
we can get into a better place yeah

1797
01:45:56,250 --> 01:46:06,099
perfect all right cool so now we've got

1798
01:46:04,179 --> 01:46:07,809
that satis update uh-oh we've only got

1799
01:46:06,099 --> 01:46:12,369
42 seconds left do we got drinking other

1800
01:46:07,809 --> 01:46:13,869
announces of this stuff let's turn back

1801
01:46:12,368 --> 01:46:16,118
off that compile because we don't really

1802
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:20,158
need to be doing that most of the time I

1803
01:46:16,118 --> 01:46:20,158
got to go get more hold on a second

1804
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:36,300
alright folks here we go

1805
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:37,770
I got to be careful because I don't

1806
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:40,550
drink this whole thing I just drink down

1807
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:40,550
to the 8 ounce line

1808
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:16,659
looks about right so how much have we

1809
01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:19,689
done so far so five three two six three

1810
01:48:16,659 --> 01:48:21,189
so yeah so we we have done by the time I

1811
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:24,009
drink this one down which I will before

1812
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:27,729
the end of stream by the time I drink

1813
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:36,789
this one down we will have drank half of

1814
01:48:27,729 --> 01:48:37,359
the gavel 8c for tonight alright so

1815
01:48:36,789 --> 01:48:38,949
there we go

1816
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:42,119
let's keep going on here so we've got

1817
01:48:38,949 --> 01:48:45,010
that listening working there pretty well

1818
01:48:42,119 --> 01:48:49,449
and so that seems fine to me and also I

1819
01:48:45,010 --> 01:48:51,400
wanted that auto tab thing to happen too

1820
01:48:49,449 --> 01:48:56,170
so let's take a look at where we get

1821
01:48:51,399 --> 01:49:12,609
that information from so inside my let's

1822
01:48:56,170 --> 01:49:14,500
see here first tab word complete so

1823
01:49:12,609 --> 01:49:18,329
let's look at the information when were

1824
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:18,329
complete I have no idea what that does

1825
01:49:46,210 --> 01:49:58,380
so I guess what I would say about that

1826
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:58,380
is that looks way too expensive

1827
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:28,230
yeah alright so that might just be too

1828
01:50:21,369 --> 01:50:28,229
difficult I don't know

1829
01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:43,449
I mean I guess what I would say is I

1830
01:50:41,619 --> 01:50:46,149
think this certainly could be made to be

1831
01:50:43,449 --> 01:50:48,909
something that just works and we could

1832
01:50:46,149 --> 01:50:51,819
call on every character and it wouldn't

1833
01:50:48,909 --> 01:50:53,949
be a problem but I don't think I want to

1834
01:50:51,819 --> 01:50:57,880
tackle that so I guess we'll just we

1835
01:50:53,949 --> 01:51:00,039
won't have that feature that's fine so

1836
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:04,440
yeah so the question then becomes I

1837
01:51:00,039 --> 01:51:12,100
guess what we want to know now is if I

1838
01:51:04,439 --> 01:51:14,169
you know have it in this view I guess I

1839
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:16,570
want to leave a little bit of space for

1840
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:21,730
that here and we'll just move everything

1841
01:51:16,569 --> 01:51:24,939
over in terms of the bins and we'll just

1842
01:51:21,729 --> 01:51:28,119
leave this as something separate right

1843
01:51:24,939 --> 01:51:32,229
like that can just be its own thing

1844
01:51:28,119 --> 01:51:41,439
so let me go ahead and switch over there

1845
01:51:32,229 --> 01:51:48,899
to the render and what we'll do is we'll

1846
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:48,899
just say yeah before the bins happen

1847
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:59,230
right here we'll go ahead and make that

1848
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:01,350
work and one of the interesting things

1849
01:51:59,229 --> 01:52:05,979
about it is we couldn't just treat it as

1850
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:08,800
initial bin because actually we were

1851
01:52:05,979 --> 01:52:12,039
kind of previously doing that like I

1852
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:13,690
have been zero is intentionally not

1853
01:52:12,039 --> 01:52:14,050
displayed it's sort of like a phantom

1854
01:52:13,689 --> 01:52:15,549
bin

1855
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:18,250
it's a favorite I wanted to have a null

1856
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:23,829
bin potentially and so what I could do

1857
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:28,329
is just say oh yeah like the thing is

1858
01:52:23,829 --> 01:52:38,380
going to be based on the number of bins

1859
01:52:28,329 --> 01:52:41,649
total and the bin goes this way I guess

1860
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:44,079
and that way there'd be like one bin

1861
01:52:41,649 --> 01:52:47,649
just kind of like phantom sitting there

1862
01:52:44,079 --> 01:52:50,590
with nothing on it right and so like

1863
01:52:47,649 --> 01:52:52,119
this right here would be the cut and

1864
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:53,470
paste

1865
01:52:52,119 --> 01:52:55,559
thing would go right there right and

1866
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:58,150
then all the F bins happen after that

1867
01:52:55,560 --> 01:53:00,520
and so that way you could always see

1868
01:52:58,149 --> 01:53:02,739
what that was and if you zoom up you can

1869
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:05,770
get more of them and we could make it so

1870
01:53:02,739 --> 01:53:06,929
that we just do a lot more than 16 as

1871
01:53:05,770 --> 01:53:11,620
well like it's got the whole

1872
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:15,430
cut-and-paste history in there and then

1873
01:53:11,619 --> 01:53:17,019
oops that's not what I want to do so if

1874
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:19,150
we actually did it that way where we

1875
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:21,490
just kept going and in fact I could do

1876
01:53:19,149 --> 01:53:27,719
this a little bit differently so what I

1877
01:53:21,489 --> 01:53:31,539
could do is say look just keep going I

1878
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:37,119
don't care how long you do it right just

1879
01:53:31,539 --> 01:53:40,439
keep going until the y-coordinate in

1880
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:45,220
question passes outside of the view

1881
01:53:40,439 --> 01:53:54,969
right so as long as the Y is on this

1882
01:53:45,220 --> 01:53:57,039
side of the the of the visible area of

1883
01:53:54,970 --> 01:53:59,860
this sort of gutter window thing we're

1884
01:53:57,039 --> 01:54:01,779
making just keep going and that way

1885
01:53:59,859 --> 01:54:03,519
we'll just ask for as many as we

1886
01:54:01,779 --> 01:54:05,439
actually need to fill it rather than

1887
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:07,540
saying 64 should be enough for anybody

1888
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:11,589
or whatever just like look we'll do as

1889
01:54:07,539 --> 01:54:15,100
many as there as fit right and so if I

1890
01:54:11,590 --> 01:54:21,400
take a look here at ya at the plus plus

1891
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:24,250
is you know what I think that I think

1892
01:54:21,399 --> 01:54:26,349
the the color is starting so I think

1893
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:28,449
we're gonna have to call the stream we

1894
01:54:26,350 --> 01:54:32,170
almost made it to the next round of Java

1895
01:54:28,449 --> 01:54:35,470
light but not quite so I'm going to have

1896
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:39,239
to go colon cleanse myself it will not

1897
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:41,619
be pleasant folks but you know trust me

1898
01:54:39,239 --> 01:54:45,340
you're lucky you don't have to be a part

1899
01:54:41,619 --> 01:54:47,680
of it well and that was the end of the

1900
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:50,520
stream - I guess we we timed that pretty

1901
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:52,690
darn well if I do say so myself

1902
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:54,280
we timed that pretty darn well well

1903
01:54:52,689 --> 01:54:57,939
let's verify it let's let's just close

1904
01:54:54,279 --> 01:55:00,789
this down and and let's verify that it

1905
01:54:57,939 --> 01:55:03,759
worked and then we'll say good night and

1906
01:55:00,789 --> 01:55:04,979
I'll talk to you after I've had someone

1907
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:06,810
stick a camera

1908
01:55:04,979 --> 01:55:10,349
really up my butt that's like actually

1909
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:13,680
what's about to happen okay so if I look

1910
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:16,530
here let me see

1911
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:26,760
did I recompile that I'm actually not

1912
01:55:16,529 --> 01:55:30,630
that resided here we go hello so a

1913
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:35,369
reason that didn't build switch for

1914
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:43,220
coder built oh yes there goes all right

1915
01:55:35,369 --> 01:55:43,220
so we're built and we ran there we go

1916
01:55:43,729 --> 01:55:53,069
perfect so we still got more to do maybe

1917
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:57,800
we'll do some more after someone has

1918
01:55:53,069 --> 01:56:01,199
stuck a stuck a camera up my butt but

1919
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:03,180
you know no promises I may just go

1920
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:04,679
finish this stuff on my own I only

1921
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:05,789
really wanted to stream it today because

1922
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:06,840
I just figured it would keep my mind off

1923
01:56:05,789 --> 01:56:09,479
the fact that I hadn't had anything to

1924
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:12,930
eat which you know I'm person who likes

1925
01:56:09,479 --> 01:56:15,539
to eat so that was not fun and continues

1926
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:21,140
to not be fun but alright thank you so

1927
01:56:15,539 --> 01:56:24,539
much for joining me and I guess I will

1928
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:26,550
if I don't stream anymore for our coder

1929
01:56:24,539 --> 01:56:28,019
streams this week then I will see you

1930
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:30,449
this weekend for the return of handmade

1931
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:31,530
hero which I'm looking forward to so see

1932
01:56:30,449 --> 01:56:34,679
you back here this weekend for that

1933
01:56:31,529 --> 01:56:38,340
check the handmade org slash watch page

1934
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:41,579
for more info on that otherwise have fun

1935
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:42,119
programming folks and I'll see you on

1936
01:56:41,579 --> 01:56:44,630
the Internet

1937
01:56:42,119 --> 01:56:44,630
take it easy everybody
