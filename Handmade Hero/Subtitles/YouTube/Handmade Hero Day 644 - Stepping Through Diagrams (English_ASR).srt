00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,720
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,960
hero show we code a complete game live

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,359
on stream uh we

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,960
currently need to

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,599
add some things

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,278
to our visualization in order to track

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,439
down a bug i believe we can still uh

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,719
trigger in our collision detector

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,759
um i can't quite remember

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,358
uh last week if we

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,960
were still able to trigger it reliably

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,960
but i'm pretty sure we were

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,640
i'm pretty sure it's like you go

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,439
up here

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,039
um

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,799
and you

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,039
right at this intersection here we've

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,718
turned off all of the textures

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,320
on the walls and stuff so you know

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,399
they're just like the blue outlines

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,520
right now of the collision geometry

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,399
and if i

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
throw that glove up in the corner

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,239
like that

25
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:56,000
um my recollection is that you could get

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,359
into a situation where it will tunnel

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,238
you know what i mean

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,479
um so it'll it'll like tunnel through

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:02,479
uh

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,239
and you know i'm

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,478
totally failing to do it but you know

32
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,359
there was there was a bug here or at

33
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,319
least i thought there was

34
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,319
i

35
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,919
and i don't remember if maybe like we

36
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,519
ended up in a situation where we can't

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,879
really reproduce it very well because we

38
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,640
fixed something

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,039
um but i thought we could still do it

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,719
and then what i was saying is that in

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,560
order to find that because it's very

42
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,359
like hard to

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,320
uh debug something like that

44
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,000
uh without some way of

45
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,239
being able to like sort of step through

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,920
it and see what happens uh the idea was

47
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,319
gonna be we we need to do something

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,320
where we

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,960
uh where we like can single step through

50
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,280
things so i was like you know what i'll

51
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,478
do is i'll single step through it

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,640
now why i cannot redo it i'm not sure

53
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,718
like i said you know i i have so much

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,439
stuff to do during the week i forget

55
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,118
usually like where i left off

56
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,438
uh on doing seven handmade heroes so it

57
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,159
could be that we changed like changing

58
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,279
the way that the uh embedding code

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,719
worked

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,318
makes it so that this doesn't happen

61
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,359
anymore or something

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,199
but i could have sworn

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,280
that we at least had

64
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,958
i mean i remember saying i'm like next

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,560
week

66
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,400
we'll have to do this

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,800
it's been two weeks

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,920
um so i give myself a little bit more of

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
a pass

70
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,679
but the fact that i can't make it happen

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
is sort of depressing um

72
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,239
so that's unfortunate i'm not sure what

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,319
to do about that i was i thought

74
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,680
uh and maybe i'm wrong about that but i

75
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,518
thought that we

76
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,400
were still having that and maybe we're

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,959
not

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,319
um okay so at least we're still having

79
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,479
this one

80
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,679
there we go so if i walk backwards

81
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,840
through here

82
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
um you can see it getting stuck in there

83
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,319
so hey i've got something i can debug

84
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,439
anyway which is all we really care about

85
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:00,878
uh

86
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,239
as far as like putting together the

87
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,039
system

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,560
so

89
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,679
what you could kind of see happening

90
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,439
here right

91
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,200
uh there's a few things that are going

92
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,878
on um

93
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,878
to be honest i'm not 100 certain uh i

94
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,759
think what we did is we have a thing in

95
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,120
there that stops the recording whenever

96
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,840
uh somebody

97
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,959
whenever it uh triggers a case

98
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
where

99
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,799
yeah yeah i remember this now

100
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,840
it stops the recording

101
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,080
um

102
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,840
whenever you end up in a case

103
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,159
where you uh

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,080
you find yourself

105
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,158
colliding on

106
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,440
all four points or something like that

107
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:46,000
or more or all uh all eight where you

108
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,000
find yourself embedded

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,759
um it stops recording or something like

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,919
that i i don't remember the exact

111
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,039
specifics but like we can go and look at

112
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,158
the code

113
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,400
and

114
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,959
that should not be happening

115
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,400
like well like in these situations as

116
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,280
far as i know

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,599
uh

118
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,640
we we probably shouldn't have that hap

119
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,318
happen

120
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,199
now i don't know if that's actually true

121
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,039
because um oh wait no i do i was gonna

122
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,199
say because there's like the head on the

123
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,159
guy that could push us in that's what we

124
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:19,120
did we removed the head collider

125
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,439
so when we move through the world

126
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
the glove can move anywhere it wants the

127
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,519
glove is basically unconstrained right

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,959
now there's nothing forcing it uh into

129
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,439
like a bad position or anything like

130
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,159
that right

131
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,639
so

132
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
the fact that it can get stuck doesn't

133
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,840
make any sense

134
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
right it shouldn't be able to end up in

135
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,679
a situation where it gets in that case

136
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,479
like that right

137
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,560
um

138
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,439
it should not be able to do that uh

139
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
because

140
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:51,360
the fact that it can do that

141
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,360
means that it somehow has a like um

142
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,520
it somehow

143
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,679
left itself in a cell

144
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,639
that when it ended

145
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,400
it thought that cell was open

146
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,319
meaning it was a cell that could be

147
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,879
moved through

148
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,120
but when it started the next frame

149
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,319
it thought the cell could not be moved

150
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,478
through

151
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,038
now it's worth noting

152
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,000
and this is a very creepy

153
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,719
uh

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,918
coincidence so it suggests that maybe

155
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,840
this is also

156
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,839
implicated in it

157
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,439
you may have noticed that this why is

158
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,000
this drawing

159
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,120
i'll make this full screen

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,079
why is this drawing over here

161
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,879
right

162
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,639
it doesn't make a lot of sense does it

163
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,000
um

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,079
well

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,240
you have to remember that this

166
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,399
we did the extra work in the engine for

167
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,918
this game which is you know just because

168
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,439
i was trying to show like interesting

169
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,599
things that you might

170
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,360
want to do if you program

171
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,439
we did the extra work in this game

172
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,000
necessary to make it so that there's no

173
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,800
bounds on the world size

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,199
so

175
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,520
basically like you can make the game be

176
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,439
you know as large as you want

177
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,879
and in order to facilitate that we made

178
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,959
it so that the camera itself only moves

179
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,560
in a very small range of floating point

180
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,560
values and we just map the world into

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,120
that local range so that the floating

182
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
point values work

183
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,079
right

184
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,280
so that

185
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:36,159
operation every time you cross a

186
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,879
boundary like re-centers the camera

187
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,960
and so when you see that happen

188
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,120
that is because the camera

189
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,399
re-centered to a new location which is

190
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,519
here

191
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,359
and in doing so it's still drawing this

192
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,560
because these are recorded without these

193
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,080
are recorded in just a debug recorder

194
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,038
the debug recorder doesn't know where

195
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,120
they are

196
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,318
it knows just where they are relative to

197
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,360
the camera

198
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,800
so

199
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,439
the reason that this is very troubling

200
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,840
is because you'll notice that the glove

201
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,719
only seems to get stuck

202
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:14,079
when the camera moves like that

203
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,919
right the two places that get stuck

204
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:21,120
are the two times right that you

205
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,758
have the camera recenter

206
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,439
now when the camera recenters

207
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,680
it is true that the floating point

208
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,918
consistency will be slightly off

209
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,199
because since everything's relative

210
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,639
location

211
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,038
uh is

212
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,038
to one center which is the previous

213
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,038
camera origin

214
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,879
and then on the next frame everything is

215
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,318
updated to be relative to a different

216
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,719
camera center

217
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,800
which is the new camera origin

218
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,560
the floating point computations from the

219
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,680
first one will not match the floating

220
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,598
point computations from the second one

221
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,759
so it is theoretically possible

222
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,399
theoretically possible

223
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,479
that you could have the exact correct

224
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,239
placement of something

225
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,959
such that when you change the camera

226
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,280
center something that was just floating

227
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,560
point rounding away

228
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,359
right

229
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,240
from being considered in betting

230
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,120
suddenly isn't floating point rounding

231
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,079
away

232
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,720
from being embedded

233
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:26,959
that's entirely possible

234
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,520
right that's entirely possible

235
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,519
however

236
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,519
the reason that i'm not

237
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,598
even a little bit without further

238
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,200
investigation willing to say that that's

239
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,800
what's going on here

240
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,519
is because it would be really strange if

241
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,359
literally like both doorways that we

242
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,919
happen to walk through at the beginning

243
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,919
of the game

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,958
both had that exact crazy floating point

245
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:56,559
rounding scenario happen

246
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,879
when you walk through them every time

247
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,879
right

248
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:05,039
it doesn't seem super plausible to me

249
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,519
that that could be what's going on

250
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,838
so i'm worried that there's some

251
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,720
more severe problem

252
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,320
that has to do with camera recentering

253
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,519
that is causing

254
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,360
a much more likely to occur failure of

255
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,320
that kind

256
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,000
um and that is why i would like to

257
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,680
investigate this because a a floating

258
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,039
point error of the kind that i just

259
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,958
discussed

260
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,000
is not something you would expect to

261
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:37,199
happen very often it's one of those like

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,720
rare cases you know

263
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,920
so

264
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,959
i'm worried

265
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,120
i think we have a more serious problem

266
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,479
and i would that is really what i'd like

267
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,159
to investigate

268
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,680
um

269
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,278
and the fact that i can't reproduce the

270
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,239
other bug we could go back and watch the

271
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,080
video from last uh from two weeks ago

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
it might be that like this was just an

273
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,000
embedding bug problem

274
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,519
uh that we fixed

275
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
um

276
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,879
because we had like not had the

277
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,600
embedding code turned on properly or

278
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,600
whatever it is

279
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,720
so

280
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,759
maybe that's just not a re maybe that

281
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,480
just can't be reproduced now like maybe

282
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:21,439
that bug is is basically gone i'm not

283
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,440
sure uh so so i'm willing to give up on

284
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,000
reproducing that one temporarily uh

285
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,760
maybe we can go watch the video

286
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,240
uh later and see

287
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:33,838
if that's what we did but

288
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,839
uh in general yeah i would say

289
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,958
seems reasonable seems reasonable

290
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,440
um you know that reminds me

291
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:49,439
644 i should double check before we

292
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,440
start programming did we check in

293
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,359
last week

294
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
i'm so busy these days i

295
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,360
have no idea what's going on most of the

296
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
time

297
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,000
but i want to make sure we checked in

298
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,360
the latest one

299
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,399
uh code codebase

300
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,399
yeah 643.

301
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,759
so that's all

302
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,800
good 643

303
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,720
and 644.

304
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,240
so i think that's it that's really all

305
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,000
um i just want a ways of polishing up

306
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,600
this collision detector and i feel like

307
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,120
i need um

308
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,240
i just need a bit way to step through

309
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
this better if i'm going to be able to

310
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,278
do that

311
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,879
it's a bummer that this happens to only

312
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,720
occur at that

313
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,600
recentering point and the reason that

314
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,839
that's a bit of a bummer is because uh

315
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,480
that means that

316
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,160
the drawing of it will be kind of wonky

317
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,680
like it'll have to draw in a different

318
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,600
place that's okay because i guess we

319
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,919
don't really care but it's still like

320
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,519
kind of that's too bad right

321
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,479
it's the worst case for us for debug

322
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,159
viewing

323
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,560
because we don't track the location of

324
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,879
things like that we could try

325
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,879
um

326
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,278
and the way we would do that is that

327
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,399
when we call recenter we would also call

328
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,078
recenter on the debug drawing um and

329
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,320
maybe that's worth doing

330
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,319
uh

331
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,958
there's like a call

332
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,120
um that we call

333
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,559
here right

334
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,480
and

335
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,599
you know this nonsense

336
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,079
tells us what we're gonna do for moving

337
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,759
the camera stuff around

338
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,719
right

339
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:42,639
and so you can see here there's like

340
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,639
the camera target p and the camera p

341
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,240
uh

342
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,200
are updated

343
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,200
via this function

344
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,759
inside the world mode

345
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,278
when we call update camera for entity

346
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,439
movement

347
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,838
which is here

348
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,680
uh you can see

349
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,680
that there's like

350
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,359
already a little stuff that updates like

351
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,120
a few things just like oh you should you

352
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,759
should place it relative to this or

353
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,240
whatever it is right

354
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,120
so you know we could do a thing where we

355
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,720
just

356
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,959
pass like a

357
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,480
into the diagramming system we just like

358
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,439
pass

359
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,519
a thing that will update stuff based on

360
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,839
this change

361
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,839
and

362
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:35,838
i mean maybe that's worth it if you look

363
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,839
at the diagramming system

364
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,278
it wouldn't be very difficult to do

365
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,198
uh

366
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,000
you know if you imagine

367
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,679
just a thing that's like

368
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,240
this

369
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,599
where you say like hey offset the debug

370
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,919
diagrams

371
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,920
uh

372
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,760
where you can update them or whatever in

373
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,759
fact i think it should be like

374
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,120
probably like this

375
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,039
uh if you have something like this and

376
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,360
you just pass in an offset

377
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,278
uh to like you know whatever it's gonna

378
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,639
be

379
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,078
we should be able to do something like

380
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,879
this

381
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,559
where we loop through all these guys and

382
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,198
by the way uh if you see what's

383
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,198
happening here

384
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,399
uh

385
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,959
one of the things that's kind of

386
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,639
annoying this is why like unions are not

387
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,439
the best thing sometimes

388
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,879
is if these had just been expanded you

389
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,800
could basically just do this in a

390
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,759
polymorphic kind of way automatically

391
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,198
right

392
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,958
the fact that it's a union means we do

393
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,439
have to check to make sure that it's

394
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,479
something that actually has like points

395
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,120
in it

396
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,680
you know what i'm saying uh like one of

397
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,679
these things

398
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,599
and to be honest i forget what overlay

399
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,600
was even supposed to be

400
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,759
i don't know if overly doesn't really

401
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,638
have any parameters so i think it's just

402
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,159
these

403
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,440
um so it's not the end of the world but

404
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,198
you can see why you know sometimes it's

405
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
easier if you don't use a union it's

406
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,679
just a quick case of whether you're

407
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,720
trying to

408
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,078
um

409
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,759
keep things like compact or not

410
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,039
but basically like you wouldn't have to

411
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,198
do this switch

412
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,879
you would just offset the points

413
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,479
if you weren't doing this

414
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,198
right

415
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,800
um but it's still really easy

416
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:30,319
so it's not worth getting um

417
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,559
you know upset about but you know it's

418
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,320
just an example of something to be aware

419
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,078
of

420
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,360
so in this case we don't have anything

421
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,000
to do in the default case there's

422
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,360
nothing

423
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,360
so we don't have to but

424
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,639
if we did have other things that we

425
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,000
wanted to change offsets of we would

426
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,480
so that's it

427
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,600
uh and now all we have to do is uh go

428
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,959
and actually call this with some offset

429
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
variable

430
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,239
that will move the things to where we

431
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,320
need them to go

432
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,720
so it would be something like this

433
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,079
where we said like you know all right

434
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,720
the old

435
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,719
blah is something the new blah is

436
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,240
something

437
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,560
i don't know whether the target p or the

438
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,159
regular p are the things that we want

439
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:26,319
here but i assume it's target p

440
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,000
not camera location

441
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,839
um because the camera location just can

442
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,078
move all around or whatever right

443
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,399
so i'm assuming that when we do our like

444
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,039
sim you know our simulation center i

445
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,320
guess it's just this right

446
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,799
if we wanted to look at the difference

447
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,199
between those two things we could just

448
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:46,479
like actually check

449
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,679
and do that update i

450
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,000
think

451
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,000
because all these things happen first

452
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
that actually like you know we might

453
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,240
want to just do it this way

454
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,519
where we just go up here and say

455
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,360
um

456
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,839
when we are going to

457
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,838
actually like when we actually

458
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,838
start

459
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,959
start the frame

460
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,640
that's when we would do the offset based

461
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,959
on whatever we're going to set the

462
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,880
camera placement to

463
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,318
um so like right here where we do like

464
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,600
the camera transform or whatever we're

465
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,519
going to do

466
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,678
it might actually be here

467
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:26,240
that makes more sense for that

468
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,240
probably

469
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,240
um

470
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,558
yeah

471
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,160
so that's my guess and

472
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,480
we may already have the information that

473
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,640
we need i'm not sure

474
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,640
but we may already have the information

475
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,360
so if we look at like game camera

476
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
we're keeping

477
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,038
one of those

478
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,519
right

479
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,519
and

480
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,359
we may already have a thing that says

481
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:08,719
where it was last time i don't actually

482
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,959
know

483
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,120
uh but like we have to do this for the

484
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,279
lighting

485
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,279
excuse already

486
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,038
like when you look at lighting center we

487
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,279
have to do this already

488
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,279
uh

489
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,000
it may be that we keep that in the

490
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:26,839
lighting system but you can see why i'm

491
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,558
like

492
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,720
meh

493
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,038
uh you would imagine that this would

494
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,480
just be something yeah like

495
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,400
so you see how

496
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,279
like there's

497
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,720
information here about the origin

498
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,000
my assumption is that we just like

499
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,640
probably kept that in the lighting

500
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,640
system but you know um here

501
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,918
so you can see like this last origin p

502
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:56,639
here is kept inside the lighting system

503
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,919
so it's kind of do like a duplicate

504
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,440
piece of work if i keep it in two places

505
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,200
so it kind of feels like we don't really

506
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,519
want to do that

507
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,880
um

508
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,279
but i don't know

509
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,039
it depends how you look at it

510
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,279
uh whether you want to unify those or

511
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,279
not

512
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,038
but what you can see

513
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,919
is this test

514
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,599
right here

515
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,000
um is doing exactly what we were just

516
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,159
suggesting

517
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,798
we take like the

518
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,480
lighting and we move it based on when

519
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,839
the camera changes

520
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,558
and you can see

521
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:47,519
it you know just proceeds from there

522
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,918
after having done an offset

523
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,798
and then it just keeps going

524
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,280
so

525
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,599
you know

526
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,759
do we want to do that do we want to do

527
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:01,678
that i'm not sure

528
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:04,240
for now i think i might just say

529
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,200
maybe systems do this themselves to

530
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,880
avoid

531
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,159
uh people

532
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,360
getting out of sync in like calls

533
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,799
so

534
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,839
you know

535
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,038
here's another thought

536
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,959
maybe we

537
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,400
actually just

538
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,038
roll this into

539
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,240
a offset that everyone uses

540
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,038
so like

541
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,798
for example

542
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,079
what we could do

543
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,079
is say

544
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,079
that

545
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,759
at the

546
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,319
top of the frame

547
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,319
we tell you what the simulation center

548
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,319
is

549
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,319
like this

550
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,519
and then maybe the it just does this

551
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,639
itself

552
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,359
so like

553
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,038
there's in the diagram system there's

554
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,798
just like a call

555
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,000
you know what i mean

556
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,639
um

557
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,038
and maybe this goes away

558
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,520
so there's like a

559
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:19,200
a set origin thing

560
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,200
and it takes like a world position

561
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,840
uh that's the origin and the offset is

562
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,240
like it will compute it

563
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,240
you know

564
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:29,798
so

565
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,399
i think i like this a little bit better

566
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,600
that i think

567
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,279
has a higher chance of working reliably

568
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,798
so like if you imagine in here we're

569
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,798
just like all right you know there's

570
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,360
one of these things

571
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,720
um

572
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:58,359
and we just do like

573
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,360
if they're not equal

574
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,079
if they're not equal we just update and

575
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:14,240
the offset is just like subtracts

576
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,319
the movement that we need to get

577
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,919
ourselves uh between these two i have to

578
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,759
think about this i always think of this

579
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,080
i'm bad at these sorts of things

580
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,759
i oftentimes get it wrong

581
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,559
oops

582
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,158
uh i oftentimes get it wrong here the

583
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,399
[Music]

584
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,280
nice job

585
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,280
let's try that again

586
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,558
uh

587
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:42,000
so if i want these things to be relative

588
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:44,158
to the new origin right so i've got

589
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,720
things around an origin a and i'm going

590
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,000
to a new origin b

591
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:55,240
then it means that i need to take yeah i

592
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,240
should just do this out longhand um

593
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,720
this is where uh computer aided algebra

594
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,519
should just be built in to editors

595
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,319
but

596
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,440
yeah

597
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,399
doesn't matter

598
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,440
anyway

599
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,600
uh so you know i've got something like

600
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,400
the origin a

601
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,399
plus the the offset right

602
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,559
and it is

603
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,480
uh needs to be equal to origin b

604
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,759
plus the new offset

605
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,240
right maybe i'll use u and v

606
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,158
so v is the new offset u is the old

607
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,079
offset right

608
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,799
and i need these two things to be equal

609
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:40,079
so a plus the new offset and b plus the

610
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,679
old offset have to be in the same place

611
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,678
i think that's roughly what we're trying

612
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,720
to do here

613
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,519
so if i need to now solve for like what

614
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,200
this

615
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,960
value is

616
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,640
right

617
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,319
um

618
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,240
i need to do

619
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,798
i need to subtract this over to the

620
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,720
other side right so i need a like minus

621
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,519
b plus u equals b or whatever right

622
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,558
um

623
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,278
so

624
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,720
a minus b is the value that i would want

625
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,798
to add

626
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,240
to the old one

627
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:16,240
um and so it is subtracting the new

628
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,679
origin which is the opposite of what you

629
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,000
would normally think

630
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,519
so unless i screwed that up that's why i

631
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,278
say often get this wrong like you know

632
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,720
my guess was the wrong way round which

633
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,159
is exactly

634
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,519
i guess you could say my guess was right

635
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,640
in the sense that i guessed that this

636
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,879
was wrong

637
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,559
um so you want to

638
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,720
subtract

639
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,158
the old origin from the new

640
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,960
you want to subtract the new origin from

641
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,960
the old origin

642
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,960
so you want it to look like that

643
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,400
which is the opposite of what you would

644
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,798
do if you weren't trying to re-center

645
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,960
right so that's why it's a little bit

646
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,400
you know

647
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,840
it's a little bit squeaky now that all

648
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,840
that said may i may just have done it

649
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,439
wrong cuz like i said it's always wrong

650
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,839
we'll know pretty quickly because things

651
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,640
will not

652
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,119
work

653
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,880
uh but that's my first guess right

654
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,539
uh okay so

655
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
um

656
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:08,639
[Music]

657
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,079
it looks like world position is not

658
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,278
known at the time that the diagram

659
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,278
system is included or something like

660
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,839
that

661
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,839
i

662
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,519
which is true

663
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,519
right you can see it here

664
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:27,278
so

665
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,960
yeah

666
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,400
the one thing i would say is this

667
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,400
probably doesn't need to be out here

668
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,840
anyway

669
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,840
so we could also just do this

670
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,639
all right and that would probably be

671
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,640
fine

672
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,200
all right so we do need the diagrams cpp

673
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,679
file though

674
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,880
uh that does need to be moved down below

675
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,000
like

676
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,960
the world

677
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,480
uh

678
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,400
code because otherwise wouldn't be able

679
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,558
to do any of that i don't

680
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,559
know

681
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,839
maybe there isn't one of those

682
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,640
let me see maybe i'm wrong about that

683
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,918
maybe i don't have to do that

684
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,159
yeah okay so i guess i don't have to do

685
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,520
that there just isn't an art an article

686
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,880
for those we'll take a look at that in a

687
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,119
second

688
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,120
um

689
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,798
let's take a look at subtract

690
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,400
so we will need the world here right

691
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:32,519
which i guess makes sense because it

692
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,519
needs the dimensions of things

693
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,119
so the only thing we don't have here is

694
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,000
an r equals

695
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,278
uh

696
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,319
we have r is we have r in the same chunk

697
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:59,359
which i suppose is good enough in this

698
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:01,278
situation maybe but it's not really what

699
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,278
i want

700
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,278
um

701
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,079
so it's weird that we don't have one

702
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,400
that checks for exact

703
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,278
equivalence

704
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,960
um

705
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,960
so i suppose that's okay it's not

706
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,080
it's not maybe quite right um

707
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:30,278
so so i don't

708
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,278
i don't love that but

709
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,440
i guess that's just how it is sometimes

710
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,039
okay so diagram set origin needs to take

711
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,640
the worlds

712
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,839
um but other than that

713
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,840
it's fine

714
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,440
uh

715
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,440
and

716
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,798
wow all right so that wasn't very good

717
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,599
oh uh right so

718
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,599
that is just because

719
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,959
uh these

720
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,879
are

721
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,399
some of them use these as a radius right

722
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,480
so we do have a slightly different thing

723
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,479
that happens here

724
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,480
uh this

725
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,480
fear

726
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,798
uses that one as radius

727
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,918
not sure if there are any other

728
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,519
[Music]

729
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,640
gotchas there

730
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,639
um so let's try that again

731
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,640
so yeah like like see i am again wrong

732
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,599
so i wonder why my math was wrong on

733
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,880
that

734
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,439
probably because i didn't think it

735
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,799
through quite right uh about what was

736
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
actually like the math probably wasn't

737
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,000
wrong but the

738
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,599
the setup for the equation was wrong

739
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,919
right

740
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,038
so why was this math

741
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,720
wrong

742
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,879
first let's make sure that actually was

743
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,679
math wrong because flipping the sign of

744
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,520
this would if i was just wrong about the

745
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,320
setup would produce the correct result

746
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,158
then

747
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,678
but it may be that this is wrong too so

748
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,600
maybe that i'm just doing something

749
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,559
completely wrong period in which case

750
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:13,519
the math was the least of our concerns

751
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:16,480
um

752
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,480
still seems wrong

753
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,960
like i don't know what that's supposedly

754
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,480
doing

755
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,440
okay so maybe this is just wrong in

756
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,720
another way and we don't have to worry

757
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,840
about the math part of it just yet

758
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,360
all right

759
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,359
so

760
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,278
i'm not sure why this would be incorrect

761
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,759
because it looks roughly like what we

762
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,000
want right if we have origins that move

763
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,359
we just need to update ourselves for

764
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,599
those origins by looping over the

765
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,678
diagrams that have already been

766
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,879
included in the system

767
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,880
uh for previous frames basically

768
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,320
and change

769
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,799
what they're relative to so that they're

770
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,879
now relative to the new center

771
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,359
right

772
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,640
that seems relatively uncontroversial to

773
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,798
me

774
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,720
um i i don't understand why that

775
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,240
wouldn't work

776
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,839
it's possible that we're producing the

777
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,640
wrong offset here

778
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,240
but

779
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,600
i can't immediately see what else we

780
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,599
would be doing

781
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,798
one of the two ways of having that go

782
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,839
should have produced the right result

783
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:17,519
and then we could have worked through

784
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,439
the math of like why which one is

785
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,200
correct or not correct

786
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,360
but since neither one does it means that

787
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,600
something's wrong structurally

788
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,000
right like this is just wrong

789
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,959
in general

790
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,960
uh and i'm not sure how that result came

791
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,960
about

792
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,880
um

793
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,480
so

794
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,519
hmm yeah i'm not sure why that that

795
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,679
seems like it should have been pretty

796
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,480
straightforward but i guess it wasn't

797
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,080
so

798
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,558
it shows you what i know

799
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,558
not much

800
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,120
so the top of each frame we set the

801
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,558
origin to the simulation center that is

802
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,158
going to be used to produce the stuff

803
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,480
and that's where everyone will do their

804
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,278
relative

805
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,960
submissions from here on

806
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,960
so it seems like that should be

807
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,720
relatively straightforward

808
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:34,319
the simulation center itself doesn't

809
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,278
really move

810
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:40,240
uh other than in hops right like it

811
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:44,240
it moves like clunk clunk clunk so it

812
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,240
only happens every so often

813
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,640
and so most of the time

814
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,919
this is going to be zero and then on

815
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,519
certain frames when it changes it's

816
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,278
going to be something non-zero when the

817
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,200
origin changes

818
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,359
uh and then it you know it does this

819
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,360
thing

820
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,840
the chunk part i don't know if maybe

821
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:07,398
that part is wrong which seems like it

822
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,398
could sort of be

823
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,839
i don't know

824
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,360
subtracting the new center from the old

825
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:55,199
center

826
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,959
is almost certainly correct i'm pretty

827
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,798
sure our math was right

828
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,319
so i'm pretty sure that this is actually

829
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,240
what we want

830
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,158
um and it did a very uh

831
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,000
counter-intuitive thing

832
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,440
so let me look at what it looked like

833
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,200
again when we did the thing that i

834
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,880
thought was correct because i want to

835
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,200
understand that a little bit better

836
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,039
you can see that it like hops it like

837
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,038
moved the thing back here

838
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:23,360
somehow

839
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,278
and i do not know how

840
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,759
right like that

841
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:30,159
that is very confusing

842
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,158
um

843
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,038
the simulation center went

844
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,599
forward by

845
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,798
not really even that amount like that

846
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,038
doesn't seem

847
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,440
maybe that was a simulation center

848
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:47,440
delta

849
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,798
i mean maybe it was

850
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,000
because it would have been like the

851
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,079
simulation center would have been like

852
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,359
something like here

853
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:58,480
and then the simulation center would

854
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,278
have been like something like here

855
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,079
probably right it's hard to say

856
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,960
uh

857
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,960
but like if you look

858
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:13,000
you know it's i don't know

859
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,000
somewhere like there

860
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,720
so i mean i guess i could believe that

861
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,838
that was the the amount

862
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,799
and so if you look at what's happening

863
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,960
that

864
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:42,159
move

865
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,159
it it offset it by an amount

866
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:50,800
it's almost as if it's still using the

867
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,800
same offset from what it was before

868
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,920
but having done the offset for this it's

869
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,039
almost like it didn't update the new

870
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,639
center but is offsetting it properly i

871
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,719
suppose maybe that would be what happens

872
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,078
if you offset by twice the amount that

873
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,279
you thought you should offset by or

874
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,480
something but i don't know how we would

875
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,720
produce that because we don't multiply

876
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,199
any of these things

877
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,199
in that way if we ran this twice

878
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,119
it should not

879
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,320
do it twice because this would stop that

880
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,480
from happening

881
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:31,838
right so once you get the old origin set

882
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,838
you won't do it again

883
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,079
so how did that happen

884
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:07,838
how

885
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
how

886
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,880
the question is how

887
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,880
um so i guess the thing about simulation

888
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,280
center

889
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,280
is

890
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,160
you know

891
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,199
in theory anyway

892
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,200
i think

893
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,199
uh

894
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,639
in theory the simulation center

895
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:53,119
i should also check all these these p

896
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,119
values which is what i'm doing right now

897
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,800
but i believe they're all yeah all these

898
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,119
p values are correct

899
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,119
uh

900
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,799
so i don't get it i do not understand

901
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,560
why this would be causing a problem it's

902
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,680
very strange so i suppose what i'll do

903
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:17,519
is i'll step through and i'll look

904
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,679
through i'll look at to make sure these

905
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,039
change when i think they change

906
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,118
um

907
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,559
we'll start there

908
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,920
just in case i'm like totally wrong

909
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,920
about that

910
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,680
uh which is easy to do when you only

911
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,559
program on something every once in a

912
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,118
very

913
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,599
short a very long time right

914
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,920
it's pretty easy to

915
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,838
to make that be wrong um

916
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,440
so like yeah if we go

917
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:42,480
let me just go into the diagram code i

918
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,559
guess

919
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,760
and just set a breakpoint

920
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:47,358
on

921
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,320
when this happens

922
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:51,279
so

923
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,680
in here like

924
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,680
hmm okay

925
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,800
so we should see it hit this breakpoint

926
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,000
one time

927
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,760
uh which is at startup right when it

928
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,079
first goes to render the world's

929
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,520
presumably it would hit that

930
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,119
okay so the fact that it doesn't hit

931
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,559
that break point unless remedy just

932
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,599
isn't setting the breakpoint properly or

933
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,239
something

934
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,480
that seems really weird right because

935
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,399
what are the chances that the

936
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,320
last origin p

937
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,680
was all was

938
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,400
already

939
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,399
the the cleared to zero last origin p

940
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,559
was already the origin p is it just

941
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,800
because we do happen to start literally

942
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,400
at zero that would be

943
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,480
cool

944
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,800
but weird

945
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,039
so let me just check the first time we

946
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,839
call in here

947
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,519
um

948
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:55,480
and see what those values are because

949
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,480
now i'm just like what

950
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,240
so that's what we would expect right

951
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,240
it's uninitialized ver okay

952
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,519
so i guess this is okay

953
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,200
uh it really is the r equals thing when

954
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,280
i was like this doesn't look right it's

955
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,919
not right so we have to do the r equals

956
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,920
thing okay

957
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,039
i mean good to know

958
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,480
so the other thing we could do here is

959
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,519
say look if these two things don't

960
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,119
produce

961
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,119
an exact value we could do this

962
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,599
you know what i'm saying

963
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,000
uh so like if if they're not

964
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,000
correct

965
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,480
so that was it

966
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,679
um i think that was the entirety of

967
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,559
that completely explained what we were

968
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,799
seeing

969
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,078
so we can move on to

970
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,880
seeing if there are other problems with

971
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,200
it

972
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,200
okay

973
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,680
let's try again

974
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,759
and now we're good

975
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,200
perfect

976
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,960
so i think that was worth doing didn't

977
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:22,799
take very long and would take a lot less

978
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,800
time if i had actually had an r equals

979
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,920
call it would have called it that it

980
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,720
would have worked

981
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,680
uh but hey doesn't matter

982
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:33,598
anyway uh so as you can see we're still

983
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,279
doing the thing in the collision routine

984
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,640
where if it hits that case it stops

985
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,040
recording the diagrams which is what we

986
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:41,358
want so that we can step through them

987
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,039
and see how we got into that case and as

988
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,679
you can see now you can see what i'm

989
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,358
talking about there's just too much like

990
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,440
this is just a record of everything that

991
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,119
happened over several frames

992
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,599
it's way too much to be able to see

993
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,519
what's going on so even though all of

994
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,400
the information we need to understand

995
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,159
the bug better is in this diagram we

996
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,838
can't make meaningful sense of it

997
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,279
because there's just so much garbage we

998
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:05,039
can't see it

999
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,079
so that's why i said we just now need to

1000
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,559
make this thing um

1001
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,920
actually work where i can turn on like

1002
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,480
single stepping

1003
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,280
and then have like some controls here

1004
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,838
that let me like like scrub

1005
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,839
right so i can just say like like move

1006
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:23,679
right and then move

1007
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,039
and then move or whatever

1008
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,519
right

1009
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:29,039
um so i just need to add something like

1010
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,079
that which actually shouldn't be that

1011
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,599
hard to do it's just a little bit of

1012
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,240
busy work

1013
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:39,440
um and what you can see is we've already

1014
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:39,439
set up like the part of the code that

1015
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,000
we haven't actually been using

1016
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,400
but it's this whole begin end part we

1017
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,719
already set up diagrams to do this they

1018
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,639
already have begin and end like around

1019
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:56,078
relevant sections

1020
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:58,559
so if you look at like the code in

1021
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,160
question like move entity

1022
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,199
it already has

1023
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,519
like an underscore begin

1024
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,519
oops

1025
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,880
so

1026
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,599
we should be able because there's a

1027
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,920
begin on each stack walk

1028
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,119
and in the refine and over the entire

1029
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,720
thing

1030
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,800
we should be able to make something that

1031
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:23,838
just like hops along those begins and

1032
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,440
ends

1033
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,358
like without

1034
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,358
uh

1035
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,679
without much trouble so like we don't

1036
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,119
really need to do any additional work to

1037
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,960
like figure out

1038
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,280
what we should be viewing for single

1039
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,039
stepping because we already like we we

1040
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,319
knew when we started this that we wanted

1041
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:41,519
something like that

1042
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:43,199
so it shouldn't be particularly

1043
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:44,400
difficult for us to actually make that

1044
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:45,679
happen now

1045
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,000
right

1046
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:51,199
uh i also there's a couple things i'm

1047
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,199
not entirely sure about

1048
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:58,199
like we had some tech stuff in here and

1049
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,200
i don't know if we ever actually

1050
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,078
yeah so i guess we kind of did

1051
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,920
so we haven't there's a couple other

1052
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,119
things we haven't done like like do we

1053
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,720
want to like put the text up there and

1054
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,280
it's like that we may not need to do

1055
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,838
that we may need to i don't know

1056
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,000
but anyway so if we ins just have like

1057
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:23,358
the diagram and begin and end stuff what

1058
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
we can do here is probably just

1059
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:30,480
make it so that we keep some kind of a

1060
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,480
counter so we have a like you know

1061
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,160
diagram

1062
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,159
index

1063
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,239
or something like this

1064
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,639
and it's a little bit more complicated

1065
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,559
because we kind of need like a stack

1066
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:43,358
for it

1067
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,078
where

1068
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:48,078
we will as we do begins

1069
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,680
we have to track like which one we're on

1070
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,560
at each level

1071
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,480
because these things can be nested

1072
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:55,599
and we may want to be able to like drill

1073
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,880
down

1074
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,880
or up

1075
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,880
or whatever

1076
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,880
um

1077
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,838
and that just seems like the most

1078
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:14,318
straightforward way to do it

1079
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,440
so we'd have something you know like

1080
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,599
this

1081
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,599
or

1082
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:26,318
whatever and when we go through here

1083
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,440
whenever we do a diagram begin we would

1084
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,440
increment the diagram

1085
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,200
depth right

1086
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:40,318
and whenever we do a diagram and we'd

1087
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:42,719
decrement it you know

1088
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:42,719
and

1089
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,480
when we hit a begin we would

1090
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,879
increase the diagram index

1091
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,760
at the depth that we're currently at

1092
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,960
right

1093
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,880
so if if we're at nothing

1094
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,920
and we hit a begin we increment the

1095
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,800
diagram index for the zeroth depth but

1096
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,400
then we

1097
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,599
update the depth plus

1098
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,280
one so that now any begins

1099
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,000
if we hit a begin

1100
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,560
it's like a sub diagram right it's at a

1101
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,880
lower depth

1102
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,880
or whatever

1103
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,240
we know that we can't

1104
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,079
do anything about it if the diagram

1105
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,559
depth is

1106
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,039
not you know is is outside of what we

1107
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,199
track so we're sort of pre saying like

1108
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:36,000
look you know i don't know how deep

1109
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:38,000
these things go but not very deep

1110
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,358
right like you can't just stack diagrams

1111
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
inside diagrams entire diagrams

1112
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:43,759
infinitely because a i don't even know

1113
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,199
what good that would do anyone you know

1114
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,880
one or two levels deep is going to be

1115
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,639
the most that you could ever really use

1116
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,240
effectively because otherwise would take

1117
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,239
you so long to navigate right

1118
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,800
um

1119
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,640
but then once we're sort of in that mode

1120
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,160
we should be able to use like the arrow

1121
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,679
keys or something to like navigate

1122
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,838
through these so then what we need is

1123
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:04,719
some idea of like what the match level

1124
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:06,078
is

1125
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:09,598
right

1126
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,640
so we need something that's like

1127
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,079
you know

1128
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,838
um

1129
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,839
in the diagram group itself

1130
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,400
which is this thing

1131
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,679
uh we we need some idea of like what

1132
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,039
this

1133
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:26,799
you know

1134
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:28,960
what this thing is going to do so you

1135
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,480
know maybe i don't know

1136
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,480
um

1137
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,679
maybe we like have an actual thing

1138
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,679
that's like oh you know there's there's

1139
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:38,679
like

1140
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:47,919
handmade diagram max depth

1141
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,559
maybe we just make this thing

1142
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,039
to be honest i think 64 it's just stupid

1143
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:56,599
like it would just be unwieldy to use so

1144
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,599
we're not gonna do that

1145
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,720
so maybe we do something like this uh

1146
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,200
and

1147
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:09,519
we have like an at diagram

1148
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:13,439
and then we have a like

1149
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:15,519
a diagram filter depth or something

1150
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,119
uh

1151
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:19,280
i'll go like this

1152
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,079
does that make more sense

1153
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,359
and then what we do here is we just say

1154
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,920
well when we're drawing these things

1155
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:29,598
uh every time we hit like a beginner and

1156
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,400
end like we're gonna have a thing that's

1157
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:36,240
like a

1158
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,240
past filter something

1159
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,159
and every time through here we're going

1160
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,558
to set like past filter equal to

1161
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,598
something

1162
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,079
and

1163
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,079
when we

1164
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,159
go to do drawing

1165
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,960
like in any of these things

1166
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,838
uh

1167
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,760
we will set that up

1168
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,400
and we'll just won't enter this case if

1169
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,400
it's not there

1170
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,519
something like that

1171
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,960
something like that

1172
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:14,480
now because i want this code i don't

1173
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,358
really care how fast this code is

1174
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,519
running

1175
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,199
i i have no reason to believe it will be

1176
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,960
particularly slow

1177
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,799
so i'm just gonna make a little easier

1178
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,880
on myself

1179
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:29,559
and i'm going to put

1180
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,559
these cases at the top

1181
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,000
uh so that they are processed

1182
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,719
prior to the switch

1183
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:50,239
statement um

1184
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,880
although now that i think about that we

1185
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:00,880
still want the diagram color thickness

1186
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:03,838
and text part to probably still have

1187
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,838
been

1188
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,400
to be honest though no we really don't i

1189
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,318
mean

1190
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,800
i do think those probably should have

1191
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:24,079
been reset as part of this

1192
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:26,318
this should have like reset those anyway

1193
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,318
uh

1194
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,960
i'm not sure how we want to deal with

1195
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,800
that going forward all right so maybe i

1196
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,159
take it back

1197
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,599
maybe we'll leave this in there it's a

1198
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,679
little annoying but i guess i'll leave

1199
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,039
it in here so let's suppose that we

1200
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:44,039
actually have

1201
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:44,039
um

1202
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,000
just a thing that's like should draw

1203
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,240
and i go in here and i just

1204
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,239
like nuke these

1205
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,239
cases

1206
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,039
so we just don't

1207
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,039
draw stuff

1208
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,599
in that case

1209
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,480
and like there's a phantom one here but

1210
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:28,480
you know we never implemented that

1211
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:30,879
so

1212
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,639
all right and so whenever we hit diagram

1213
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:38,159
begin and we do one of these things we

1214
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:39,358
need to do a computation to determine

1215
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:43,519
whether or not

1216
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:46,159
we're going to pass the filter or not

1217
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,440
um and whenever we do like you know we

1218
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,558
do the begins and the ends or whatever

1219
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,480
we need to update this past filter

1220
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,359
value

1221
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,920
to

1222
00:50:53,358 --> 00:51:00,799
come from something that we compute

1223
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,680
so we do stuff like look if we can look

1224
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,960
up in here then whatever like should

1225
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,279
draw

1226
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,039
is just going to be equal to whatever

1227
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,079
the old

1228
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:13,838
uh assuming we can look it up

1229
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,280
uh is just gonna be whatever the old one

1230
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:17,358
was

1231
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,920
and the same would be true here where

1232
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:22,880
like whatever we determine the like

1233
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,880
should we draw this thing or not

1234
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,920
is going to come from here as well

1235
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,160
so

1236
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,760
uh in a sense like

1237
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:33,279
that always happens

1238
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,880
but we also like update the past filter

1239
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,880
thing

1240
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,960
and i think

1241
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,920
i could be very wrong about this but i

1242
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,639
think this is actually pretty simple

1243
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:48,720
so like this is just

1244
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:50,879
the the past filter for this is just

1245
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,639
whatever the current state was so we

1246
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,318
assume that children are always drawn if

1247
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,078
they should be drawn if the parent

1248
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:58,558
should have been drawn

1249
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:01,839
but then if

1250
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,280
like the filter depth

1251
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:05,838
uh is

1252
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,240
like if where we're at if the diagram

1253
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:08,239
depth

1254
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,639
that we're currently at

1255
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:16,679
is like less than

1256
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:16,679
the diagram filter depth

1257
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,719
so like if they were both zero

1258
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,280
we don't do the test

1259
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:28,399
if diagram filter depth is like one and

1260
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,240
we're at diagram depth zero

1261
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,318
then at that point

1262
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,318
we would be filtering so we would check

1263
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:37,039
to see

1264
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,318
whether we would filter on this

1265
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,880
index

1266
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:42,719
so the diagram index at that diagram

1267
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,720
depth

1268
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:45,719
um

1269
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,480
would have to be equal to hours

1270
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:55,759
right

1271
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,280
i believe

1272
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,240
i guess technically this is

1273
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,839
supposed to be after because if it was

1274
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,838
zero it would be this way so

1275
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:20,960
so

1276
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:23,280
uh

1277
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:27,480
if these are equal then

1278
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,480
or i should say if they're not equal

1279
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,800
would turn it off

1280
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,598
something like that

1281
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,760
i want to say that's just sort of

1282
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:48,759
what it is

1283
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,960
i'm not sure it needs to be

1284
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:02,960
really any more

1285
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,920
complicated than that

1286
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,920
all right so we'll go back over that

1287
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,800
again in a second but i think that's

1288
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,800
roughly what we want

1289
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,559
so now we just need some way of actually

1290
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,318
navigating through these things i think

1291
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,760
we could already start debugging this a

1292
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,558
little bit because

1293
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,440
uh we can now go like make sure this

1294
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,119
code works for no filtering right

1295
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,559
so it should be that if with no

1296
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,760
filtering it would work

1297
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,880
uh

1298
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,799
i suppose i need to start should draw at

1299
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,400
true

1300
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:53,599
though

1301
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,798
um

1302
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:58,318
which i think is what we want

1303
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,480
because otherwise things will never be

1304
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:01,838
drawn because the the root has to start

1305
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,719
at true

1306
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:03,519
um

1307
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:05,279
so

1308
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:08,000
i think that's correct in that it's like

1309
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,599
you know it draws the thing

1310
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,679
uh and so now we just need a way of

1311
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,440
setting it uh

1312
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,679
so that we can set the

1313
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,679
that's

1314
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,519
i don't know what that is

1315
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:22,399
this is some kind of four code or flurry

1316
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:25,838
thing look at that

1317
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,880
if you would like purple things to be

1318
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:28,558
purple

1319
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,838
you can click on them

1320
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,839
with the right mouse button

1321
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,879
i do not know what that does like what

1322
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,880
is that

1323
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,559
i i have no idea what that's even meant

1324
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:42,558
to do

1325
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,599
i feel like ryan needs to tell us what

1326
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:51,279
that is supposed to do

1327
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,519
something it's definitely doing

1328
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,680
something non-trivial like it's it's

1329
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:57,599
doing like a rectangular selection of

1330
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:58,558
empty space

1331
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,920
like

1332
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,920
i have no idea what that does

1333
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,519
anyway

1334
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:16,480
so if we look at the codes where we've

1335
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:18,480
got

1336
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,679
you know

1337
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,920
single stepping and whatever

1338
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:23,919
uh

1339
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:31,318
i guess we can do something where we say

1340
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:37,039
is single stepping we don't even really

1341
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:39,439
care

1342
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:43,480
i guess um

1343
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,480
about single stepping anymore

1344
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,960
like we don't

1345
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,559
need that

1346
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,559
at all

1347
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,079
i don't think we could just have a reset

1348
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,079
button

1349
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,079
um

1350
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:04,480
okay so that's for we don't yeah so we

1351
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,480
don't really need

1352
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,798
we don't really need that for this but

1353
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,400
we'll leave it on there so so this is a

1354
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:14,239
different thing

1355
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,838
and that's fine

1356
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,759
and we'll leave that in there

1357
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:20,880
but i'll then do like

1358
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,640
a thing down here where we do

1359
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,240
you know label f

1360
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,279
and we'll say like

1361
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:27,838
a

1362
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,839
diagram

1363
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,759
uh filter

1364
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,450
something like that right

1365
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,720
and then in here i can just put in

1366
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:39,719
[Music]

1367
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,719
a

1368
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,639
i guess i don't know

1369
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,640
if editable

1370
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:52,920
px is the right thing it might

1371
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,920
be

1372
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,760
i mean probably not but

1373
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:00,759
maybe it is

1374
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:15,838
i mean my guess is it sort of is

1375
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:15,838
um because like we can set the

1376
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,720
yeah we could just have two sliders that

1377
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,720
are like

1378
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,199
what depth do you want to be at

1379
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,559
i mean it's probably the only you really

1380
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:28,960
you probably only really want a slider

1381
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,319
for the second one so maybe you want

1382
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,798
like a button

1383
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:32,798
excuse me

1384
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:37,079
for the first two or something

1385
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:41,838
uh that are like

1386
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,358
we want one for stepping like forwards

1387
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:48,838
and backward or up and down the

1388
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:52,719
hierarchy so like

1389
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:52,719
up and down

1390
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,480
and those would just be like

1391
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,559
whatever that group was

1392
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,720
this stuff here

1393
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:15,599
the diagram filter depth

1394
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:18,239
for

1395
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:20,000
uh like if you go up if the diagonal is

1396
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:23,479
greater than zero then

1397
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,480
you know you would

1398
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:35,599
do something like this

1399
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:37,838
so we

1400
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,838
we

1401
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,159
i don't know why that's in there it's

1402
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,159
not even remotely right there we go

1403
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:49,118
so we just have like a value and we we

1404
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,480
move it like up and down

1405
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:54,318
depending on which one we want to do

1406
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,119
so we can go down to like lower levels

1407
00:59:54,318 --> 01:00:00,119
of detail or greater levels of detail

1408
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,119
um

1409
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:07,759
i don't know how this thing label f

1410
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,760
works is it just like percent

1411
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,838
yeah it looks like it

1412
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:15,200
so you know if we just have percent u

1413
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:18,318
percent u

1414
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:20,639
kind of thing so you can see it

1415
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:20,639
um

1416
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:27,118
so we just do like

1417
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:29,439
there's the filter depth and

1418
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,760
there's the filter index at that filter

1419
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,760
depth

1420
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,359
and this really

1421
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,960
uh since

1422
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:44,960
i think that's right um this is actually

1423
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,280
not quite what we want

1424
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,679
so in this case like when we do these

1425
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,680
labels

1426
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:53,279
we need to like this part

1427
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,599
you

1428
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,559
do want to do this

1429
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,640
and you want to do it that way

1430
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,960
right it's the filter when you do the

1431
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:04,798
depth it's like the depth minus one but

1432
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,318
that means that when it's at zero

1433
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:07,838
you would

1434
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:11,838
turn it off

1435
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:11,838
so i think what you really want is this

1436
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:22,400
where if the diagram filter depth

1437
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:28,239
is zero you like print some other thing

1438
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,240
that's like

1439
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,640
something like that

1440
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:36,639
um

1441
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,798
yeah

1442
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,160
i don't know how this got to be

1443
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:44,159
something other than layout there

1444
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,039
probably bad

1445
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:48,000
uh

1446
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:48,000
auto complete but

1447
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,318
so like in theory now we should be able

1448
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:53,599
to control one of the parameters and

1449
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:55,838
then i just need like a slider for the

1450
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,720
other one or something

1451
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,719
so

1452
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:01,759
uh

1453
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:03,519
this will allow me to like filter

1454
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,720
a different level of the hierarchy but i

1455
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:08,159
can't step through a different diagrams

1456
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:10,480
right

1457
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:12,480
um so if you like imagine like okay

1458
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,119
we're looking at something like that

1459
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,719
um in theory like you can see in fact it

1460
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,440
already is sort of working

1461
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:21,838
if i'm filtering out like

1462
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,838
that's like

1463
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,720
the first diagram on each frame

1464
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,280
that's the first sub diagram

1465
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:33,038
on each frame in theory

1466
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,359
it doesn't look like it's quite correct

1467
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,880
so i think we screwed it up the filter

1468
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:38,239
but that's

1469
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,920
what it would be

1470
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:44,000
and then we need like a little slider

1471
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,000
here i don't understand why these

1472
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:49,079
oh

1473
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:49,079
because i put it in the wrong place

1474
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,719
probably that probably about the label

1475
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:57,719
and then the thing

1476
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:10,559
okay so now if i look and i just say

1477
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,880
down

1478
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,880
down

1479
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:18,960
there we go and you can see that it's on

1480
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,720
the thing perfect all right so i think

1481
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,400
that's all good that seems pretty

1482
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:26,558
straightforward

1483
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:29,280
um so then maybe what i'll do is

1484
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:32,160
put one of these in there

1485
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,480
and i don't actually have one of these

1486
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:37,519
for integers it doesn't look like

1487
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,760
but i could use float for it anyway

1488
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:39,759
um

1489
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,440
and then just map the float

1490
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:49,199
map the float to

1491
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,000
a valiant right

1492
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,720
so like if i wanted to

1493
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,838
um

1494
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:03,838
i can do something like this

1495
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:13,358
and when we look at the depth here i

1496
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,358
could just do something like okay look

1497
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:18,239
if you just convert this to a u32 then

1498
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:18,239
then that's what it is

1499
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:23,119
um and then we can just have like a

1500
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:26,199
standard slider

1501
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,200
i guess

1502
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,639
that's like

1503
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,039
whichever one of these

1504
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,039
we're on

1505
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:55,039
and we don't

1506
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:55,280
really have a maximum here so i don't

1507
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,359
know

1508
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,359
[Music]

1509
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,440
i guess it would just be from zero to

1510
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:06,440
some very large number

1511
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,440
right

1512
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:13,038
so then we just have to make the

1513
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,480
filtering work but i think that's

1514
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,000
roughly it so like you know you get

1515
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,760
stuck

1516
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,880
or something

1517
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,880
um you can

1518
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:24,960
what what is this complaining oh it

1519
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:26,798
doesn't like

1520
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,920
it doesn't like something about the way

1521
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:29,920
i called this function

1522
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:37,038
i must have made a mistake

1523
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:40,078
uh so here it doesn't like this

1524
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,079
oh i see why

1525
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:53,838
that slider isn't valid

1526
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:53,838
if we are below the the you know

1527
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,599
if if we are below the depth

1528
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:07,358
so if we now go down to one of these you

1529
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,639
know in theory we can now change like

1530
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:10,078
which one of these we're looking at i

1531
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:11,199
don't know what oh because this is a

1532
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,200
float

1533
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:14,199
still

1534
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,280
so at uh at this point now we just need

1535
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,200
to make sure the filter is working

1536
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,079
properly but i believe now we're like

1537
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:29,038
setting the values in this thing

1538
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:33,000
so

1539
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,000
you know if we

1540
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:37,679
if we step down

1541
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:44,199
i'm just gonna do some

1542
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,200
random stuff here

1543
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,559
all right

1544
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,520
so that's

1545
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,519
a stuck diagram

1546
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,318
so now we should be able to make it so

1547
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:04,960
that as this thing rolls we like draw

1548
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:06,719
different stuff and it sort of is doing

1549
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,400
something but it's like the filter's not

1550
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:11,358
quite right you see what i'm saying like

1551
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,599
it doesn't advance properly or something

1552
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:14,798
so we just need to go debug this code

1553
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,440
make sure that we're passing in

1554
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:18,798
something reasonable here

1555
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:22,000
but other than that

1556
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:22,000
i think that's all we really need

1557
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:30,558
all right so let's take a look at what

1558
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:32,078
happens here so on the first

1559
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,960
we always need to look to make sure that

1560
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,559
the diagram depth is within bounds

1561
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,960
and that's fine

1562
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,079
uh the depth just goes up and down as it

1563
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,440
should

1564
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:45,280
that all seems fine um

1565
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,318
when we look at the diagram depth we say

1566
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,240
okay

1567
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,318
whether or not we pass the filter is

1568
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:52,479
just whatever the previous value of

1569
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:54,159
should draw is

1570
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,159
which starts out at true so the first

1571
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:57,199
time down we would just set it to true

1572
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,639
for sure

1573
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,679
we then look at the diagram depth and

1574
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:02,318
see if it's less than the diagonal

1575
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:04,480
filter so let's say we set this to one

1576
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:06,480
so this is zero the first time through

1577
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,159
we would say is the index that we're

1578
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,199
currently on

1579
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:10,960
which is

1580
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:13,279
also zero

1581
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:16,078
um if that's not equal to whatever the

1582
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,079
filter should be

1583
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:19,439
then we set the past filter value to

1584
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,560
false

1585
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:25,838
okay so this is wrong

1586
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,839
should be that

1587
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,198
although i guess it doesn't matter

1588
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:37,198
because we haven't done this yet

1589
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,838
um

1590
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
otherwise we just leave it what it

1591
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,000
should be

1592
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,319
i suppose this actually is is

1593
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:57,679
unnecessarily verbose so

1594
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,679
really you could just do this

1595
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,920
right

1596
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,920
i think that's how we actually

1597
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,278
oh we actually need there

1598
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:30,480
so anyway uh first time through right we

1599
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:31,440
would set the diagram index to zero

1600
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,879
uh

1601
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,439
or rather the diagram just would be

1602
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,359
equal to zero so if the diagram filter

1603
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:39,039
index is something other than that it

1604
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:40,000
shouldn't draw so it should draw to

1605
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:41,600
false

1606
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,119
it will remember that

1607
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,000
for its children

1608
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:46,318
right

1609
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,079
uh if it pops back up

1610
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,400
but that's all the past filter thing is

1611
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:50,399
doing

1612
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,439
so

1613
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,280
we increment the diagram depth and then

1614
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:58,719
you know let's just ignore anything that

1615
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:00,238
happens down there we get into some

1616
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,239
other begins or whatever so we do

1617
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:03,519
another begin but in siri like when we

1618
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:05,198
hit the diagram for that one it would

1619
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,800
pop back up and just look at whatever

1620
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:07,919
the past filter value was that it was

1621
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,440
setting

1622
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,119
uh and it will reset should draw to

1623
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,039
whatever that should have been right

1624
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:16,039
whatever it was before we went into this

1625
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:16,039
thing

1626
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,560
so i suppose the problem here is that

1627
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,440
this should actually be set prior

1628
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,480
meaning

1629
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:32,799
that

1630
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:34,479
should be set before we do anything else

1631
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,640
with it because should draw is the value

1632
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:40,639
we actually are using and the past

1633
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,640
filter thing is what we'll restore it to

1634
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:48,319
okay so that was definitely wrong

1635
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,479
i don't know that that's enough wrong

1636
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:52,559
so we probably still aren't quite right

1637
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:54,479
but let's just see what the behavior is

1638
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,840
now

1639
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:57,198
for the next

1640
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,520
round through

1641
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:02,238
okay so there's some gunk

1642
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,480
uh let's suppose we go down

1643
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:07,039
a level

1644
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:07,039
two levels

1645
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:09,679
um

1646
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,039
okay so now we're sort of working a

1647
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:15,199
little bit better right you can see us

1648
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:16,399
drawing the stuff

1649
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:19,599
right

1650
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:22,399
uh at level two if we went down one more

1651
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,480
you can see us testing the spheres

1652
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:27,439
right so that's kind of nice

1653
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:29,839
this goes up way too quickly

1654
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,759
um which is a bummer

1655
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,440
so like maybe we do need something a

1656
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:37,360
little bit different there but yeah like

1657
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:37,359
our slider code is kind of crap right

1658
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,238
um

1659
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:52,799
so i think this is all we really need i

1660
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,319
think we're good now that seems to be

1661
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,119
working it was just the restoring of the

1662
01:11:54,319 --> 01:12:00,399
stack was wrong

1663
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:02,479
this is kind of garbage uh the editable

1664
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:05,519
px code

1665
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:07,359
we need like a step

1666
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,480
value in here you can see

1667
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:12,479
uh it's it's this nonsense

1668
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:12,839
the dx value

1669
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:15,938
um

1670
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,939
[Music]

1671
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:23,158
so what we might want to do is something

1672
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:23,158
more like this

1673
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:32,158
like if you didn't specify dx then it

1674
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:36,639
will do that

1675
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:38,799
but otherwise it won't

1676
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:41,280
that way like for things like this one

1677
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,920
we can do like oh you know what's the

1678
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:46,079
delta x value

1679
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,679
uh when you move like i don't know maybe

1680
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,679
it's like 10 pixels per

1681
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,279
or some crap like that

1682
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,039
this is not a good ui obviously right

1683
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:59,198
it's just a debug ui so we don't really

1684
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:59,198
care as long as we can use it it's fine

1685
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,520
so then when we do it here

1686
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:05,920
like that's

1687
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,000
better right because i can get like

1688
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,800
fairly precise

1689
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
now which is what i want

1690
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,560
um

1691
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,198
and so

1692
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:19,520
when it gets stuck as like so

1693
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:23,119
um

1694
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:26,080
now if i go down to one of these

1695
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:27,198
i should be able to like

1696
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:30,158
yeah

1697
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:33,119
i don't know why that is happening

1698
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:34,719
so if i go past the total number

1699
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:38,479
that is somehow

1700
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,560
relevant i'm not sure why

1701
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:42,799
so i think we still have a bug like like

1702
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,800
this doesn't make sense at filter level

1703
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,800
one

1704
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,440
it looks like we still have a bug in

1705
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:53,519
there like that

1706
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:56,158
that's not right it shouldn't be like

1707
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:58,960
all of those things are not

1708
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:00,399
on diagram level one right

1709
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,000
so like each one of those should have

1710
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,079
been stepping through there

1711
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,198
so there's still some kind of a like not

1712
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:07,198
quite right thing in the stack

1713
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:09,359
processing as i originally surmised but

1714
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:11,919
then talked myself out of

1715
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:15,039
uh so we're not quite right so we save

1716
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,319
in past filter here what we should what

1717
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:19,119
we were doing

1718
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:20,000
so that we can restore it when we come

1719
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:22,158
back

1720
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,560
right which is all this that's all this

1721
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,879
code does it all

1722
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,840
it's not very interesting

1723
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,840
um

1724
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,320
this seems pretty straightforward

1725
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,520
otherwise i'm not sure why we're getting

1726
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:45,198
a problem with stepping through

1727
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,880
we look to see whether or not the

1728
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:47,678
diagram depth

1729
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,920
is

1730
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,960
less than the diagram filter depth like

1731
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,640
that is just

1732
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,800
keeping us that's so that we don't have

1733
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,800
to

1734
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,359
like

1735
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,119
that we won't only just pick one child

1736
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:02,719
if we can draw like all the children of

1737
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:04,960
something if we want to

1738
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:08,600
so that seems fine like i don't see why

1739
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,600
that would cause this problem

1740
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:22,599
and the diagram filter index also looks

1741
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,600
fine so so hmm

1742
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:39,839
so one thing i would like to do

1743
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,480
let's assert the diagram depth of zero

1744
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:53,759
at the end because one thing that we

1745
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:56,000
don't really address here is what if

1746
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,560
there are unbalanced like what if our

1747
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,880
code that syncs is wrong

1748
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,880
yeah

1749
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:06,000
so it could be that actually just the

1750
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:08,238
code that we're actually calling that's

1751
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,079
like calling this is wrong

1752
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:14,238
meaning the places in the code where we

1753
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:17,760
have a diagram begin don't match

1754
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:20,319
and that would do it right

1755
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,840
so let's just double check to make sure

1756
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:24,238
that that is a thing

1757
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,560
because it might not be a thing

1758
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,238
and then we would have a problem

1759
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,159
so here's the thing where we've got a

1760
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:33,759
diagram begin and there's the diagram

1761
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:34,879
end and that's fine

1762
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,719
here's the thing where we've got to

1763
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,000
begin for move entity so that means

1764
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,079
there has to be one like all the way

1765
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
down at the bottom and there is

1766
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:43,760
right

1767
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,158
um

1768
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:49,280
here's one inside the

1769
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:50,639
the walk here and it's got an end as

1770
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:51,679
well

1771
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,360
so they look

1772
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:55,600
balanced though

1773
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,599
right

1774
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,440
those all look pretty balanced to me

1775
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:00,719
so

1776
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:04,399
[Music]

1777
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:04,399
yeah i'm not sure what happened there

1778
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:17,759
seems like that should be pretty

1779
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,920
straightforward so let's take a look at

1780
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,159
what's going on in there

1781
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:24,079
because that maybe that would give us

1782
01:17:22,158 --> 01:17:27,039
some insight into what the bug is in

1783
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:27,039
this particular routine

1784
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:30,719
i think we're almost done with what we

1785
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:32,158
needed for stepping through and seeing

1786
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,920
what happened right

1787
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:37,359
and then we can

1788
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,359
you know add the code that we need

1789
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:44,000
so what is the value because we'll know

1790
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:46,718
whether it's an underflow or an overflow

1791
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,719
which would be good

1792
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:54,480
so it's like there's just one unclosed

1793
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:55,679
one of these apparently apparently right

1794
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:58,479
um

1795
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:01,119
and i guess we don't know which one it

1796
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:04,000
is but we actually could put in

1797
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:05,359
something pretty you know

1798
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,479
it would be pretty simple for us to

1799
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:07,519
figure out

1800
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:09,759
like

1801
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:12,960
where this ended i guess

1802
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:15,119
uh but so we know that like we've got

1803
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:18,640
just one open

1804
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,640
that didn't get closed

1805
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,158
right

1806
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,199
one begin

1807
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:30,159
that didn't end

1808
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,520
because the depth is one if we had an an

1809
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:33,279
additional end

1810
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,719
the diagram death would have been

1811
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:40,279
like you know 42 you know 4.2 billion or

1812
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,279
whatever it would have been

1813
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:43,519
that

1814
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,600
right

1815
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,119
4.3 billion

1816
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,120
uh

1817
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:53,920
so we know that we've got an open that

1818
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,679
doesn't get closed somehow but i'm not

1819
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,600
sure how that's possible given what

1820
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:59,520
we're actually doing since we just

1821
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,360
looked and saw that that really wasn't

1822
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,880
the case

1823
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:04,319
maybe what's happening is we're breaking

1824
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,800
out

1825
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:07,799
of that loop

1826
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,039
yeah yeah yeah so it's just that right

1827
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,960
there right

1828
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:17,760
um so i don't know how we want to deal

1829
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,520
with that there's a couple different

1830
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,159
ways one is we can use like a

1831
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,679
constructor destructor pair

1832
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:26,479
to like force

1833
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,920
this to be done i tend not to like those

1834
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:29,198
kind of things

1835
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,440
very much

1836
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:32,960
right

1837
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:34,719
um and the reason that i don't really

1838
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,640
love those kind of things is they create

1839
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:38,158
kind of like hidden code that's hard to

1840
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,159
understand

1841
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:41,359
like you had to just know that like okay

1842
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:43,359
there was like a thing that would

1843
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:45,039
automatically like clean up the diagram

1844
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,399
end code when we broke out of the loop

1845
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:48,719
because it's got a destructor that you

1846
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:51,599
can't see

1847
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,359
so i'm not sure that's the best idea

1848
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,239
because

1849
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:56,880
you know

1850
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:59,119
uh it seems like we could pretty easily

1851
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,719
just allow this code to finish

1852
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:02,559
instead

1853
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:03,279
and it wouldn't really

1854
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,960
be

1855
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:07,198
a huge deal

1856
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,198
um

1857
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:14,559
so let me think about how i want that to

1858
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:16,559
work but i don't know that i'm i'd be

1859
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,159
disinclined to like wrap it in the thing

1860
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,639
i don't love that idea so i think i

1861
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:23,638
might just not do that

1862
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,639
um

1863
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,079
excuse me

1864
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:44,079
so effectively what we're doing here is

1865
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:44,079
we're checking to see whether this cell

1866
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,840
is already in the target cell

1867
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:55,678
and if it is

1868
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,199
we just stop looking

1869
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:59,199
that's all this is it's like an early

1870
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:00,719
out right

1871
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:02,559
so the first thing to note here is it's

1872
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,880
not really

1873
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,880
um

1874
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:17,198
it's not really even yeah

1875
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:17,198
it's not really even something that

1876
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,800
it's not even really something that we

1877
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:28,479
want to have happen because when it

1878
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,760
breaks out of here it won't even draw

1879
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:33,759
this diagram so what was the point

1880
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,239
um of some of this stuff we would never

1881
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,079
see the last box either if we did want

1882
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:40,079
to like re-enable this particular case

1883
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,639
to run so you can see why i'm not

1884
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:43,359
thrilled about this

1885
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,039
so

1886
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:46,238
maybe

1887
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:49,439
what i do

1888
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:50,559
is i just say look there's going to be a

1889
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:52,879
like

1890
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,880
um

1891
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:58,800
like a found best in here

1892
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,800
right

1893
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:07,759
and maybe what we do is we just say like

1894
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,520
okay found best equals true in this case

1895
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,480
that way we can still run as much of

1896
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:15,840
this as we want

1897
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:16,879
we can also say if found best

1898
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,679
here

1899
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,119
so we don't have to do this but that way

1900
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:23,359
that way we exit the loop at a

1901
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:25,599
controlled point which i think is just

1902
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:26,559
more important to me at this point

1903
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,760
in the

1904
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,679
in the thing

1905
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,920
right

1906
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:33,840
so i would prefer that

1907
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,239
to the alternative

1908
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,800
um but you know you could do it either

1909
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:40,319
way if you did we we have done things

1910
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,400
before where we did like a constructor

1911
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:45,119
destructor pair

1912
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:47,039
to mark begins and ends of loops

1913
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:49,519
so you know if that's something you want

1914
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:51,119
to do i'm not going to get mad

1915
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,639
but

1916
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:53,840
in this particular case i didn't like

1917
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,199
that

1918
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,600
uh i

1919
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:59,839
i didn't really like that solution so

1920
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,639
yeah i'm less inclined all right so back

1921
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:06,039
to what we were trying to debug before

1922
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:06,039
well that's interesting

1923
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:14,319
there is something that happens in that

1924
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:18,320
case in that particular case

1925
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:21,319
um oops i don't know how that got there

1926
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:21,319
um

1927
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:28,880
there are no other breakout or breakout

1928
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,280
loops

1929
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,279
in here

1930
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:36,319
so we have one other bug

1931
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,719
right

1932
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:39,840
like we have a bug of a different kind

1933
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:41,679
because

1934
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,639
i don't i don't recall seeing any other

1935
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:44,560
way

1936
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,840
that you could break out of anything

1937
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:49,120
without completing your diagram maybe

1938
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:51,039
i'm maybe i'm wrong maybe i'm missing

1939
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:52,800
something

1940
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:54,319
but at that point you look at what's

1941
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,119
happening in here there's there's no

1942
01:23:54,319 --> 01:24:01,639
real way to jump out of this anymore

1943
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:01,639
and the rest of the things aren't loops

1944
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,719
so i don't know

1945
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,439
i don't know how we would

1946
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:24,319
get that result so that's still

1947
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:24,319
troubling right

1948
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:29,119
let's see if we can make it happen in

1949
01:24:27,198 --> 01:24:33,039
debug mode so we can see what kind of a

1950
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:33,039
of a beginning pairing we have

1951
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:42,399
we should turn off lighting one of these

1952
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,440
days or just fix it so that it's not so

1953
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:45,519
slow

1954
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:47,439
because debug mode actually runs

1955
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,719
totally fine

1956
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:49,839
in a lot of cases although i suppose

1957
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,079
with collision detecting being

1958
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,440
completely unoptimized that we would

1959
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:54,639
have to do as well which is what we're

1960
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:58,638
working on so i suppose we don't really

1961
01:24:54,639 --> 01:25:01,119
have that luxury at the end of the day

1962
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,119
too bad

1963
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:07,679
so i'm not really doing anything here

1964
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:09,599
i'm just seeing if i can make

1965
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:11,440
um

1966
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,600
a uh

1967
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:15,599
you know

1968
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,840
make a trigger like make it trigger that

1969
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,800
path where the beginning ends don't

1970
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,039
balance

1971
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,039
um

1972
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:27,799
while in debug mode so i can inspect

1973
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,800
easier

1974
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,000
not looking good

1975
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,158
in release mode it's pretty easy to

1976
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,600
trigger if only we could ever step

1977
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:50,079
through anything

1978
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,840
you know imagine a world where like

1979
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:53,359
someone made a debugger where you could

1980
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,239
actually step through release mode code

1981
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:58,319
and inspect anything ever

1982
01:25:56,238 --> 01:25:59,839
how much easier this would all be but of

1983
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:02,719
course you can't

1984
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,960
because the debug information

1985
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:07,829
that they create is so bad that you

1986
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:10,908
can't ever find it out

1987
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,908
[Music]

1988
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:22,039
r15d

1989
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:27,920
what the heck was diagram depth

1990
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,319
it's a u32

1991
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,319
all right

1992
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:36,399
same problem

1993
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,840
so it feels like breaking out was there

1994
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:40,399
another break statement or something

1995
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:44,159
that i missed

1996
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:44,158
i don't think so

1997
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:49,439
so again not really sure how that is

1998
01:26:47,198 --> 01:26:51,759
managing to happen

1999
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:54,000
there isn't like a return

2000
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:56,320
you know in here

2001
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,319
um

2002
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:03,238
so that's a puzzler

2003
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,959
i don't know how it's managing to do

2004
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,119
that i do not know

2005
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,119
and with completely unoptimized it may

2006
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:19,039
be very difficult for me

2007
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:23,319
to actually like step through and see

2008
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:23,319
how it's able to generate that result

2009
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:36,399
you know it could be this

2010
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:41,439
in fact that is what it is i suppose i

2011
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:43,839
do have to do that

2012
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:47,279
which is to say that once you do set

2013
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:49,360
capture it won't record anymore so the

2014
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:51,279
diagram end

2015
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:54,639
won't work

2016
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:55,840
i suppose we could as well not really

2017
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:58,319
so that's

2018
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:00,000
that's all that was

2019
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:01,039
i guess that one's not that hard to find

2020
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,520
so

2021
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:03,519
it's okay

2022
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:07,599
question remains though why is our

2023
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,639
filter broken it could be that our

2024
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,239
filter

2025
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,560
isn't really that broken but i think it

2026
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:15,759
still is so now we just need to go

2027
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:20,080
fix this part and

2028
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:20,079
so at least now that works properly

2029
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:25,359
right

2030
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:26,719
so now we can step through the moves

2031
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:28,799
that occurred

2032
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:31,198
right pretty easily

2033
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:34,000
and that's nice so we can look and see

2034
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:36,079
like okay so we know that like

2035
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,880
this one right here

2036
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:40,800
is the one where we had the issue

2037
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:45,039
so the one right before it

2038
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:45,039
if we look let me go down one level

2039
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:50,639
well that doesn't work very well does it

2040
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,279
so it looks like we're able to step on

2041
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:01,119
the top level but when we go down to the

2042
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:04,559
next level down i can't really step

2043
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:04,559
through what all of these things are

2044
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:14,079
right but i'm not sure why so we have a

2045
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:16,079
little bit more work to do here we can

2046
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:19,519
step through

2047
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:19,519
we can step through the top level

2048
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:23,439
so we can see like everything that

2049
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:25,198
happens leading up to it but we just

2050
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:26,719
can't get down one level from there but

2051
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:28,319
i thought we were supposed to because we

2052
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:31,198
definitely have

2053
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:34,158
one more level of information don't we

2054
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:36,158
like inside like each time through here

2055
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:37,599
there's a beginning end

2056
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:40,238
right

2057
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,280
so each frame we've got one

2058
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:43,119
here

2059
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:46,238
and each

2060
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:47,760
cell of the voxel we've got one here

2061
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:49,759
so we should at least be able to step on

2062
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,760
level one and two

2063
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:54,000
but for some reason we can't

2064
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:56,880
so again still a bug in the filtering

2065
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,399
code presumably

2066
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,719
where for some reason we're not

2067
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:03,439
filtering correctly at the

2068
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:06,399
level below it's like no matter what we

2069
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:08,238
set it to it only shows us the first

2070
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:10,960
step

2071
01:30:08,238 --> 01:30:10,959
or something

2072
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:15,000
why would that be

2073
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:31,039
why would that be

2074
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:37,279
there's got to be something here that's

2075
01:30:34,479 --> 01:30:40,799
counter-intuitive

2076
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:40,800
that makes it so that we can't

2077
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,360
when we descend twice

2078
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:50,319
so when this code path

2079
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:50,319
runs twice instead of once right

2080
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:57,119
so you hit the first begin it's a frame

2081
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:05,199
you do a diagram index increment

2082
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:08,198
uh

2083
01:31:05,198 --> 01:31:08,198
and

2084
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:28,399
yes

2085
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:32,719
i do know what the problem is

2086
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:36,158
when you do a diagram index increment

2087
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:38,719
you also have to clear whatever is at

2088
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:41,198
the depth

2089
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:43,920
that you're going to move into

2090
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:47,919
because otherwise it wouldn't work so

2091
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:47,920
basically when you go to do this

2092
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,510
right

2093
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,000
um you need to do

2094
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:54,079
[Music]

2095
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,319
every time you end the diagram the

2096
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:57,760
diagram index at that depth has to get

2097
01:31:56,319 --> 01:32:00,238
set

2098
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,480
back to zero

2099
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:02,479
right

2100
01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:11,359
because otherwise it'll just keep going

2101
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:13,198
up forever and you'll never yeah so on

2102
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:15,359
the first one we probably could have

2103
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:16,960
done it but then by the time you

2104
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:18,960
increment the top guy to a certain

2105
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,039
number you've incremented the lower

2106
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:23,279
indices too far

2107
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:24,479
and they don't get reset right

2108
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:26,479
so now

2109
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:27,839
if i do like

2110
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:29,678
this

2111
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,880
or whatever

2112
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:32,880
go back to the one i was on

2113
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:42,479
i believe that's the one i wanted to see

2114
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,639
second to last one i go down one level i

2115
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:46,319
should now yeah i should be able to like

2116
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:49,199
just step through all of these and see

2117
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:49,198
what the heck it was

2118
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,360
right

2119
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:55,759
so now we can watch the collision solver

2120
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,839
like work over time

2121
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:00,880
we can start at zero

2122
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,560
so you know this is where

2123
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:04,239
it started on this frame

2124
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,159
it looked through a bunch of these and

2125
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:07,919
it found where it wanted to place the

2126
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:09,119
thing eventually you know whichever one

2127
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,319
that was

2128
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:12,479
we'll have to look and see which one it

2129
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:13,920
was we go down oops

2130
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:15,839
we go up

2131
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,960
and we go to the next diagram this is

2132
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,960
the one where it fails basically

2133
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,840
and we look at what we're actually

2134
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,840
seeing here

2135
01:33:24,319 --> 01:33:29,519
you can see that where it is placed it

2136
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:31,760
finds them all to be read

2137
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,679
right

2138
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:38,239
so if

2139
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:39,520
i actually look carefully where that is

2140
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:40,638
right

2141
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,159
it's like

2142
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:43,520
this one right here

2143
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,759
if i go

2144
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,760
up

2145
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,600
to the previous frame

2146
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:02,718
it sure doesn't seem to be producing

2147
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:05,279
like you can see that it doesn't think

2148
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:07,359
that those green ones

2149
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:10,639
it never even has one on the front row

2150
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:12,960
there where those green ones are

2151
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,960
red

2152
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:17,158
right

2153
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:27,839
hmm

2154
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,440
and you can see like it's true about the

2155
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:37,119
shift

2156
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:40,119
so i think that actually is what's

2157
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:40,119
happening

2158
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:52,319
what that suggests to me

2159
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:59,079
so for the simulation centers

2160
01:34:56,079 --> 01:34:59,079
um

2161
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:04,719
there is some kind of a like

2162
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:06,319
so

2163
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:08,960
i think what that suggests to me is we

2164
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:14,118
just want these things to be on even

2165
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:14,118
movement levels so you know

2166
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:19,599
the unembed code would solve this

2167
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,000
problem but i don't think we want to

2168
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,360
have this problem in the first place

2169
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,279
so like when we look at the motion

2170
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:27,759
displacement size i think what we want

2171
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:29,359
to do is make that be

2172
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,000
you know the trunk dimension for the

2173
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:34,639
world should be related to that

2174
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,639
you know what i mean

2175
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:38,559
and so when we're like setting the chunk

2176
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,920
dim in meters

2177
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,679
uh

2178
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,840
you know

2179
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:46,480
this stuff right

2180
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:48,000
the fundamental unit should be a

2181
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:50,238
multiple

2182
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,238
like

2183
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:55,679
what we really want to do is make these

2184
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:58,158
things be like well defined relative to

2185
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,158
each other

2186
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:04,880
so the motion displacement size and the

2187
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:08,879
fundamental unit are like not

2188
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,880
similar values to each other

2189
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,440
and i think that is

2190
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:16,079
where we're getting this problem then

2191
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:16,079
as a result

2192
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:22,719
if this were 1.5

2193
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,719
we wouldn't have a problem

2194
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,840
if it were one

2195
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:27,839
point

2196
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,800
um

2197
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,600
so 0.125 times

2198
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:45,840
you know

2199
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:48,639
uh

2200
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:51,360
12 or 11.

2201
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:53,279
so 1.375

2202
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:57,118
would be fine

2203
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:57,118
right that would work

2204
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,280
so a slightly different dimension for

2205
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,159
everything

2206
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:11,679
would presumably work okay

2207
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:12,960
although as i say that you can see that

2208
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:14,158
it actually didn't

2209
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,399
right

2210
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:18,399
but i believe that if the chunk if the

2211
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:20,238
actual way that things move although i

2212
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:23,118
guess so you know what i just realized

2213
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:23,118
this may be pointless

2214
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:31,199
we may not always move

2215
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:32,320
uh a even chunk amount for simulation

2216
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:33,839
centers

2217
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:34,880
in fact we know that didn't happen

2218
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:38,719
because when we looked at the simulation

2219
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:39,920
centers they had like garbage in the xyz

2220
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:42,719
so like

2221
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:45,118
yeah simulation centers not moving by a

2222
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,480
constant amount each time is definitely

2223
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:49,839
an issue

2224
01:37:46,479 --> 01:37:49,839
so like

2225
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,039
i don't know what we want to do about

2226
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:57,039
that i do think we want to make sure

2227
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:58,079
that this is

2228
01:37:57,039 --> 01:37:59,920
uh

2229
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:01,600
fixed

2230
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,399
i don't think we want to allow that to

2231
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,639
happen

2232
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:07,039
where the voxel slides relative to

2233
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:07,039
things

2234
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:12,759
but i'm not sure what the best way to

2235
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:12,759
solve that would be

2236
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:24,238
thinking it through i want to go look

2237
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:24,239
and see how we're actually doing that um

2238
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,679
like how does this thing decide

2239
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,600
those

2240
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:32,960
values

2241
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,639
um

2242
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:36,000
because i don't know

2243
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:39,199
like how does it do

2244
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,238
the simulation center

2245
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:44,719
in the first place because i don't know

2246
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:47,118
you can see here it's like oh like

2247
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:50,158
map into chunk space get the simulation

2248
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:52,319
center for this room

2249
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:54,319
you know

2250
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:58,439
i assume that's like the only real place

2251
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:58,439
that simulation center is set

2252
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:03,599
um

2253
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,840
besides there besides the initial

2254
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:13,840
setting right

2255
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:21,919
so really our problem here is just the

2256
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:25,520
simulation center itself is never

2257
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:27,840
rounded to the actual fundamental values

2258
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:30,880
which it should be

2259
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,880
so that's i think

2260
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:34,479
all we would need

2261
01:39:33,439 --> 01:39:36,879
right

2262
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:40,678
so like if you imagined

2263
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:40,679
something like this

2264
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:52,079
this simulation center

2265
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:56,238
is like

2266
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:57,519
hey here's the here's the offset

2267
01:39:56,238 --> 01:39:59,198
right

2268
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:01,040
um it's going to do a map in a trunk

2269
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:02,719
space of this if you then took the

2270
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:05,600
simulation center here and you just like

2271
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:07,359
zeroed the xyz

2272
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,840
you know what i mean

2273
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:09,839
um

2274
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:21,799
or you rounded the simulation center

2275
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,880
i gotta think about this a little

2276
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:39,199
but just like for numerical accuracy

2277
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:40,880
purposes i think you really want to do

2278
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:42,399
that the i mean there's another way you

2279
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,639
could do it which is just to offset the

2280
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:44,638
thing

2281
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:50,560
and maybe that's just fine

2282
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:53,118
but it seems like you would like this to

2283
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,119
be correct

2284
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:57,359
so you'd like the simulation center to

2285
01:40:55,039 --> 01:40:58,719
always be snapped to a fundamental unit

2286
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:00,719
boundary

2287
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:03,719
right

2288
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:03,719
um

2289
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:06,879
and i guess

2290
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:11,359
when i think about it

2291
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:15,920
this is actually fine

2292
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:18,639
because you don't really care what this

2293
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:21,039
fundamental unit is really

2294
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:23,118
um you only care that the simulation

2295
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:24,079
center is always snapped to the motion

2296
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:25,519
unit

2297
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:29,719
right

2298
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:29,719
so really that would be fine

2299
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:42,039
as long as it's always snapped to 0.125

2300
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,920
so in other words this

2301
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:53,919
thing here

2302
01:41:54,079 --> 01:41:57,920
if you just always insisted

2303
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:04,399
uh

2304
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,399
like literally you just did this

2305
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:08,559
right

2306
01:42:06,238 --> 01:42:10,319
where the simulation center

2307
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,679
is always set

2308
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:15,840
to

2309
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:15,840
like some kind of thing where you

2310
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:19,759
you

2311
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:22,000
do the same kind of like re-centering as

2312
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,480
you were doing before

2313
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,479
in theory that would always put you

2314
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:27,479
uh

2315
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:31,149
add a value truncated that now

2316
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:34,229
um

2317
01:42:31,149 --> 01:42:34,228
[Music]

2318
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:38,560
it assumes you started there

2319
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:44,000
so that may not quite be right

2320
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:46,159
um

2321
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,719
but basically if you just do that one

2322
01:42:46,158 --> 01:42:51,839
offset so that now you're always aligned

2323
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:51,840
to that voxel

2324
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,480
now i would argue you won't have that

2325
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:57,760
particular bug

2326
01:42:56,479 --> 01:42:59,678
right

2327
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,880
that particular bug we may have other

2328
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:03,840
ones

2329
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,840
and of course we didn't

2330
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:09,599
not

2331
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:11,840
100 conclusive but

2332
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:14,639
but we didn't

2333
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:16,800
so i think that's a good start but you

2334
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:19,679
know i don't know looks like we have a

2335
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:22,560
one here that's a an issue though right

2336
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:24,480
it's like a detected one here

2337
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:27,119
and that has nothing to do with it

2338
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:29,519
because that's not a camera move

2339
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:31,679
right the camera doesn't move

2340
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:34,480
on that boundary

2341
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:36,800
so you look here we can say hey what

2342
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:39,799
what happened there exactly

2343
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,800
um

2344
01:43:46,238 --> 01:43:49,559
so somehow

2345
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:58,639
it decided it needed to stop

2346
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:58,639
this one but i don't know why

2347
01:44:03,198 --> 01:44:07,839
all right this is the one it actually

2348
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:07,839
needs to stop sorry

2349
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,119
so somehow it decided this one was

2350
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,840
colliding

2351
01:44:13,118 --> 01:44:19,039
but what was it colliding with

2352
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:19,039
there's nothing there

2353
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,119
that just seems straight up buggy right

2354
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:26,559
like there's nothing there for it to

2355
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:26,559
collide with in the first place

2356
01:44:27,198 --> 01:44:32,359
um all of those are

2357
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:32,359
non-colliding

2358
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:40,399
so it just like returned collision for

2359
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:41,280
all of those but there's nothing there

2360
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:43,039
right

2361
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:45,759
so that just looks like straight up

2362
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:49,279
buggy code for the collider so that's a

2363
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:51,039
good thing to debug as well

2364
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:52,880
so i think this might actually be

2365
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:55,118
something i want to do

2366
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,118
um

2367
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:03,480
so we kind of want like a call

2368
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:10,719
that's like a line to

2369
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:14,159
movement grid a line to movement

2370
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,158
voxel or something right

2371
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,639
where

2372
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,639
this

2373
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:21,639
will happen

2374
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:21,639
um

2375
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:34,879
like something like this

2376
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:37,118
and

2377
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:39,359
we probably need seldom in here because

2378
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:41,118
we use it again right so this this kind

2379
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:43,679
of needs to be

2380
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:45,279
um something that that also exists in

2381
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:47,118
here so

2382
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:49,359
you know there's that

2383
01:45:47,118 --> 01:45:49,359
but

2384
01:45:57,039 --> 01:46:00,479
to a first approximation

2385
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:08,079
it's this

2386
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:10,319
so this way when we come through here we

2387
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:12,639
can say like well simulation center

2388
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:14,238
equals align

2389
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:16,480
the thing

2390
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:18,879
right

2391
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:18,879
and

2392
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,279
it returns a v3

2393
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,118
and voxel starting corner

2394
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:40,639
will come from calling it

2395
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:44,159
and then it just needs to be something

2396
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:44,159
exposed to the outside world

2397
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:54,799
so i think that's fine i'm not sure

2398
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:56,880
um

2399
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,239
like again it kind of needs to be

2400
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,000
something

2401
01:46:58,238 --> 01:47:02,879
there's this part here where it's like

2402
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,840
setting the simulation center

2403
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,840
uh to something

2404
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,440
and so that's a little bit troubling

2405
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:11,840
because

2406
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:11,839
you know

2407
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,920
we need this to be correct and it's not

2408
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:22,400
going to be

2409
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:25,039
and so what we really want here is for

2410
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:25,039
this to be

2411
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:32,079
ideally we would like this to be set

2412
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:33,118
later

2413
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:35,039
right

2414
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:37,519
so ideally what we would like this to be

2415
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:39,118
is for this to be just like

2416
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:42,400
always set to all zeros or something and

2417
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:44,479
then it moves to the correct location

2418
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:48,638
so this is kind of annoying because it's

2419
01:47:44,479 --> 01:47:51,519
hard to reset this properly

2420
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:54,960
i'm also not entirely sure

2421
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:54,960
like this part here right

2422
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,400
so i guess that's just gonna work now

2423
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:05,760
that i think about it because it's

2424
01:48:04,399 --> 01:48:06,960
already always going to be set to zero

2425
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,440
anyway

2426
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,719
so i guess that's okay it's not

2427
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:11,759
the best thing in the world but it's

2428
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,840
okay

2429
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:16,000
so i think that's okay for now uh maybe

2430
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:18,239
we'll put off to next weekend

2431
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,479
debugging the uh we have like a

2432
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:23,839
collision detection problem there right

2433
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:24,718
so in here we had a problem where

2434
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:26,719
we

2435
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:28,399
had the glove in a place where it could

2436
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:30,399
totally move just fine but the collision

2437
01:48:28,399 --> 01:48:32,799
detector said like no it couldn't

2438
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:33,920
and there's really not an explanation

2439
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,360
for this

2440
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,399
uh because

2441
01:48:35,359 --> 01:48:38,799
there was

2442
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:40,799
no more for it to go so it doesn't make

2443
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:43,199
sense i mean nowhere nothing to collide

2444
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:46,400
with so it doesn't make a lot of sense

2445
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:48,559
why would we be seeing that um

2446
01:48:46,399 --> 01:48:49,920
uh anyway

2447
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,880
again

2448
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:54,480
though

2449
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:56,960
uh getting much closer now to solid

2450
01:48:54,479 --> 01:48:58,799
um and i like the fact that we now have

2451
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,880
really good tracing in there so i can

2452
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:02,800
step through and watch

2453
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:04,000
and see what the heck it's doing

2454
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,760
because that's really the only way to

2455
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,639
debug these things there's no other way

2456
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:09,840
to do it right

2457
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:11,039
so you can see if you play around with

2458
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,039
it for a while you get into these

2459
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:15,198
situations again and here i assume this

2460
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:16,800
is exactly the same bug where it's just

2461
01:49:15,198 --> 01:49:18,719
maybe maybe our sphere collision

2462
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,360
detector for example is just buggy it's

2463
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:21,359
not very good

2464
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,239
um

2465
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:27,840
because again like the other time too it

2466
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:29,439
wasn't even on a case where the camera

2467
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,719
moved so it wasn't even something that

2468
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:32,559
could really be

2469
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:33,439
explained away

2470
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:36,480
um

2471
01:49:33,439 --> 01:49:38,158
in that context right

2472
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:40,959
uh yeah and i mean that's just floating

2473
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:43,439
in the middle of nowhere like there's no

2474
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:46,079
there's nothing for it to touch

2475
01:49:43,439 --> 01:49:48,079
so it looks like our sphere tester like

2476
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:50,880
has some kind of a bad or just some

2477
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:52,079
other aspect of the system right

2478
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,599
um

2479
01:49:52,079 --> 01:49:55,279
where it's testing these and thinking

2480
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:56,560
they're failing so that's our next

2481
01:49:55,279 --> 01:49:59,759
that's next week

2482
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:59,760
but otherwise i think we're good

2483
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:06,000
i think we are now good

2484
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:11,598
right

2485
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,800
um so

2486
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:13,920
i like the fact we fixed the camera

2487
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,079
thing i like the fact that we're now

2488
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,560
around to the box so properly we have a

2489
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:20,238
bug in the sphere collision section or

2490
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:21,440
just the way that it sets the values so

2491
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:23,198
it could be that the collision detector

2492
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:25,839
is returning the correct value

2493
01:50:23,198 --> 01:50:25,839
and in fact

2494
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:32,319
you know what we can check that really

2495
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:34,000
easily

2496
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:36,719
when we do

2497
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,719
the collide

2498
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:40,239
thing uh

2499
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:48,239
so when we do this collides part we

2500
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:49,199
could just draw that in here right as

2501
01:50:48,238 --> 01:50:52,718
well

2502
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:54,238
so in shapes collide uh when we do this

2503
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:57,439
stuff

2504
01:50:54,238 --> 01:51:00,319
we know what the result is

2505
01:50:57,439 --> 01:51:02,479
uh for colliding and not oh well i guess

2506
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:03,679
we only draw it if it collides

2507
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:05,919
oh okay

2508
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:07,520
so the fact that we saw those fears is

2509
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,719
just wrong

2510
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:10,639
so actually

2511
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,439
we already know

2512
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:14,319
uh

2513
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:14,319
we already know

2514
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:17,839
that it's wrong

2515
01:51:19,359 --> 01:51:24,279
it would seem

2516
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:24,279
right

2517
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:41,719
oh

2518
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:21,760
so of course it's hard to get it to

2519
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,279
trigger which is what you'd expect you

2520
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,560
know if it's some kind of subtle problem

2521
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:26,399
in our collision detector right you

2522
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,920
can't just there we go so you kind of

2523
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:29,359
have to wait a little while to get it to

2524
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:31,039
go

2525
01:52:29,359 --> 01:52:32,319
but what what it looked like in that

2526
01:52:31,039 --> 01:52:33,279
routine to me

2527
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:37,359
um

2528
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:37,359
very you know pretty clearly right

2529
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:42,480
uh is that if we're diagramming and the

2530
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:44,639
result is that we collided then we draw

2531
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:46,238
it but if it's not

2532
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,560
colliding

2533
01:52:46,238 --> 01:52:50,399
then it never will so in fact this is

2534
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,599
like meaningless

2535
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:54,238
right

2536
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:55,760
we never we never actually do that

2537
01:52:54,238 --> 01:52:57,519
we only come in here and draw it if

2538
01:52:55,760 --> 01:53:00,079
that's the case

2539
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:01,199
so what that would suggest is that when

2540
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:05,198
we look

2541
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:07,839
at you know wherever this thing ended up

2542
01:53:05,198 --> 01:53:09,198
right there

2543
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,360
uh

2544
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:14,399
the fact that it draws all of these

2545
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:16,479
spheres is just blatantly wrong there

2546
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:18,000
are two that look like they collide the

2547
01:53:16,479 --> 01:53:20,319
bottom two

2548
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,719
uh but those top ones there's nothing

2549
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:23,920
for them to collide with like there's no

2550
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:26,800
actual

2551
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:29,039
there's nothing for them to touch

2552
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,039
right

2553
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:36,359
so that's just like we got a bug in that

2554
01:53:32,158 --> 01:53:36,359
which is you know

2555
01:53:41,359 --> 01:53:46,399
and what's what's really kind of strange

2556
01:53:44,238 --> 01:53:48,559
about that in fact

2557
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:52,399
um is that they're supposed to be a

2558
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:53,760
secondary thing that we draw here right

2559
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:56,719
um

2560
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,719
meaning if you look

2561
01:53:57,279 --> 01:54:01,519
at this code

2562
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:04,639
you can see that it always draws like

2563
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:06,960
two spheres a sphere in a box

2564
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:08,880
or two boxes

2565
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:12,319
now we know it won't be two boxes

2566
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:14,800
because one of them's a sphere

2567
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:15,679
so we know that it will be this

2568
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,800
set

2569
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:19,599
furthermore

2570
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:21,039
there shouldn't be any spheres

2571
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:22,239
um

2572
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:24,158
i don't know if there's any other

2573
01:54:22,238 --> 01:54:26,079
spheres in the entire game right now

2574
01:54:24,158 --> 01:54:28,638
other than the glove

2575
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:30,238
so we pretty much know it's this these

2576
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:31,920
two cases

2577
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:33,598
and furthermore we know that when we

2578
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,118
call this code

2579
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:38,079
we always pass

2580
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:40,880
the mover and then the test

2581
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:42,479
so we know the mover which is a is a

2582
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:45,440
sphere

2583
01:54:42,479 --> 01:54:47,279
and we know that b is presumably not

2584
01:54:45,439 --> 01:54:48,719
so we know that this is the code that

2585
01:54:47,279 --> 01:54:52,000
we're running

2586
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:55,359
and there should be a box

2587
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,359
right this box b

2588
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:58,400
so

2589
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,960
somehow

2590
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:03,759
and we don't know how

2591
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:06,399
there is supposedly a box that we are

2592
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:08,320
colliding with that is here

2593
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:09,839
that's what that oh well no that that

2594
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:10,880
line might not be that i shouldn't say

2595
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:13,279
that we don't actually know what that

2596
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,279
line is

2597
01:55:14,238 --> 01:55:18,718
um but like

2598
01:55:16,079 --> 01:55:20,559
there's the line

2599
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,319
so there's a box here

2600
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:24,960
that we're colliding with

2601
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:27,118
and like there is no such box and when

2602
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:28,319
you draw it like because we are drawing

2603
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:30,639
the box

2604
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:33,279
it's not there

2605
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:35,760
like we don't see any box

2606
01:55:33,279 --> 01:55:35,759
show up

2607
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,399
you know

2608
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:45,279
you know maybe it's like a very tiny

2609
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:47,119
little invisible box

2610
01:55:45,279 --> 01:55:48,880
i don't know

2611
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:50,880
so that's

2612
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:53,359
particularly odd

2613
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:55,118
we do record what box we think it is

2614
01:55:53,359 --> 01:55:56,319
like this box b

2615
01:55:55,118 --> 01:55:57,679
thing here

2616
01:55:56,319 --> 01:55:59,279
right

2617
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:00,639
so one thing we might

2618
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:04,238
do

2619
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:04,239
is we might want to

2620
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:11,679
like we might want to

2621
01:56:09,359 --> 01:56:15,519
dump the data for whichever diagram

2622
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:17,840
thing we're on in here or something

2623
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:20,000
so that we can see what the actual value

2624
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:22,880
of b is because it's like what is this

2625
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,118
box it's like a phantom bug box

2626
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,118
right

2627
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:30,399
and we just have no idea we don't know

2628
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:31,520
where this phantom bug box is coming

2629
01:56:30,399 --> 01:56:35,359
from

2630
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:37,440
it's some magical mystery box

2631
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:40,880
like the magical mystery tour

2632
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:40,879
that doesn't actually exist there

2633
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:43,840
right

2634
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:00,319
so i don't know

2635
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:01,599
that's going to be a puzzler

2636
01:57:00,319 --> 01:57:03,840
that's going to be a puzzler for next

2637
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,840
time

2638
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:14,000
we have no idea what it is

2639
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:16,639
and i guess we'll leave it for next time

2640
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,639
any questions

2641
01:57:20,158 --> 01:57:24,559
but we're not quite sure right like

2642
01:57:22,158 --> 01:57:27,439
we're now quite sure what's going on but

2643
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:29,119
like something that we can't see like

2644
01:57:27,439 --> 01:57:31,839
the size of zero or infinite or

2645
01:57:29,118 --> 01:57:31,839
something right

2646
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:34,638
so

2647
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:39,759
yeah it could be like very large it

2648
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:42,000
could be like a huge box

2649
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:44,239
that's so big you can't see it

2650
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,880
that only existed on that one frame for

2651
01:57:44,238 --> 01:57:46,879
some reason

2652
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:53,039
i mean it can't be the hero's head i

2653
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:54,399
don't think because we disabled that

2654
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:55,599
collision box

2655
01:57:54,399 --> 01:57:56,638
right

2656
01:57:55,599 --> 01:57:58,319
so

2657
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:01,039
this

2658
01:57:58,319 --> 01:58:06,079
would that would do it

2659
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:07,599
but it ain't there right um

2660
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:09,519
so

2661
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:11,199
that's why we're not considering that

2662
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:13,119
possibility

2663
01:58:11,198 --> 01:58:14,238
you cannot move diagonally in this game

2664
01:58:13,118 --> 01:58:16,880
no

2665
01:58:14,238 --> 01:58:20,439
can only move

2666
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:20,440
in the cardinal directions

2667
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:30,000
yeah we definitely can write that it's

2668
01:58:27,118 --> 01:58:31,679
just we uh we need some we just need to

2669
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,560
add in our debug display something to do

2670
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:33,920
that

2671
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:35,520
which is what i was suggesting we do

2672
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:37,599
last time so we can see what the value

2673
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,119
is is that thing the other thing that we

2674
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:40,880
probably want to do is like be able to

2675
01:58:39,118 --> 01:58:41,920
tag the entity or something

2676
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:44,639
like

2677
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:46,480
if this entity when we do collides at p

2678
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:50,079
and we loop over the entities if we had

2679
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:50,079
a thing that basically said like oh

2680
01:58:51,359 --> 01:58:55,279
pass a like like each entity gets tagged

2681
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:56,560
with like which generator function

2682
01:58:55,279 --> 01:58:58,319
generated it

2683
01:58:56,560 --> 01:59:00,480
then we can also print out like what

2684
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:02,799
type of entity it was

2685
01:59:00,479 --> 01:59:04,158
right like who generated this entity

2686
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:06,239
you know

2687
01:59:04,158 --> 01:59:08,879
um and that would help us

2688
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:11,919
to determine like what kind of a thing

2689
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:11,920
it collided with as well

2690
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:18,158
but yeah i have no idea where that

2691
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:20,479
box is coming with

2692
01:59:18,158 --> 01:59:20,479
all right

2693
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:31,800
yeah refinement is still running

2694
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:47,359
it could be

2695
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:49,599
that uh the tunneling was happening

2696
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:51,679
because of the camera movement thing too

2697
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:54,719
right

2698
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:54,719
which we now fixed

2699
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,880
yeah the entity cache system is still in

2700
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,520
this is all going through the end of the

2701
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:03,520
cache system

2702
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:09,039
um

2703
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:12,560
i don't think the entity cache system

2704
02:00:11,118 --> 02:00:14,399
could explain this though because we're

2705
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:16,560
drawing what we think so let's suppose

2706
02:00:14,399 --> 02:00:18,319
there was a phantom entity on that frame

2707
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:19,520
that the cache system erroneously said

2708
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:22,000
was there

2709
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:25,280
we should still have seen it drawn

2710
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,639
right so the fact that we don't see

2711
02:00:25,279 --> 02:00:28,238
the thing that it's supposed to collide

2712
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:30,159
with suggests that it's more of like a

2713
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:32,238
garbage value problem

2714
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:34,238
because somehow there was something for

2715
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:35,919
it to collide with that we don't then

2716
02:00:34,238 --> 02:00:36,799
draw which doesn't make a whole lot of

2717
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:38,239
sense

2718
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:41,239
right

2719
02:00:38,238 --> 02:00:41,238
um

2720
02:00:45,359 --> 02:00:47,598
no i don't think the mystery box pushed

2721
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:49,679
into the wall i think that was probably

2722
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:52,079
the camera changing when you hop across

2723
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:53,679
the threshold it would change

2724
02:00:52,079 --> 02:00:55,760
be embedded

2725
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:59,279
and then be able to go go through it

2726
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:59,280
because of the tunneling right

2727
02:01:06,319 --> 02:01:13,000
that's what i think

2728
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:13,000
that's that'd be my guess anyway

2729
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,079
so i don't think this this particular

2730
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:04,000
part has anything to do with the camera

2731
02:02:02,079 --> 02:02:05,279
moving the reason i say that is it

2732
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,279
seemed like i was able to get it to

2733
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:09,118
happen without being at a camera

2734
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:11,118
threshold at all

2735
02:02:09,118 --> 02:02:12,719
now maybe that's false

2736
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:14,960
but i thought that's what was able to

2737
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:16,158
happen

2738
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:17,840
because i thought we were able to do it

2739
02:02:16,158 --> 02:02:19,118
just in this room

2740
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:21,920
without

2741
02:02:19,118 --> 02:02:23,359
the hero moving out of the room i

2742
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,319
thought

2743
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:27,118
um

2744
02:02:24,319 --> 02:02:29,439
i could be wrong about that

2745
02:02:27,118 --> 02:02:31,679
but i mean look right like we never

2746
02:02:29,439 --> 02:02:33,039
changed the camera and and it did it so

2747
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:34,880
it seems like it's just one of these

2748
02:02:33,039 --> 02:02:37,359
things that like is some kind of garbage

2749
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:39,599
value problem where we're just like

2750
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:41,198
doing something totally wrong like you

2751
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:43,119
know

2752
02:02:41,198 --> 02:02:44,960
misattributing the location of something

2753
02:02:43,118 --> 02:02:47,679
but like you know we weren't moving the

2754
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:50,000
camera and it just recorded collisions

2755
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:53,520
for all four of those points even though

2756
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:57,039
none of those points are colliding right

2757
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:58,719
so like somehow just stationarily you

2758
02:02:57,039 --> 02:03:00,158
get in a situation where it suddenly

2759
02:02:58,719 --> 02:03:01,599
thinks a bunch of things glide and they

2760
02:03:00,158 --> 02:03:03,118
definitely don't

2761
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:04,800
now it could just be like this routine

2762
02:03:03,118 --> 02:03:07,279
is just buggy like it could be that like

2763
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,159
this math is wrong in a subtle way or

2764
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:09,279
something

2765
02:03:08,158 --> 02:03:10,638
right

2766
02:03:09,279 --> 02:03:12,238
so it's not

2767
02:03:10,639 --> 02:03:14,960
necessarily the case that's coming up

2768
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:16,319
but again this is the part that really

2769
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:18,158
is confusing me

2770
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:19,279
unless it actually is drawing this thing

2771
02:03:18,158 --> 02:03:22,079
somewhere

2772
02:03:19,279 --> 02:03:23,840
which maybe it is

2773
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:25,359
i mean i guess we didn't actually try to

2774
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:27,520
determine that there's

2775
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:30,319
nowhere else

2776
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:32,320
for it to do this but

2777
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:34,559
um but you saw what what i mean right

2778
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:36,479
like we're not even moving

2779
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:38,320
uh the

2780
02:03:36,479 --> 02:03:39,919
the game camera is staying stationary

2781
02:03:38,319 --> 02:03:42,799
this entire time

2782
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:46,840
uh and we were able to get it to happen

2783
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:46,840
so i don't think it's required

2784
02:04:14,078 --> 02:04:19,439
it does seem however like i had to move

2785
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,440
out of where i was though slightly

2786
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:24,159
like i'm not able to get it to happen

2787
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:26,400
just in here but when i moved up here

2788
02:04:24,158 --> 02:04:28,638
i was able to get it to happen

2789
02:04:26,399 --> 02:04:30,960
of course that may just be a random luck

2790
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:32,960
again this doesn't trigger very often

2791
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:34,960
right it seems to take thousands of

2792
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:36,239
frames to get it to happen

2793
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:37,920
so it's kind of one of those

2794
02:04:36,238 --> 02:04:40,158
unpredictable bugs where you're like i

2795
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:41,760
can't really make generalizations about

2796
02:04:40,158 --> 02:04:43,759
when it doesn't doesn't happen because

2797
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:45,280
it's so rare that like who knows what

2798
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:47,280
the you know

2799
02:04:45,279 --> 02:04:48,960
what the actual thing that precipitated

2800
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:51,960
the bug was

2801
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,960
um

2802
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:00,399
but you definitely saw it happen we just

2803
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:04,360
don't know how to make it happen more

2804
02:05:00,399 --> 02:05:04,359
reliably than that unfortunately

2805
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:19,078
no post stream i really only tr i try to

2806
02:05:14,719 --> 02:05:19,078
take only questions that are on topic

2807
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:25,760
pre-stream you can ask general questions

2808
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:25,760
because we haven't started yet

2809
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:34,439
not that we always really adhere to that

2810
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:34,440
rule but we should

2811
02:05:55,198 --> 02:06:00,118
well this is a very hard bug to

2812
02:05:56,639 --> 02:06:00,118
reproduce apparently

2813
02:06:03,359 --> 02:06:05,920
there we go

2814
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:09,279
um

2815
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:12,239
so you know

2816
02:06:13,039 --> 02:06:17,439
you can see it light up boxes as they

2817
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:19,679
get hit right you see them lighting up

2818
02:06:17,439 --> 02:06:20,638
the boxes that it hits

2819
02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:22,880
and then

2820
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:22,880
oh

2821
02:06:27,039 --> 02:06:31,118
my led strip just

2822
02:06:29,439 --> 02:06:34,879
got wanked

2823
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:34,880
that was bad i know what happened there

2824
02:06:35,198 --> 02:06:37,439
um

2825
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:41,520
so you can see here like when we hit

2826
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:42,239
this case

2827
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:44,880
uh

2828
02:06:42,238 --> 02:06:47,678
who is the box that is getting hit like

2829
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:51,199
nothing in the entire world

2830
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:51,199
seems to be highlighted white

2831
02:06:51,279 --> 02:06:56,639
right there's it's just not there

2832
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:58,960
so it's not like a very large box it's

2833
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:00,800
not an offs like some random entity over

2834
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:04,719
here is getting hit

2835
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:07,679
like there's nothing keyed

2836
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:09,039
the entire time nothing is keyed

2837
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:10,840
right

2838
02:07:09,039 --> 02:07:14,560
so i don't

2839
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:17,599
know what this could be colliding with

2840
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:20,079
because it doesn't actually show

2841
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:22,480
now just to underscore this point

2842
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:24,639
if you imagine like here right

2843
02:07:22,479 --> 02:07:26,799
what you can see is every time you hit a

2844
02:07:24,639 --> 02:07:28,639
collider you see like the wall light up

2845
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:31,039
that's the thing it hit

2846
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:32,159
right so you can see

2847
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:33,439
that

2848
02:07:32,158 --> 02:07:35,359
every time you look at one of those

2849
02:07:33,439 --> 02:07:36,559
sphere hits it it shows you and

2850
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:38,158
furthermore it shows you the direction

2851
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:40,000
it's in right so like that little thing

2852
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:42,960
there is like oh it's over here right

2853
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,560
the little white line

2854
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:46,480
so like that's what i'm talking about

2855
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:48,320
when i say we've got a bug is that like

2856
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:50,000
it's pretty clear this is a nonsense

2857
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:51,519
collision so the result that we're

2858
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,439
getting when we think this thing has

2859
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:54,800
collided it thinks it's colliding with

2860
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:57,519
something

2861
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:59,279
but it's not even ju it's not even a bug

2862
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:03,199
in this math

2863
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:05,279
it's a bug in the input to the function

2864
02:08:03,198 --> 02:08:09,439
somehow because the thing that we

2865
02:08:05,279 --> 02:08:10,800
suppose the cloud with does not exist

2866
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:13,919
right

2867
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:13,920
it does not exist

2868
02:08:17,039 --> 02:08:21,000
and so we don't know

2869
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:27,440
and it's pointing

2870
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:27,439
right it's pointing somewhere

2871
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:32,639
they're pointing to different things

2872
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:33,520
even like look at that

2873
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:35,679
like

2874
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:37,520
it says we collided with two things one

2875
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:40,000
there and one there

2876
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:43,800
right but we didn't

2877
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:43,800
like we definitely didn't

2878
02:08:51,118 --> 02:08:55,679
the line going off to the left is where

2879
02:08:53,198 --> 02:08:57,678
the move was supposed to be going

2880
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:58,480
towards i think

2881
02:08:57,679 --> 02:09:01,359
right

2882
02:08:58,479 --> 02:09:03,039
so that's like oh you know we were going

2883
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:04,799
we were trying to go this direction on

2884
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:07,599
this frame it wanted to head over this

2885
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:10,159
direction to here

2886
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:12,639
is all that is

2887
02:09:10,158 --> 02:09:12,638
i believe

2888
02:09:12,719 --> 02:09:16,000
um

2889
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:19,399
don't quote me on that but i believe

2890
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,399
that's what's happening

2891
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:37,199
uh the direction vectors aren't

2892
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:39,440
normalized

2893
02:09:37,198 --> 02:09:41,598
it's literally just a line to the center

2894
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:43,678
of the other thing so like it thinks the

2895
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:47,239
thing we collided with it thinks is

2896
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:47,239
centered there

2897
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:56,719
and centered is the wrong um term here i

2898
02:09:54,479 --> 02:09:56,718
guess

2899
02:09:59,359 --> 02:10:02,238
you know uh there's another possibility

2900
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:04,560
which is that the diagramming system is

2901
02:10:02,238 --> 02:10:04,559
broken

2902
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:10,399
uh like maybe this is a valid box and

2903
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:12,239
it's drawing it wrong

2904
02:10:10,399 --> 02:10:13,920
in some cases or something i mean i

2905
02:10:12,238 --> 02:10:14,959
don't know exactly why that would be but

2906
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:16,000
like

2907
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:16,880
you know it's not entirely out of the

2908
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,319
question

2909
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:20,560
there is one thing that's a little weird

2910
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:22,000
so let's think about this for a second

2911
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:23,920
so let's take a case where something is

2912
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,679
colliding and it draws

2913
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:29,039
it correctly

2914
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:30,399
like there or something

2915
02:10:29,039 --> 02:10:33,599
um

2916
02:10:30,399 --> 02:10:36,078
it's true that the get center function

2917
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:38,159
like something is weird

2918
02:10:36,078 --> 02:10:39,359
right because

2919
02:10:38,158 --> 02:10:41,759
that

2920
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:46,319
that is the center of the sphere

2921
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:46,320
it is the closest point on the box

2922
02:10:46,399 --> 02:10:51,039
okay that is what it's doing

2923
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:51,039
never mind

2924
02:10:54,238 --> 02:10:58,399
um so that is what it was supposed to do

2925
02:10:56,399 --> 02:11:01,039
that's fine

2926
02:10:58,399 --> 02:11:02,879
um so yeah so like we don't know whether

2927
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:04,399
it's a box or a sphere intersection i

2928
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:06,239
guess

2929
02:11:04,399 --> 02:11:08,638
um which maybe we should draw so we can

2930
02:11:06,238 --> 02:11:08,638
see it

2931
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:13,679
um but yeah like if you look there it's

2932
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:16,719
like oh yeah what's the closest point on

2933
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:18,719
the box quote-unquote

2934
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:20,719
and it's like there

2935
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:23,920
like okay so it's the closest point on

2936
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:26,639
the box is there for what box there's no

2937
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:28,399
box at all that could possibly have that

2938
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:29,440
be the closest point

2939
02:11:28,399 --> 02:11:31,439
right

2940
02:11:29,439 --> 02:11:33,198
so not only is it not drawing this box

2941
02:11:31,439 --> 02:11:34,719
supposed box

2942
02:11:33,198 --> 02:11:36,078
so we don't know what the heck the box

2943
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:38,800
input is

2944
02:11:36,078 --> 02:11:40,399
but it also yeah doesn't have that that

2945
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:42,239
property

2946
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:44,960
now it's possible that we created like a

2947
02:11:42,238 --> 02:11:47,439
phantom box that's inverted

2948
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:50,158
and a phantom box that's inverted

2949
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:50,158
maybe would

2950
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:56,399
like suppose we pass it we come in here

2951
02:11:54,078 --> 02:11:56,399
um

2952
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:02,319
and and we look at like a do we have a

2953
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:04,718
house volume for other things i don't no

2954
02:12:02,319 --> 02:12:09,359
i don't think we do but we if we look we

2955
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:10,960
could see in um like the rectangle

2956
02:12:09,359 --> 02:12:11,839
code

2957
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:13,279
um

2958
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:16,520
which i guess is in here i don't

2959
02:12:13,279 --> 02:12:16,519
actually know

2960
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:23,760
so

2961
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:25,440
it's called has area here i guess but we

2962
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:26,960
could so we could check to see if this

2963
02:12:25,439 --> 02:12:28,158
thing has area

2964
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:29,118
right

2965
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:31,359
um

2966
02:12:29,118 --> 02:12:33,519
so we could do something like oh if we

2967
02:12:31,359 --> 02:12:35,920
collided

2968
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:38,800
and we go in here and we say like oh we

2969
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:40,078
collided with a rect with a box

2970
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:40,880
right

2971
02:12:40,078 --> 02:12:42,880
so

2972
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:45,359
we're in one of these two cases and we

2973
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:49,078
just say like look let's just assert

2974
02:12:45,359 --> 02:12:49,078
that it has area

2975
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:56,879
um so in this case it's a that is the

2976
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,399
box and in their case it was b

2977
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:02,400
we could just see like is this some

2978
02:12:58,399 --> 02:13:04,399
weird like inverted box but even that

2979
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:06,399
should draw

2980
02:13:04,399 --> 02:13:08,960
so i don't think that would be the case

2981
02:13:06,399 --> 02:13:08,960
but i don't know

2982
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:13,239
evidently not

2983
02:13:16,399 --> 02:13:20,879
so so this might have something to do

2984
02:13:18,719 --> 02:13:22,319
with it right this might have something

2985
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:24,480
to do with it what

2986
02:13:22,319 --> 02:13:27,118
oh those are little tiny

2987
02:13:24,479 --> 02:13:30,118
pictures of step into interesting

2988
02:13:27,118 --> 02:13:30,118
um

2989
02:13:37,039 --> 02:13:41,439
so let's just see

2990
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:44,000
who these people are who don't have any

2991
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:46,238
area

2992
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,238
um

2993
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:56,520
so like here's a supposed box

2994
02:13:52,439 --> 02:13:56,519
right um

2995
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:02,960
yeah so so there are things that like i

2996
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:06,319
guess are going into the collision

2997
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:10,118
section collision detection system

2998
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:10,118
that have no area

2999
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:24,039
that's disturbing

3000
02:14:30,719 --> 02:14:34,118
that's uh

3001
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:51,880
that's kind of disturbing so wait a

3002
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,880
minute

3003
02:14:56,479 --> 02:15:01,598
are we just like setting people who have

3004
02:14:59,439 --> 02:15:03,839
no collision volume are we saying that

3005
02:15:01,599 --> 02:15:03,840
they

3006
02:15:04,479 --> 02:15:10,000
does this just not filter on something

3007
02:15:06,479 --> 02:15:11,598
that should be filtered on that may be

3008
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:15,118
what's going on here maybe we don't have

3009
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:15,119
a bug after i mean we have a book but

3010
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:27,760
so do we not have a like thing for

3011
02:15:24,158 --> 02:15:27,759
participating in collision or not

3012
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:34,079
it looks like we don't

3013
02:15:34,319 --> 02:15:38,399
so really

3014
02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:40,719
yeah i mean this is not very good so so

3015
02:15:38,399 --> 02:15:44,638
maybe

3016
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:44,639
actually this is our entire problem

3017
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:54,480
maybe actually

3018
02:15:51,679 --> 02:15:54,480
this code

3019
02:15:55,198 --> 02:16:00,319
when we do shapes collide

3020
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:02,399
uh

3021
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:05,399
has to have volume

3022
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:05,399
right

3023
02:16:14,479 --> 02:16:19,279
so yeah let's just do that so when we do

3024
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:21,198
move entity in here i think we just

3025
02:16:19,279 --> 02:16:23,679
yeah i mean like i think we just checked

3026
02:16:21,198 --> 02:16:23,678
the corners

3027
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:29,000
uh

3028
02:16:25,198 --> 02:16:29,000
only for things like

3029
02:16:32,318 --> 02:16:35,679
for ha for that actually have collision

3030
02:16:34,718 --> 02:16:37,279
volumes

3031
02:16:35,679 --> 02:16:40,638
i guess we just assumed that was

3032
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:40,639
happening but it definitely wasn't

3033
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:47,599
so basically if the if the collision

3034
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:49,040
volume is not valid then we just don't

3035
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:52,000
test the thing we should probably just

3036
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:54,960
have a flag for that but

3037
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,959
uh you know we didn't

3038
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:57,200
so

3039
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,760
that's

3040
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:01,439
probably just all it was i guess we

3041
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:03,200
actually have entities in there that are

3042
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:04,880
stuck that are set to like not color

3043
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:06,079
just fake things like

3044
02:17:04,879 --> 02:17:10,518
you know

3045
02:17:06,079 --> 02:17:10,519
markup things we used or whatever

3046
02:17:14,959 --> 02:17:19,279
i'm not sure that's actually what it was

3047
02:17:16,799 --> 02:17:20,718
but that was definitely a problem

3048
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:22,639
because we don't want to be processing

3049
02:17:20,718 --> 02:17:23,919
those anyway

3050
02:17:22,638 --> 02:17:25,759
right

3051
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:27,200
um

3052
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,398
we don't want to be processing those

3053
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:29,599
anyway

3054
02:17:28,398 --> 02:17:31,119
all right so i don't know that we

3055
02:17:29,599 --> 02:17:32,719
actually fixed the bug i think next week

3056
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:34,079
we'll have to look for it

3057
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:36,239
in earnest

3058
02:17:34,079 --> 02:17:37,760
uh but at least we now know that that

3059
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:39,760
we're not like checking a bunch of

3060
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:42,800
things that don't that weren't supposed

3061
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:44,159
to be colliders which may have caused us

3062
02:17:42,799 --> 02:17:46,398
a lot of problems

3063
02:17:44,159 --> 02:17:46,398
right

3064
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:49,879
so

3065
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:24,840
all right

3066
02:18:26,079 --> 02:18:30,359
all right i'm gonna call it

3067
02:18:38,799 --> 02:18:45,438
that all seems good

3068
02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:45,439
that all seems good

3069
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:50,719
all right folks so i'm gonna wrap it up

3070
02:18:48,239 --> 02:18:54,000
thank you everyone for joining me um if

3071
02:18:50,718 --> 02:18:57,119
you do by the way we our kickstarter for

3072
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:58,959
meow the infinite is still going

3073
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:01,599
it's actually halfway through

3074
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:03,039
it did really well this time

3075
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:04,719
so

3076
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:05,840
it's it's doing excellent but it's only

3077
02:19:04,718 --> 02:19:07,199
about halfway through if you're

3078
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:09,679
interested in a cool graphic novel

3079
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:10,719
series i would highly highly suggest

3080
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:12,558
checking out

3081
02:19:10,718 --> 02:19:15,839
our kickstarter for meow the infinite

3082
02:19:12,558 --> 02:19:16,718
book two you can get book one as well

3083
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:18,960
um

3084
02:19:16,718 --> 02:19:20,638
i will post the link

3085
02:19:18,959 --> 02:19:22,718
into the chat

3086
02:19:20,638 --> 02:19:24,159
but i think there'll also there's also

3087
02:19:22,718 --> 02:19:25,119
like a link

3088
02:19:24,159 --> 02:19:27,200
um

3089
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:28,319
at the bottom of the twitch

3090
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,679
page

3091
02:19:28,318 --> 02:19:32,000
thing

3092
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:33,920
uh right like the little like

3093
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,760
if you're on a platform where twitch

3094
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:39,760
shows the things below the video

3095
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:39,760
whatever you want to call those um

3096
02:19:40,398 --> 02:19:42,959
but i will

3097
02:19:43,599 --> 02:19:47,599
pack those in there

3098
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,159
yeah meows backwards i have to flip the

3099
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:52,960
camera so remember uh people didn't like

3100
02:19:50,159 --> 02:19:55,439
that i faced away from the

3101
02:19:52,959 --> 02:19:57,919
from the programming

3102
02:19:55,439 --> 02:20:00,559
so the camera's flipped when it's tiny

3103
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:02,559
if i if i switch to big

3104
02:20:00,559 --> 02:20:05,199
uh if i switch to big

3105
02:20:02,559 --> 02:20:06,318
then it's then it's right

3106
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:08,159
you know what i mean

3107
02:20:06,318 --> 02:20:11,279
but in tiny and tiny i have to be

3108
02:20:08,159 --> 02:20:13,520
flipped so that i point

3109
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:13,520
right

3110
02:20:14,639 --> 02:20:19,680
so

3111
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,680
um

3112
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:23,359
so anyway

3113
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:25,520
check that out if you get a chance

3114
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:26,399
um it's pretty cool

3115
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:30,479
and

3116
02:20:26,398 --> 02:20:33,279
uh i will be back here next week

3117
02:20:30,478 --> 02:20:36,000
for looking at if this bug still exists

3118
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:38,079
or not we may have just fixed it but

3119
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,840
i would like to go also see maybe like

3120
02:20:38,079 --> 02:20:41,439
look at what those entities were like

3121
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:43,359
why we have entities with zero collision

3122
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:44,960
volumes uh are they actually supposed to

3123
02:20:43,359 --> 02:20:46,239
be there they probably are they're

3124
02:20:44,959 --> 02:20:48,079
probably just like

3125
02:20:46,239 --> 02:20:50,398
um placeholder entities for things that

3126
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:52,559
are like not they're like logic things

3127
02:20:50,398 --> 02:20:53,599
or whatever so they might be valid but i

3128
02:20:52,559 --> 02:20:54,959
don't want to assume they're valid

3129
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:56,239
without actually looking at them and

3130
02:20:54,959 --> 02:20:57,438
seeing why we're creating them in the

3131
02:20:56,239 --> 02:20:59,520
first make sure they're not just like

3132
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:00,559
garbage that gets generated by the world

3133
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:03,359
generator

3134
02:21:00,559 --> 02:21:03,359
incorrectly right

3135
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:07,439
um so i would like to take a look at

3136
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:09,439
that and have a better understanding of

3137
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:11,680
why we had those entities there in the

3138
02:21:09,439 --> 02:21:12,960
first place so we'll do that

3139
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:15,520
but

3140
02:21:12,959 --> 02:21:17,279
uh i think that's about it

3141
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:18,640
uh thank you for joining me please check

3142
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:21,600
out our kickstarter if you get a chance

3143
02:21:18,639 --> 02:21:22,398
and i'll be back here next week

3144
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:24,000
to

3145
02:21:22,398 --> 02:21:26,478
take a look at

3146
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:28,079
the that stuff and and maybe start to do

3147
02:21:26,478 --> 02:21:29,760
just like a spatial partition for our

3148
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:31,680
collision detector because

3149
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:33,439
um it's still really slow because it

3150
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:34,479
checks all the entities in the world for

3151
02:21:33,439 --> 02:21:36,159
every one of those collisions it's

3152
02:21:34,478 --> 02:21:38,398
amazing that it runs as fast as it does

3153
02:21:36,159 --> 02:21:40,159
it's so weird how fast computers are but

3154
02:21:38,398 --> 02:21:41,840
we need to fix that because it should be

3155
02:21:40,159 --> 02:21:43,840
basically instant but right now it's

3156
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:46,159
very slow

3157
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:48,559
so we'll do that next week

3158
02:21:46,159 --> 02:21:51,520
and i hope to see you back here for that

3159
02:21:48,559 --> 02:21:53,519
until then uh i do have more stuff i

3160
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:54,880
guess coming out this week

3161
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:56,399
so there'll be some live streams this

3162
02:21:54,879 --> 02:21:58,159
week

3163
02:21:56,398 --> 02:21:59,760
there's a cryptocurrency interview

3164
02:21:58,159 --> 02:22:02,478
happening if you've been following that

3165
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:04,478
series of cryptocurrency interviews

3166
02:22:02,478 --> 02:22:06,239
um that'll be happening i have a very

3167
02:22:04,478 --> 02:22:09,358
special thing

3168
02:22:06,239 --> 02:22:10,639
happening this thursday that uh i think

3169
02:22:09,359 --> 02:22:12,559
will be very interesting i don't know

3170
02:22:10,639 --> 02:22:15,279
how it'll go but

3171
02:22:12,559 --> 02:22:17,840
uh me and jonas curatzis from that the

3172
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:19,439
person who was the wrote the talus

3173
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:21,439
principle and if you ever played that

3174
02:22:19,439 --> 02:22:23,680
game he's a writer

3175
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:25,200
uh that game companies like hire to

3176
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:27,040
write

3177
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:29,680
the stories for their games and and that

3178
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:32,319
sort of stuff right

3179
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:35,200
he and i are doing a babylon 5 season 1

3180
02:22:32,318 --> 02:22:38,239
recap because he's like a huge babylon 5

3181
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:40,319
fan and i'd never seen it before and i

3182
02:22:38,239 --> 02:22:43,760
just started watching it

3183
02:22:40,318 --> 02:22:45,039
um and so every time i finish a season

3184
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:47,120
we're just going to do like a live

3185
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:49,280
stream

3186
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:50,479
where we talk about

3187
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:52,479
uh

3188
02:22:50,478 --> 02:22:54,398
the season

3189
02:22:52,478 --> 02:22:55,199
right

3190
02:22:54,398 --> 02:22:57,199
um

3191
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:59,439
so so this thursday there'll be a live

3192
02:22:57,200 --> 02:23:02,000
stream too with me and jonas carazzis

3193
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:03,680
