1
00:00:04,068 --> 00:00:09,990
okay we are back with a Q&amp;A from day

2
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:13,199
three of the test stream which is

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,509
learned to code C on Windows and I'm

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,649
gonna go to the chat window now and I'm

5
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,880
going to take about 20 minutes of

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:22,108
questions so let's see what we've got

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:23,460
somebody says they teach nothing of this

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,760
in many colleges how do you feel about

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:31,199
the new programming workforce well you

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,090
know I am I am a grunty kind of lusty

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,160
person and so you will often hear me say

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,050
disparaging things about the workforce

13
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,750
or web programmers I will criticize them

14
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:41,849
in this sort of thing really that's that

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,738
is unfair of me and I know that it's

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,450
true when I say those things because

17
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,429
there's nothing wrong with the modern

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,500
workforce that's just totally the wrong

19
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,329
way to say things and I think there are

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,600
probably just as many smart people now

21
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,149
as there were when I learned to program

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,520
and I know there are many people who are

23
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,439
great programmers nowadays as well and

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,969
so I don't have any problem with the

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,618
modern workforce mostly what I have a

26
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,570
problem with actually is modern

27
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,310
conventions because a lot of these

28
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:09,989
people like you were saying they go to

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,240
college and they are very smart people

30
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,399
and they learn what they are exposed to

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,949
I would know nothing of any of these

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,380
things that I am teaching you if I did

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,150
not know people who knew them I was

34
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,978
fortunate to know experts who knew these

35
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,630
things and that is the only reason I

36
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,009
know any of these things I would never

37
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:27,750
know any of them if it weren't for those

38
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,099
experiences and so the thing that I

39
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,328
think is the real problem and one of the

40
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:31,438
reasons that I'm doing this dream is

41
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:33,478
because we just need to put this

42
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:37,019
information out there smart people who

43
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,819
know who understand like the importance

44
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,408
of performance oriented code and and

45
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,959
writing code that works well and is

46
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,549
reliable and those sorts of things they

47
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,809
are going to understand all of the

48
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,100
importance of these things of knowing

49
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,540
how the computer works and understand

50
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,739
the security implications of memory and

51
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,700
understanding before its implications of

52
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:52,048
memory and all those sorts of things

53
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,070
they're gonna understand all those

54
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,960
things there's programs out there that

55
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:55,949
are way smarter than I am I'm sure but

56
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,289
if they've never had the experience

57
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,149
they're gonna be very very hamstrung

58
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,380
there it's gonna be very limiting what

59
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,750
they can do and they're gonna be limited

60
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,069
to programming in Java abstractions that

61
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,359
never let them achieve the full

62
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:07,739
potential that they could be achieving

63
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,449
their programs will always be slower

64
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,859
their programs will always not be able

65
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,949
to do these things and that's

66
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,420
unfortunate and I that does upset me too

67
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:16,769
some degree because I want everyone to

68
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,179
be able to be as good at programmers

69
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,650
they can be and when they do use

70
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,909
abstractions I want them to be it there

71
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,319
I want to be their choice

72
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,189
what abstractions they use I want you to

73
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,049
be able to choose them because I choose

74
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,068
abstractions all the time and the reason

75
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,510
that I still program and see is cuz it

76
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:29,310
lets me choose the abstractions it

77
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:30,840
doesn't force them upon me and so I

78
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,129
think a lot of the problem these days is

79
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,060
that a lot of the languages the modern

80
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:34,500
languages and a lot of the modern

81
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,269
methodologies are just wrong they're

82
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,769
just bad methodologies and it's

83
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:39,750
unfortunate because a lot of these

84
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:42,150
languages add features I would want you

85
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,860
know I want a lot of these things even

86
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,390
garbage collection which I often rail

87
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,400
against I really hate garbage collection

88
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,169
I don't mind the option to have garbage

89
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,430
section I love to occasionally turn on

90
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,449
garbage collection maybe if I'm doing

91
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,860
something where it might have been

92
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,089
appropriate and it will save me some

93
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,709
time if I'm testing something whatever

94
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,729
and I just want to use it there's

95
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,219
nothing wrong with those things those

96
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:01,219
things are great if you know how they

97
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,299
work you understand what they do and

98
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:04,739
you're you're using them in a

99
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,329
circumstance where you know that the

100
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,129
pitfalls of those things will never harm

101
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:09,540
you they're great and so do I want to

102
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,979
see languages advance to the point we

103
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,959
can do all those things yes I just don't

104
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,039
want them to leave the old things behind

105
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
because the old things are very

106
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,159
important and being able to know what

107
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,049
the CPU does and control it is very

108
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,489
important so yeah I'm really excited

109
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,959
about John's new language too like I

110
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:23,430
said because he's starting to think

111
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,489
about adding some cool things to the

112
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,700
language but still retain all that C and

113
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,139
C++ stuff where you can actually write

114
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,638
you know with pointers and do things

115
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:37,920
like that but you want to do all right

116
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:41,489
let's see what else we got here Wow lots

117
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,750
of Paul success left fleet density I

118
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,310
couldn't agree more I don't even have a

119
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,019
ps4 though yet so how am I gonna stream

120
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,739
density I don't know I'll have to buy a

121
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,060
ps4 a pendo x2 the instruction pointer

122
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,780
memory address to get it in visual

123
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,310
studio Oh seriously is that all I had to

124
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,799
do was that this is me not knowing how

125
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,280
to use the memory window please tell me

126
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,409
that's true

127
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,509
please tell me that's true let's find

128
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,930
out if that's true Carl and oh bloom you

129
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:08,519
may have saved the day if that's true so

130
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,760
what am I doing here

131
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,819
let's see doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

132
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,319
doo one of the things that's a problem

133
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,879
is when you're doing these streams your

134
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,620
mind is concentrating on the explanation

135
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,060
and not what's going on on in the thing

136
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,509
so it makes it a little harder for you

137
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,220
to to think of stuff that that may have

138
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:27,449
gone wrong and so I really appreciate it

139
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,770
when people

140
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,479
tell me what's going on here let's see

141
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:36,120
it's that that really problem oh yes

142
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,000
dude thank you so much all right that is

143
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,459
great that is fantastic so it turns out

144
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,779
you can see your code that is awesome

145
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,149
that's such good news so it did not

146
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,599
prevent me from executing it that's

147
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:47,159
great

148
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,810
ok good good good I'll have to put a

149
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,970
little correction on there and just I

150
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,740
forgot the zero X so I guess yeah Visual

151
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,930
Studio just didn't know that that was

152
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,210
hexadecimal I guess it thought you know

153
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,180
when I did that oh you know what it

154
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:02,699
could be - is it because is it because I

155
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,470
changed the mode would it have normally

156
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,430
known no it's not so I don't know so I

157
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,020
guess you just always have to put the

158
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,100
zero X so it knows its hexadecimal for

159
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,359
some reason I thought you could just do

160
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:15,330
that yeah oh well that's great thank you

161
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,530
girl and Oh bloom thank you very much ok

162
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:18,479
that's great

163
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:19,829
do any schools get this right how much

164
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,430
will you have well I have to learn what

165
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:25,620
to do is cos I don't know chronodragon I

166
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,389
do not know if school got this right I

167
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,590
didn't go to college I've never been to

168
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,399
college I've set foot on a college

169
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:35,759
campus when I went to visit the

170
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:38,099
University of Washington once and and

171
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,089
and I guess I've been to I went to

172
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,710
Princeton once but yeah and I went to

173
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:45,209
MIT once so I've been to some college

174
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:46,799
campuses but I never went to school so I

175
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:49,649
don't know I don't know how bad CSA is

176
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,579
I'm sorry again try and do the stream

177
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,859
try to get this information out there

178
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,389
that's that's the best I can do and if

179
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,720
you're having a bad time with your CS

180
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,729
class in college I'm sorry yeah I don't

181
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,050
say it's nice outside my areas protists

182
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:05,340
what happens in college is I really

183
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:07,079
don't know let's see what languages do I

184
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,869
use for metaprogramming see I write C

185
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:13,050
programs that output C programs not a

186
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,759
question but has flowing tools tools

187
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,319
options text editor general heart count

188
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,329
line okay okay okay

189
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,399
thank you post good ism for telling me

190
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:22,229
that I'm gonna copy that off just into a

191
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,729
quick note here I don't want to address

192
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,830
that I don't want to do that right now

193
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,180
since we're have limited time before I

194
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:29,490
run that time for the Q&amp;A so I'm just

195
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,900
gonna paste that in on my laptop and I

196
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,400
will take care of that before next time

197
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,919
thank you very much

198
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,989
okay warning track says how big will the

199
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,629
adjustment be for a web programmer like

200
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,009
me programming web scripts involves very

201
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,959
little memory management compared to the

202
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,310
warning track it'll be a big adjustment

203
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,899
for you there's no lie about that

204
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,360
thinking about memory is a big change

205
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,729
but that's what the whole series is kind

206
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,800
of about is learning to to work that way

207
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,360
and so I don't think you'll have any

208
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,310
trouble following it because you'll

209
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,870
always be watching me do it so you don't

210
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,100
have to know how to do it first you'll

211
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,750
always see how I do it

212
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,580
so you'll be able to kind of learn just

213
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,209
by watching oh here's all the stuff he

214
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:08,639
does with memory and why and I think I

215
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:11,279
hope I hope people will be very

216
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,139
pleasantly surprised at just how little

217
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,000
work it actually is to manage your own

218
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,519
memory I think people think it's this

219
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,379
huge ordeal and that we're gonna spend

220
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:21,779
90% of the time doing this memory we're

221
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:23,399
gonna spend 5% of the times with memory

222
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,750
I'm gonna talk about it all the time in

223
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,299
reference to why we did certain things

224
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,459
certain ways but it's gonna be so simple

225
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,350
you'll be shocked at how simple it is to

226
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,549
do your own memory management all of the

227
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,750
people who say garbage selection in this

228
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,750
garbage collection that oh my god

229
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,040
managed memory for me reference counting

230
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,839
all of those things are actually very

231
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,040
easy to implement yourself when you need

232
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,679
them in the limited cases where you do

233
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,410
most of the time you don't it will be a

234
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,180
big surprise I think you will be very

235
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,130
pleasantly surprised at just how easy it

236
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,139
is it's not going to be this huge

237
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,850
problem now the thing that will take

238
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,560
more getting used to is the pointer

239
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,700
manipulation because I'm going to do a

240
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,410
bunch of stuff where I manipulate

241
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,550
pointers to do the rasterizer to do

242
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,810
rendering and that's where stuff and

243
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,610
that may take you a little while to get

244
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,990
used to but at the end of the day if

245
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,490
you're a web programmer you've probably

246
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,530
dealt with an array before something

247
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,840
that's indexed you know locations

248
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,219
indexed by a value that's sort of what

249
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,810
memory is right it's just locations

250
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,310
indexed by a value so if you understand

251
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,629
how to use an array you're not gonna

252
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,769
have that hard time following what I do

253
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,990
with memory it's really not gonna be

254
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:20,490
that hard so I think you'll do I think

255
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,079
people who've only ever done script

256
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,310
stuff will actually be pleasantly

257
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,169
surprised at how little stuff they

258
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,250
actually have to do that's my hope

259
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:30,660
anyway we'll see if turns out to be true

260
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,220
let's see how useful is it to study

261
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,930
cache oblivious data structures as

262
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,740
inspiration for domains of glia such as

263
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:40,139
then end bows trees I have absolutely no

264
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,259
idea to be on honest with you I have no

265
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:45,559
idea I don't even know what that means I

266
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,149
don't know what a van and Boas tree is

267
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,619
sorry if you want to send me an email I

268
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:52,110
can find coverton if you can't restrain

269
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,250
my guests but I would basically say if

270
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,870
you're if you're working with data

271
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,919
structures that are supposed to be

272
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,940
it's critical like you're really

273
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,889
concerned about what their performance

274
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,420
is gonna be then the phrase

275
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:02,189
cache-oblivious is terrifying

276
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:05,009
performance is all about cash management

277
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,030
nowadays all about cash management I

278
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:09,299
mean the difference between like a

279
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:11,339
memory system if you miss a cache badly

280
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,750
and you fail out to main memory you

281
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,420
could be talking about something like

282
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,590
two hundred four hundred instructions or

283
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,329
something depending on the pairing and

284
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,980
what you're implementing and we're

285
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,350
talking about instructions that that

286
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,210
might do sixteen multiplies in one

287
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,430
instruction or something the amount of

288
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,350
work the CPU could do in the amount of

289
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:30,959
time it takes you to fail out to main

290
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:34,019
memory is staggering nowadays it is

291
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,450
staggering so the concept that you would

292
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,069
have a cache oblivious data structure if

293
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,850
what you mean by that and they gonna

294
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,960
said I don't know what you were

295
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,190
referenced so maybe this is not what

296
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,050
cache oblivious means this kha'zix but

297
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,760
let me just say the kind of that you

298
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,289
wouldn't be aware of the cache

299
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,289
performance we're not care about the

300
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:50,909
cache performance of something is

301
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:52,679
terrifying now if you're doing if you're

302
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:54,569
structuring your stuff for something for

303
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,099
some other reason and you don't it's not

304
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,700
super performance critical then it may

305
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,649
be fine

306
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,420
it's certainly good idea to study data

307
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,740
structures in an abstract sense to

308
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,599
understand how they work and what their

309
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,610
trade-offs are in other senses like

310
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,320
order notation and things like that so

311
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,550
it's still very important but when it

312
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,900
comes down when you're actually talking

313
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:11,639
about something that it's in performance

314
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,319
critical part of your code you always

315
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,689
need to be aware of the cache stuff and

316
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,700
honestly if there's one thing that I

317
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,290
would say if like people ask me Casey as

318
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,650
a programmer what is the thing that if

319
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:24,480
you could improve your own sort of

320
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,819
skills at what would it be it would be

321
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,990
that like I am still not a great

322
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,879
programmer when it comes to cash

323
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,220
management and stuff like that because I

324
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,779
often do a lot of code that is not quite

325
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,090
as performance critical as it should

326
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,360
it's not quite as perfect as it should

327
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,139
be

328
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,879
I only go a certain level I'm not like

329
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,159
you know Jeff and Fabian the two guys

330
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,500
who do - now for example at rat

331
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,850
game tools they are like super good at

332
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,070
cranking it all the way down you know

333
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,080
like their code is is way further along

334
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,320
in terms of like cash management stuff

335
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,090
than anything I'm gonna write and so you

336
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,980
know I would i would probably say if i

337
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,930
could magically without changing the way

338
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,659
i code or something magically get that

339
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:05,729
knowledge boost and and have like just a

340
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,259
great feel for for the cache coherency

341
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,580
of things that that would be the thing

342
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:09,289
I'd probably add so it's always really

343
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,420
important

344
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:14,459
how do you meet experts I have no idea I

345
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:16,409
was extremely fortunate in that I just

346
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,900
happened to meet them I was interning at

347
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:21,360
Microsoft actually and I met Chris

348
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,750
hacker who some of you may know he is

349
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,879
the guy who does spy party which is a is

350
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,350
a very popular indie game right now you

351
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,480
can check it out at spy party comm I

352
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:37,350
think do I have that right let's let's

353
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:39,210
take a look at that spy party spy party

354
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,790
calm okay

355
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,230
I don't know why - so right now so this

356
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:45,449
game right here is made by a guy named

357
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,399
Chris hacker and I met him when I was

358
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,930
entering at Microsoft he actually at the

359
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,459
time he doesn't do that much low-level

360
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:52,649
programming nowadays cuz he's working on

361
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,000
it on a game and that game is more about

362
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,529
game design and stuff like that he's

363
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
working on a lot of other things and the

364
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,699
rendering and that sort of stuff he's

365
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,289
working on other things so he's not

366
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,580
working on operating system code but he

367
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:04,110
actually used to work on code that was

368
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,620
actually operating system stuff in

369
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,539
Windows at Microsoft and I met him and

370
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,179
he happened to be working on this is

371
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,709
even before Windows 95 shipped he was

372
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,329
working on a thing called win G which

373
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,280
was like the first way that games were

374
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,350
ever really able to run on Windows it

375
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,240
was to allow like fast bleeding and

376
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,700
stuff like that so he knew a bunch of

377
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,379
game development people and he was a

378
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,690
good low-level programmer and stuff like

379
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,889
that so I actually met him and I met a

380
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,780
bunch of people through him and if it

381
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:32,970
wasn't for that I probably wouldn't have

382
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:34,470
known a lot of these experts and you

383
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,230
know I'm very fortunate that I happened

384
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:40,230
to run into somebody who knew that sort

385
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:43,279
of stuff at that time and I'm very

386
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,420
grateful to Chris for for that sort of

387
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,879
introducing me to that network it's it

388
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,149
really made a huge difference in in my

389
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,620
life

390
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:54,120
programming there's no question about

391
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:57,240
that so yeah and and he chris has done a

392
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,190
lot of really cool things too in in his

393
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,620
career like he was one of the guy who

394
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,090
did the the incredible creature system

395
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,500
for spore the thing that lets you build

396
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,500
the creatures and all that stuff and

397
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,990
animate them even though it didn't know

398
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,129
like what the morphology the creature

399
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,570
was could build it yourself but it's

400
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:16,590
still allowed to animate them that was

401
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:18,510
all him so he's just done like some some

402
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,129
pretty cool stuff and and he's doing spy

403
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,679
party now so yeah you should you should

404
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:23,100
go check that out and if if you're in

405
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,079
the mood

406
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,820
you could even support him I know

407
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,530
there's a PayPal thing on his thing to

408
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,720
where you can you can buy the game and

409
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:32,909
it's it's you know it's still you know

410
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,129
in alpha or whatever but you can throw

411
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:36,929
him some cash

412
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:38,429
let's see in light of memory performance

413
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:41,129
do you use linked data structures ever

414
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:44,189
nowadays so yes I still do use linked

415
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:47,759
data structures and you know like I said

416
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:50,400
I am NOT the most cash optimal guy I get

417
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,529
things fast enough to be good and to do

418
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,029
what I need them to do and when I need

419
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:55,679
to optimize something maybe I will go in

420
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,620
there and do stuff that needs to happen

421
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,929
to reduce how you know to basically

422
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,370
reduce the cost but no I will still use

423
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:03,419
LinkedIn structures all the time because

424
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,649
sometimes they're more efficient for

425
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,240
other reasons or sometimes they're just

426
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,199
more more easy to use conceptually and I

427
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,730
know that the performance is not

428
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,350
important at that particular point in

429
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,029
time and I'd rather have its flexibility

430
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,800
in terms of growing things and that sort

431
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:18,870
of stuff um let's see I'm a big fan of

432
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,399
linear algebra will we see some uses of

433
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:25,590
it and will you show us how to use it in

434
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:27,360
graphics so lord lord eldon 1992 oh

435
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,009
sorry if i'm not pressing that right I'm

436
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
glad you're a big fan of linear algebra

437
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:32,639
I am also a big fan of linear algebra

438
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,950
it's one of the few branches of math

439
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,240
that I actually know a little bit about

440
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:43,080
like I said I'm not great at math linear

441
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,399
algebra is not that necessary for a lot

442
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,070
of the stuff we're gonna be doing in 2d

443
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,299
now I mean obviously everything is

444
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,920
linear algebra at some level because if

445
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:53,279
you solve more than two equations at

446
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,049
once which you always do you're gonna be

447
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,000
using linear algebra at the base level

448
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:59,759
anyway so it's a little misnomer to say

449
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,250
that it's not that much it is but the

450
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,980
real hardcore linear algebra stuff tends

451
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,870
to kick in in 3d most of the time so it

452
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,940
won't be that linear algebra intensive

453
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,820
in the mainstream I don't think now I

454
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,080
could surprise myself and paint us into

455
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,970
a corner where we really want some

456
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,310
linear algebra action going on and if

457
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,019
that's true then we'll bust it out but

458
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:21,089
for the most part I'm expecting that we

459
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:24,509
will be mostly like if you've got high

460
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:26,070
school trig under your belt you will be

461
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:29,220
able to understand most of the stuff we

462
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:32,510
do because you know vector and matrix

463
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,550
stuff at the basic level

464
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:35,990
that you need for 2d can really just be

465
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:37,759
thought of as trig most of the time and

466
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,009
the extent to what you need linear

467
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,139
algebra stuff is you know it's it's it's

468
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:43,549
linear algebra but it's it's unfair to

469
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,169
really even use that term because it is

470
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:48,109
not the kind of stuff you know it ain't

471
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:50,449
gonna be doing you know oh like yeah I

472
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,340
did the singular value decomposition of

473
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,680
this thing right like to me linear

474
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,230
algebra gets into more serious stuff and

475
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,819
and we will not be doing that stuff we

476
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,710
will not be taking the Jacobian of the

477
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,510
matrix we will not be doing any of the

478
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:07,040
things that I would classify as linear

479
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:08,539
algebra in the proper sense will we be

480
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,279
grading your own starts to replace STL

481
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:11,389
well we won't be replacing STL but we

482
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,850
will be using all our own data

483
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:15,169
structures Paul six will there be

484
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,600
network program as part of the game

485
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:19,909
probably not if we did do network

486
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,440
programming it would be as a as after

487
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:23,509
the game is already done basically it'd

488
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,430
be like oh now we're gonna add network

489
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,679
support to handmade here oh but I don't

490
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:30,289
want to address that early on primarily

491
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,939
just because I don't know how long it

492
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,709
will take me to program things when I

493
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,270
have to explain them all the time it's

494
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,769
hard for programmers to even ballpark

495
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,629
how long it takes them to finish things

496
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:40,490
when they don't have to explain them so

497
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:42,710
I don't want to add more complexity I

498
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,210
want to do a really great 2-d game and

499
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,620
show you everything you need to do that

500
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:49,040
but I don't want to start adding things

501
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:51,200
like networking and 3d support for

502
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,819
example I didn't want to add those until

503
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,410
if if anything if we were going to dress

504
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,629
them to address them after the game was

505
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:58,309
already done so that I could focus on

506
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,639
all the things you need to build a great

507
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,959
game at minimum and then as we want to

508
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,949
add things that aren't required for a

509
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,539
great game because we've all played

510
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,519
great 2d games and we've all played

511
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:09,379
great games that weren't networked so we

512
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,389
know that it's not necessary to have

513
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,640
those things to build a great game and

514
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,810
so I wanted to since the goal was to

515
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,070
teach you low-level programming and

516
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,059
teach you all these other things I want

517
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,439
to make sure you can spend a lot of time

518
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:19,819
on that and not have to spend time

519
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,500
teaching about like the network model

520
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,879
and all those sorts of things in UDP and

521
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,799
all that sort of stuff but you know

522
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,660
we'll see how this is the the series

523
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,069
goes if people are hungry for more after

524
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,540
it's all done and it's could be a long

525
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:30,740
time people so we'll see if people are

526
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:33,440
still watching the videos by the end

527
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,490
right you know I'm not averse to adding

528
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,150
those sorts of things that that's what

529
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,470
people would be interested in how do I

530
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,200
feel about a language like rust I know

531
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,000
nothing about rust never seen it do you

532
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,289
plan on reviving the Mali rocket forum

533
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,460
to something similar for this project I

534
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:47,899
would love to I don't know if

535
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,120
have time but that is a big thing on my

536
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,650
list of things to do so you believe me

537
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,299
it is something that I would like to do

538
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,340
I loved the Mali rocket forums and I

539
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:56,779
wish PHP BB had been better because

540
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:57,980
they'd still probably running today if

541
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,599
it weren't for all the spam and problems

542
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,529
that I was having with it what do you

543
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,709
think about learning to program in C

544
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:06,740
with a CL I operating system with things

545
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,880
like GCC and compiling manually Visual

546
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,559
Studio authorities are nice but I've

547
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,550
heard option opinions that programmers

548
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,990
should at least have basic experience

549
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,940
command-line we will be doing all the

550
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,440
compiling from the command line I am

551
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,970
only using the IDE right now because I

552
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,620
wanted to show people in introduction to

553
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,269
C on Windows and I didn't want them to

554
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:22,129
have to deal with the command line and

555
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:22,879
the separate editor yet but that is

556
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,500
probably something we'll get to this

557
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,990
weekend and the entire stream starting

558
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,700
Monday there will be no code editing in

559
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,769
Visual Studio and no compiling from

560
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,350
Visual Studio Visual Studio will only be

561
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:37,490
the debugger people so hold on to your

562
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:38,869
hats cache oblivious algorithms are for

563
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,789
taking advantage of cache close to

564
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:43,399
optimally without knowing cache sizes

565
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:44,420
okay so like yeah like I was saying

566
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,740
before I don't know cat what

567
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,900
cache-oblivious means I've never seen

568
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,519
that term before so if that's actually

569
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,400
true that they're about that then I

570
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,660
would say that's good because you can't

571
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,950
always know the size of the cache

572
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,110
obviously because it changes each

573
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,519
individual processor changes so if cache

574
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:59,750
oblivious just means don't know the size

575
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:01,670
but you're aware of the cache and you're

576
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,059
trying to optimize the use of it then

577
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,400
that's great

578
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:06,500
yes by all means you should study that

579
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,210
it's only it's the only thing I was

580
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,309
trying to say not to do is to be unaware

581
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:13,309
of the cache now I don't know very much

582
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:14,329
about the latest research in cache cache

583
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:16,129
data structures or anything like that

584
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:17,210
and I don't pretend to and one of the

585
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,800
things you'll hear me say a lot on this

586
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,569
stream is that like you know I program

587
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,639
the way I program I know how to do what

588
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:24,679
I do effectively but I never am an

589
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,940
expert in any one specific thing usually

590
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,529
there are a couple things that maybe I'm

591
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,180
an expert in but for the most part like

592
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:31,309
most of the things I just know it as

593
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,740
much as was necessary to do a good job

594
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:35,659
on stuff and so I don't pretend to know

595
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,160
what the best way to do thing is so our

596
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,600
cache oblivious data structure is good I

597
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,400
have no idea don't even know if they are

598
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:43,849
never looked at them it sounds like a

599
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,290
good thing to try and for things like a

600
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,299
PC where you can't guarantee the cache

601
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,740
size like you can on a console it may be

602
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:50,419
a very important way to program in the

603
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,620
future because if you think about it you

604
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,269
never know what that capsule is going to

605
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:54,619
be someone might run in something on a

606
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:56,720
machine where the cache is much smaller

607
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:58,759
than on some other machine and so if you

608
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,019
can find effective ways to make things

609
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:01,579
work well without knowing those

610
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:03,710
things that does sound like a pretty

611
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:09,500
good idea so yeah I would say they're

612
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:11,420
probably probably good a reddit thread

613
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,930
related to my question what is the

614
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,220
question sorry I don't know what this is

615
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:19,850
is this personal for chicken only board

616
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:23,839
the bitter truth okay so I don't have

617
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:25,309
time to read this reddit thing sorry

618
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,079
maybe we can look at that later send me

619
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,389
an email are you uploading these streams

620
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:33,309
to YouTube yes if you go to handmade

621
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:36,740
hero there's actually so if you go to

622
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:38,419
handmade hero org there is a archive

623
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,250
button and if you look on the archive

624
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,590
button all the streams are there usually

625
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,240
the day after they air it takes a while

626
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:45,679
for YouTube to like process the videos

627
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,420
and stuff but they're usually up within

628
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,440
a day so you can follow along the day

629
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,550
after pretty easily

630
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,720
so yeah if you just go to handmade hero

631
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:58,879
that's that's all you need handmade here

632
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:02,720
org let's see doo-doo-doo-doo

633
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,860
doo-doo-doo-doo what's the general plan

634
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,299
for growing graphics through the stream

635
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:06,799
we will be drawing the graphics the

636
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,629
screen using the pointers that I just

637
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,009
demoed this evening in fact we are going

638
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,510
to be writing to it by just get in the

639
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:13,519
pointer to memory and and we are going

640
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:15,619
to do that so that's that's how that

641
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:21,139
goes

642
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:22,369
we are going to do let's see we

643
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,950
explaining game designs while developing

644
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:26,869
in the livestream no not really

645
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,130
I will be sort of saying what we're

646
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,719
doing in the game design and why but I

647
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,780
won't be trying to do game design

648
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,279
alright it is almost 7:30 by the clock

649
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:37,099
in fact I think it just ticked over to

650
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:38,720
7:30 so I will be in fact we're down to

651
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:42,139
three only three questions so that's

652
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,370
excellent I think it'd be a good idea to

653
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:46,640
choose a friendly URL for the YouTube

654
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:49,399
channel before the launch okay I will

655
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,670
take a look at that mostly well actually

656
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,600
properties API design yes alright so I

657
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:57,800
think that is the end of the QA if you

658
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:00,589
have questions that were not answered

659
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:03,409
and you don't want to wait to answer

660
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:05,629
them in tomorrow night's Q&amp;A there is

661
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:09,040
also at handmade hero comm I've started

662
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:11,660
him a hero org handmade here

663
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,519
org there's also this email a question

664
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,910
button you can click on that to email

665
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,920
some

666
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:18,200
in so that it will be in the queue and

667
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,870
maybe we can sort of start using that as

668
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,950
a good way to queue up questions for for

669
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:26,269
q and A's thank you everyone for joining

670
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,710
another live stream it has been a

671
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:32,180
pleasure it was great to see you all

672
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:34,759
again and we will probably do streams on

673
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,140
tomorrow Saturday and Sunday normally we

674
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:39,200
will only be doing weeknights on the

675
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,759
main stream but for this because I'm

676
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,170
sort of trying to get the streaming

677
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,390
kinks worked out and make everything

678
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,100
work pretty well I will be practicing

679
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,170
all weekend as well so there should be

680
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:51,289
two more streams one on Saturday one on

681
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,330
Sunday watched the Twitter feed at

682
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:55,369
hand-made underscore hero com

683
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:57,710
I start at handmade underscore hero on

684
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:59,029
Twitter if you want to know when those

685
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,920
are going to be so thanks everyone for

686
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:02,920
joining and I will see you tomorrow
