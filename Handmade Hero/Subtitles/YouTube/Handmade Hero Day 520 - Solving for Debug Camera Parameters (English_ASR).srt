00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:05,160
hello everybody and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:11,730
Hero show Rico to complete game live on

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:14,400
stream we so as we often do in here made

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,109
here quite intentionally often to the

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,699
chagrin of some people who just want

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,279
like the simplest possible game made as

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,350
fast as possible which is another thing

8
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,448
you can definitely do and I don't

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,250
begrudge people doing it

10
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,810
we like to solve technical problems here

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,039
or show how to attempt to solve them

12
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:32,098
anyway we don't always get a great

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,439
solution sometimes we do we're out

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,669
another one of those points where we've

15
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,289
done a lot of work actually Hammond here

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,879
and done a lot of things I think in kind

17
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,128
of some interesting ways in terms of

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,170
harmonizing 2d and 3d you know I don't

19
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:47,849
see a lot of people really trying to

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:51,448
make perspective rendering work with you

21
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,620
know 2d inserts in some of the ways that

22
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:53,969
we're trying to make it work where you

23
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,009
can do things like go downstairs and

24
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,359
have some kind of perspective bending

25
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:59,429
and you know we're trying to do some

26
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,320
interesting stuff there and you know

27
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:03,390
it's a tough thing to get right because

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,540
of the way that the art interacts with

29
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,969
the world and one of the things that we

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,470
haven't finished I think pretty much

31
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,039
everything is working pretty well

32
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:16,170
actually when we look at it that has to

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,609
do with that one of the things that we

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,969
haven't quite finished is figuring out

35
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,469
how to alter the z-buffer

36
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:25,140
in a way that allows us to insert

37
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:29,188
sprites that really we don't know the 3d

38
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,799
shape of in a way that makes them look

39
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:33,449
plausible right so that they don't so

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,189
that they do get occluded by things that

41
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,719
they should get occluded by but they

42
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:40,078
don't get occluded by other things that

43
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,908
they shouldn't get occluded by and we're

44
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,179
trying to make that happen

45
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:49,409
in what we would consider a relatively

46
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,310
rigorous way meaning there's some ways

47
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,350
you can do it which you're just about

48
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,240
let's hack it we'll just cheese is tons

49
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,679
of values and have lots of like cleanup

50
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,059
in there where we just tweak things

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,079
until it sort of looks right most the

52
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,799
time and then there's some glitches

53
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,750
right we're trying to say look before we

54
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,149
go down that road because sometimes in

55
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,929
game development you have to go down

56
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:13,830
that road right but before we go down

57
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,840
that road what we want to do is say can

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,310
we figure out a real solution to this so

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,640
that we can just do it for once and for

60
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,819
all

61
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,069
right and I thought our fogging are like

62
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,479
alpha fog one for example was a pretty

63
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,549
good way you know when we when we kind

64
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,049
of have our our cool way of going

65
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,400
downstairs and stuff now I thought we've

66
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,930
been kind of doing a pretty good job of

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,450
getting some of these things like really

68
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:37,680
tight and good but this one isn't and so

69
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:39,119
that's the way our last thing before we

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,770
can sort of adjust our sprites so for

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:53,189
example let me hop this dude down here

72
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:55,590
and and let me just take a look here so

73
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:57,930
for example right we've got that feeling

74
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,450
like really good you know and it feels

75
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,980
really tight and and all of the like you

76
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:03,349
know fading in and out looks really good

77
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,579
and stuff right

78
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,689
even our lighting is coming along we

79
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,610
just we don't know how to get fast

80
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,810
enough yet right it looks good for where

81
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,250
we can afford to do it but we can't

82
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,370
afford to do it in a big enough region

83
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,750
to make it make it good right but again

84
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,310
all this stuff seems to be working

85
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,530
pretty good but this is our see that

86
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,300
right there right that's the last thing

87
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,800
we really got to know how to do right

88
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,230
we've really got to figure out a good

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,239
way to make sure that we don't get those

90
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:29,459
kind of interpenetration artifacts right

91
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,989
now we're not doing anything for the Z

92
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,039
bias you know we put Z bias in the

93
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,039
shader but we really don't know what to

94
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,799
do with it and so our goal is to solve

95
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,419
that last problem okay

96
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,160
lighting obviously is something we need

97
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,139
to do more work on but that's not that

98
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,329
has nothing to do with 2d 3d right

99
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,219
that's just lighting is hard and it's

100
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,660
always hard for everybody always if you

101
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:52,229
want you know depending on how good you

102
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,039
want to be you can make it arbitrarily

103
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,500
hard on yourself

104
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,859
but from my perspective right what I

105
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,530
want to do is finally you know knock off

106
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,610
the last thing on our 2d 3d list if for

107
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,900
no other reason and that's what's

108
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,190
keeping us from like going in and

109
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,140
finishing all our alignment points and

110
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,609
having all the rest of the art in right

111
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,069
because we don't want to bother with

112
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,410
that until we know that we're you know

113
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,329
we're solid there and again you can see

114
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:17,699
the camera just so solid right it just

115
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,100
works really great now all of the fading

116
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,680
does exactly what it should do you can

117
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,360
go up and down levels even stairs it

118
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,150
looks great and it's easy to understand

119
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,750
right and so I'm really really happy

120
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,969
with

121
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,500
the aesthetics aren't going and I think

122
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:37,650
they're there right where they need to

123
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:42,360
be in most cases but we just have this

124
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:44,370
unfortunate issue where we don't know

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,449
how to do that Z and so that's what we

126
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,040
were brainstorming yesterday we're like

127
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,659
look this is the last big thing and it's

128
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,330
gonna really prevent us from finishing

129
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,180
up the artist that's you know until we

130
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:57,169
do it how do we do it and what I

131
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,959
suggested at the end of the last stream

132
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:04,860
was what if we did something where we

133
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:07,469
actually just put the projection into

134
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,080
the shader and said that the that the

135
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,460
final coordinate X Y Z W the W

136
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:17,359
coordinate which was previously just in

137
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:21,180
addition to Z will actually just be a Z

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:27,689
the the height like the the Z coordinate

139
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:30,810
of the plane the XY plane on which to

140
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:39,990
project the point to get the z-buffer

141
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:44,009
value that you should use right that was

142
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:53,370
our idea now whether or not that idea is

143
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:56,579
good is kind of another question and you

144
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,110
know I would like to just quickly or not

145
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:00,779
quickly but I would like to take a

146
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,240
little more time on the blackboard to

147
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:06,599
talk about what I mean and what the

148
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,340
problem actually is right again just to

149
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:15,169
try and get to a place where we've got a

150
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:17,939
little bit more rigor to it so if I may

151
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:23,099
the specific problem that we have and

152
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:25,110
this is like for our Z occlusion the

153
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,600
specific problem that we have is that

154
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,810
the place that we would like our sprites

155
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,660
to be sorted is not where they are

156
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,598
actually drawn right and so if you think

157
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,820
about how a Z buffer works a Z buffer

158
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:41,129
works by drawing you know into a screen

159
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:45,449
region you know

160
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:47,279
a particular Z value and then when

161
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,870
something else comes in you know and

162
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,849
wants to draw on here like you know I'm

163
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,889
drawing another thing on here we check

164
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,660
to see if it's Z value is closer to the

165
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,979
camera than the one that we already drew

166
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,860
and if it is then we'll put there if

167
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,930
it's not we don't right so what we're

168
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,199
really doing is just saying hey for

169
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:09,090
every pixel we're gonna record how close

170
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:13,139
this thing was you know and that's what

171
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:16,079
we're gonna use but the problem with

172
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:20,009
that is that if we then want to draw

173
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:22,620
things that occupy regions of space that

174
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:26,189
are nowhere near the place they wanted

175
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:30,180
to be sorted right so for example I was

176
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:31,829
drawing this the other day Friday if we

177
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,360
have something like this where here's a

178
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:42,689
back facing wall right and here's the

179
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:45,480
floor right when we're drawing someone

180
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:48,120
here we want them to roughly sort within

181
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,970
this cube so that if there was a wall

182
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:55,740
here right we would want this to occlude

183
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:57,690
them but we don't want this to right so

184
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,530
this wall should not block something

185
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:04,319
drawn here but this wall should now that

186
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:07,139
would be fine if we were drawing it as a

187
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,719
sprite card that actually stood right

188
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,959
there right that would be very easy for

189
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,420
us to do and it would just work because

190
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,879
that's what the Z buffer is meant to

191
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:22,560
resolve it's meant to resolve anything

192
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:24,629
that involves drawing in actual 3d with

193
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,000
actual 3d objects in the actual

194
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:30,180
positions they are supposed to occupy it

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,940
does it pretty well however what we have

196
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,340
is a different scenario when we want to

197
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,890
draw this thing we actually want it to

198
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,860
kind of come out like this right imagine

199
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:44,159
the hero body right we want it to come

200
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,930
and and look more like that right that's

201
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,659
what it should look like and then the

202
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:50,669
head should be like up here right that

203
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:54,079
means that we actually need to draw out

204
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:58,189
here as well

205
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,970
okay so what actually happens if we were

206
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:04,339
to do that right well the first problem

207
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,310
is you know okay we would have to know

208
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:10,760
to move this thing out alike along Y I

209
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:12,259
guess to however far it would take to

210
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:17,679
line up the alignment point with where

211
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:20,120
it should be right that's one thing and

212
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:23,389
then the other thing is we don't

213
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,549
actually want this much perspective

214
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:27,889
because too much perspective makes them

215
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:30,229
look like cards and we want them to look

216
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:32,799
more like art right so the other thing

217
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:36,079
is we have to lie it down like that and

218
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,578
when we lie it down like that what we

219
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:39,439
end up doing is we end up

220
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:41,120
interpenetrating for example something

221
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,279
that like this wall back here and

222
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:50,000
clipping into it right so our challenge

223
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:55,519
is figuring out what are we supposed to

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,070
do here right you know what can how can

225
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,289
we make this work in some way that

226
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,430
doesn't create these kind of problems

227
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:08,208
that's what we're trying to figure out

228
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:11,750
just just fundamentally speaking okay

229
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:13,309
and so there's some things we could

230
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,078
possibly do there are some ways that we

231
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:17,208
can address this problem and again like

232
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:20,899
I don't really know what the correct

233
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:22,250
answer is but for example one thing that

234
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,769
we could try doing is that has nothing

235
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,269
to do with Z bias if we imagine looking

236
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,500
at this from the side now so let's

237
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:32,528
suppose that we're just looking at this

238
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,528
orthographically here's our side view

239
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:42,139
right so here is the wall and here is

240
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:44,448
the floor here is the point right this

241
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:47,208
is this is P this is the entity point

242
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:50,689
and we're trying to construct something

243
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:53,629
to draw on here if this is what we would

244
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,550
normally draw right so that would be the

245
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:58,159
sprite card if the card were just stuck

246
00:10:55,549 --> 00:11:01,519
in the world but what we actually want

247
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:03,828
to draw right doesn't have that level of

248
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,580
eccentricity so we really want something

249
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:10,549
that can lie flatter than that right

250
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:13,250
and we want something that can extend

251
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:15,409
further in well one thing we could do is

252
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,958
just say what if we just slid this thing

253
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:21,139
over this way and counter slid the other

254
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:25,179
part right back right and created a

255
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:27,169
sprite card more like crosswise right

256
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:29,599
what if we just did something like that

257
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:32,028
so rather than saying look for something

258
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,180
like this we're actually going to allow

259
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:36,740
it to go down below this level what if

260
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:39,169
instead of doing that we just took the

261
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,750
alignment point and said look we have

262
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:44,269
the camera we know what we want is

263
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,730
wherever the align is we want to be able

264
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:49,190
to shoot that line and hit the point

265
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,409
that it's supposed to align with in view

266
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,980
space but we're going to leave it on the

267
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:57,620
same z plane that it was right that gets

268
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,899
slid forward and then the one on the top

269
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,278
which would still be there we want to

270
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,528
lie down flatter so we're just gonna

271
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,750
slide that backwards the other way and

272
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:07,490
by the way if we want to do it we can

273
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,950
compensate to keep the length the same

274
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,200
we can also slide it down right meaning

275
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,690
we can sort of treat it as a rotation so

276
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,500
slide forward till you hit the

277
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:20,570
orientation then lie down right until

278
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,028
you hit the orientation I mean until you

279
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:28,190
hit the alignment point right so forward

280
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:32,019
and down you know maybe that would get

281
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:36,470
us out of the Z bias business altogether

282
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:38,179
and again I just don't know I don't know

283
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:42,019
what the right solution to this problem

284
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:46,549
is I'm not sure but what I do think is

285
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:49,720
true is we do kind of want to experiment

286
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:53,149
a little more try to find something good

287
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,100
and that won't involve us doing a lot of

288
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:59,509
fudge you know like I don't want a ton

289
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,190
of fudge in there uh now I think that's

290
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:02,870
what we want to do today and focus on a

291
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,550
day see how far we can get it probably

292
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:10,429
take us next weekend as well right so

293
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:13,519
what I would like to do today is I would

294
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:16,759
like to go and first I don't think we

295
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,259
ever really are debug camera so I think

296
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,200
we should go get the debug camera

297
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:22,730
working well because that's you

298
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,740
no the that was just on the to-do list

299
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,500
and we're gonna need it to verify that

300
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,409
we're lying down these things correctly

301
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,970
so let's go get our debug camera enabled

302
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:33,079
and that'll probably a significant chunk

303
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,690
of what we do today because we want to

304
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,000
make it decent and then the other thing

305
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,910
I want to do after we're done with that

306
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,570
is then play around something like this

307
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:48,019
and maybe write that routine so instead

308
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:50,510
of using alignment points in a way that

309
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:54,620
actually adjusts things in Z never

310
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:57,500
adjusting Z adjust only in Y on the

311
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,269
bottom and then we'll we will allow

312
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,899
adjusting of Z on the top to maintain

313
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:06,199
the height of things in screen space but

314
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,889
that's all right something along those

315
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,170
lines

316
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,449
we'll see if that works we'll see how

317
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:13,819
far that gets us maybe gets us all the

318
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,129
way in which case party time and we can

319
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,530
just go mark up all our art assets and

320
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:19,580
call it a day if that doesn't get us all

321
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:22,100
the way hopefully we will learn

322
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,020
something that we can then use to

323
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,259
determine what it is we should actually

324
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:31,250
be doing to solve this problem because

325
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:33,649
hey you know that's that's the goal of

326
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:37,009
exploratory programming either solve the

327
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:39,730
problem or learn something that new that

328
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,720
allows us to solve the problem later

329
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,259
alright so let me show you what I'm

330
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,899
talking about

331
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:51,769
oops here we are in handmade here oh and

332
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:54,909
if I run the game here then what happens

333
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:58,220
is you know here's me running the game

334
00:14:54,909 --> 00:15:00,019
if I run the game I switch to debug

335
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,990
camera and I get you know kind of

336
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:05,329
garbage right and the reason for this is

337
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,980
the debug camera is still like nominally

338
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,370
involved you can see I'm actually able

339
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,250
to look around actually right but it's

340
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,889
not it's all screwed up I think it

341
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:18,799
doesn't have any displacement from the

342
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:22,129
hero and it's just it's right it's it's

343
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,319
just it's busted you know I mean so what

344
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,720
I'd like to do is just re-enable that to

345
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,220
the extent where we're able to easily

346
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,810
get around the game with the debug

347
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,300
camera so that when we come to a

348
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:34,489
situation like say here and we want to

349
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,019
see what we have chosen for our sprite

350
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,659
cards

351
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:41,980
we can do so easily that's what I'd like

352
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:43,419
to get working right um so let's

353
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,209
reacquaint ourselves with that

354
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:49,539
particular piece of code that's in the

355
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:51,278
world mode right now which is kind of

356
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:53,049
the place where we actually in a world

357
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,278
mode is is game mode right it's the game

358
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:56,250
where you look at the mode where you're

359
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:59,139
looking at the world as opposed to say

360
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,089
the opening cutscene or the title screen

361
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,769
we have a title screen now did you know

362
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:05,230
that it's not really a title screen yet

363
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:07,419
but it's got a little thing on it so not

364
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:14,320
just the cutscene there is actually a

365
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:15,309
little a little you know whatever you

366
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,980
want to call that there's a title screen

367
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:20,549
I think I might ask Anna to like do that

368
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,110
a little bit more completely like the

369
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:24,549
I'd like to be able to make each of

370
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,440
these things kind of like float

371
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:28,419
independently I don't know if she'd get

372
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,959
grumpy if I asked for that but it's kind

373
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:36,009
of open anyway so like what I'd like to

374
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:40,000
do here is I'd like to go ahead and find

375
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:41,740
a good way of making Ziva camera really

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,240
useful allow us to look around the world

377
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:49,389
however we want and and do you know kind

378
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,259
of quick analyses of it and so on so if

379
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,149
you take a look at the way this code

380
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,769
works in update and render world what

381
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:56,889
you can see here is we do look at the

382
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:59,230
input and you can see us updating the

383
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:02,769
debug camera stuff it's still so right

384
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,838
it's in there right but what you'll

385
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:06,519
notice is that use debug camera is not

386
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:08,379
even really predicated here and we saw

387
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,639
this problem before we would have these

388
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,689
situations where if I happen to the

389
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,160
mouse around without having switch to

390
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:13,959
debug in road it would actually changed

391
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,699
around and so one thing I would like to

392
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,640
do is just right off the bat I managed

393
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:21,670
to remember not wanting this to be

394
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,559
busted before and just we never really

395
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:28,900
fix it what I'd like to do is let's

396
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:30,910
let's predicate this right where we're

397
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,570
not gonna do any kind of weird stuff

398
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:37,660
with the debug mouse if you're not in

399
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:39,549
debug camera mode right so if we're not

400
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,670
using any bug camera it doesn't do

401
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:44,529
anything that's just better and that way

402
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,970
you know we can kinda and maybe I'll

403
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,859
even do it this way so it's till you

404
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,279
actually affirmatively press it doesn't

405
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,979
change

406
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,119
right and then if you have switch to

407
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,589
debug camera mode then you can do this

408
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,509
other stuff right then you can rotate

409
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:57,189
around and you can zoom in and out and

410
00:17:55,509 --> 00:18:02,470
and all that good stuff

411
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,940
right so let's start with that so let's

412
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,860
say you do switch to debug camera mode

413
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,720
what happens then

414
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:09,909
well if you're in debug camera mode then

415
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,460
we have a couple different problems we

416
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,230
never actually fixed some of them looked

417
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,390
like we never really did the full debug

418
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,789
camera right and so one of the problems

419
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,470
that we had was you couldn't really move

420
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:23,139
to debug camera right mean you look up

421
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:26,710
here and we've got orbit we got pitch

422
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:29,050
and we've got dolly there's no pan right

423
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,029
so you can't you can't move the camera

424
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:34,119
you can only rotate the camera around

425
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:35,680
and zoom it in and out right which is

426
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,449
fine for most things but it would be all

427
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,460
it would be nice right to be able to

428
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,809
like move to actually take the camera

429
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:45,850
and move it around the world as well

430
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:50,589
because that's just a much you know

431
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:54,369
easier way to inspect things that we

432
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:57,069
might want inspect right so let's take a

433
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:58,359
look at that part as well and in fact

434
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:02,619
you know I can just put that on here you

435
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:05,799
can look we've got alt left and alt

436
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:10,989
middle are the ways that that's working

437
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:13,659
and so you know we need some way of the

438
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:18,190
debug camera some something that tells

439
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,480
us that we're going to pan and so the

440
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,200
thing that I think would be nice there

441
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:29,950
is just look if we just press the like

442
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:32,350
let's say we did this so basically I'm

443
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,900
saying here is hey if if that middle

444
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:37,029
mouse button goes down then if the alt

445
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,430
button is pressed then we will rotate

446
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:42,359
but if it's not pressed then we will pan

447
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,360
right

448
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,390
okay so the focus point can be moved

449
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,710
here and that's something that we can

450
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:55,390
you know we can work on all right so

451
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,809
we'll put the pan code there when we're

452
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:01,030
ready for it and we'll be good to go so

453
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:02,049
now if we come down here we can see like

454
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:04,210
near clip plane

455
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:06,339
far clip plane stuff they're predicated

456
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,019
on the debug camera if you look at

457
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,579
what's going on here I don't love that

458
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,650
you know I don't like the way this looks

459
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:13,119
and the reason is because it kind of

460
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,950
inter mixes those two pieces of code

461
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:18,309
together in a way that's a little more

462
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:20,680
than I would have liked right

463
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:22,720
so what I'd rather do is I would rather

464
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,710
have something that actually looks a

465
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,480
little bit more like the code below

466
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:32,140
where we say hey if we are in use debug

467
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,890
camera mode then we will set these to

468
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,960
something else

469
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,310
otherwise they just appear as they

470
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,490
appear above that's just a little bit

471
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:44,980
better so let's set them to what they

472
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:48,009
should be which is these things and then

473
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:51,099
if we're using a debug camera then I

474
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:53,589
will go ahead and allow them to be set

475
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:56,289
to these other things right and that way

476
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:58,929
I can again see that this is the debug

477
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:01,480
code here and this code is the actual

478
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:05,200
code that we normally use so it's more

479
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,610
up you know it's more direct right it's

480
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,289
something that you can see more clearly

481
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:13,059
and you don't have to you don't have to

482
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,309
sort of read these little inline ifs

483
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,230
which I like inline is quite a bit but

484
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:19,089
only for code that's actually always

485
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,529
gonna happen if it's debug code I'd

486
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:22,389
rather keep it a little bit more

487
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,759
separated so it's easier to see what's

488
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,310
going on so now when we come through

489
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:30,039
here what we're doing is using the

490
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:32,619
camera pitch in orbit regardless and

491
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,740
that's intentional because again we've

492
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:38,229
got that camera pit in pitch and orbit

493
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:41,200
setting that can change in the actual

494
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,700
game potentially and we want to set all

495
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,880
that stuff up normally so we're doing

496
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,430
all of that here as you can see and then

497
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,800
we set up the camera transform now if we

498
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,480
have a debug camera then we want to set

499
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,059
up our debug transform as well and

500
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,160
remember we set these two up there's a

501
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:58,869
reason we set them both up and the

502
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,029
reason that we set up two separate

503
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:03,939
camera transforms one for the game one

504
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:06,250
for debug and not just pick one and use

505
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,170
it is because there are things in the

506
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,569
game that depend on the camera transform

507
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,480
such as how we lie our sprite cards down

508
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:15,490
when we switch to debug camera we don't

509
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,370
want them following the debug

510
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,558
camera we want them to stay oriented to

511
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:22,629
the game camera so that we can pan

512
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,119
around and look at our algorithms to see

513
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,010
if they're working properly right so we

514
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,889
need to keep it's very important to have

515
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:32,710
the concept in the render of two cameras

516
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,080
the one that we're actually viewing the

517
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:40,380
world from which is the like real

518
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:43,329
rendering camera and the one that work

519
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,800
yeah I should say the game camera the

520
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:46,539
the camera that would be used in the

521
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,339
release mode build which may not be

522
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:52,329
where we're looking from right now but

523
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:55,990
is where all of the like camera facing

524
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:58,569
stuff all the culling code all that

525
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,779
stuff still needs to run off of that

526
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:04,058
camera because of that camera is the one

527
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:06,220
we're trying to like use for debugging

528
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:07,420
right now like the one that who's we're

529
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,750
trying to see if everything works with

530
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,130
and then the other one is you know the

531
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,690
debug camera the one that actually is

532
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,370
for rendering that's the one that's

533
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,230
actually displaying the world from right

534
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:19,289
that's the more actually looking from so

535
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,910
we want those two so that we can debug

536
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:23,409
things that involve the camera because

537
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,330
if we were always using our actual

538
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,710
camera we'd rotate and we'd never be

539
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:28,149
able to see how this rights are working

540
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,058
because they'd always turn to face us

541
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,040
right and so that's it's just useful to

542
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:36,220
understand why we need those two things

543
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,109
and we do need them all right so when we

544
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,990
go in to use debug camera what you can

545
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:43,678
see us doing here is using some extra

546
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:46,420
rotations that are applied to the camera

547
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,059
just for debug purposes and that's fine

548
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,380
we then also have the debug camera dolly

549
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:52,990
set here and I think the problem that

550
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,110
we're seeing is the debug camera dolly

551
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:58,390
it's probably set to zero at startup and

552
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:59,829
so what we're seeing is we're just we're

553
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:03,100
dollied all the way in and since

554
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:05,799
dollying is itself based off of the

555
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:08,919
distance from the camera that creates an

556
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:11,169
unrecoverable situation so what I'd like

557
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,330
to do is over in this window here I'd

558
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:16,179
like to jump to where we're initializing

559
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:19,928
the world here and you can see that

560
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:24,669
happening I think right in where is it

561
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:26,590
no no no there it is in here where we

562
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:30,150
set things up I would like to set that

563
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:30,149
debug dolly right

564
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:39,129
I'd like to set that to something like

565
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,299
let's say 10 right when I say I'd like

566
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,680
to what I mean is I'd like to do it

567
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:42,970
temporarily just to show you that that

568
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,799
was the case but there were gonna be

569
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,329
something else in a second but you know

570
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,569
just just bear with me here so there we

571
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:51,279
go here here's me building and so if I

572
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:53,139
right-click now you can see that our

573
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,690
debug camera is nominally restored

574
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,520
meaning we can now do the simple

575
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,900
operations we were doing before right

576
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,750
we'd like to go a little further than

577
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:05,110
this like I said but you know we'll get

578
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,579
to that in a second okay so why did I

579
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:08,439
say I want to actually do something else

580
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:10,839
there well the reason is because it's a

581
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,410
little jarring right I'm in here i right

582
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:17,829
click and suddenly I'm in this situation

583
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:21,640
right and what I'd rather do is just be

584
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:23,589
in this situation probably right so I'm

585
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,650
wondering if what I can do is say hey

586
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:30,220
with this debug camera dolly all this

587
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:34,240
stuff right would it be possible that

588
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:37,630
just when you actually switch so in here

589
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,490
we could say look you know if world mode

590
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:43,300
use debug camera so we know you're

591
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:46,779
turning it on right now could we set the

592
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:51,279
camera dolly now to just be whatever the

593
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:53,859
camera dolly actually is right so if

594
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,470
you're looking here what you can see is

595
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:57,789
we are doing something right so when we

596
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,960
come through here we've got the camera

597
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:03,549
orbit and the camera pitch right and

598
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,110
then we've got this camera P and

599
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,700
simulation center we're setting the

600
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:08,589
Delta there right then we do some work

601
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,240
to set the spans and then we come

602
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:11,949
through here and we set the camera

603
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,000
transform and you can see us doing right

604
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:20,830
here our cameras Z you know and our

605
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,440
camera 0 T these are created - as part

606
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:26,049
of our camera interpolation Delta from

607
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,240
sim right which is this right here is

608
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:30,879
the translation that tells us how far

609
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,990
away we are from from the world right

610
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,590
you can see us doing this subtraction

611
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:39,009
here where simulation of camera P so

612
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:42,639
that thing tells us where the camera

613
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:44,980
actually is it might be nice to

614
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,400
set up our debug camera to follow that

615
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:52,269
same position right to basically do that

616
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:57,250
exact thing um so we know here for

617
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:59,950
example that our camera 0t is setting us

618
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:02,859
to some displacement away from the

619
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:05,230
camera and you can see our camera

620
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:07,809
orientation multiplying our dolly that's

621
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:10,059
the part that we're you know this is the

622
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,169
orientation part here of the debug

623
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:14,379
camera right and this is that dolly

624
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:16,990
that's setting us away from it it might

625
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:22,120
be nice to figure out some way to again

626
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:24,789
get those two things in line right and

627
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:27,099
so if i look at what's going on here you

628
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:30,279
can see that when we take our camera

629
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:35,769
orientation here we really don't we

630
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:38,829
don't use that right i should i say this

631
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:42,779
we we don't actually take our

632
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:46,419
orientation the camera orientation and

633
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:51,420
modify this translation so this part

634
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:54,970
here we don't actually in in the actual

635
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,980
game rendered camera we don't do

636
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,779
anything to that translation so it's

637
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,160
just whatever the game said here's where

638
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:03,730
the camera supposed to be we just use

639
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:07,029
that right and so if we were going to

640
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:13,180
mimic the behavior of what that is here

641
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:17,049
we would need the camera dolly right to

642
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:20,049
mimic the behavior of this so the camera

643
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:22,389
orbit and the camera pitch plus the

644
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:26,019
camera dolly would have to reproduce

645
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:29,800
whatever ot actually was going to be

646
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:32,259
with delta from sim right i mean that's

647
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:34,240
what we would actually need so if you

648
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:36,490
take a look at what's going on here you

649
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,029
can see that we've got pretty much only

650
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,859
debug camera stuff happening and so i'm

651
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:44,440
gonna go ahead and say what if we just

652
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:46,949
move or well we don't even have to we

653
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,950
could do this

654
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:57,220
we could just record the fact that it's

655
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:59,320
supposed to happen into a boolean right

656
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,730
and then what we can do is right down

657
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,649
there where we were actually doing that

658
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:05,769
piece of code we could do the

659
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:08,410
calculation so in here where we say look

660
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:10,569
we're about to do this use debug camera

661
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,400
I'm gonna say look was I supposed to

662
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:15,460
reset the debug camera here if I was

663
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,550
maybe now what we do is we set the debug

664
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:23,289
camera orbit we set the debug camera

665
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:26,759
pitch and then we set the debug camera

666
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:30,250
dolly and we try to get those to match

667
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:33,099
right we try to get those things to

668
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:36,369
match what the camera displacement

669
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:38,289
actually was now in order to do that we

670
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:40,959
would actually need some inverse trig

671
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:44,980
and trig functions right we would need

672
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,870
our atan2 but you know maybe that's just

673
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,779
fine because at some point we would like

674
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:52,569
to use a tan too and so we'll take a

675
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:56,079
look at it right okay

676
00:29:52,569 --> 00:30:00,339
so let's go back to our drawing board

677
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:02,619
here and let's just say okay here's the

678
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:04,589
situation we actually have we've got a

679
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:07,509
rotation that's not good

680
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:10,269
we've got a rotation like around a ring

681
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:15,480
and then we've got a rotation and I

682
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:18,369
should draw this better here's a plane

683
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,890
all right so we've got a rotation and

684
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:23,009
the rotation is going to be this kind of

685
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:26,140
a thing right it's gotta go somewhere

686
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:30,250
let's say it goes mostly around the horn

687
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:33,520
to here right then we do a rotation

688
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:36,390
upward to here right so first rotations

689
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,400
that way next rotations this way right

690
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:42,850
maybe I'll do a little bit smaller there

691
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,880
right so this is orbit and this is pitch

692
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:48,579
I believe I think that's orbit

693
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,970
this is pitch and then we have the

694
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:55,809
vector and we know that we have a camera

695
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:58,059
somewhere in space right so we're given

696
00:30:55,809 --> 00:31:00,039
this point this is our camera point and

697
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,659
we want to know what is the orbit and

698
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,799
the pitch that would be necessary to

699
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,860
reproduce that the dis

700
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,529
since is trivial right because the

701
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:10,899
distance from this point here we're just

702
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:13,809
gonna know that's not particularly

703
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:17,019
difficult right because it's just the

704
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:20,139
length of that camera vector right so we

705
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:22,690
trivially know this right that length

706
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,160
that's the dolly and we trivially can

707
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:27,190
get that piece of information that

708
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,860
shouldn't be a problem at all what we

709
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:33,960
don't know is how to reconstruct this

710
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:37,899
vector from an orbit and a pitch right

711
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:42,610
but it shouldn't be that hard to figure

712
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:45,310
out because since the thing can only

713
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:47,259
really rotate within this right it's the

714
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:52,119
game camera so it can really only rotate

715
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:56,230
like that we effectively know that the Z

716
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:58,659
coordinate right of that vector whatever

717
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:02,470
that Z coordinate is after we normalize

718
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:07,779
it for length its Z coordinate just

719
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:10,660
tells us the pitch angle right I mean

720
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:13,180
how could it not the only way this thing

721
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,759
can get up into Z and not be flat in the

722
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,789
plane is by having this angle the angle

723
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:22,089
the pitch angle be nonzero if the pitch

724
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:23,980
angle is zero right so there's no lift

725
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:27,970
up then we're not gonna have any Z

726
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:33,039
coordinate right so pitch of zero that's

727
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:35,829
not right of zero right is Z of 0 these

728
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,349
are the same right and furthermore a

729
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:42,189
pitch of 1 right I'm sorry

730
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:47,439
ozzie of 1 if we saw Z of 1 would mean

731
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:53,049
that we pitched 90 degrees right right

732
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:57,460
or tau over 4 what do you how do you

733
00:32:53,049 --> 00:33:01,169
draw a tau again you know I'm so not

734
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,170
used to drawing tau hold please

735
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:09,859
it's like a little T looking thing

736
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,538
there it is so it's like you kind of

737
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,940
have to crook the thing in the motika no

738
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:32,200
loops around I don't like how much it

739
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:38,980
looks like a regular tee but yeah it's

740
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:43,659
close enough I guess that's not a very

741
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:46,028
good time I apologize anyway so a pitch

742
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:48,909
that's gonna be 90 degrees it's gonna be

743
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:50,890
as equal to one right and so that pretty

744
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:54,120
much tells us exactly what we wanted to

745
00:33:50,890 --> 00:34:00,278
know pretty much right off the bat

746
00:33:54,119 --> 00:34:03,398
because it means that we can take the we

747
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:05,558
know right how cosine and sine behave so

748
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:08,799
we can immediately tell which way our

749
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:10,929
circle is working here right if the

750
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,649
pitch is zero meaning the angle is zero

751
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:16,838
Z is zero use cosine of zero zero no

752
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:19,929
right cosine of zero is one

753
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:24,579
he's sine of zero zero yes right so we

754
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:26,588
know that the Aysen right of whatever

755
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:30,159
the Z value is is going to give us our

756
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:33,159
pitch another way of saying that is we

757
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,800
know that tangent of an angle right

758
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,230
whatever that angle is we know the

759
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,419
tangent angle is equal to sine over

760
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:45,608
cosine oops so if we want to do this all

761
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:47,079
in terms of eight and two because that's

762
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:48,909
probably the only a trig function we

763
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:51,549
really want to have we can pretty easily

764
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,619
do that because since we know sine over

765
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:56,019
cosine is what we would feed into atan2

766
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:57,579
to get our angle well we know that Z is

767
00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:00,309
the sine right

768
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:02,710
so whatever the other component of the

769
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:06,460
vector is in that plane would be the

770
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:08,679
cosine you know I'm saying so we can

771
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,690
trivially into our eight and two we can

772
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:13,299
trivially say look just feed the Z

773
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,429
coordinate in after normalization of the

774
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:20,260
vector just feed the Z coordinate in as

775
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:22,539
the sine value and whatever the whatever

776
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,670
is left over after removing the Z

777
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:27,639
coordinate that length so if you

778
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,500
subtract that off of the Z zero out the

779
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:33,159
Z coordinate of the vector that length

780
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:35,588
is the bottom part right is the cosine

781
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:38,440
so the length of the vector of the of

782
00:35:35,588 --> 00:35:40,538
the remaining vector after Z is gone

783
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,460
that's would be the other one so we

784
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:45,160
could do it either of those two ways

785
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:48,400
either with a Nason or than 18 - that

786
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:51,429
would get us back the pitch value right

787
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,068
no worries and then furthermore if we

788
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:56,500
wanted to figure out the rest of it well

789
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:58,599
this vector that we would compute here

790
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,579
so after creating the planar version of

791
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,160
this of getting rid of the Z we're just

792
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:04,809
looking at a vector right that vector is

793
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:07,750
pointing in some direction hey guess

794
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:11,048
what that vector itself has an XY

795
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:14,170
coordinate if we just feed that in to an

796
00:36:11,048 --> 00:36:16,469
atan - that's gonna give us how far

797
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:20,079
around the circle the orbit we went

798
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:24,459
right so again really really

799
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:27,490
straightforward here pretty much we're

800
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,880
done so we should be able to compute

801
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:33,459
these things directly without really too

802
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,559
much trouble and reproduce the exact

803
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:38,139
camera position for when we hit the

804
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,680
right mouse button why do we care about

805
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:41,348
doing this

806
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:44,889
we don't it's just a good way to show

807
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:46,059
you how to do those constructions we try

808
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:48,278
to do them a lot on handmade here ODEs

809
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:49,720
to drill them in right drill them and

810
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:51,818
drill them in drill them in right so you

811
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:54,429
know don't be afraid of creating

812
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:57,099
geometry don't be afraid of trying to

813
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:59,018
solve vector problems do them over and

814
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:00,849
over and over and over again and I

815
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:02,500
apologize I kind of did that one quickly

816
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:07,000
but again that's because we're on day 5

817
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:08,409
something right 5:20 you should be able

818
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,739
to do that if you followed handmade hero

819
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:12,848
so far but you know if you had trouble

820
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:16,419
with that we can go over it again in the

821
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:18,818
QA all right so here we are needing to

822
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:23,670
solve these so like I said we've got an

823
00:37:18,818 --> 00:37:25,989
8 and 2 somewhere right here it is and

824
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,220
and these are our trig functions that

825
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:29,828
we're going to replace someday right

826
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:31,088
it's the only three that we have and

827
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:32,680
someday we'll just write our own

828
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:34,210
approximated versions and we'll be done

829
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:37,268
with them right but we're allowed to use

830
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:40,329
those three so this we need an eight and

831
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:43,268
two for this I need an 8 and 2 4 and the

832
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:46,028
camera dolly part is actually quite easy

833
00:37:43,268 --> 00:37:46,869
like I said that one comes right away so

834
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:50,590
let's see how to

835
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:52,480
those okay so we're sending the camera

836
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:55,900
transform here and the camera transform

837
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,789
is just this ot so the dolly away from

838
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:01,119
the focus point should just be the

839
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:02,469
length of this vector in theory right so

840
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,809
we should be able to get that camera

841
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:06,549
dolly just by saying okay what's the

842
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:10,539
length of that vector that's the camera

843
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:13,000
dolly right so at that point once we

844
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:15,880
have the length of that vector we should

845
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,199
then be able to produce the normalized

846
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,849
version and I'm not going to be

847
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:23,409
efficient here so I because I don't care

848
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:26,529
but if I want to do in fact I think yeah

849
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:28,089
there we go umm so I'm gonna normalize

850
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,470
it like I said I already have the length

851
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,490
so I'm just counting on the optimizer to

852
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:32,289
do the right thing we don't care about

853
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:33,309
this is not high performance part of the

854
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:34,719
thing right here it's only getting

855
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:38,469
called once so it doesn't even matter

856
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:40,929
what we do but I now want the normalized

857
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:43,659
camera arm right so I'm gonna call this

858
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:46,589
like hogs call it cam arm right now I

859
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:49,480
want the normalized version of that

860
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:51,519
right so this is the just a vector

861
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,769
pointing it's a unit vector pointing in

862
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:58,389
the direction of the camera from the

863
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:59,259
focus point right at least I believe

864
00:38:58,389 --> 00:39:00,659
that's what it is it might be pointing

865
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,980
the other direction if I'm totally wrong

866
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:06,969
about how this set camera transform

867
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:11,820
works I believe this is saying where the

868
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:13,869
camera is I could be wrong about that

869
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,430
looking at how we're doing it here you

870
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:16,960
can see us getting the columns of the

871
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:20,199
camera orientation matrix and passing

872
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,990
this down that to me very much suggests

873
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:26,589
that we are passing in the placement of

874
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:28,629
the camera I can verify that by jumping

875
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:31,990
to set camera transform and you can see

876
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,630
in here what we're actually doing before

877
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:37,239
we go any further let's just verify that

878
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:39,970
so camera peak here it is we set the XYZ

879
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,679
camera P directly so yeah it's just the

880
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:44,169
position of the camera so it is its and

881
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,389
so this is going from 0 out to where the

882
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,849
camera is so that's pretty much all

883
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:51,129
there is to it

884
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:52,839
all right so at that point we now know

885
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,070
this is where the camera is and we know

886
00:39:52,840 --> 00:40:05,250
that we're looking at this particular

887
00:39:54,070 --> 00:40:09,940
point actually no I take that back

888
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:12,809
so this is actually a little bit more

889
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,809
complicated than that

890
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:20,940
so yeah we do need to do a little bit

891
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:25,210
more work here I lied to you

892
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:27,940
we're not moving just off of Z we allow

893
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:30,340
the camera to kind of like go side to

894
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,990
side as well so it actually doesn't have

895
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,840
to be you know it's it's gonna be

896
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:42,219
focusing on camera Z straight down the

897
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:53,019
camera z-axis so actually what I said

898
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:54,789
was alive we do need to create a I'm not

899
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:57,759
sure what I want to call this but we

900
00:40:54,789 --> 00:41:02,070
need to create a cam or like a two cam

901
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:05,440
vector right and that is going to be

902
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:09,430
based off of this but it has to only be

903
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,710
the camera Z part of it right now that's

904
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:13,269
pretty easy for me to do and the reason

905
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:15,460
for that is of course I can always

906
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:17,380
measure anything against another vector

907
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,750
that's a unit vector right I can take

908
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,730
this and say how far along the camera z

909
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,260
vector was I actually going but in order

910
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,940
to get the two cam back up for like the

911
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:28,060
focus point which is what I want to be

912
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:30,490
able to revolve around this actually has

913
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:33,759
to happen so I take it back

914
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:34,929
that was my bad right now I'll draw that

915
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,030
out for you really quickly just so you

916
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:38,319
understand what I'm talking about but

917
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,700
what I did is you saw me do the

918
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,900
construction I wanted to do the

919
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:43,149
construction around the place the camera

920
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,579
was looking at but actually the camera

921
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:49,240
displacement that we have isn't that

922
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:52,539
kind of displacement right the actual

923
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:55,479
displacement we have is saying here's

924
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:58,179
zero zero in the world the camera

925
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,889
displacement is like over here or you

926
00:41:58,179 --> 00:42:01,328
know somewhere up in space like over

927
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:03,969
here and

928
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:06,190
then it's Z vector is whatever else we

929
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:08,048
want it to be so the Z vector is

930
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,849
actually just pointing down to here or

931
00:42:08,048 --> 00:42:11,920
something so that's what it's actually

932
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:13,900
looking at it's something over here now

933
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,969
if I want to know what point it's

934
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,539
looking at well it's still looking at

935
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:22,838
the point zero zero zero in a sense just

936
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:25,089
translate it over right so if I take the

937
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:27,009
camera's z-axis and I take the inner

938
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:29,889
product of this vector with it

939
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:33,159
I will get how far along the z vector we

940
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:35,139
actually went right so all I'm doing is

941
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:38,440
removing the other components and just

942
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:40,179
saying look let's look only at those so

943
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:44,889
this is the actual displacement of the

944
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:48,929
camera in the world only off of its z

945
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:54,159
axis right only off of its z axis so

946
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:55,419
that is more useful to us and then we

947
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:59,348
can construct the thing which we

948
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:02,289
actually want in that case which I can

949
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:07,690
construct off of off of this by saying

950
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:09,579
look when we actually do this we need to

951
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:12,729
retain the displacement that we were

952
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:14,680
going to get before like we need that we

953
00:43:12,728 --> 00:43:17,439
need a camera placement vector that

954
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:20,919
we're going to use and that will be

955
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,239
whatever the residual is here right so I

956
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,719
can show you what we would do with that

957
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,969
as well

958
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,429
let's do that part and this would give

959
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:28,568
us a good way to do the the panning as

960
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:30,940
well because like I said we need to do

961
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:33,608
the panning so we need something on here

962
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,289
that's like a camera pan and that camera

963
00:43:33,608 --> 00:43:37,298
pan is something that allows us to move

964
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:39,249
the camera around which we couldn't do

965
00:43:37,298 --> 00:43:42,338
before in addition to just orbiting it

966
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:44,618
and stuff like that so we want to do

967
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:46,929
here is say okay the world mode camera

968
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:49,749
pan is whatever the displacement was

969
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:51,848
that isn't part of the camera dolly so

970
00:43:49,748 --> 00:43:53,858
once we have this two cam vector we know

971
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:56,140
what that is again because we just say

972
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:58,298
look whatever the total displacement was

973
00:43:56,139 --> 00:44:00,940
that we have get rid of the part that's

974
00:43:58,298 --> 00:44:02,920
gonna be our dolly part and just tell me

975
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:07,179
what's left that's the panning amount

976
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:09,099
right then we proceed as normal so now

977
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:10,298
we say look how long is the part that

978
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:12,579
actually goes back to the camera

979
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:15,038
great that's the camera debug dolly part

980
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:15,280
right and really you know at this part

981
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:17,020
we

982
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,380
could be a little bit squeakier and say

983
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:22,480
oh hey well by the way instead of

984
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:26,320
constructing it and then retaking the

985
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:29,590
length how about we just say give me the

986
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,330
length directly because I know it right

987
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:33,309
cuz that's what that is right there

988
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:36,130
that's the length that we have to go

989
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:39,699
along Z to get to where the camera is

990
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:41,650
right you know that was it so we can

991
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:43,480
actually get rid of that length call now

992
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,980
too because we can just say oh well this

993
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,599
is what we actually needed to do there

994
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,909
where we just said there's the debug

995
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,440
camera dolly and let me take the the

996
00:44:48,909 --> 00:44:53,609
cameras you there to create the two cam

997
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,789
vector that means we no longer need that

998
00:44:53,610 --> 00:45:00,789
vector to be normalized either because

999
00:44:57,789 --> 00:45:03,699
it means that the camera Z vector is

1000
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:05,529
actually our camera arm now right so

1001
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:11,199
that Z vector whatever the camera Z

1002
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:13,150
vector is that's the camera arm right we

1003
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:14,109
don't need to normalize anything because

1004
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:17,619
we've got it all now

1005
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:19,090
because I think we do so now we have all

1006
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:22,089
of the information that we need and we

1007
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:24,430
just need to do some atan doing so like

1008
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:26,230
I said in here we have one more

1009
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:28,449
projection step we would like to do

1010
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:31,599
which is we'd like to get the Z out of

1011
00:45:28,449 --> 00:45:34,599
there right so what we want to do is say

1012
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:37,809
hey there's a there's a planar right

1013
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:42,549
version of this it doesn't have the Z

1014
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:45,009
it's just cam arm X camera and Y right

1015
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:47,230
so that's the part that's that's in a

1016
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:53,740
plane and Z right that doesn't lift up

1017
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:55,119
and off we go right so if we know all of

1018
00:45:53,739 --> 00:45:57,009
those pieces of information we should be

1019
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,639
able to do our eight and twos pretty

1020
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,520
easily now

1021
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:02,529
right so the first one we just need to

1022
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:03,880
know is that length right so at the

1023
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,990
length of the camera I don't even really

1024
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,820
need it there's only gonna use it once

1025
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:10,809
so what I can do is say look whatever

1026
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:15,039
the length of the planar arm is that's

1027
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:19,420
our X we know our Y for the atan2 it's

1028
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:21,809
just the cameras YZ z value that gives

1029
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,980
us whatever oops in the wrong one here

1030
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:27,250
that gives us sort of the pitches and

1031
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:28,838
the planar version that planar arm is

1032
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,608
actually exactly the thing

1033
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:34,858
we would take to get our orbit because

1034
00:46:30,608 --> 00:46:40,358
it's the thing inside right inside the

1035
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:42,098
the circle so now all we have to do is

1036
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:43,538
make sure these things line up with what

1037
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,859
we were actually using you can see we

1038
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:46,180
don't do any of this placement here and

1039
00:46:44,858 --> 00:46:48,219
we don't do any displacement here so I

1040
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:52,449
think that should give us basically what

1041
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:54,429
we wanted right I think and then what

1042
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:56,409
you do is say okay we don't use this

1043
00:46:54,429 --> 00:47:00,460
anymore this is not a thing that we

1044
00:46:56,409 --> 00:47:04,989
actually do directly instead what we

1045
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:10,568
want to do is take that pan and base

1046
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:12,489
that ot off of it right so that way we

1047
00:47:10,568 --> 00:47:14,170
start in the place that we're saying

1048
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:17,199
we're focusing on and then we do our

1049
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:22,719
rotation of the dahle vector around

1050
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:24,848
there right now things get a little bit

1051
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,048
more complicated because what will

1052
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:31,150
happen if you actually run this code

1053
00:47:26,048 --> 00:47:33,278
even if I didn't make any mistakes even

1054
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:36,700
if I didn't make any math of six is we

1055
00:47:33,278 --> 00:47:39,159
will not get the correct result it'll be

1056
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:42,699
close but it'll be mirrored and flipped

1057
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:44,949
right and what's the reason for that

1058
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:49,689
well the reason for that is think about

1059
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:52,478
how atan2 actually works a team to work

1060
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:54,729
specifically assuming that the vector

1061
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:58,298
you started with was pointing along the

1062
00:47:54,728 --> 00:48:00,759
x-direction right and just again to like

1063
00:47:58,298 --> 00:48:03,309
hammer this home suppose I was to draw

1064
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:06,818
the unit circle right

1065
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:12,969
I take eight and two of this vector

1066
00:48:06,818 --> 00:48:15,728
right here's my x equals one right x

1067
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:18,729
equals 1 negative 1 y negative 1 X

1068
00:48:15,728 --> 00:48:21,909
positive 1 Y right yes no I'm talking

1069
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:24,098
about here so if I'm looking at the

1070
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:26,679
circle the unit circle here if I take

1071
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:30,818
the 8 into of this vector what I get I

1072
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:33,518
get 0 right so 18 to you know let me

1073
00:48:30,818 --> 00:48:36,298
just draw it out I should say write it

1074
00:48:33,518 --> 00:48:42,759
out so if I take the 8 and 2 of

1075
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:44,829
coordinates right this is 1 comma 0 and

1076
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,830
why right why goes on the top XO is on

1077
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:51,699
the bottom right 18 - sine over cosine y

1078
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:53,619
over X right so if I take the 8 into of

1079
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:57,039
this what do I get will I get 0 degrees

1080
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:58,599
right I'm gonna get 0 if I take the 8

1081
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:01,690
a.m. - of this what do I get

1082
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:06,940
right so that's gonna be one over zero

1083
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:08,679
right so what do I get in that case well

1084
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,510
I guess besides the fact that this would

1085
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,699
normally multiply out this would

1086
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:14,500
actually divide out - nothing but that's

1087
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,329
why we use a tan - because you never do

1088
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,800
that actual divide right I mean that

1089
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,969
tells you right there what I do it cuz I

1090
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,180
wanna be able to get back to sign crease

1091
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:24,299
so if we feed that into 18 - right what

1092
00:49:22,179 --> 00:49:27,339
am I gonna get well I'm gonna get 90

1093
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:30,550
right and keep going right what's gonna

1094
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:34,960
be here I'm gonna get PI gonna get 3 PI

1095
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:37,630
over 4 right bah bah bah bah bah so what

1096
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,329
you can see there is it's giving me the

1097
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:44,230
answer for rotation assuming that the

1098
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:46,719
vector I started rotating was a 1 0

1099
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:49,960
vector right it was a vector that

1100
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:51,789
started here if my vector didn't start

1101
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:57,849
there that's not the answer I'm gonna

1102
00:49:51,789 --> 00:50:02,710
get right so let's see what we've got

1103
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:07,089
here if you look at what we start with

1104
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:10,619
eating that vector right that's not the

1105
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:16,180
x-direction in any coordinate space

1106
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:17,769
right so I could probably and I think

1107
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:20,409
maybe we should just try this

1108
00:50:17,769 --> 00:50:23,110
I could start with one that just goes

1109
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:30,609
down the x direction and then it would

1110
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:33,880
probably work right but these might be

1111
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:41,019
weird now so these would have to be

1112
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:43,360
changed so the thing that rotates if I

1113
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:48,579
started in the plane and then I rotated

1114
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:54,490
and then I pitched right the way that I

1115
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:55,829
would have to do that is is I'd have to

1116
00:50:54,489 --> 00:51:02,189
orbit four

1117
00:50:55,829 --> 00:51:06,299
first and then pitch second so the pitch

1118
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:09,840
vector would have to actually be yeah if

1119
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:13,650
I pitch first well you know what I think

1120
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:15,000
that still probably works all right so I

1121
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:17,880
think the only real thing we have to

1122
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,440
change is this X rotation right so for

1123
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,910
pointing down the x axis and we want to

1124
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,849
pitch up then what we need to do is

1125
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:25,949
rotate around the y axis right because

1126
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:27,150
if the x axis needs to pitch upward the

1127
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:29,519
thing that's perpendicular to it that

1128
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:31,440
would pitch it upwards is the Y X we'll

1129
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,519
rotate it around and that I'm sorry Z

1130
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,990
will rotate it around which is what

1131
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:36,239
we're doing here and Y will pitch it up

1132
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:39,539
so now we're starting in the place we're

1133
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:42,419
actually measuring so now now we should

1134
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:43,650
have a correct construction of course

1135
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,869
there's way too much math there you'd

1136
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:48,930
never get it right the first time so we

1137
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:53,400
won't but at least we now don't have any

1138
00:51:48,929 --> 00:51:57,239
obvious mistakes right that we can fix

1139
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,590
ahead of time okay so what's going on

1140
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:03,419
here Oh debug camera dawg this is

1141
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:04,590
supposed to be an inner product I'm just

1142
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,849
trying to write it in math notation

1143
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,650
there like as if there was a dot

1144
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:08,670
operator or something right there's an

1145
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:10,470
inner product right we just want to

1146
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:14,039
measure how far along Z we displace

1147
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:18,829
ourselves there let's see what that is

1148
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:20,460
this is supposed to be a b2 to construct

1149
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:22,710
and off we go

1150
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,110
now the other thing we could do here we

1151
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,099
could actually say this now I think

1152
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:35,579
about it

1153
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:38,699
I think we support this yeah so there we

1154
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:39,690
go all right uh now again I don't

1155
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:40,949
actually think this is going to work

1156
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,670
because I think we've got too much stuff

1157
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:48,500
going on here

1158
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:48,500
right what just happened

1159
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:59,108
that's weird what did we do wrong there

1160
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:07,250
was that a reload problem what was going

1161
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:11,048
on there no that must have just been a

1162
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:13,190
bug in our loading code or something I

1163
00:53:11,048 --> 00:53:21,858
didn't actually mean to kill that I

1164
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:23,539
wanted to look at that bug I'm not sure

1165
00:53:21,858 --> 00:53:30,739
why that would fail other than like a

1166
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:32,720
bitmap info just being null probably so

1167
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:34,449
that probably was a bitmap that info

1168
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:37,759
equals null I would have liked to have

1169
00:53:34,449 --> 00:53:41,419
I'm bummed that I didn't get it to look

1170
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,329
at that all right well that's

1171
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:46,700
unfortunate

1172
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:48,289
all right so anyway you can see that it

1173
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:51,230
is wrong right exactly like I said it

1174
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:52,970
would be so now we got to go do our

1175
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:54,920
homework and see what the problem is

1176
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:56,149
although I I do wonder if the only

1177
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:00,019
problem is just we're pointing the wrong

1178
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:01,519
direction hold on let me take a look at

1179
00:54:00,018 --> 00:54:05,479
this construction that we ended up with

1180
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:07,159
here one more time so if I go in here

1181
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,259
and look at what we did for construction

1182
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:15,199
the camera Z is pointing backwards right

1183
00:54:11,259 --> 00:54:17,240
so this is measuring how far back from

1184
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:19,659
the place we're focusing on we would go

1185
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:25,028
right so that that inner product there

1186
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:28,308
is is measuring that off of the origin

1187
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:29,268
so I think that should be correct we'll

1188
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:31,849
have to think it through a little bit

1189
00:54:29,268 --> 00:54:34,308
carefully and obviously about code but

1190
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:35,809
that's fine so then we have the vector

1191
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:37,430
to the camera out the vector the camera

1192
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:38,778
should be whatever that was times the

1193
00:54:37,429 --> 00:54:41,419
camera Z that should be the displacement

1194
00:54:38,778 --> 00:54:43,460
in Z that seems correct as well

1195
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:45,259
and then the panning that we actually

1196
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,568
want is going to be whatever is

1197
00:54:45,259 --> 00:54:50,599
necessary to assuming that the two cam

1198
00:54:47,568 --> 00:54:53,239
is actually getting reconstructed we

1199
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:57,740
want the rest of it which is this right

1200
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:59,899
to still be added in and that is what we

1201
00:54:57,739 --> 00:55:03,288
should do that is what should work right

1202
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,550
there we then have the camera arm that's

1203
00:55:03,289 --> 00:55:09,910
going

1204
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:11,680
be that's not right I said it was

1205
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:14,769
supposed to be toucan and for some

1206
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:16,809
reason it wasn't so - cam is actually

1207
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:19,480
the camera arm so I'm not sure why I did

1208
00:55:16,809 --> 00:55:23,739
that this is actually the thing that we

1209
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:25,329
want so this is that all of this is

1210
00:55:23,739 --> 00:55:27,849
wrong I just this was just a typo

1211
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:30,659
festival I don't know why I seem to have

1212
00:55:27,849 --> 00:55:30,659
had such a problem with it

1213
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:42,820
yeah so so this is the camera sorry this

1214
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:44,619
is two camera oh no no no no I'm sorry

1215
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:48,730
that's not that's not true that's not

1216
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:52,329
true I I do agree with that right the

1217
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:54,760
camera arm is just camera Z because we

1218
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:56,829
want it normalized now right so this is

1219
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:01,060
the unit vector that we are talking

1220
00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:03,819
about so no no I'm totally totally wrong

1221
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:07,360
didn't mean to malign our code like that

1222
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:09,309
that was brain fart so yes that's

1223
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,990
correct the planar arm is the X Y

1224
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:13,900
component of that so it doesn't include

1225
00:56:10,989 --> 00:56:17,589
the Z displacement that goes upward

1226
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:19,119
right out of the plane so then we can

1227
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:22,480
take a look here we say what's the debug

1228
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,309
camera orbit well it's the cleaner are

1229
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,219
my over the planar arm X that should

1230
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:31,289
give us the spin around in there ah

1231
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:33,399
that's not normalized this needs to be

1232
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:34,869
no it shouldn't be normals actually cuz

1233
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,300
atan2 will automatically take care of

1234
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:38,889
that so we don't need a Norma's Asian

1235
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,840
that's fine too

1236
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:45,940
then we got debug camera pitch and

1237
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:48,610
that's just the Z value is the sine part

1238
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:51,309
yep that's correct and then however long

1239
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:54,070
the planar arm was that's the other part

1240
00:56:51,309 --> 00:57:02,049
of the confess the other X component of

1241
00:56:54,070 --> 00:57:06,000
it that seems correct as well now see

1242
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:06,000
any real issue there

1243
00:57:10,858 --> 00:57:15,219
yeah that all that all seems relatively

1244
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,019
good to me

1245
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:18,939
so what I'd like to do now is the bug

1246
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:20,559
that and before I do I'm just gonna set

1247
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:25,269
assert ourselves up for a slightly

1248
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:26,290
better so something a little bit easier

1249
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:29,619
to work with them what we've got here

1250
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:32,039
what I'm going to do is set another

1251
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:35,740
thing here that's like the camera arm

1252
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:37,630
recomputation so here's us Rica you know

1253
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:39,039
recreating that camera arm effectively I

1254
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:42,539
mean here's actually the camera so this

1255
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:44,889
is us we keep creating the two cam right

1256
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:46,750
so I'm gonna go ahead and grab that part

1257
00:57:44,889 --> 00:57:49,838
here so we can look at this separately

1258
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:51,699
so we can look at the two cam as well as

1259
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:53,980
you know getting reconstruct with the

1260
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:56,289
camera pan and so we should be able to

1261
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:59,650
do ideally is look at these things that

1262
00:57:56,289 --> 00:58:02,798
come in here now debug the 0t and the oh

1263
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:05,170
here so so these actually exist up here

1264
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:06,880
and and that makes it less good because

1265
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:08,619
i want to maybe be able to look at those

1266
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,710
but at the same time so what i'd like to

1267
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:14,019
do is just expand this out to use like a

1268
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:16,150
debug version of each naming convention

1269
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:16,929
wise so i can kind of do something more

1270
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,818
like this

1271
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:21,578
where we've just got you know debug

1272
00:58:18,818 --> 00:58:27,608
versions of them that are computed

1273
00:58:21,579 --> 00:58:30,280
separately and then each of these you

1274
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:32,380
know can be can be recomputed right so

1275
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:36,040
that looks that looks right so we can

1276
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:38,170
compete debug camera oh we use that here

1277
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:40,659
do grote and then we used a camera oh

1278
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:44,289
and ot all throughout here so that

1279
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:46,808
should let me now if I go through and do

1280
00:58:44,289 --> 00:58:50,199
a debug builds so let me go to the build

1281
00:58:46,809 --> 00:58:53,319
up bat and change that into a TV bug

1282
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:55,389
build if I take the debug build and step

1283
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:57,219
through it now I would like to be able

1284
00:58:55,389 --> 00:58:59,889
to look at where were maybe getting

1285
00:58:57,219 --> 00:59:03,129
these values wrong and see if we can't

1286
00:58:59,889 --> 00:59:04,118
do bug like I said you know I said I

1287
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,099
wouldn't get it right the first time and

1288
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:07,059
I wasn't wrong that's what other times

1289
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:09,119
where you'd like to be wrong you'd like

1290
00:59:07,059 --> 00:59:13,319
to be like oh I guess I did get it right

1291
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:16,650
not so all right so anyway inside here

1292
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:19,179
here's us looking pretty standard

1293
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:20,980
looking at the world the orbit should be

1294
00:59:19,179 --> 00:59:22,118
zero probably at this point because I

1295
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,469
think the center of the simulation is

1296
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:24,460
probably roughly where

1297
00:59:23,469 --> 00:59:26,618
looking at I don't really know if that's

1298
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:29,199
true but let's take a look

1299
00:59:26,619 --> 00:59:31,780
so I right-click and we got the first

1300
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:33,639
step of our solve here so let's take a

1301
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:41,920
look at what these values actually are

1302
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:45,639
so here is camera 0 t what oh sorry

1303
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,780
camera Oh T can't read the difference in

1304
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:49,839
the during though

1305
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:52,000
and here's camera Z so as we expect

1306
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:55,510
because there's no orbit the X component

1307
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,880
of our camera Z is 0 that's exactly what

1308
00:59:55,510 --> 01:00:00,609
we want to see and then we have our

1309
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:02,289
other components here for y&amp;z you know

1310
01:00:00,608 --> 01:00:04,150
it's up a little bit and it's back

1311
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:05,858
because like the wide goes upwards right

1312
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:09,639
so this this is what we would expect

1313
01:00:05,858 --> 01:00:12,009
that all looks reasonable if we look

1314
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:15,039
here our X component of our camera

1315
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:17,200
orientation I'm sorry our cameras

1316
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:21,279
oriented translation so the this place

1317
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:23,469
for the camera which by the way I don't

1318
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,769
know why it's called that because it's

1319
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:29,289
not that out here so that's a little bit

1320
01:00:26,769 --> 01:00:32,108
weird but doesn't matter the extra

1321
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:33,940
motive that's also 0 and that's good and

1322
01:00:32,108 --> 01:00:35,619
you can see that it's got a displacement

1323
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:38,490
that is exactly what we would probably

1324
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:40,750
expect it to be so that's all fine and

1325
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:42,129
so now we'd like to do is go alright

1326
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,780
let's step through and see what we get

1327
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:45,130
so the first thing we're gonna do is

1328
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:47,320
we're gonna compute some of these world

1329
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:48,849
mode values here since we're almost

1330
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:52,769
rector's pretty big I'm just gonna get

1331
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:55,480
the ones we actually want so here's a

1332
01:00:52,769 --> 01:00:58,480
debug camera dolly why I didn't call

1333
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:00,639
this debug camera pan I don't know we

1334
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,969
should have changed that so you know in

1335
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:06,098
here this should actually not be what it

1336
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:08,829
is this should be up here and it should

1337
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:10,690
be called you mode camera pan but we'll

1338
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:12,279
get to that a second so like yet in here

1339
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:14,710
where we're doing camera pan at should

1340
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,630
be debug camera pan in both of these

1341
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:20,108
places and that was just a screw-up on

1342
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:23,440
our part ok so coming back here you can

1343
01:01:20,108 --> 01:01:25,440
see us doing the inner pocket the debug

1344
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,119
camera dolly so that value right here

1345
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,059
should be somewhat close to whatever the

1346
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:33,789
distance should be of this and you know

1347
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:37,900
that looks reasonable you know that

1348
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:42,279
looks like not a totally ridiculous idea

1349
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:44,619
right and so if I was to look at what

1350
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,050
was going on there I you know is this is

1351
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:49,029
are those values actually commensurate

1352
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:54,039
so it's like negative five times

1353
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:57,730
negative five right which is just twenty

1354
01:01:54,039 --> 01:02:02,469
five plus twelve times twelve right so

1355
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:03,969
it's like 169 and hey that's it's after

1356
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:05,409
thirteen yeah so you know this is

1357
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:07,089
exactly the value that we thought you

1358
01:02:05,409 --> 01:02:10,029
know the Pythagorean theorem there right

1359
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:14,170
like you know this square root it is

1360
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:16,330
thirteen so yeah uh so you know looking

1361
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:18,490
at this I just go yeah okay that's a

1362
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:20,259
pretty reasonable camera dolly amount

1363
01:02:18,489 --> 01:02:24,369
because that's exactly what it would

1364
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:26,670
take to put us back at this camera ot so

1365
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:29,519
so far so good that doesn't look like

1366
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:31,599
much of a mistake that looks pretty good

1367
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:33,940
so let's take a look at the two cam

1368
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:36,039
vector our two cam vectors should now

1369
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:39,579
basically be this and it is which is

1370
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:41,110
exactly what we want right so now we

1371
01:02:39,579 --> 01:02:43,539
need to get that residual in the camera

1372
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:44,980
pan it should basically be zero right so

1373
01:02:43,539 --> 01:02:47,650
we should basically have a zero

1374
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:48,490
displacement because we're looking right

1375
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:50,800
at the target

1376
01:02:48,489 --> 01:02:54,129
we're not displaced from zero zero we're

1377
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,450
looking right at zero zero so we should

1378
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:57,099
get basically nothing and that's exactly

1379
01:02:55,449 --> 01:02:59,349
what we get you can see the residual is

1380
01:02:57,099 --> 01:03:00,250
the same as here exactly respect very

1381
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:03,219
very tiny number

1382
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:05,409
that's all looks totally right so now

1383
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:07,509
let's take that camera arm the camera

1384
01:03:05,409 --> 01:03:08,409
arm is just Z right so you can see it

1385
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:12,490
that's what that is

1386
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:14,199
and the planar arm is is just the XY I

1387
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:16,389
can put into that so now we need to do

1388
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:18,879
our eight and two and we need to compute

1389
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:20,440
our camera orbit and camera pitch so our

1390
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,570
first eight and two is say hey let's

1391
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,420
take the X and the y just that planar

1392
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:32,710
portion how you know what's the rotation

1393
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:34,920
around of that thing let's get that in

1394
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,920
here

1395
01:03:37,248 --> 01:03:44,219
all right and then we'll also compute

1396
01:03:40,739 --> 01:03:47,008
what that pitch upward was right and so

1397
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:55,439
you can see us getting some values that

1398
01:03:47,009 --> 01:03:59,130
I guess for Orbitz sake seems about

1399
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:02,099
right it's trying to rotate us 90

1400
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:03,480
degrees this way that is exactly what we

1401
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:06,329
would need to rotate to put ourselves

1402
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,798
into negative Y facing which is exactly

1403
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:10,230
where we are

1404
01:04:07,798 --> 01:04:14,969
pitch wise it's telling us we need to

1405
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:18,748
rotate negative 1.57 that's again that's

1406
01:04:14,969 --> 01:04:20,909
a that's around 1/2 PI right 3.14 so

1407
01:04:18,748 --> 01:04:33,048
it's a little more than that which is

1408
01:04:20,909 --> 01:04:33,048
it's gonna be a little bit that seems a

1409
01:04:33,318 --> 01:04:39,869
little bit odd to me so the X Y one

1410
01:04:37,768 --> 01:04:41,939
seemed about right because if you were

1411
01:04:39,869 --> 01:04:45,960
going to try and rotate you need to

1412
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:50,130
rotate the X thing down to be here but

1413
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:56,210
rotating it to rotate this this part in

1414
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:58,680
order to go upward around the y axis

1415
01:04:56,210 --> 01:05:05,249
no I guess that's right too because it

1416
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:08,518
would be negative to flip it up so those

1417
01:05:05,248 --> 01:05:14,838
both seem relatively plausible the only

1418
01:05:08,518 --> 01:05:14,838
thing I would say is

1419
01:05:19,369 --> 01:05:23,949
is nothing that those both look good

1420
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,190
so that's negative the debug camera

1421
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:34,050
pitch this is the part of saying that

1422
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:35,849
actually seems like that is going the

1423
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:36,960
wrong direction I really do think so

1424
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:40,710
though because if you supply the right

1425
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:47,070
hand rule to the y-axis right it's gonna

1426
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:52,320
pitch it down so I think I actually

1427
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:54,240
didn't do the winding properly there so

1428
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:56,160
although this is not the bug we're

1429
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:59,039
seeing this is a different bug the

1430
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,170
winding is wrong on our pitch and here's

1431
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:04,050
why the winding is wrong so if you

1432
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:06,329
imagine looking at the X Y Z and I wish

1433
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:10,769
I could and I can't really show you my

1434
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:12,110
hands very well on the stream but if you

1435
01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:15,630
imagine doing the right-hand rule

1436
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:16,530
so you curl your right hand around the y

1437
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:21,210
axis

1438
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:24,930
well the z axis is actually the X and

1439
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:29,639
the y axis of the x axis is actually the

1440
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:34,739
Y right so in here when we did debug

1441
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:40,639
camera pitch to me this would actually

1442
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:44,099
be assuming that the the vector started

1443
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:46,710
up on that like these are inverted right

1444
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:51,920
it's assuming that the Z was actually

1445
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:51,920
the Y but it's not right

1446
01:06:52,940 --> 01:07:03,929
so the winding on this is in fact wrong

1447
01:06:56,150 --> 01:07:07,639
and I'm not sure exactly what I want to

1448
01:07:03,929 --> 01:07:07,639
do there to fix that

1449
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:17,529
because there's a lot of ways I could do

1450
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:21,610
it right I could negate the Z for

1451
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:24,370
example but if you think about how this

1452
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:25,720
is starting out so this is totally fine

1453
01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:26,889
because it's going to rotate whatever

1454
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:28,359
vector we end up with it's going to

1455
01:07:26,889 --> 01:07:30,549
rotate it around the Z and that's

1456
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:32,860
totally exactly the same thing that

1457
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:36,880
we're measuring here but this Y rotation

1458
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:38,890
right this Y rotation is the first thing

1459
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,800
that gets applied so it's going to apply

1460
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:44,109
to an X it's gonna apply a Y rotation if

1461
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:47,830
you look at the XY plane formed by the Y

1462
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:51,789
axis it's actually Z is what is the x

1463
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:53,139
axis and y is the y axis so I'm just

1464
01:07:51,789 --> 01:07:56,230
trying to think about how I want to

1465
01:07:53,139 --> 01:08:02,710
measure that part of it it's like you

1466
01:07:56,230 --> 01:08:04,329
know do I want to invert the winding or

1467
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:06,039
do I want to keep the winding the same I

1468
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:08,289
guess I want to say let's keep the

1469
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:14,019
winding the same so what that means is

1470
01:08:08,289 --> 01:08:16,569
that the for the pitch since the z axis

1471
01:08:14,019 --> 01:08:22,739
is actually the X it goes on the bottom

1472
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:25,420
and since the the actual length in the

1473
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:30,369
how big that vector would have been when

1474
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:31,750
it was on the x axis that's actually

1475
01:08:30,369 --> 01:08:36,220
going to be the length of the planar arm

1476
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:43,180
I think this is more what we're actually

1477
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:45,369
looking for here right and we do have a

1478
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:52,150
problem which is the length of the

1479
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:55,119
planar arm is not signed and so we would

1480
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:59,939
like it to have been signed so when it

1481
01:08:55,119 --> 01:09:02,649
crosses over it should so if the Z right

1482
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:04,750
came over the top and back around again

1483
01:09:02,649 --> 01:09:06,250
which we don't actually do in the game

1484
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:08,680
so this is never gonna cause an actual

1485
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:10,449
problem but if we were actually viewing

1486
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:12,400
it from the up the back side looking

1487
01:09:10,449 --> 01:09:16,510
back down so we flipped over and we're

1488
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:19,719
looking like that this would be the

1489
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:21,310
incorrect sign right because we're just

1490
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,079
taking the length of it we don't track

1491
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:25,890
the fact that it had flipped it gone

1492
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:25,890
over here

1493
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:32,920
so we could try to do something more

1494
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:36,219
fancy there right but I don't think we

1495
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:43,118
need to but anyway so I just let's fix

1496
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:46,828
that first and let's try this again all

1497
01:09:43,118 --> 01:09:49,948
right so there is a debug camera dolly

1498
01:09:46,828 --> 01:09:53,439
there's the camera pan orbit and pitch

1499
01:09:49,948 --> 01:10:02,799
so now let's take a look we've got the

1500
01:09:53,439 --> 01:10:07,269
debug camera orbit the pitch with the X

1501
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:11,010
oh crap and it's again it's also it's

1502
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:21,369
inverted because if it started here and

1503
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:23,949
rotated down yeah so so I guess again

1504
01:10:21,368 --> 01:10:25,779
still not really following my own rules

1505
01:10:23,948 --> 01:10:30,339
so we would have to start with the

1506
01:10:25,779 --> 01:10:33,759
vector we had before right we would have

1507
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:37,500
to start with Z pointing upwards and

1508
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:40,270
then again we can make that be correct

1509
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:42,130
so I guess what we had originally was

1510
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:43,989
actually not so bad if this is an X

1511
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:44,800
rotation that would be okay because X

1512
01:10:43,988 --> 01:10:48,939
would be fine

1513
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:53,529
X would be rotating from the Z over to

1514
01:10:48,939 --> 01:10:55,359
the negative Y right and so if you just

1515
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:56,979
put that in here and this was always

1516
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:59,019
gonna be negative this would basically

1517
01:10:56,979 --> 01:11:00,609
preserve the old way we were doing it

1518
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:02,679
right because we did an X rotation not a

1519
01:11:00,609 --> 01:11:04,420
Y rotation if I remember correctly so

1520
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:05,828
that actually would be fine for the way

1521
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:09,429
we were doing it and maybe I should have

1522
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:15,908
done that to not change it alright so

1523
01:11:09,429 --> 01:11:18,908
let's see what we get here all right so

1524
01:11:15,908 --> 01:11:21,670
let's see with the orbit being what it

1525
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:28,000
is and then this being a negative pitch

1526
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:33,219
so if I have the x axis and I'm looking

1527
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,719
at these I guess I can just choose

1528
01:11:33,219 --> 01:11:38,039
whether I negate this or not to whether

1529
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,039
I want the pitch to be negative or not

1530
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:49,560
since the X rotation will rotate towards

1531
01:11:42,989 --> 01:11:52,579
the right-hand rule wise will rotate Y

1532
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,580
into X

1533
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:08,899
then we're always going to sort of have

1534
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:14,000
it yeah it's always gonna be 90 degrees

1535
01:12:08,899 --> 01:12:17,899
off right so the 90 degrees off would

1536
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,250
also would have also flipped that

1537
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:23,059
because we're not starting at the y-axis

1538
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:25,279
either this is a bit of a mind bender I

1539
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:28,940
probably should draw this out again just

1540
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:30,409
to make sure we get that correct because

1541
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:32,989
there's way too many things in there

1542
01:12:30,409 --> 01:12:37,599
that's like okay negative flips like

1543
01:12:32,989 --> 01:12:40,789
either one could happen uh so anyway

1544
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:45,260
yeah let's see so the length of the

1545
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:47,779
planar arm if that's a positive pitch

1546
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:49,430
that should go yeah that's what we would

1547
01:12:47,779 --> 01:12:51,979
expect to see

1548
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:53,510
so let's now we have to debug the rest

1549
01:12:51,979 --> 01:12:59,319
of it because we're still a little bit

1550
01:12:53,510 --> 01:13:02,840
janky here so hold on us again all right

1551
01:12:59,319 --> 01:13:07,130
so now if we hit the right mouse button

1552
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:10,670
what do we get so we're almost right but

1553
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:16,010
we're we've got our orbit wrong it looks

1554
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:18,170
like and you know again that's just a

1555
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:20,360
case of me failing to do this as

1556
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:22,069
meticulous as I should because anything

1557
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:26,809
about it to here the problem we're gonna

1558
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:32,569
have is that this is producing something

1559
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:39,710
after pitching that again is not in the

1560
01:13:32,569 --> 01:13:41,539
x-axis right so let's adjust this debug

1561
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:45,050
camera orbit to assume that what we're

1562
01:13:41,539 --> 01:13:47,989
doing is we're starting along the z-axis

1563
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:50,150
so we take the z axis and we're folding

1564
01:13:47,989 --> 01:13:53,590
it down so now it's pointing along

1565
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:56,569
negative Y right

1566
01:13:53,590 --> 01:14:00,949
instead of X which means it's going to

1567
01:13:56,569 --> 01:14:06,219
be 90 degrees back from where it should

1568
01:14:00,949 --> 01:14:09,109
be right it's it's just 90 degrees it's

1569
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:11,960
it's going to have to rotate an extra 90

1570
01:14:09,109 --> 01:14:15,460
degrees from where this would return it

1571
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,460
was right so you'd imagine

1572
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:26,130
that right would give us the actual

1573
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,810
orbit that we wanted because we need to

1574
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:29,369
do an extra 90 to get from where we

1575
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:31,550
thought we were to where we actually are

1576
01:14:29,369 --> 01:14:34,829
right

1577
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:37,710
we could also because of trigonometric

1578
01:14:34,829 --> 01:14:40,500
identities we could actually fix that

1579
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:45,930
part too but we'll get to that in a

1580
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:48,359
second all right so what have we learned

1581
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:50,450
other than the fact that I need to be

1582
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:52,920
more meticulous about where I'm

1583
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:56,340
conceiving my atan2 is to have started

1584
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:58,380
from that was relatively painless though

1585
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:01,050
and now we do have it working exactly as

1586
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:04,529
we want so now if I hit the right click

1587
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:07,380
I'm in debug mode it puts me exactly

1588
01:15:04,529 --> 01:15:11,130
where we are right this is the game this

1589
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:14,010
is debug mode right so we've solved for

1590
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:16,350
exactly where we should be now I don't

1591
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:19,110
know how we want our rotation to work

1592
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:21,239
right now it works it looks like the

1593
01:15:19,109 --> 01:15:23,969
left-right rotation is not what I want

1594
01:15:21,238 --> 01:15:28,619
it to be so I want the I don't know

1595
01:15:23,969 --> 01:15:31,289
I thought we addressed this before but

1596
01:15:28,619 --> 01:15:33,238
you can see that that's going the wrong

1597
01:15:31,289 --> 01:15:34,979
way so I'm just gonna change the way the

1598
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:42,479
input is and make it be a trackball II

1599
01:15:34,979 --> 01:15:49,019
kind of a thing for now I think so let's

1600
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:52,619
say I do that there we go and so now if

1601
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:55,469
I run it what you can see is I have a

1602
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:58,349
trackball version right and I can zoom

1603
01:15:55,469 --> 01:16:00,359
in and off we go right I go back to the

1604
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:01,140
debug let's see if I can make it work

1605
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:04,289
here

1606
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:05,610
look at that perfect right so we got the

1607
01:16:04,289 --> 01:16:08,789
math just right

1608
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:10,559
my eight am too was too sloppy so we

1609
01:16:08,789 --> 01:16:12,180
didn't quite get it first try but

1610
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,800
otherwise we we got the construction

1611
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:16,230
basically right first try it's just we

1612
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:21,890
we were too sloppy about our 18 to

1613
01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:26,559
origins right so there's virtual

1614
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:28,630
trackball we sort of version of it right

1615
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,580
and we can go in here so now we need to

1616
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:34,210
do is we need to get our pan we get

1617
01:16:30,579 --> 01:16:36,760
panning in there right and so we'd like

1618
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:40,149
to do for panning is we'd like to take

1619
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:41,710
the world mode debug camera pan and we

1620
01:16:40,149 --> 01:16:44,769
like to add something to it

1621
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:47,560
right and we've got two things we can

1622
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:51,520
add to it we've got D Mouse px and D

1623
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:53,469
Mouse py right but we don't know what we

1624
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,989
would actually add there so you know

1625
01:16:53,469 --> 01:16:58,109
think about this for a second

1626
01:16:54,988 --> 01:17:00,789
suppose I want to add something to this

1627
01:16:58,109 --> 01:17:05,829
what do I add like what do I actually do

1628
01:17:00,789 --> 01:17:07,420
to make this work right so the naive

1629
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:10,779
thing would be well I don't know like

1630
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:13,449
maybe I take you know the the pan amount

1631
01:17:10,779 --> 01:17:15,250
that we're doing here and I just say

1632
01:17:13,449 --> 01:17:18,699
well you know I've got an x and y so

1633
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:20,800
there's the D aspx and the D mouse P Y

1634
01:17:18,699 --> 01:17:24,399
and well you know just add those in

1635
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:27,070
right that's kind of the amateur-hour

1636
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:30,219
way to do it right and what ends up

1637
01:17:27,069 --> 01:17:33,699
happening if I do that is when I go into

1638
01:17:30,219 --> 01:17:35,199
this mode I can pan right and you know

1639
01:17:33,699 --> 01:17:38,349
all right it's it's kind of

1640
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:40,750
counterintuitive because the axes are

1641
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:44,050
not aligned the way that you would think

1642
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:45,250
that they would be right so it's a

1643
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:47,619
little bit weird but you might think

1644
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:49,659
it's fine and so maybe you just do

1645
01:17:47,619 --> 01:17:51,939
something like this right you know I

1646
01:17:49,659 --> 01:17:53,710
invert these two again just showing you

1647
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:58,238
kind of what people often do and it's

1648
01:17:53,710 --> 01:18:01,689
crappy you know like just to give you

1649
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:03,849
some perspective so I go into debug mode

1650
01:18:01,689 --> 01:18:05,079
and I say all right let's let's move it

1651
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,789
around and now it seems like it's

1652
01:18:05,079 --> 01:18:09,039
working pretty good right like okay

1653
01:18:06,789 --> 01:18:10,810
that's that's great you know now I can

1654
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:12,039
kind of pan the camera around and maybe

1655
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:14,560
I needed to be a little bit faster than

1656
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:15,819
that or something and so maybe I can do

1657
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,710
something about that but for the moment

1658
01:18:15,819 --> 01:18:19,719
it seems fine right but it's not fine

1659
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:23,920
because what actually happens is when we

1660
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:25,390
actually go in here and change the

1661
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,300
orientation of the camera like let's say

1662
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:30,489
here now when we go to pan it's totally

1663
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:32,920
wack right because it's just using the

1664
01:18:30,488 --> 01:18:34,149
world coordinate space right so it's

1665
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,100
just it's totally busted

1666
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:37,960
I've actually played like bad unity

1667
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:39,920
games that have stuff like this in the

1668
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:42,698
that the actual player has to do

1669
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:46,550
with right and stuff like this anyway

1670
01:18:42,698 --> 01:18:48,079
sort of a separation but anyway so the

1671
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:50,119
question is what do we actually need to

1672
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:52,130
use here to make us move in the space of

1673
01:18:50,119 --> 01:18:54,439
that the camera is looking at what how

1674
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:57,800
do we do that right well we know what

1675
01:18:54,439 --> 01:19:00,439
the cameras XY coordinate XY axes are

1676
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,719
because those are actually told to us in

1677
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:05,629
the world mode right we actually know

1678
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:08,750
what those what those are we compute

1679
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:11,119
them right and store them right here

1680
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:13,279
right these these get columns this is

1681
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:14,539
the x axis of the camera this is the y

1682
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:17,420
axis of the camera and this is the z

1683
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:19,939
axis of the camera so if we want to

1684
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:21,289
again and I was sort of like I didn't

1685
01:19:19,939 --> 01:19:24,229
know if I wanted to move this down there

1686
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:26,060
or not but I you know at this point now

1687
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:28,789
it's pretty clear I want those

1688
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:31,580
computations so what I'm gonna do is put

1689
01:19:28,789 --> 01:19:33,170
that right here effectively right so I'm

1690
01:19:31,579 --> 01:19:34,729
gonna put that in here where we adjust

1691
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:37,730
the debug stuff that'll be adjusted

1692
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:39,709
right here and so what I'm going to do

1693
01:19:37,729 --> 01:19:42,019
is just use those things that we

1694
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:44,060
actually created now I can do that

1695
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:46,699
pretty easily by actually just making

1696
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:50,120
these be things that we'd get out

1697
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:53,599
earlier right so now we have the camera

1698
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:56,630
X Y Z and then down where I actually use

1699
01:19:53,600 --> 01:20:03,320
them I'll just actually use camera X

1700
01:19:56,630 --> 01:20:06,440
camera Y camera Z but think about it so

1701
01:20:03,319 --> 01:20:08,269
now if I know for the cameras frame of

1702
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:10,549
reference you know what it's looking at

1703
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:12,920
the world through if I know what x axis

1704
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:14,890
it thinks it's looking at and what Y

1705
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:20,690
acts if things look at that's the screen

1706
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:26,989
right so if I just multiply the X motion

1707
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:29,389
here right by the cameras x-axis and I

1708
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:31,009
multiply the Y and again I want to

1709
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:31,820
invert this cuz I believe the mouse I'll

1710
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:33,590
actually I don't know which direction

1711
01:20:31,819 --> 01:20:34,729
our mouse goes I'll leave it this way

1712
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:36,409
because I don't really remember which

1713
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:40,279
way we had the mouse coordinates come in

1714
01:20:36,409 --> 01:20:43,369
sorry it's down right now I've created

1715
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:45,529
an X Y space that actually matches what

1716
01:20:43,369 --> 01:20:47,719
the camera is actually seeing and that's

1717
01:20:45,529 --> 01:20:50,119
step one to getting our pan to work

1718
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:50,329
right so let me show you what that looks

1719
01:20:50,119 --> 01:20:53,599
like

1720
01:20:50,329 --> 01:20:57,050
right here's that pan

1721
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:59,750
right and it looks like yeah so so

1722
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:01,670
that's perfect right it's counter what

1723
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:03,469
we want but that's actually what we

1724
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:05,929
would expect and the reason for that is

1725
01:21:03,469 --> 01:21:07,908
this is a displacement of the camera so

1726
01:21:05,929 --> 01:21:10,849
it's actually the opposite displacement

1727
01:21:07,908 --> 01:21:14,328
it's moving the camera in that direction

1728
01:21:10,849 --> 01:21:17,300
right so I believe that is actually what

1729
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:19,309
we expect although does that mean our Y

1730
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:25,940
is flipped let me see

1731
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:40,460
do we flip the Y what is that that's

1732
01:21:25,939 --> 01:21:41,089
Mouse clip space Mouse P so that's oh

1733
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:43,819
yeah we do

1734
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:45,679
there it is I'm like that doesn't really

1735
01:21:43,819 --> 01:21:48,078
make sense I'm like we should have found

1736
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:50,840
a clip the way I should have to should

1737
01:21:48,078 --> 01:21:53,448
have had to have inverted the Y for that

1738
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:58,789
to be correct but okay we did so that's

1739
01:21:53,448 --> 01:22:02,000
fine right all right so since again this

1740
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:03,170
is a displacement of the camera I'm

1741
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,090
trying to think if that makes sense or

1742
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:07,039
not because it's a little weird that it

1743
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:09,520
was I would have excited to move exactly

1744
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:09,519
a long

1745
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:22,470
nope that's correct so here's why this

1746
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:24,539
is correct if we're moving if I move the

1747
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:26,730
kit if I move the mouse this way the

1748
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:28,500
camera should move along its x-axis

1749
01:22:26,729 --> 01:22:28,889
that's a negative X motion with the

1750
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,239
mouse

1751
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:32,460
we should mean negative X emotion which

1752
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:35,819
is this direction right and that's

1753
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:38,100
exactly what I see I happen to want the

1754
01:22:35,819 --> 01:22:41,279
semantics to be like grab and pull the

1755
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:43,410
screen around you know so that's where

1756
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:48,719
the negation comes in so we're all good

1757
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:51,239
right okay so what I want to do now is I

1758
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:53,400
want to say all right I'd like this to

1759
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:56,460
also be proportional to the dolly

1760
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:58,619
because as we're closer in I want to

1761
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:01,619
move less and when we're further away I

1762
01:22:58,619 --> 01:23:03,180
want to move more right so what I'd like

1763
01:23:01,619 --> 01:23:05,220
to do is the same thing I did with zoom

1764
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:07,260
speed here which is to say that pan

1765
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:10,380
speed should be proportional to this and

1766
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:12,510
so we'll just do pan speed times the

1767
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:14,460
dolly right and just to let you know why

1768
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:16,860
if I don't recompile so we do the old

1769
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:19,850
version I can show you what that means

1770
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:22,949
so here's me panning around right and

1771
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:25,620
now if i zoom in you can see that I pan

1772
01:23:22,949 --> 01:23:28,409
way more when I'm in and if I'm way out

1773
01:23:25,619 --> 01:23:30,300
I pan almost not at all right that's

1774
01:23:28,409 --> 01:23:32,189
just not what we want we want a pan

1775
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,279
proportional to what we're seeing so

1776
01:23:32,189 --> 01:23:37,710
that it feels more like we're moving the

1777
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:41,849
thing uniformly regardless of how far a

1778
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:44,220
zoomed in we are right so now if I do

1779
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:46,470
this you can see it moves a lot out here

1780
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:49,920
if i zoom in it moves significantly less

1781
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:51,570
right proportionally still way too fast

1782
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,279
so I think what we want to do is maybe

1783
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:55,619
knock that down a bit again we can just

1784
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:57,960
tune this to our own personal preference

1785
01:23:55,619 --> 01:24:00,989
about how fast we want the camera to pan

1786
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:02,369
there's no right answer there so we can

1787
01:24:00,989 --> 01:24:05,010
just say all right let's say we're out

1788
01:24:02,369 --> 01:24:07,399
here still looks a little too fast for

1789
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:10,409
my taste I'm gonna go with an 0.5 maybe

1790
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:12,149
don't ask me why this was multiplied on

1791
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:19,170
the other side I tend to put scalars on

1792
01:24:12,149 --> 01:24:22,549
the Left I don't know I didn't hear I'm

1793
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:22,550
scared on the left of variables

1794
01:24:24,279 --> 01:24:28,750
so that seems fine

1795
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,750
right

1796
01:24:35,979 --> 01:24:46,218
no concerns they're pretty happy with

1797
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:49,579
that yeah so one of the things that's

1798
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:51,319
weird is yeah for the picking

1799
01:24:49,579 --> 01:24:54,289
you'll note that picking only is

1800
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:55,969
activated or the drawing anyway of the

1801
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:58,279
picking is only activated when we're in

1802
01:24:55,969 --> 01:24:59,989
the edit mode we probably want this to

1803
01:24:58,279 --> 01:25:01,158
be active all the time because I'd like

1804
01:24:59,988 --> 01:25:05,000
to also have a thing where we can focus

1805
01:25:01,158 --> 01:25:07,369
on a particular part right but anyway

1806
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,500
it's totally fine so we're in good shape

1807
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:11,149
now and I can always suit back to where

1808
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:12,770
I am and so now we should be able to

1809
01:25:11,149 --> 01:25:14,509
really use the camera for what we were

1810
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:16,820
intentionally what we're going to do it

1811
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:17,869
it's nothing to do it with it which is

1812
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:20,269
like you know when we're in some

1813
01:25:17,869 --> 01:25:23,090
situation we can now right-click and

1814
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:25,670
actually inspect really what's going on

1815
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:29,090
in 3d much more cleanly than we were

1816
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:30,560
able to do so before and so very

1817
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:32,150
specifically what we want to be able to

1818
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,010
do at this point is we'd like to be able

1819
01:25:32,149 --> 01:25:36,198
to now start addressing these kind of

1820
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:38,810
errors like I said we've got to get this

1821
01:25:36,198 --> 01:25:41,569
fixed so that we can use more

1822
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:43,010
effectively our sprite cards in a way

1823
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:46,639
that inserts them into the environment

1824
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:49,699
well and again I'm just thinking to

1825
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:55,159
myself you know I would I would like to

1826
01:25:49,698 --> 01:25:58,428
- I would like to try that method of

1827
01:25:55,158 --> 01:26:00,589
doing a Y displacement and actually not

1828
01:25:58,429 --> 01:26:02,739
having an easy bias in there at all just

1829
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:06,469
to see whether that magically ends up

1830
01:26:02,738 --> 01:26:09,829
giving us what we want I don't know if

1831
01:26:06,469 --> 01:26:12,619
it will it probably won't but that's at

1832
01:26:09,829 --> 01:26:15,340
least something we can try to see

1833
01:26:12,619 --> 01:26:18,439
whether that gets us closer to

1834
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:22,179
acceptable I will say to like man I'm

1835
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:22,178
really liking the look like

1836
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:33,350
it's just I think we've got a little bit

1837
01:26:29,569 --> 01:26:35,630
more to do on our lighting and then the

1838
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:36,530
this fixture strike cards it's really

1839
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:39,020
looking nice

1840
01:26:36,529 --> 01:26:41,259
like I'm really liking the aesthetics

1841
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:43,429
now and that's really important to me

1842
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:44,929
again I'm an engine programmer not a

1843
01:26:43,429 --> 01:26:47,449
game designer don't care about the game

1844
01:26:44,929 --> 01:26:49,069
design it's not my thing but the

1845
01:26:47,448 --> 01:26:50,839
aesthetics is important right that's

1846
01:26:49,069 --> 01:26:53,269
part of my job as engine programmer is

1847
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:57,140
to make the engine make the art look

1848
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:59,989
good right nobody likes an engine

1849
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:01,880
programmer who makes crappy systems that

1850
01:26:59,988 --> 01:27:04,879
make the art look lousy right that's no

1851
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:06,500
good you need to understand how your

1852
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,690
programming affects the aesthetics of

1853
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:13,069
the things on the screen and like I

1854
01:27:08,689 --> 01:27:15,619
really try to like show you how to dig

1855
01:27:13,069 --> 01:27:17,269
into things like that all right I don't

1856
01:27:15,619 --> 01:27:22,429
know how much time I have I think I've

1857
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:24,679
got 15 minutes maybe left so the thing

1858
01:27:22,429 --> 01:27:28,429
that I said about sprites figuring out

1859
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:33,949
the alignment of them I figure that's

1860
01:27:28,429 --> 01:27:36,109
not actually that hard for us to do to

1861
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:44,839
start with so let's just play around

1862
01:27:36,109 --> 01:27:46,670
with it a little bit and there's a

1863
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:48,110
couple things that are involved with it

1864
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:50,779
that are a little harder to do we can

1865
01:27:48,109 --> 01:27:53,179
skip those for starters but just in the

1866
01:27:50,779 --> 01:27:57,229
next 15 minutes I should be able to do a

1867
01:27:53,179 --> 01:28:00,140
little bit of that sprite adjustment

1868
01:27:57,229 --> 01:28:04,189
right so let's start down that path

1869
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:06,800
again that's in the entity code which is

1870
01:28:04,189 --> 01:28:09,710
where we draw all of our sprites you can

1871
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,360
see that happening in here so as we come

1872
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:16,010
through this piece of code you can see

1873
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:18,799
us grabbing a texture handle this is

1874
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:20,690
just to highlight so this is not this

1875
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,390
part is not important this is our

1876
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:26,149
alignment point code so we're only

1877
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:28,550
really talking about this part here and

1878
01:28:26,149 --> 01:28:30,289
what you can see us doing in here is

1879
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:31,789
we've got this push sprite call

1880
01:28:30,289 --> 01:28:34,399
happening and the sprite values for

1881
01:28:31,789 --> 01:28:37,760
upright are coming in there

1882
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:39,738
so really the sprite values for upright

1883
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:44,090
is the part that we actually care

1884
01:28:39,738 --> 01:28:45,408
about this align P is the part that's

1885
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:46,699
telling us how it's supposed to be

1886
01:28:45,408 --> 01:28:57,049
aligned with the point that's come

1887
01:28:46,698 --> 01:29:01,998
that's being input right so yeah so

1888
01:28:57,050 --> 01:29:03,949
let's do the hacked version first so

1889
01:29:01,998 --> 01:29:05,420
what you can see happening here and I'm

1890
01:29:03,948 --> 01:29:07,819
gonna walk you through the step by step

1891
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:09,368
we're not gonna do this what I'm about

1892
01:29:07,819 --> 01:29:13,219
to do is not gonna be the final answer

1893
01:29:09,368 --> 01:29:14,598
next weekend we'll do that right now

1894
01:29:13,219 --> 01:29:15,769
we're just gonna play with this a little

1895
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:20,569
bit to get some information about

1896
01:29:15,769 --> 01:29:22,190
whether it's plausible for us okay so

1897
01:29:20,569 --> 01:29:24,018
what you can see happening here is we

1898
01:29:22,189 --> 01:29:25,698
start by saying what's the up Vector of

1899
01:29:24,019 --> 01:29:28,849
the world and the up Vector of the world

1900
01:29:25,698 --> 01:29:30,828
is the z axis right what's the up Vector

1901
01:29:28,849 --> 01:29:32,840
of the camera and that's totally

1902
01:29:30,828 --> 01:29:33,920
dependent on the camera pitch right

1903
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,090
whatever the pitch of the camera is

1904
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:39,190
that's what it is

1905
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:42,498
so right then we have the x and y axes

1906
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:45,710
and we know that the x axis is just

1907
01:29:42,498 --> 01:29:48,109
gonna be the camera doesn't rotate in

1908
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:50,899
our game right so the x axis is always

1909
01:29:48,109 --> 01:29:53,238
just the cameras X the Y axis on the

1910
01:29:50,899 --> 01:29:55,238
other hand is something we're gonna so

1911
01:29:53,238 --> 01:29:57,109
that's what sticks the card up straight

1912
01:29:55,238 --> 01:29:58,788
we're saying we're gonna use an

1913
01:29:57,109 --> 01:30:00,469
interpolation parameter that you can

1914
01:29:58,788 --> 01:30:02,268
specify and we're gonna use that

1915
01:30:00,469 --> 01:30:04,309
interpolation parameter to kind of like

1916
01:30:02,269 --> 01:30:07,248
fold like we're gonna sort of fold it

1917
01:30:04,309 --> 01:30:11,288
down a little bit right so that's again

1918
01:30:07,248 --> 01:30:15,800
what gives us that that lean down effect

1919
01:30:11,288 --> 01:30:17,868
then we compute this Z bias I don't care

1920
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:21,980
about that at the moment because we're

1921
01:30:17,868 --> 01:30:24,009
just not using it right so what am I do

1922
01:30:21,979 --> 01:30:29,419
here is I'm gonna take this out for now

1923
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:31,670
right and I'm pretty sure that I can I

1924
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:34,219
don't think we use that anywhere

1925
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:36,618
I think we're setting the Z bias to zero

1926
01:30:34,219 --> 01:30:38,210
right now and then you can see that's

1927
01:30:36,618 --> 01:30:39,859
just it's just not a problem right it's

1928
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:42,590
just it's drawing the same stuff it was

1929
01:30:39,859 --> 01:30:46,308
before which is what we expect so that's

1930
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:48,860
good so we then come down and say let's

1931
01:30:46,309 --> 01:30:50,748
produce the X actual X&amp;Y axis you can

1932
01:30:48,859 --> 01:30:52,698
see us multiplying out the dimensions

1933
01:30:50,748 --> 01:30:53,359
here and then you can see is producing

1934
01:30:52,698 --> 01:30:56,689
this baseball

1935
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:58,639
we're using the alignment X to align

1936
01:30:56,689 --> 01:31:01,639
along the x-axis that won't cause any

1937
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:04,220
abrasion this is the one that will using

1938
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:08,570
the align Y to go along the the the y

1939
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:11,270
axis so what I'm proposing right is that

1940
01:31:08,569 --> 01:31:16,039
we don't do that what I'm proposing we

1941
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:17,420
do is use the world y axis right now I

1942
01:31:16,039 --> 01:31:19,369
don't know if we have that in the render

1943
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:23,359
group I'm gonna jump over to the render

1944
01:31:19,369 --> 01:31:25,130
group here and just see if we got it

1945
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:26,839
so we don't actually have that but

1946
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:29,180
that's okay for now I'm just gonna say

1947
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:31,100
look we know it's the z-axis sorry we

1948
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:33,789
know it's the y axis right now so to

1949
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:37,250
move the align Y along the y axis

1950
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:39,829
temporarily and we'll add that in to the

1951
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:41,659
to our render group if that turns out to

1952
01:31:39,829 --> 01:31:46,010
be what we actually use so that you can

1953
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:47,869
adjust it as necessary now that Y axis

1954
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:53,810
right is pointing the other direction so

1955
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:56,809
the align py is telling us how like far

1956
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:58,250
we would need to move to like we're

1957
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:58,670
doing a subtract there this is what I'm

1958
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:02,359
saying

1959
01:31:58,670 --> 01:32:06,980
so I'm I guess if I think about how we

1960
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:10,369
would position that it means that the

1961
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:12,259
minimum position we need to go backwards

1962
01:32:10,369 --> 01:32:14,329
along X thus far and backwards along

1963
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:20,690
with that far so that's how far in it is

1964
01:32:14,329 --> 01:32:22,359
that means we would need to displace a

1965
01:32:20,689 --> 01:32:26,029
[Music]

1966
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:29,329
long- Y if I'm not mistaken meaning

1967
01:32:26,029 --> 01:32:34,759
towards the camera to make that

1968
01:32:29,329 --> 01:32:38,300
adjustment right and so that should

1969
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:42,230
displace things inward I would think

1970
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:45,260
right and I'm not 100% sure about that

1971
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:47,689
so we'll see ok so I'm gonna start

1972
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:49,250
playing with this and see where we can

1973
01:32:47,689 --> 01:32:50,449
get again we're just just playing around

1974
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:51,859
so you don't have much time with me

1975
01:32:50,449 --> 01:32:54,649
episode so I'm not gonna do anything too

1976
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:57,710
fancy so if I go to alignment points

1977
01:32:54,649 --> 01:33:00,679
here and I'm gonna adjust the alignment

1978
01:32:57,710 --> 01:33:03,649
of like this thing so I'm gonna move

1979
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:07,329
this so that it's default alignment it's

1980
01:33:03,649 --> 01:33:07,329
like 50/50 right

1981
01:33:09,969 --> 01:33:17,050
and that looks like it's moving it the

1982
01:33:13,639 --> 01:33:21,109
wrong direction if that makes sense

1983
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:23,869
that's moving it forward which I don't

1984
01:33:21,109 --> 01:33:25,939
think is what I wanted now the other

1985
01:33:23,868 --> 01:33:29,089
problem I have is the distance of this

1986
01:33:25,939 --> 01:33:32,569
is also wrong because this doesn't this

1987
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:34,369
world dim isn't being respected here so

1988
01:33:32,569 --> 01:33:37,158
I'm also gonna I'm gonna throw in the

1989
01:33:34,368 --> 01:33:42,339
world dim why to correct for that so I'm

1990
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:42,339
gonna say that that's in here let's say

1991
01:33:44,349 --> 01:33:51,199
all right I don't want this head in the

1992
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,639
way at the immediate moment so what I'm

1993
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:55,549
gonna do is I'm going to turn off the

1994
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:57,889
alignment point for that so I'm gonna

1995
01:33:55,550 --> 01:34:00,020
say look at the head out of there right

1996
01:33:57,889 --> 01:34:01,909
and we would go back to the game camera

1997
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:04,219
so here we are in the game camera blow

1998
01:34:01,908 --> 01:34:08,448
that out to full screen this is our a

1999
01:34:04,219 --> 01:34:10,309
little dude right hopalong and looking

2000
01:34:08,448 --> 01:34:12,710
at where that sprite is let's see if

2001
01:34:10,309 --> 01:34:15,559
this alignment now makes sense right and

2002
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:17,059
it sure does look like it it kind of

2003
01:34:15,559 --> 01:34:19,340
makes sense right so if we put it right

2004
01:34:17,059 --> 01:34:20,869
in the middle which is where we that's

2005
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:25,010
where we would kind of expect that

2006
01:34:20,868 --> 01:34:30,170
sprite to stick roughly and then I

2007
01:34:25,010 --> 01:34:32,179
adjust the top of head part right I

2008
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:34,309
adjust the top of head part to be like

2009
01:34:32,179 --> 01:34:38,658
right where I think that should be I'll

2010
01:34:34,309 --> 01:34:41,420
turn it back to bases neck and then I

2011
01:34:38,658 --> 01:34:43,098
adjust the hero head to have an

2012
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:51,819
alignment point some default alignment

2013
01:34:43,099 --> 01:34:54,409
point that goes to the parent right yeah

2014
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:57,078
and so then I adjust it so it's on the

2015
01:34:54,408 --> 01:35:00,500
head roughly and I don't know if these

2016
01:34:57,078 --> 01:35:02,269
sizes are what they should be you know I

2017
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:05,868
don't know what the size of the head

2018
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:08,840
should be really but we can play with

2019
01:35:05,868 --> 01:35:10,460
that stuff later so let's suppose I get

2020
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:13,510
all that in there and I'm like alright

2021
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:13,510
that seems about right

2022
01:35:13,779 --> 01:35:19,719
alright so now what happens well I'm

2023
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,719
gonna hop along right

2024
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:30,740
so it looks like we get a little bit of

2025
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:31,939
a tree penetration on this hop but I

2026
01:35:30,739 --> 01:35:36,170
think that's actually cuz the hop is

2027
01:35:31,939 --> 01:35:39,379
wrong the hop should really be higher

2028
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:43,340
and and like here's what's looking at

2029
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:45,529
the hop the hop doesn't actually hop up

2030
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:49,190
in Z like it should it's actually

2031
01:35:45,529 --> 01:35:54,679
hopping in Y which is wrong so the hop

2032
01:35:49,189 --> 01:35:58,429
is actually just wrong but that sorting

2033
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:59,150
sure looks good right that sorting looks

2034
01:35:58,430 --> 01:36:02,360
real good

2035
01:35:59,149 --> 01:36:05,059
to me I don't know about how you folks

2036
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:07,750
feel about it but I'm pretty psyched

2037
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:11,270
about that that bodes very well I think

2038
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:13,010
so I feel like if we solve some more

2039
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:17,240
explicit equations about projecting

2040
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:20,480
those alignment points we may just be in

2041
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:23,630
the money that made us be that just made

2042
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:25,819
may be just fine right now on the

2043
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:28,400
hopping front yeah like that part the

2044
01:36:25,819 --> 01:36:33,559
hop should go up should be displacing

2045
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:35,929
the entities in Y and it's not at the

2046
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:37,880
moment and I don't really know why but

2047
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:41,030
that's great so I think that's all good

2048
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:42,319
I hadn't saved those out look we're

2049
01:36:41,029 --> 01:36:44,689
gonna have to go through and do all

2050
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:46,819
those and then we can also attach the

2051
01:36:44,689 --> 01:36:49,460
bodies to the these orphans and stuff as

2052
01:36:46,819 --> 01:36:53,509
well and the cats and all that stuff so

2053
01:36:49,460 --> 01:37:00,710
that will be good I think we're in good

2054
01:36:53,510 --> 01:37:02,480
shape all right and again looking at

2055
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:04,520
that so the reason that's clipping in

2056
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:06,109
right now I think is cuz this hop is

2057
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:08,510
actually wrong and the debug camera is

2058
01:37:06,109 --> 01:37:11,149
what told us that right the hop is

2059
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:15,760
supposed to be going up and down right

2060
01:37:11,149 --> 01:37:15,759
but right now it's not doing that right

2061
01:37:20,409 --> 01:37:25,639
right the hop is going backwards hop

2062
01:37:22,909 --> 01:37:27,889
supposed to be going in Z Y in the hop

2063
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:30,950
isn't going in Z I don't actually know

2064
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:34,039
probably old-school ideas about how the

2065
01:37:30,949 --> 01:37:36,500
2d stuff was working is really why

2066
01:37:34,039 --> 01:37:38,510
that's happening so if I go and fix that

2067
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:42,890
so I'm wondering if we get an

2068
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:44,930
improvement here so there's some code in

2069
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:54,619
here for that sort of thing you can see

2070
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:57,890
this sort of nonsense here I don't

2071
01:37:54,619 --> 01:38:07,729
actually see quite what this is doing

2072
01:37:57,890 --> 01:38:10,940
what's the ATT there for entity P a so

2073
01:38:07,729 --> 01:38:15,049
yeah I mean that's just totally broken

2074
01:38:10,939 --> 01:38:24,589
right like it's it's actually it's

2075
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:32,329
actually always not that right so I you

2076
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:36,400
know I feel like this is what should

2077
01:38:32,329 --> 01:38:39,319
have been happening there probably right

2078
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:40,879
and really I don't know that I like the

2079
01:38:39,319 --> 01:38:43,039
fact that this is actually displacing

2080
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:51,890
the entity P per se because I kind of

2081
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:54,939
wanted to really more displace yeah why

2082
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:54,940
is that going underneath

2083
01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:02,610
yeah I don't really remember how this

2084
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:08,180
code was supposed to work at all by the

2085
01:39:02,609 --> 01:39:08,179
way don't hold that against me

2086
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:14,250
but that's how the hopping should

2087
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:15,500
actually be working and man that's nice

2088
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:18,779
and clean

2089
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:23,039
that's that looks great let's see how we

2090
01:39:18,779 --> 01:39:24,389
do on the stairs we got that we got to

2091
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:26,279
set the rest of our alignment points up

2092
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:35,660
we'll do that soon I'd like to do that

2093
01:39:26,279 --> 01:39:35,659
so it can look cool yeah just it's great

2094
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:45,810
oh man yeah this engines looking nice I

2095
01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:52,869
still think our import pipe is a little

2096
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:54,190
borked but we're getting there right

2097
01:39:52,869 --> 01:39:56,349
we're gonna do all the alignment points

2098
01:39:54,189 --> 01:39:57,519
we'll see how it is and then we'll clean

2099
01:39:56,350 --> 01:40:00,300
up we'll clean up anything that's broken

2100
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,300
and we do that

2101
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:31,090
all right that's a good place to call

2102
01:40:27,819 --> 01:40:33,039
for today and again we're not quite done

2103
01:40:31,090 --> 01:40:35,800
with that that code is a little janky

2104
01:40:33,039 --> 01:40:37,449
right now so we're gonna want to make

2105
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:40,600
that code you know tune that up a little

2106
01:40:37,449 --> 01:40:42,250
bit but that confirms to me that you

2107
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:44,430
know overcomplicating the problem is not

2108
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:46,630
necessary I think we can just use that

2109
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:50,070
technique of spanning those things out

2110
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:50,069
and I think it'll be good

2111
01:41:23,479 --> 01:41:26,629
[Music]

2112
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:45,439
oh did I really okay sorry about the

2113
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:45,440
label my bad I will fix that

2114
01:41:51,689 --> 01:42:03,029
or I'll try to fix that I'd actually

2115
01:41:53,430 --> 01:42:10,010
know how to fix some of that stuff is

2116
01:42:03,029 --> 01:42:10,009
that better hopefully maybe possibly

2117
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:26,330
are we gonna switch to remedy for

2118
01:42:18,649 --> 01:42:28,789
handmade hero soon um so I don't know

2119
01:42:26,329 --> 01:42:30,470
when we will switch to it there's still

2120
01:42:28,789 --> 01:42:32,239
some things that aren't quite right in

2121
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:34,579
it and I'm a little worried about using

2122
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:36,649
it on streem because it still has some

2123
01:42:34,579 --> 01:42:40,010
bugs that like make the debug inspection

2124
01:42:36,649 --> 01:42:43,129
wrong or whatever and so I'm okay kind

2125
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:46,070
of dogfooding that when I have tons of

2126
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:47,739
time to work on stuff like when I'm

2127
01:42:46,069 --> 01:42:50,149
working eight hours a day on something

2128
01:42:47,739 --> 01:42:51,590
cuz I want to get it better so I'm

2129
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:53,719
trying it and I find those things I just

2130
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:55,760
report them unhand me here when we only

2131
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:58,789
have two hours I don't know that I

2132
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:01,520
really want to do that so I'm just

2133
01:42:58,789 --> 01:43:03,409
waiting since a little more solid

2134
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,030
there's not many problems yet left of

2135
01:43:03,409 --> 01:43:08,000
that nature but there's definitely some

2136
01:43:05,029 --> 01:43:10,340
and so until it's like more reliable

2137
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,689
about showing you know stepping the code

2138
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:21,079
and showing the right stuff it's just

2139
01:43:11,689 --> 01:43:28,509
it's a little bit off and so you know so

2140
01:43:21,079 --> 01:43:28,510
we will but yeah

2141
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:44,349
shahuri johansson says one of the

2142
01:43:42,788 --> 01:43:45,849
reasons i became briefly enthusiastic

2143
01:43:44,349 --> 01:43:47,380
about wynn debug preview is the ability

2144
01:43:45,849 --> 01:43:49,239
to record a trace or a running program

2145
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:51,309
and then send that trace to someone else

2146
01:43:49,238 --> 01:43:52,629
and they can look at the exact debug

2147
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:54,820
session you were looking at rather than

2148
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:56,920
having to reproduce a bug spending

2149
01:43:54,819 --> 01:43:58,149
possibly a long period of time to me

2150
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,529
that sounds like a silver bullet way to

2151
01:43:58,149 --> 01:44:02,109
reproduce a bug can you think of any

2152
01:43:59,529 --> 01:44:03,670
reason why we're on to conclude that the

2153
01:44:02,109 --> 01:44:10,598
feature is a Siller silver bullet for

2154
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:12,550
reproducing bugs um I guess I don't know

2155
01:44:10,599 --> 01:44:18,400
what the term silver bullet means in

2156
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:21,360
this case I so it does seem like a good

2157
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:24,549
feature but silver bullet I don't know

2158
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:26,920
the problem is that usually you have two

2159
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:28,860
kinds of bugs bugs that are easy to

2160
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:32,288
repro and bugs that are hard to repro

2161
01:44:28,859 --> 01:44:33,609
easy to repro bugs there is still some

2162
01:44:32,288 --> 01:44:35,349
benefit to something like this because

2163
01:44:33,609 --> 01:44:38,229
hey I don't have to send you like a

2164
01:44:35,349 --> 01:44:40,090
buildable version of the thing or you

2165
01:44:38,229 --> 01:44:41,229
know whatever I'll say the art assets to

2166
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:42,578
reproduce it or something I can just

2167
01:44:41,229 --> 01:44:47,618
record the trace and maybe that works

2168
01:44:42,578 --> 01:44:49,679
right so there's something to be said

2169
01:44:47,618 --> 01:44:56,288
for that

2170
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:58,569
but it's limited for hard to repro bugs

2171
01:44:56,288 --> 01:45:01,899
I don't know that it helps you at all

2172
01:44:58,569 --> 01:45:03,939
because hard to repro bugs are just hard

2173
01:45:01,899 --> 01:45:05,948
to get repro cases for at all so what

2174
01:45:03,939 --> 01:45:08,738
are the chances that you happen to turn

2175
01:45:05,948 --> 01:45:12,219
debug recording on when the bug happened

2176
01:45:08,738 --> 01:45:14,678
probably pretty low and so the problem

2177
01:45:12,219 --> 01:45:18,899
is unless the debug recording is always

2178
01:45:14,679 --> 01:45:21,219
on and just ubiquitous and just works I

2179
01:45:18,899 --> 01:45:24,429
don't think it's really a silver bullet

2180
01:45:21,219 --> 01:45:26,198
right and windy bugs recording is

2181
01:45:24,429 --> 01:45:30,578
definitely not an always-on kind of

2182
01:45:26,198 --> 01:45:32,649
feature so I would say at the moment the

2183
01:45:30,578 --> 01:45:34,538
closest thing to a repro Silver Bullet

2184
01:45:32,649 --> 01:45:36,129
is probably something more like what we

2185
01:45:34,538 --> 01:45:37,538
have in handmade hero where you could

2186
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:39,520
just leave it on all the time if you

2187
01:45:37,538 --> 01:45:43,328
wanted to where it just records user

2188
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:45,039
input and can play it back directly that

2189
01:45:43,328 --> 01:45:48,759
you could afford to leave on all the

2190
01:45:45,038 --> 01:45:51,670
time and if you extended that to do some

2191
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:53,440
recording to try and help you make it so

2192
01:45:51,670 --> 01:45:54,310
that runs would be more exactly repro

2193
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:57,819
able

2194
01:45:54,310 --> 01:46:01,630
maybe that would work but again it's

2195
01:45:57,819 --> 01:46:05,049
just not until like the recording is

2196
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:06,819
ubiquitous always on and free I don't

2197
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:08,230
think it really changes the equation

2198
01:46:06,819 --> 01:46:10,840
that much because the hard part about

2199
01:46:08,229 --> 01:46:13,479
hard to repo is that you only know you

2200
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:17,260
hit one at long after it was too late to

2201
01:46:13,479 --> 01:46:20,159
turn on recording and I don't think this

2202
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:20,159
changes it that much

2203
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:25,320
does that help does that make sense so

2204
01:46:26,609 --> 01:46:30,069
far it seems like all the animations are

2205
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:31,840
programmatically moving static sprites

2206
01:46:30,069 --> 01:46:34,029
is there any plan to include preset or

2207
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:39,100
artistic creating animations we probably

2208
01:46:34,029 --> 01:46:42,130
won't you know we're pretty much a

2209
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:44,100
programming stream here so you know I I

2210
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:47,829
don't really want to put a lot of art

2211
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:50,320
stress on the art the other thing I

2212
01:46:47,829 --> 01:46:51,789
guess is this game is supposed to be one

2213
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:54,009
where it's easy to add new things to it

2214
01:46:51,789 --> 01:46:55,960
so I don't really want to set the bar

2215
01:46:54,010 --> 01:46:57,930
high for animation I want you to have to

2216
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:59,829
draw the smallest number of things

2217
01:46:57,930 --> 01:47:01,600
necessary to add something new to the

2218
01:46:59,829 --> 01:47:03,309
game that's kind of another criteria and

2219
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:06,100
so if you start having frames of

2220
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:09,430
animation that just really increases the

2221
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:12,550
cost for people to add like a new item

2222
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:19,510
or a new enemy so I'd like to keep those

2223
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:21,989
really low right that's that's really

2224
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:21,989
all I could say

2225
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:33,779
not but no I said they're under code for

2226
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:35,310
a bit it seems the vertices indices for

2227
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:37,199
the cubes and quads are generated each

2228
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:39,000
frame and the CPU and put into a big VBA

2229
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:40,170
which is said the stream draw is this

2230
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:44,340
correct and it's yes what was the

2231
01:47:40,170 --> 01:47:45,690
decision to do it that way so the reason

2232
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:48,449
we do it that way is because we have

2233
01:47:45,689 --> 01:47:56,159
it's a game with very low geometry load

2234
01:47:48,449 --> 01:47:58,170
right so the the number of things we

2235
01:47:56,159 --> 01:48:01,260
draw with Q with the cubes and the

2236
01:47:58,170 --> 01:48:03,449
sprites is very low that's generally

2237
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:08,310
true of a 2d game it's just not that

2238
01:48:03,449 --> 01:48:11,599
many things and so there isn't really

2239
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:15,539
much of a reason for us to spend time

2240
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:17,640
managing GPU memory for no reason

2241
01:48:15,539 --> 01:48:21,989
because we just it's just not a

2242
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:24,600
bottleneck so introducing something like

2243
01:48:21,989 --> 01:48:26,250
static buffers that we manage just

2244
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:29,130
increases the chance that we have bugs

2245
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:32,300
and work on less cards and doesn't

2246
01:48:29,130 --> 01:48:34,170
really do much for us because we don't

2247
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:37,140
we don't spend a lot of time

2248
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:38,909
transferring that stuff right textures

2249
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:40,380
we do spend time transferring it so

2250
01:48:38,909 --> 01:48:43,949
that's why we try to keep them cached on

2251
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:47,010
the card as much as possible vertices we

2252
01:48:43,949 --> 01:48:49,829
just don't have that problem and so

2253
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:54,270
that's our current situation now we also

2254
01:48:49,829 --> 01:48:58,050
have the situation that we may have lots

2255
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:59,610
of particles and particles are things

2256
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:01,260
that we will probably try to compress

2257
01:48:59,609 --> 01:49:02,909
more but we still will probably have to

2258
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:04,350
stream them out every frame because we

2259
01:49:02,909 --> 01:49:06,389
are going to move them on the CPU side

2260
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:08,610
mostly so you can't really use a static

2261
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:11,910
buffer for those either if you wanted to

2262
01:49:08,609 --> 01:49:14,219
do particle simulation on the GPU what

2263
01:49:11,909 --> 01:49:16,260
you can do then you could change it but

2264
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:18,329
for right now I don't have any plans to

2265
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:21,180
do that either because again even with a

2266
01:49:18,329 --> 01:49:22,649
couple you know ten thousand particles

2267
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:23,970
may be on the screen we probably still

2268
01:49:22,649 --> 01:49:26,750
wouldn't be stressing the pipe to the

2269
01:49:23,970 --> 01:49:26,750
graphs card very much

2270
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:35,559
once your take on ProFlowers versus

2271
01:49:33,569 --> 01:49:36,819
do-it-yourself in-game profiling I've

2272
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:38,920
always found do it you're selling any

2273
01:49:36,819 --> 01:49:40,179
profiling to be better what are some

2274
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:44,260
decent profiles that you know of or have

2275
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:47,200
used I tried to use very sleepy it

2276
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:48,699
didn't really work the multi-threading

2277
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:50,889
just didn't seem to work it just gave

2278
01:49:48,699 --> 01:49:53,590
really ridiculous results that I knew

2279
01:49:50,890 --> 01:49:56,470
weren't true so I'm not sure what was up

2280
01:49:53,590 --> 01:50:00,159
with that I've tried to use vtune it's a

2281
01:49:56,470 --> 01:50:01,800
mess I haven't ever tried to lemma tree

2282
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:05,680
so rad ships a thing called telemetry

2283
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:09,130
that looks more sane unsurprisingly

2284
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:11,710
because hey like rats would working on

2285
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:13,449
it for a while so it's better but I

2286
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:14,920
haven't tried it myself so I don't

2287
01:50:13,449 --> 01:50:16,420
really know but it looks more like the

2288
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:18,399
kind of thing that I would do right like

2289
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:20,440
it it records a bunch of things and then

2290
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:24,909
you can kind of look at them and go show

2291
01:50:20,439 --> 01:50:29,409
me what a frame looked like and that

2292
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:31,829
seems you know seems like something

2293
01:50:29,409 --> 01:50:31,829
that's more useful

2294
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:10,199
so I guess we don't have any more

2295
01:51:07,649 --> 01:51:12,569
questions it looks like oh wait what I

2296
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:22,529
think about Python you talk about the

2297
01:51:12,569 --> 01:51:26,429
language so I've only really ever looked

2298
01:51:22,529 --> 01:51:30,719
at Python like twice and it was someone

2299
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:33,570
else's project uh

2300
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:36,840
I guess what I would say is it looks

2301
01:51:33,569 --> 01:51:39,179
like yet another super janky high-level

2302
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:40,110
language that is mostly only interesting

2303
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:44,670
because people have written a lot of

2304
01:51:40,109 --> 01:51:50,789
libraries for it like it looks like

2305
01:51:44,670 --> 01:51:54,180
probably slightly better than PHP but

2306
01:51:50,789 --> 01:51:55,619
basically the exact same thing like a

2307
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:58,890
janky language not particularly well

2308
01:51:55,619 --> 01:52:05,670
thought-out certainly not doesn't

2309
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:07,140
perform well very slow but lots of

2310
01:52:05,670 --> 01:52:09,260
libraries so you can do things quickly

2311
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:12,270
if the library does what you want right

2312
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:13,860
that's about all I could tell about it

2313
01:52:12,270 --> 01:52:17,580
from the limited amount that I've used

2314
01:52:13,859 --> 01:52:18,689
it see if there's any value in keeping

2315
01:52:17,579 --> 01:52:21,689
the cost of registers in the

2316
01:52:18,689 --> 01:52:23,359
higher-level language yes absolutely if

2317
01:52:21,689 --> 01:52:25,919
I were designing a language you would

2318
01:52:23,359 --> 01:52:27,420
actually be able to essentially program

2319
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:30,270
assembly language directly in it and

2320
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:32,760
then scale out to like so basically you

2321
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:34,260
could do register allocation yourself at

2322
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:39,900
any point if you wanted to that would

2323
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:42,030
totally be something I would do how do I

2324
01:52:39,899 --> 01:52:45,960
feel about dynamically typed languages

2325
01:52:42,029 --> 01:52:47,219
I feel like dynamic typing is good for

2326
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:48,590
certain situations but you definitely

2327
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:52,619
don't want it to the only thing you have

2328
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:58,529
so if you have dynamic typing that's

2329
01:52:52,619 --> 01:53:00,149
fine but if you don't allow static

2330
01:52:58,529 --> 01:53:01,019
typing as well I probably won't like

2331
01:53:00,149 --> 01:53:03,629
your language because there's way too

2332
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:05,730
many bugs there's lots of unnecessary

2333
01:53:03,630 --> 01:53:09,690
bugs in languages that don't have static

2334
01:53:05,729 --> 01:53:12,809
typing analysis maybe that's before but

2335
01:53:09,689 --> 01:53:15,500
have you looked at Pony lang no I do not

2336
01:53:12,810 --> 01:53:15,500
know Pony lang

2337
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:21,550
the fact that your name is useless pony

2338
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:25,530
seems to suggest that pony leg must not

2339
01:53:21,550 --> 01:53:25,529
be very good if it is useless

2340
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:50,509
does the game live lettuce from files no

2341
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:52,160
it generates levels itself or I should

2342
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:54,260
say will generate level itself at the

2343
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:58,609
moment a it only generates a few simple

2344
01:53:54,260 --> 01:54:01,880
things that we told it to generate but

2345
01:53:58,609 --> 01:54:03,679
we will be expanding on that and there

2346
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:06,880
will be no level editor at all it's not

2347
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:06,880
a game where you edit levels

2348
01:54:22,998 --> 01:54:26,118
I feel like with the number of times

2349
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:27,559
people ask me like what do you think

2350
01:54:26,118 --> 01:54:30,228
about this random language that's very

2351
01:54:27,559 --> 01:54:32,179
esoteric I feel like I just start just

2352
01:54:30,229 --> 01:54:39,829
making up languages and answering them

2353
01:54:32,179 --> 01:54:41,748
right like everyone should just program

2354
01:54:39,828 --> 01:54:43,248
in Kronk like Gronk is obviously the

2355
01:54:41,748 --> 01:54:45,349
best language it has all the best things

2356
01:54:43,248 --> 01:54:47,559
in it like why aren't we just burning

2357
01:54:45,349 --> 01:54:50,559
this game and Gronk

2358
01:54:47,559 --> 01:54:50,559
right

2359
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:23,670
it rust is I mean rust is probably a

2360
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:25,829
fine language but you know it's not as

2361
01:55:23,670 --> 01:55:33,420
good as iron or iron ore is a way better

2362
01:55:25,829 --> 01:55:36,529
language also the the zinc oxide

2363
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:39,060
language is very good

2364
01:55:36,529 --> 01:55:41,250
dihydrogen monoxide is one of my

2365
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:45,360
favorite languages it's got a ton of

2366
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:46,829
good stuff in it you know cuz rust has

2367
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:52,229
the Baro checker which people like to

2368
01:55:46,829 --> 01:55:54,719
talk about but the but zinc oxide is a

2369
01:55:52,229 --> 01:55:56,908
way better language and the Baro checker

2370
01:55:54,719 --> 01:56:00,329
has a lot limitations zinc oxide has the

2371
01:55:56,908 --> 01:56:03,500
theft police feature the thepolice is

2372
01:56:00,329 --> 01:56:07,920
like way better than the Baro checker

2373
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:11,069
and and similarly like like the garbage

2374
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:12,750
collection features are like like goes

2375
01:56:11,069 --> 01:56:15,500
garbage collection is terrible

2376
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:17,880
whereas zinc oxide has actually

2377
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:21,390
recycling and composting has memory

2378
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:22,980
composting and memory composting is like

2379
01:56:21,390 --> 01:56:24,929
way more powerful than garbage garbage

2380
01:56:22,979 --> 01:56:26,609
collection right because one of the

2381
01:56:24,929 --> 01:56:28,408
problems is you get in in languages like

2382
01:56:26,609 --> 01:56:32,158
NGO that focus on garbage collection is

2383
01:56:28,408 --> 01:56:35,039
that eventually there's you run out of

2384
01:56:32,158 --> 01:56:36,000
raw materials right so you're collecting

2385
01:56:35,039 --> 01:56:39,119
the garbage second guard took the

2386
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:42,600
garbage putting it in into the landfill

2387
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:43,979
segment and then eventually you know

2388
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:47,610
either you run out of space in the

2389
01:56:43,979 --> 01:56:50,158
landfill segment or you end up in a

2390
01:56:47,609 --> 01:56:54,479
situation where you just don't have any

2391
01:56:50,158 --> 01:56:57,809
raw materials anymore at all right so

2392
01:56:54,479 --> 01:56:58,678
you know in a language like go all the

2393
01:56:57,810 --> 01:57:00,810
memory has to come from the memory

2394
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:04,949
garden the memory gardens planted at

2395
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:08,539
sort of time and after you harvest all

2396
01:57:04,948 --> 01:57:10,979
of the memory in the memory garden and

2397
01:57:08,539 --> 01:57:12,329
your garbage collector has collected all

2398
01:57:10,979 --> 01:57:16,198
of that used memory and thrown it away

2399
01:57:12,329 --> 01:57:17,519
in the landfill segment that's it right

2400
01:57:16,198 --> 01:57:19,859
I mean the program stops

2401
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:22,020
I mean basically not not to mention all

2402
01:57:19,859 --> 01:57:23,609
the health problems and so one of the

2403
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:28,050
things about zinc oxide which makes it

2404
01:57:23,609 --> 01:57:29,969
far superior or also I I don't know if

2405
01:57:28,050 --> 01:57:32,010
you guys would look at stop Lang stop

2406
01:57:29,969 --> 01:57:32,578
Lang is is kind of like go but with

2407
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:33,929
compost

2408
01:57:32,578 --> 01:57:38,458
with memory composting right because

2409
01:57:33,929 --> 01:57:41,158
they recognized the fact that you know

2410
01:57:38,458 --> 01:57:44,488
you you have this sort of inherent

2411
01:57:41,158 --> 01:57:46,888
problem with garbage collection where

2412
01:57:44,488 --> 01:57:48,958
all of the code just just ends up in a

2413
01:57:46,889 --> 01:57:50,159
landfill and there's you know all of all

2414
01:57:48,958 --> 01:57:51,418
that memory just ends up in the landfill

2415
01:57:50,158 --> 01:57:51,868
after it's used and it's a really big

2416
01:57:51,418 --> 01:57:54,599
problem

2417
01:57:51,868 --> 01:57:55,918
so stop laying but also zinc oxide

2418
01:57:54,599 --> 01:57:58,639
because zinc oxides really like way

2419
01:57:55,918 --> 01:58:02,118
better right

2420
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:06,809
stop lang was kind of just only internal

2421
01:58:02,118 --> 01:58:08,458
to fugle and you know they sort of have

2422
01:58:06,809 --> 01:58:11,248
it out there but it's not really where

2423
01:58:08,458 --> 01:58:12,628
as zinc oxide was more of like an open

2424
01:58:11,248 --> 01:58:14,069
language took more feedback from the

2425
01:58:12,628 --> 01:58:15,118
academic community we all know how good

2426
01:58:14,069 --> 01:58:16,889
the academic community is applying

2427
01:58:15,118 --> 01:58:18,328
languages very good the fact that they

2428
01:58:16,889 --> 01:58:20,300
never write new code Justin you know

2429
01:58:18,328 --> 01:58:24,088
shouldn't shouldn't be held against him

2430
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:25,498
so anyway zinc oxide has that has the

2431
01:58:24,088 --> 01:58:29,458
memory composting so what that allows

2432
01:58:25,498 --> 01:58:31,019
you to do is after you use some memory

2433
01:58:29,458 --> 01:58:32,608
from the memory garden which obviously

2434
01:58:31,019 --> 01:58:34,588
you know all the memory has to go

2435
01:58:32,609 --> 01:58:37,379
through a memory garden at some point in

2436
01:58:34,588 --> 01:58:42,469
order to have the memory be nitrogen

2437
01:58:37,378 --> 01:58:45,418
fixated when it's initially created I

2438
01:58:42,469 --> 01:58:49,408
unless you're in in Pliska obviously

2439
01:58:45,418 --> 01:58:51,238
plis code and data are interchangeable

2440
01:58:49,408 --> 01:58:54,418
and you can and you know everything

2441
01:58:51,238 --> 01:58:56,069
everything is a blip in that language so

2442
01:58:54,418 --> 01:58:58,439
that's like a different kind of language

2443
01:58:56,069 --> 01:59:00,748
so I would I would say yeah don't don't

2444
01:58:58,439 --> 01:59:02,459
take that one too seriously it's just a

2445
01:59:00,748 --> 01:59:06,118
little bit weird but assuming that

2446
01:59:02,458 --> 01:59:07,349
you're using zinc oxide or stop Lang you

2447
01:59:06,118 --> 01:59:09,478
know that that composting feature is

2448
01:59:07,349 --> 01:59:11,788
really important because you know then

2449
01:59:09,479 --> 01:59:14,849
instead of all of the garbage collected

2450
01:59:11,788 --> 01:59:18,418
memory just getting thrown away all of

2451
01:59:14,849 --> 01:59:24,359
that you know that that nutrient rich

2452
01:59:18,418 --> 01:59:27,148
used memory is put into a bin right it's

2453
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:30,359
put into a memory bin until it kind of

2454
01:59:27,149 --> 01:59:32,729
has a chance to let you know usually

2455
01:59:30,359 --> 01:59:36,510
what and and I know this seems weird but

2456
01:59:32,729 --> 01:59:38,309
this is very serious security research

2457
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:42,239
was done on both stop laying and zinc

2458
01:59:38,309 --> 01:59:44,069
oxide and so a lot of those other

2459
01:59:42,238 --> 01:59:46,349
languages that you're that you're

2460
01:59:44,069 --> 01:59:48,120
talking about there

2461
01:59:46,350 --> 01:59:49,590
of those other languages they don't

2462
01:59:48,119 --> 01:59:52,619
appreciate the fact that there's a lot

2463
01:59:49,590 --> 01:59:54,569
of other malicious code normally running

2464
01:59:52,619 --> 01:59:56,970
on the machine there's like malware you

2465
01:59:54,569 --> 02:00:00,750
know viruses but those things are

2466
01:59:56,970 --> 02:00:02,730
actually helpful right because what

2467
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:06,029
those things can do is if you just give

2468
02:00:02,729 --> 02:00:08,729
them your used memory then what will

2469
02:00:06,029 --> 02:00:11,960
happen is those malware's will actually

2470
02:00:08,729 --> 02:00:16,109
they will metabolize the used memory and

2471
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:17,939
turn it back into remember you can use

2472
02:00:16,109 --> 02:00:20,609
in your actual program right

2473
02:00:17,939 --> 02:00:22,559
so a typical language like like stop

2474
02:00:20,609 --> 02:00:24,089
lang or zinc oxide that has some of

2475
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:26,310
these more modern memory composting

2476
02:00:24,090 --> 02:00:28,079
features they'll take that used memory

2477
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:29,640
after you know you use it in your actual

2478
02:00:28,079 --> 02:00:32,460
program to do some computations and

2479
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:35,460
store some things in they'll put it into

2480
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:37,439
the memory composting bin and that bin

2481
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:41,369
is essentially you could think of it as

2482
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:43,500
a memory sandbox right that is running

2483
02:00:41,369 --> 02:00:46,289
all of the malware on your machine and

2484
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:50,909
it's it's allowing that composted memory

2485
02:00:46,289 --> 02:00:54,659
right to be metabolized by the malware

2486
02:00:50,909 --> 02:00:58,319
in back into usable memory and so that

2487
02:00:54,659 --> 02:01:01,550
is a really you know again very cutting

2488
02:00:58,319 --> 02:01:05,130
edge a very very very cutting edge

2489
02:01:01,550 --> 02:01:07,890
language feature that things like stop

2490
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:09,060
lang and zinc oxide have and you know

2491
02:01:07,890 --> 02:01:10,410
it's one of the reasons why you know

2492
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:11,610
those are really great languages I can

2493
02:01:10,409 --> 02:01:14,989
see why everyone always comes on the

2494
02:01:11,609 --> 02:01:14,989
stream and ask me what I think of them

2495
02:01:21,239 --> 02:01:24,989
let's see here

2496
02:01:34,238 --> 02:01:42,519
all right I think we'll wrap it up for

2497
02:01:36,069 --> 02:01:45,509
the day I think we will wrap it up for

2498
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:45,510
the day

2499
02:01:47,819 --> 02:01:54,579
pretty please without that wind today I

2500
02:01:50,729 --> 02:01:59,589
don't mind telling you despite my lack

2501
02:01:54,579 --> 02:02:01,569
of mental grasp on the atan2 in my

2502
02:01:59,590 --> 02:02:03,789
imagination how I always seem to get the

2503
02:02:01,569 --> 02:02:06,519
basis wrong other than that we did

2504
02:02:03,789 --> 02:02:07,479
pretty good today all right thank you

2505
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:08,739
everyone for joining me for this sort of

2506
02:02:07,479 --> 02:02:10,869
handmade hero it's our pleasure coding

2507
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:12,309
with you as always if you want to follow

2508
02:02:10,869 --> 02:02:13,809
in series at home you can always go to

2509
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:15,760
handmade hero Oregon pre-order the game

2510
02:02:13,810 --> 02:02:18,280
it comes with all the source code even

2511
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:22,420
today so you can play around with it and

2512
02:02:18,279 --> 02:02:26,380
learn from the series hopefully I will

2513
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:29,460
be back here next week to probably I

2514
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:32,109
guess so I think what we want to do is

2515
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:33,699
do the full version of that alignment

2516
02:02:32,109 --> 02:02:35,559
code that I just played around with

2517
02:02:33,699 --> 02:02:37,059
today so we can track that off her list

2518
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:39,460
and then we can go like a Lionel our

2519
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:41,590
sprite assets and have a nice like put

2520
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:43,239
all that stuff in the game and that'll

2521
02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:45,069
give us a chance to turn the crank a few

2522
02:02:43,238 --> 02:02:46,750
times on the asset system and get the

2523
02:02:45,069 --> 02:02:49,119
bugs out I know there's still bugs in

2524
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:50,859
there I guarantee you it's just we put

2525
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:53,649
there's it's just really big and there's

2526
02:02:50,859 --> 02:02:55,238
a lot of complexity in there now I'm

2527
02:02:53,649 --> 02:02:57,250
sure we've got some things wrong going

2528
02:02:55,238 --> 02:02:59,669
on there so we need to like actually get

2529
02:02:57,250 --> 02:03:02,229
a really good monocle out a really good

2530
02:02:59,670 --> 02:03:03,670
evil genius monocle out and look at that

2531
02:03:02,229 --> 02:03:07,389
coating and make sure that it's just

2532
02:03:03,670 --> 02:03:08,590
right but that's really you know where

2533
02:03:07,390 --> 02:03:09,670
we're at and I'm happy about that so I

2534
02:03:08,590 --> 02:03:11,140
think the game will look a lot nicer

2535
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:13,090
then because we'll be able to align all

2536
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:14,530
the stuff make it good maybe the after

2537
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:16,600
that will will ping back over to

2538
02:03:14,529 --> 02:03:18,250
lighting strip out some of the stuff

2539
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:20,380
make a simpler version of it so we can

2540
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:22,779
run it real real time on lower end

2541
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:24,640
machines and also do a wider version and

2542
02:03:22,779 --> 02:03:26,649
then I think we're checked off man I

2543
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:27,969
think we're looking great I think I

2544
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:30,579
think we're ready to populate the game

2545
02:03:27,969 --> 02:03:32,560
of stuff hopefully right I don't know

2546
02:03:30,579 --> 02:03:35,260
what else we'd have to do Oh wha do

2547
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:36,850
sounds right we want to do some we want

2548
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:38,739
put sounds into the pack files that's

2549
02:03:36,850 --> 02:03:41,140
another thing we got to do so you have

2550
02:03:38,738 --> 02:03:42,789
some stuff left so we'll be back on that

2551
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:44,350
I hope you join me for that next weekend

2552
02:03:42,789 --> 02:03:47,289
until then have fun prettier than anyone

2553
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:47,950
have fun programming everyone I'll see

2554
02:03:47,289 --> 02:03:50,579
you on the Internet

2555
02:03:47,949 --> 02:03:50,579
use everybody
