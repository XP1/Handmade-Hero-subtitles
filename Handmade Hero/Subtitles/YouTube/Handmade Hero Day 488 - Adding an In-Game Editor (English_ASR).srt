00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,490
hello everyone and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:10,289
here the show we could a complete game

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:14,070
live on stream we are going to do some

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:16,288
editing features today essentially the

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:21,750
problem that we have at the moment is

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:25,890
that we added some stuff to our sort of

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,929
art asset format that is not something

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,140
that we really have any way to input so

9
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:33,350
basically like we have information we

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,329
need four different

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,719
sprite pieces things that are supposed

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,250
to snap together and we now have ways of

13
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,600
describing how they snap together but we

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,719
don't have any way of actually ever

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,090
specifying any of that and we could just

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,789
make a text file format that we then

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,219
like have to edit by hand but rather

18
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,920
than doing that what I would rather do

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,140
is make it so that there is a way to

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,640
edit it inside the game that then I

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,530
could just hit save and it just writes

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,149
the text file for me because I don't

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,859
really ever want to edit the text file I

24
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,210
mean I'd like to have a text file there

25
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:06,810
so I can just look at it and verify

26
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:08,938
that's correct

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,368
and sometimes it again if you don't have

28
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,839
a lot of time to write tools text files

29
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:14,640
are kind of your friend because you can

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,170
use like a diff utilities and stuff on

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,170
them and source code controlling us how

32
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,790
to merge them for example so you can

33
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,219
leverage a lot of stuff there if you use

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,840
a text file format so I kind of do like

35
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,250
the idea value textile format - right -

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,930
I just don't want to actually thumb make

37
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,519
them by hand because I think that would

38
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,770
just be sort of annoying and take a long

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,719
time and so that's really all I wanted

40
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:36,048
to do this weekend is make something

41
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,310
that I can use to edit that information

42
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,780
and it's not particularly hard code is

43
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,189
just a lot of code cuz you gotta write

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,810
something that writes text files and

45
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,849
reads them and I got to write something

46
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,280
that edits this stuff and last save it's

47
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:48,868
just a lot of code right so it's good

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,329
take us a little while to do but it's an

49
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:52,649
optically hard code it's not code that

50
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,069
it's gonna like bend your mind or

51
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,840
anything but it isn't it isn't small

52
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:02,309
typically it actually takes a bit of

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,780
typing so if you remember correctly the

54
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,780
point of this was just like for example

55
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,459
we had some cats we loaded in and we

56
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,560
have different pieces there's cat heads

57
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,930
and cat bodies and we wanted the cat

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,890
heads and the cat bodies to both you

59
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,540
know to be able to sort of

60
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,789
five snap points that would just like

61
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:19,739
stick on and so right now what we get if

62
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:21,959
we try to put a cat in there other and

63
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,390
again scale was also part of this right

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,969
we just get a cat of an arbitrary size

65
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:28,769
and we have no way to like adjust the

66
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:32,520
size in-game right it's just whatever

67
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,140
numbers we randomly picked so we we have

68
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,850
that problem the other problem we have

69
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,469
is that the they're not snapped together

70
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,090
the head doesn't go on the body at all

71
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:41,550
so it's just ridiculous and totally not

72
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,840
what we want and so what we want to be

73
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,819
able to do we wrote something here where

74
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,409
we can pick stuff pretty easily what

75
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,839
we'd like to do is be able to click here

76
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,939
and like you know bring up some

77
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,939
information where I can edit that stuff

78
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,090
what is the scale of this cat you know

79
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,189
so I can set it something reasonable and

80
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,879
how do the pieces of the cat snap

81
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:10,590
together to create an actual correctly

82
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:11,669
formed cat this is not hard like I said

83
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,170
before we're just talking about

84
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:16,289
basically implementing some floating

85
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:18,328
point values you know editable window it

86
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:20,909
just takes a long time because we don't

87
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,590
have anything like that but we can

88
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,449
borrow our debug code which sort of had

89
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,539
some stuff for doing this we can borrow

90
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:30,229
debug code and kind of use that so we

91
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:33,328
don't have to re-implement everything

92
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:36,539
but we will have to do some typing okay

93
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,879
so how do we edit this stuff well what I

94
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:41,310
would like to do is have some way you

95
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,289
know cuz what's actually happening in

96
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,140
that code that we wrote for picking last

97
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:49,109
week is we know when we exit this

98
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:52,078
routine we actually have information

99
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:55,380
about who was selected by the mouse

100
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,930
cursor right so when we went through

101
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:01,319
here we already did the work to figure

102
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,659
out who's being picked and we have that

103
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,379
piece of information so really what we

104
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:10,859
want here is a way of providing that to

105
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:15,209
some system that can do something with

106
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:18,410
it right so if we have a pic where it

107
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,668
says like hey this is this is the entity

108
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,979
and this is the piece of the entity that

109
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,299
was being picked or whatever how do we

110
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,120
get that out of here

111
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,569
right and so that's something that I

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,209
would like

113
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,860
to address so what I'm going to do is

114
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:35,789
I'm going to introduce some pretty

115
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,639
simple stuff here inside world mode is

116
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,260
one place we could put it but I don't

117
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,120
love that the reason I don't love that

118
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,500
is because if you think about what's

119
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,269
happening here is basically what we

120
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,370
reading is we're not editing entities

121
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,959
because we're never actually editing

122
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,550
entities if you look at something like

123
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,469
for example since John was on the stream

124
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,460
earlier if you look at games like what

125
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,830
John makes braid and the witness the way

126
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:01,079
those work is the designer makes

127
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:04,079
entities and they place entities in the

128
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:07,229
world right so the core unit of editing

129
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,089
is an entity that is what you would be

130
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,680
editing and so what we would normally

131
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:15,209
think about our editing system being

132
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,459
built around is editing an entity right

133
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:20,250
and so it would make a lot of sense if

134
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:21,930
we were in one of those engines to do it

135
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,870
that way and that is how those engines

136
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,389
work you edit enemies however in our

137
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,910
engine that designer that replaces any

138
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,759
entities we don't have that concept the

139
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,890
the generator places them and it does

140
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,509
whatever it wants right so which

141
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,370
creating entities all over the place

142
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:42,089
it's parametrically determining there

143
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,959
there's values and so us editing an

144
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:48,389
entity in our game makes no sense it's

145
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,239
not a designer eGain in that way the

146
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,459
designer if we had one would be working

147
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,870
on the generator not on the entities

148
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:59,669
right and so what we're really editing

149
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,680
here and the parameters were actually

150
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,110
concerned with are actually parameters

151
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,060
of the art assets we don't really have a

152
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,949
lot of need to edit parameters of

153
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,199
entities because those have to be edited

154
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,430
in the generator and I don't really know

155
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,709
how you would make an interface for

156
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,840
editing that through entities you'd have

157
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:18,209
to do something really crazy like tag

158
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,979
the route that everything went through

159
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:22,199
the generator and have a really cool

160
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,000
edit system like flowed back to that I

161
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,409
could imagine doing that if this was a

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,300
product I was spending full time on

163
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,700
every day I'm not going to try to do

164
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,560
that at two hours a day on weekends only

165
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,439
right because that's like a huge it

166
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,480
sounds cool it's a little bit far field

167
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,219
right

168
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,500
so we're gonna be editing that generator

169
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,980
mostly by hand and if we do have an

170
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,240
interface

171
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,370
for it it's gonna be an interface that

172
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,650
goes directly to the generator it's not

173
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,600
gonna try to reverse through it so we're

174
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:50,549
editing mostly art assets and the

175
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,100
parameters we're editing our artistic

176
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,620
parameters that go on to the art assets

177
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,900
themselves what that means is that we

178
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,550
don't really want our editing system to

179
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,409
be restricted to entities because why

180
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,449
should it be maybe we've got some

181
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,850
interface stuff in the metagame maybe

182
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,620
the cutscenes for example anything like

183
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,950
that if we want to be able to specify

184
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,780
information to those art assets they're

185
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:14,639
not entities there's no entities there

186
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,889
right and we don't really want to have

187
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,539
to introduce entities into that system

188
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,219
for no reason when really the only thing

189
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,840
we're trying anything is art assets so

190
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,940
really what we want to think about here

191
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,359
is how do we expose editing of art

192
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,980
assets not of entities because we those

193
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,389
are two different things and we really

194
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,610
just don't have a game where edit

195
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:35,370
entities can be edited they just can't

196
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,259
be edited right the thing that has to be

197
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,759
edited is the generators parameters and

198
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,620
that would be a different interface

199
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,089
which we might make at some point for

200
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,550
fine-tuning or whatever but it's just

201
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:46,319
it's a different kind of thing so what

202
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,930
we want to do here is we want to focus

203
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,240
on the fact that assets are the things

204
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,470
that are being edited and we want to

205
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,230
kind of put this code in something

206
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,760
that's gonna be asset editing based so I

207
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,170
think what that's gonna mean is it's

208
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,909
gonna be something that lives at a

209
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,340
pretty high level it's gonna be

210
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,500
something that lives and talks to asset

211
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:07,919
system more directly and doesn't really

212
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,769
go through the game code it's more the

213
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,040
game code telling it what was selected

214
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:15,180
is about it right so I think what's

215
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,370
gonna happen here is we're gonna have

216
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,120
something where for example we've got

217
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:23,250
this switch statement here and what this

218
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,990
switch statement does is says what kind

219
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,819
of game what are we running what do we

220
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,439
need to do here let's go ahead and

221
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,000
update the title screen up to the render

222
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,230
cutscene update the world whatever it is

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that we're running that's what we're

224
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,009
going to do and what I'd like to see

225
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,629
happen here is to expand our notion of

226
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:39,990
what's going on in this particular

227
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:42,200
context to include an overriding editor

228
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,279
that sits above everything in the game

229
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,920
doesn't matter what mode you're in

230
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,549
you can still propagate information out

231
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:52,139
to the editor and have it edit

232
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:54,539
asynchronous of well not asynchronous of

233
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,448
I should say edit

234
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:59,458
irrespective of who is the actual

235
00:08:57,448 --> 00:09:02,008
arbiter of what goes on the screen and

236
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,049
not so what I'd like to see here is

237
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,490
inside the game state right which I

238
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:08,099
which is kind of the over anything that

239
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,959
controls that not specific to which

240
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,579
game-mode you're actually running I

241
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:17,039
would like to have that game state be

242
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:20,578
the thing that the checks this this

243
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:23,909
information right so in here I want to

244
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:27,419
have something that's sort of like you

245
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:31,679
know asset editor or something like this

246
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:33,870
or just like in-game editor something

247
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,919
like that you know I'm talking about so

248
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,269
I want to have something here that's

249
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:42,120
just an in-game editor thing and that

250
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:43,649
in-game editor thing is going to be

251
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,990
something that allows me to communicate

252
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,250
this information in a mout right so just

253
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,470
gonna make a file

254
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,870
let me jump this stuff into that file

255
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:55,769
and we're gonna go from there so here's

256
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:58,078
in-game editor and again one of the

257
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,730
things that I might do this would go in

258
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,458
the debug system if I were making this

259
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,319
game for me I'm not making this game for

260
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,138
me I'm making this game for you

261
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:14,549
and as a result what that means why can

262
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:16,318
I not save this handmade there we go

263
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:19,349
since I'm making it for other people

264
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:21,088
substantively to learn and work in it

265
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,649
means that things like being able to

266
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:24,990
edit the art assets are gonna probably

267
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:27,120
ship in the actual release version of

268
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,440
the game that's a little atypical it's

269
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,240
not a hundred percent atypical because

270
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,889
some games come with editors in fact I

271
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,299
mentioned braid braid came with an

272
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:35,639
editor on the PC if I remember correctly

273
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,318
you could pop up like John's interface

274
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,659
for editing you know things in the world

275
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,889
and you could edit that right that's my

276
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:44,068
recollection anyway I could be wrong

277
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:46,350
about that so it had like the PC version

278
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:47,639
had an editor I think it didn't ship may

279
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,290
be necessary I don't know if it

280
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,879
necessary shipped immediately with the

281
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:52,919
game but I think it did because I think

282
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,110
the PC version was also delayed because

283
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,009
it was Xbox exclusive or something the

284
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,839
original one I don't even remember

285
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:59,310
remember anything about that but I just

286
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,250
remember I think the PC version could do

287
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:04,198
that so it's not out of the ordinary for

288
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,698
a game to include any editor it's just

289
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:07,049
not necessarily how I would normally

290
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,569
think silent only shipped games with

291
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:09,459
editors

292
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,170
I'm an enormous if games I normally just

293
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,590
have tucked so I don't know but point

294
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,969
being

295
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,690
Nora it's not something I would consider

296
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:19,000
I could certainly going the debug system

297
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,500
so anyway inside here if I imagine

298
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,149
what's going to go in here I would say

299
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,919
okay there's gonna be an in-game editor

300
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,240
and what I wanted to do is go write some

301
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,799
code that does can give meaning I'm

302
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,409
going to shove the things it needs to

303
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,539
edit into here but I know that one of

304
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:35,709
them very clearly is going to be like

305
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:40,329
what kind of bitmap editor or what kind

306
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:42,850
of what sort of look apart what what

307
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,470
kind of art asset am i editing you know

308
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,690
which which art asset am I actually

309
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:50,050
looking at and which art asset on my

310
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:53,620
editing here so if I go into HHA edit

311
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:56,019
for example MS IHSA edit the asset

312
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,669
system right we know the inside here

313
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,960
we've got like a set of loaded assets

314
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:01,719
and there's information about those

315
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,580
assets in here right and when we go to

316
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,560
match against assets we can do stuff in

317
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,740
this system where we go through and we

318
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,809
we do various things we usually are able

319
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,639
to pull out things like a bitmap ID and

320
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:14,949
say look this is the bitmap ID amusing

321
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,500
and then it will go and try to edit that

322
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,090
bitmap ID right so what we want to be

323
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,889
able to do here is respect the fact that

324
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,600
all of our assets are loaded at any

325
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,189
given time there's just an asset array

326
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,720
and I should be able to talk about an

327
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,150
asset in the nest array and I want to

328
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,500
edit that particular asset if I did that

329
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:31,299
I would be able to get back to one of

330
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,370
these that asset has a bunch of

331
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:35,620
information in it including the original

332
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,320
file format information from whence it

333
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,000
came that means that the header itself

334
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,070
will be in there right

335
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,190
and the HHA asset structure will

336
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,470
actually be there that's one of these

337
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,450
and what you can see is that has all the

338
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,460
information I need actually in order to

339
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,259
edit it it'll say what type it is and

340
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,509
it's got the information for the bitmap

341
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:56,889
sounder font baked right in there

342
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,960
the only thing it doesn't tell me is how

343
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:00,100
to immediately write it back out but if

344
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,019
I was starting with one of these

345
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,600
structures to begin with I have the file

346
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,610
index and which asset it was inside that

347
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,070
file which means I can also write it

348
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,110
back to disk anytime I want this between

349
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,629
a great position to make this be the

350
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,340
foundational element of our editing so

351
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:18,279
what I'm gonna do here is say alright

352
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,379
look let's just say let's just say well

353
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,189
hypothetically say in a hypothetical way

354
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:24,639
with

355
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:27,430
let's just say that we had some way of

356
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,919
recording a set of art assets that we

357
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:32,559
may want to edit okay I'm just going to

358
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:36,939
say that hypothetically so if I say I

359
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:39,458
have an edited editable asset or

360
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:43,180
something here right and I want to say

361
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:45,369
look this particular asset index is

362
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:47,828
something that I'm recording that should

363
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:51,578
be edited and maybe I put in there as

364
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:52,958
well sort of uh I don't really want to

365
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:54,818
call it a priority it's not a priority

366
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,438
it's more like a z-depth it's more like

367
00:13:54,818 --> 00:14:00,009
a sorting value so I want to be able to

368
00:13:56,438 --> 00:14:01,659
say look a lot of times where there's

369
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:03,759
gonna be a preference to what is

370
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:05,559
probably edited so for example if I hit

371
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,740
test things in the world and I look at

372
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,838
all the things that I've hit tested I

373
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,360
may want to say one way or another that

374
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,829
things that are far from the camera are

375
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,060
less likely to be the thing that you

376
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:18,429
were trying to edit them things that are

377
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:20,349
in the camera now it's not 100% true

378
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:22,659
right because like let's take this

379
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,850
scenario for example I make mouse over

380
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:27,129
this thing and and who knows maybe I

381
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,879
wanted to edit the body not the head

382
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:29,500
right

383
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,059
or maybe I wanted to edit the square

384
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,208
this thing was standing on but it's big

385
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:36,518
as fat and I can't I can't get get at it

386
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:39,549
right so it's not a given it's not a

387
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,500
given that I want to edit the closely

388
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:43,479
the cursor it's just more likely so I

389
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,448
want to provide some kind of an

390
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,220
information there that's like a sort key

391
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:50,109
right it's just saying look I'm gonna

392
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,139
give you some information I'm gonna

393
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:56,139
prefer things let's just say here that

394
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:57,519
closer to zero is better let's just say

395
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:59,100
that because that's what I want to say

396
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,389
and I'm gonna say it so I just said it

397
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,439
closer to zero is better so we're

398
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:05,159
basically going to say that like

399
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:08,379
anything that's greater than zero

400
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:13,838
decreases your chance as you go out and

401
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:15,879
makes it more likely to be ignored and

402
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,279
maybe I'll say that less than zero is

403
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:21,068
discarded right so when you provide

404
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:23,350
these things I want you to be giving me

405
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:24,698
things that that are above zero and the

406
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,170
further above zero then the further if

407
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:27,938
they're behind if they're lower than

408
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:29,620
zero those are just discarded I don't

409
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:31,360
know why I just want to do that that's

410
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,139
what ice it's you know I'm programmer

411
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,659
I'm allowed to make arbitrary decisions

412
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:39,689
and the CPU has to obey me that's just

413
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:45,269
how it goes so what I want to do here is

414
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:48,390
create um the notion of an editable like

415
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:50,429
asset group and in here I want to track

416
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:52,769
some number of these so I might say

417
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:55,799
there's an asset count and I might say

418
00:15:52,769 --> 00:16:00,149
that there's some number of these assets

419
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:02,279
right then I'm looking at in each one of

420
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,840
those editable assets let's say maybe

421
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,049
there's 16 of them or something like

422
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,790
this you know when I do are these

423
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:15,240
editable asset groups maybe I have

424
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:17,669
something maybe I have some idea of like

425
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,870
when I group grab these things up what

426
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:20,399
I'm looking for and maybe I wanted to

427
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,879
scarred them I could add a filtering

428
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,230
here for example as well but we'll see

429
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,299
we'll see how we want to do that

430
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,700
so anyway in the in-game editor what I

431
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:32,370
want to do here is I want to have an

432
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:36,300
editable asset group and I want this to

433
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:38,970
be the current group right and I'm gonna

434
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:40,709
do something like I'm gonna use my sort

435
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,290
of standard trick that I like to use

436
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,090
which is active and hot and these two

437
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:46,259
things are a little bit different the

438
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,879
active group is the thing that I'm

439
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:49,409
actually editing the hot group is the

440
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,600
one that's like under the cursor right

441
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,679
now which may not really be something

442
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,750
I'm looking at if I'm in the middle of a

443
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,339
net operation or it might be if I am in

444
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,570
the middle of it if I not know that I

445
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,990
have Irish and I'm just like picking

446
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:02,850
entities right so this is the structure

447
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,410
that I want to provide and then what I

448
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,420
want to do is I wanna be able to gather

449
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,940
these and then I want to be a limit

450
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,070
these depending on the circumstances you

451
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,529
know what's going on there I want to be

452
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:16,049
able to do different things

453
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:18,889
so this editable asset group probably

454
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:21,480
wants to bundle up into an editable

455
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,250
query or something like this like a like

456
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,680
editable hit test or something like this

457
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,359
and what I want to do here is say that

458
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:33,750
the editable hit test is going to have

459
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:35,609
you know idea of what the the test group

460
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,380
is that it's going to write to you know

461
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:41,639
and it's also going to have probably the

462
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:44,880
information that comes from that game

463
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,230
input structure so in here you know

464
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,060
we've got some information about the

465
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,370
mouse this sort of stuff

466
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:52,200
is it that's really not true you know

467
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,519
what I take that back that's a lie you

468
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,120
know what I probably want to do I think

469
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,319
I want to do that a little bit

470
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,149
differently what I probably wanna do

471
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:59,189
there is just provide just the basic

472
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,170
Mouse information so probably what I

473
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,549
would say is it might not provide any

474
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,769
real information there other than the

475
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:06,720
clip space Mouse pee the clip space

476
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:09,660
Mouse pee is probably gonna just be the

477
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,069
V to not to be 3v3 includes Z from mouse

478
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,210
wheel we don't really want the mouse

479
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:14,399
wheel getting passed down here because

480
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,200
hit testing is not about the mass wheel

481
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,960
hit testing is not about your feelings

482
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,730
it's about the to deeper space on the

483
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,620
screen where the Ray should shoot out

484
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,970
from so what I lost something like an

485
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:25,439
edible hit test that's the thing you can

486
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,029
pass through here this answer is one of

487
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,100
our big questions and solves a problem I

488
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:32,009
think we were having for which is that

489
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:33,509
when we look into that world mode and we

490
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,250
look at what was happening between the

491
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:37,470
world non-entity there's a piece of that

492
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,930
that wasn't particularly good right it

493
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,670
wasn't great and that is here on the

494
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,350
update and render entities you can see

495
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,269
that we're passing down that game input

496
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:46,709
structure really the game infrastructure

497
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:48,450
has no business being here if you look

498
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,660
at what's going on there it's really

499
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:54,150
just used to get that clip space P and

500
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,950
then do some work on it that's not a

501
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,840
really appropriate way to be doing this

502
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,370
because remember pass that game input

503
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,990
that's passing a lot of information now

504
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,609
look at all the stuff it could be using

505
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,799
there can be using a controller state

506
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,689
the time step we don't really want to

507
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,579
know those things why do we want not

508
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,549
wanting those things because look we

509
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:13,439
don't want to pass information to things

510
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:15,509
that don't need it because they might

511
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,710
accidentally use it right we don't want

512
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:19,410
to give ourselves the opportunity make

513
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,150
mistake I'm not a fan of the weird C++

514
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,410
object-oriented encapsulation nonsense

515
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,840
where everyone has to be isolated from

516
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,580
everything else and like everything in

517
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,129
your code is some ridiculous walled off

518
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:32,460
redic you know incapable little lump

519
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,170
right that's no good but I also am NOT a

520
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,519
fan of just having everybody access

521
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,350
everything for no reason because I'd

522
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:41,309
rather keep things that should be

523
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:43,230
accessed on the on the parameter line so

524
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:44,940
I can see what everyone's using and know

525
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,839
it's kind of a little bit of functional

526
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,160
programming right it's a little bit

527
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,990
functional programming idea sleeping

528
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,430
through that things that you should be

529
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,380
editing should come in as your

530
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,150
parameters right and the more we pass

531
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,040
giants trucks that have everything in

532
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,750
them the less we really know what each

533
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,180
person is using it becomes really

534
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,339
onerous to pass everything to everybody

535
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,049
so it's not really

536
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:05,059
all the time not to mention its

537
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:06,319
inefficient in a code sense to always be

538
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:08,899
passing everything as a function

539
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:11,450
parameter but it is generally true that

540
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,550
you want to keep in mind what is going

541
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,100
to whom and why because you don't want

542
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:18,200
things to get too out of control anyway

543
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:21,289
so what I want to do here is I want to

544
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,660
go again to that in-game editor and I

545
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:26,180
want to go ahead and pass in oops not

546
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,100
that the hit test that we're doing here

547
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,900
because I want this person to always

548
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:32,509
respond to that hit test if it's

549
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,310
appropriate right so in this case here

550
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:37,069
what you can see is we're gonna use that

551
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:39,529
that hit test I don't really want to do

552
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,779
it I don't want to do this work unless

553
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:44,779
we actually need it right so what I want

554
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:46,940
to do here is say all right yeah the hit

555
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:49,519
test in this case is only gonna happen

556
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,680
if we actually have one if we don't have

557
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,559
one that we won't in here again we'll do

558
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,900
the same thing so if we had a hit test

559
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,000
we'll do it when we record this we'll

560
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,820
see if we have the best hit we'll push

561
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,009
the volume out line blah blah blah right

562
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:06,009
this part is a little bit more

563
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:11,960
squirrelly right it's a little bit less

564
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:15,800
clear what we want to do here but what

565
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,299
you can see is we do probably want this

566
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:20,029
same basic idea

567
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:22,669
so in this editable hit test here what

568
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:25,250
we might want to do is have a way of

569
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,620
passing down a selection volume like

570
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:31,569
that so maybe there is a thing here

571
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:34,909
which says like highlight rect right and

572
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:37,460
highlight color something like that so a

573
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,019
way of in our hip test also passing back

574
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,240
look we'd like you to highlight this

575
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:43,339
thing that's just what we're gonna tell

576
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,920
you to do and you're just gonna have to

577
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:48,319
trust us on it simile in here I want to

578
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,150
record that probably so I'd like to say

579
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,579
in here look this is the highlight

580
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:57,410
rectangle that we're talking about so

581
00:21:52,579 --> 00:22:00,019
this is the this is the the rectangle of

582
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:02,210
this thing that we put on here that also

583
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:04,009
allows me to maybe if I want to get rid

584
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,509
of the sort key ID I don't know I still

585
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:06,319
might want it because I don't know that

586
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:08,329
I really wanna do this

587
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,639
we'll see what happens we'll play that

588
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:12,949
one by ear so in here this will change

589
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,780
it's not actually about best hit not

590
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,480
equal to f3 to max that's not sure

591
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:19,700
simile up here best hit is not really

592
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,140
what we're looking at best hit is not

593
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,910
going to be used anymore

594
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,830
in fact it's it's something that we will

595
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,509
probably expand to more of a group

596
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:31,039
search but basically what it's going to

597
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:32,900
happen here is this thing that we're

598
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,960
saving like hit MV piece and that sort

599
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,090
of stuff that's actually just gonna get

600
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,309
resolved inside here so what I'd rather

601
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:42,589
do is say look this stuff is gonna go in

602
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:45,409
here temporarily I'm gonna work on this

603
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:47,359
a little bit differently the hit P and

604
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,610
the hit dimension yeah all that stuff

605
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:53,059
not really what we're talking about here

606
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:54,829
I want to just kind of ignore that for

607
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:56,450
now and move it out so it's really the

608
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:58,399
picking array that sort of stuff this

609
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:01,009
stuff that's what we actually wanted

610
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,910
there and that's going to be doing the

611
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:06,349
picking for this particular routine when

612
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,050
we do the picking now what we're gonna

613
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:10,549
do is this stuff here is gonna when

614
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:12,649
we're doing our push volume outline

615
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:15,289
that's that's gonna work directly off of

616
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,060
the rectangle in question we're gonna

617
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,700
pull that out and we're gonna deal with

618
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:22,159
that in one second here but if we have a

619
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,039
writer group in a hit test we will want

620
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,750
to do our volume outline here and the

621
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,569
volume outline is going to be determined

622
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,390
again by this in-game editor and if it

623
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:38,659
wants to do a highlight rect right

624
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:42,650
that's what we'd like to do there here's

625
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,870
what I'll say now that I think about it

626
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:51,769
that's dumb waste space we can do it

627
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:53,569
better let's roll it in line we'll have

628
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:55,519
a highlight asset index it'll go on a

629
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:57,169
one frame lag it'll be fine

630
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,529
we'll say what we want the highlight

631
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:03,320
color to be and we'll stay with the

632
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:05,450
asset is we won't specify the rectangle

633
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:07,220
right then what we'll do is we'll pull

634
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:11,279
this out we'll actually put this

635
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,180
directly in line here and we'll say

636
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,839
[Music]

637
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:19,200
there was that Center half dim there it

638
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:23,099
is

639
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,309
oops right there this will be better

640
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:30,089
will be simpler and more fun and

641
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:31,529
exciting for everybody really so in here

642
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:33,179
what we want to do is when we're going

643
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:36,809
through these right when we're going

644
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,730
through these the render groups of doing

645
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:41,250
the hit testing right so in here you can

646
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:44,160
see us do the hip test if we wanted to

647
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,589
highlight this thing in particular then

648
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,500
what we'll do is we'll highlight it here

649
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:53,399
right so if we have a hit test I guess I

650
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:56,309
can do it inside this check like so

651
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:02,640
we've already pushed the MT transform so

652
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:05,669
that's fine and I recall how so the hit

653
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,509
P I don't really want I want the one

654
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:14,480
that's not already offset there so it's

655
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:14,480
not this one it's just this one right

656
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:32,519
and the dimensions are the same here so

657
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,960
so I'm gonna do all of this in line so

658
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:35,339
the first thing we're gonna do is we're

659
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,049
gonna take a look at this T hit Rea your

660
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:41,669
sex box what I'm gonna do here is say

661
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:44,399
look if the T hit that I get back when

662
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,350
we look at those when we wrote our

663
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,840
little simple ray caster here right here

664
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:51,559
it is doesn't do anything fancy all I

665
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,119
want to do is see whether or not that

666
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,369
value that comes back is not equal to

667
00:25:54,119 --> 00:26:02,129
the f32 max right that's really all I

668
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:03,779
wanted to do so if it's less than f3 to

669
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,890
max then we're going to process the hit

670
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:09,960
I'm not gonna do it this way at all

671
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:14,670
because those are gone right those are

672
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:21,630
gonna go in here I've got my H in my C

673
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:23,519
file swapped there we go so what I want

674
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:28,860
to do is every time I get a hit I want

675
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:32,579
to provide that hit option so ad kit I

676
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:36,778
want to pass the hit test that I'm using

677
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:39,480
here which is this one and I want to

678
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:42,329
pass the hit in question so here's the

679
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:47,069
world position of that hit here's the

680
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:48,720
world radius what I could do is past a

681
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:50,609
rectangle here but I don't really want

682
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,140
to in fact I guess now think about it it

683
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,278
doesn't really need that information so

684
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,590
can I think about we don't even really

685
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,419
need that I just need the asset index in

686
00:26:55,589 --> 00:27:00,058
the sort key so what I could do here is

687
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:02,429
pass T hit as the sort key so that's the

688
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:04,769
key we're using for sorting they're the

689
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:10,200
asset index and you know what I could

690
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:11,579
say I could just say less is better so

691
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,519
you can pass negative things if you want

692
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:17,638
to so anyway when we do our ad hit here

693
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:20,880
I'll go ahead and say look any kit is a

694
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:22,798
good hit to add to the hit system it can

695
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,570
determine whether or not it wants to use

696
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,329
those hits or not that's entirely up to

697
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:29,189
it and then what we'll do is we'll pass

698
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:30,178
whatever the piece of information err

699
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,038
that are relevant here

700
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:34,048
here's a piece index we also have an

701
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:41,788
ending index I'd like to make both of

702
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:43,470
those things perhaps well you know

703
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:46,579
honestly do I really even care about

704
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:50,009
those I don't know that I really care

705
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:52,138
the asset may actually be sufficient

706
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:54,148
because since I can only edit an asset I

707
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:55,528
may not really care if I mouse over

708
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:56,819
something I'll just highlight all the

709
00:27:55,528 --> 00:27:58,888
assets on the screen that have that

710
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:00,629
thing maybe that may be a little bit

711
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:01,709
absurd because it like for example when

712
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,870
you highlight a floor it'll highlight

713
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,370
every floor piece that has that on the

714
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:14,329
other hand maybe that's a good thing

715
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:17,278
I don't really know hard to say yeah

716
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:18,720
hard to say we'll see how it goes I'll

717
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,669
play around with it we can always add it

718
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,750
back in if I don't like it I'm gonna

719
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:24,028
play that one by ear

720
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,980
so here's what I'm gonna say let's start

721
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:27,929
out with a highlight color here here's

722
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,210
our highlight color the highlight color

723
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,860
is gonna come from that hit test because

724
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,019
we have this highlight color what I'm

725
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:35,250
gonna do is say if I hit then great if I

726
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,528
don't hit this thing the highlight color

727
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,599
is going to be multiplied by 0.5 F so

728
00:28:37,528 --> 00:28:41,190
it's less so it'll highlight the

729
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,509
entities the other things that are not

730
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,140
under the mouse it will highlight those

731
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:45,089
as well but

732
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,950
not as much that basically just gives us

733
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:48,659
a better way of seeing what we're

734
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,100
actually edit and what we're not gonna

735
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,600
edit I think that's a good compromise

736
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:53,189
between the two I'm gonna go ahead and

737
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,750
put the highlighter in here what I want

738
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,970
to do here is say look I need to know

739
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,319
what the asset index actually is that's

740
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,360
a little bit of a difficulty here

741
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,799
because I get the bitmap ID back I don't

742
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:03,750
remember to what extent the bitmap ID

743
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:05,970
actually lines up with an asset index I

744
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:08,819
think it might I don't know it's been a

745
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,069
long time programming is slow on this

746
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:12,990
project because I do it so infrequently

747
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:14,970
that's just not the first thing in my

748
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,490
mind so let me take a look at what that

749
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,660
bitmap ID is actually supposed to be

750
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,650
because I don't really remember

751
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:25,110
is it a enum is it a struct I think it's

752
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,420
a struct it's got a clear value okay so

753
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:29,669
basically all of these things the bitmap

754
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,710
ID sign ID font ID they are just asset

755
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:34,019
IDs at heart right that's all they

756
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,579
actually are so what I should be able to

757
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,920
do here is I should be able just push

758
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:40,889
the value on there and say look that's

759
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,620
the actual thing that I want to be

760
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,600
editing so when we go into a kit here

761
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:48,239
I'm gonna say here's the asset that got

762
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:51,899
hit it's whatever this this bitmap ID

763
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,359
was this bitmap ID here right so that

764
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,370
bitmap ID I'm gonna pass that in now I

765
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,899
could just let it take a bitmap ID I'm

766
00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:00,029
not gonna bother I'm gonna crack it here

767
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,530
but I could pass it in and have three of

768
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:03,180
them one for sounds one for bitmaps or

769
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:05,399
whatever I don't know it's not really a

770
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,710
big deal anyway so that's what I'm doing

771
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,360
that's gonna add a hit to the system

772
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,490
then what I'm gonna do is I'm also going

773
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,049
to see is that bit might be bitmap ID

774
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,240
value equal to the one that's supposed

775
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:19,289
to be highlighting right so if I come

776
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,539
back into the in-game editor and I just

777
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:22,680
want to know what's the asset index that

778
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:26,250
I'm highlighting here like what do I

779
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,170
actually want to show what does the

780
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,630
system think it wants to highlight if

781
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,460
this is that one then I'm gonna push the

782
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,560
volume init line on it right and if it's

783
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,269
not that I'm not going to so that gives

784
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,799
me a way of integrating the hit testing

785
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:40,980
into the rendering routine very cleanly

786
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:43,559
it allows us to do one pass and produce

787
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,970
the hit test buffer if it was requested

788
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,589
at the same time that we do our

789
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,279
rendering and it just simplifies things

790
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:50,009
a lot

791
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,289
there's no baggage being gone there just

792
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:53,700
a little extra CPU time that's spent in

793
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:56,159
the case where you actually wanted to

794
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,029
build it and you need to spend the CPU

795
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,790
time if you're going to build

796
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:06,089
right yeah there's no such thing as a

797
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:08,609
free lunch except at vendor sponsored

798
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:11,579
sponsored conferences so what we want to

799
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:14,250
do here is say that is how we built it

800
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:16,079
now we need to use it and we need to

801
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,029
support this specific function that

802
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,599
we're talking about here where we can

803
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:23,250
add a hit to the system right so what I

804
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,409
want to do is I want to have a way of

805
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,900
adding a hit here it's gonna be crappy

806
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:29,580
and stupid and I won't really care too

807
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,870
much about how it works because again

808
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:32,210
it's only something that goes on when

809
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:34,289
the editor which means gonna be on

810
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,850
machines that people are trying to do

811
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:37,319
actual dev work on which means they

812
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:39,449
should be okay with things being a

813
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:40,679
little slower if they need to be so I'm

814
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,230
not gonna worry about the speed very

815
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,420
much here here's the asset index that

816
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,279
we're going to be editing and then here

817
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,529
on the tee hit I'm gonna put in the sort

818
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,059
key here like so and again like I said

819
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:52,379
we could make this be a bitmap ad if we

820
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,419
want to him not sure if you want to or

821
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,100
not but we definitely could that's

822
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,050
something we could do we can think about

823
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:59,549
later if we want to to add a layer of

824
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,680
type checking there in case we think

825
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:03,629
that's important at the moment I don't

826
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,549
think it is particularly important when

827
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,170
we go ahead and add in hit tests what

828
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,970
I'd like to do is make sure that there

829
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,960
actually is a hit test because this

830
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,279
shouldn't really be getting called

831
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,079
because it means you did a bunch of work

832
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,190
I don't want you to be adding hits in

833
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,269
that case because it means you did a

834
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,309
bunch of work you probably shouldn't

835
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,869
have done so let's take a look at what

836
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:20,730
happens here if we're looking at one of

837
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:22,979
these editable hit tests it means we

838
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,690
have a destination group in here that

839
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,769
destination group is important that's

840
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,710
the thing we're going to be working on

841
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:33,869
so here's the editable hit group I'm

842
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:35,970
sorry asset group I'll call that desk

843
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,500
group equals desk rip right just pulling

844
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:42,269
it out of here for easier Naaman clay

845
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:45,890
Chur the desk group I'm going to go

846
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:50,160
through the assets here and look to see

847
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:52,680
if I have one that's how should I put

848
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:57,360
this I'm going to look to see whether or

849
00:32:52,680 --> 00:33:00,779
not I should prefer this one to other

850
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:02,429
assets in the set right all the things

851
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:04,440
that are that are being in here so I'm

852
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,360
gonna use the sort key to just say look

853
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,980
we're going to do a few 16 may have been

854
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,808
a bit much so I think maybe what I'll

855
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:13,179
say is let's say that's not six

856
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:15,190
maybe it's it's more like eight let's

857
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:17,288
say furthermore I could just say that

858
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,239
asset camp isn't really a thing maybe

859
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:20,829
it's just assets and there's just eight

860
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:22,778
of them and we look through them I don't

861
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:26,618
know or maybe there aren't I don't know

862
00:33:22,778 --> 00:33:28,598
I'm not sure how I want to do that so

863
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:30,519
what I'm gonna do here is say let's look

864
00:33:28,598 --> 00:33:33,968
through these and compare and find a

865
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:37,239
place to add it I'll say asset hour

866
00:33:33,969 --> 00:33:42,159
sorry test index equals zero test index

867
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:44,759
is less than the desk group assets so

868
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:48,489
I'm just keeping eight of them for now

869
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:50,528
there's test index and so what I'd like

870
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:57,489
to do here is just look at each of these

871
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:59,138
editable assets and I'd like to see

872
00:33:57,489 --> 00:34:01,569
whether this one should be replaced or

873
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:04,209
not in fact I might call this desk right

874
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:07,509
so we'll look at this particular one and

875
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:11,769
we'll say all right if this particular

876
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:13,418
destination asset if it's sort key is

877
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:15,878
greater than the sort key that we've

878
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:18,699
received we would like to replace the

879
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:21,128
one that's here with the one that we're

880
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:24,338
getting now right so we want to move the

881
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:26,828
rest up if that makes sense

882
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:29,619
and so that's the case that would go

883
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:32,409
here if any other case we just proceed

884
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:35,108
so in the case that we go here then what

885
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:38,230
I'd like to do is do a copy so I'd like

886
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:40,808
to move everything up and then I would

887
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,579
like to insert the one so in this case

888
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:43,929
what I'm going to do is say I know I'm

889
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:45,490
gonna overwrite this so I'm going to

890
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:49,869
overwrite it with the one that I've got

891
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:51,459
right this is just an insertion and what

892
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:53,289
I'd like to do is just make room for it

893
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:56,260
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say

894
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:58,990
okay whatever however much the asset

895
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,650
count was that's how many I would have

896
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:06,548
to copy - the one that I'm on right so

897
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:08,950
if we look at what we've got here I've

898
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:11,139
got an array and I've got from my test

899
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:17,078
index as the one I'm overwriting so I've

900
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:18,460
got from there right excuse me up to the

901
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:21,809
asset count another way to write it

902
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,809
would look actually more like this

903
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:36,950
start at this one right I want to go

904
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:39,710
from the test index plus one and I want

905
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:42,829
to go upwards all the way till I get to

906
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:46,369
the end of I don't know why I didn't

907
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:49,190
type that I want to go to that get to

908
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:51,949
the end of the array right another way

909
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:55,940
to say it would be I want to see if I

910
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:58,189
can get to the end of asset count right

911
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,570
if we do it that way I don't know I

912
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:03,500
still don't know which way I want to

913
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:05,990
really write that right I want to go up

914
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,480
to there and I want to push everything

915
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:19,519
there one forward so I want to basically

916
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:24,050
say all right the copy index I want to

917
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:27,500
move everything up one unit so it always

918
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,940
wants to copy forward what you can see

919
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,250
from here is the problem going to have

920
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,230
is as I copy me over writing the things

921
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,659
that I would like to copy right because

922
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,329
it's gonna look like this but as I go

923
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:41,899
I'm always going to be copying

924
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:44,239
oops sorry that's not a man as I go I'm

925
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,190
always gonna be overwriting the thing

926
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,169
that I'm going to copy next with the

927
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,829
thing that was before it and that's not

928
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:55,940
gonna work

929
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:58,730
but again pretty easy to fix right could

930
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,970
do something like this now what we want

931
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:06,920
to do is we want to expand this array in

932
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:09,049
the case where we can so if we had an

933
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:18,200
asset count that's less than the maximum

934
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:23,210
asset count we can have right if it's

935
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:26,779
less I want to add right I want to add

936
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:29,179
some space and so once I do that this

937
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,730
becomes safe because I know that this is

938
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:34,009
always at least one or more so I can

939
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,329
always subtract one from it and say I

940
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:38,510
want to start there

941
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:42,769
I want to go backwards and I want to end

942
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:46,490
on the one I was going to fill out right

943
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:50,119
I want to end on the one I was going to

944
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:52,669
fill out so now I can just say look the

945
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:55,639
copy index always copies from the copy

946
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:57,800
index minus one so I go back until I

947
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:59,839
would have copied the one that I'm

948
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,610
actually gonna overwrite I copy that one

949
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:06,680
and I stop right at that point we're

950
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,240
pretty much done this maintains that

951
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:10,069
sort of list by just doing a simple

952
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,369
insertion sort on just a few things

953
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:16,340
right and pushing them up each time as I

954
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:19,309
go that's about all there is to it not a

955
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:21,079
lot more will do bug that routine typos

956
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:22,549
or slips of the minor common and these

957
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:24,230
sorts of things will debug that and

958
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,050
check the logic later but that's

959
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:28,429
basically all we need to do for add hit

960
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:31,880
so then that leaves us with just the

961
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:34,639
notion of the in-game editor to begin

962
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:40,329
with and we need some way of like you

963
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:44,029
know render or update and render editor

964
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:47,150
right and that's something that we're

965
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:50,780
going to have to that's gonna have to

966
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:56,930
process this like hit and you know

967
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:57,920
what's interesting about it is it really

968
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:01,190
doesn't need this because it's got a

969
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,159
pointer in it so at some level the hot

970
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,960
group that's that's in here it just

971
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,420
already knows everything that happened

972
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,309
cuz that's what it did so I don't really

973
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,960
know honestly if it needs to get past

974
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:15,590
that I don't necessarily think it really

975
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:19,960
does so probably more what we what we

976
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:19,960
actually have is something like this

977
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:43,579
something like this and so what really

978
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:47,889
what's going on here is we're just

979
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:50,599
saying alright there's one of these

980
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:53,569
we're gonna send back most of the time

981
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:55,819
not all time and what we're gonna do is

982
00:39:53,570 --> 00:40:03,800
this by the way we'll obviously want

983
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:07,460
this well what we want to do here is

984
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,950
we're gonna create this thing we're just

985
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:14,659
gonna say alright obviously this thing

986
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:18,980
points to the hot group right this

987
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:21,889
editable hit test oh no you know what it

988
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:28,250
does get sent in and out so I can do

989
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:30,170
what I was gonna do first right yeah so

990
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:37,179
never mind so we can do begin hit test

991
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:40,400
we can say add a little hit test result

992
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:43,219
so right we can do that we're gonna do

993
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,690
is I could return it as well I just am

994
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:46,819
not sure which one I want to do you know

995
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,139
maybe you do this I don't know so hard

996
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:53,230
to say so maybe we do something like

997
00:40:48,139 --> 00:40:59,659
that and then here we say and hit test

998
00:40:53,230 --> 00:41:00,949
right and we pass it in like that so I

999
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:03,170
think that's more or less what we'd want

1000
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:05,689
to do there we'd pass in the editable

1001
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,920
hit test we'd go I don't know maybe the

1002
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:12,460
only thing I don't like about that is we

1003
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,460
were sort of using the fit test

1004
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:20,090
so they don't like about that and you

1005
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,300
know what I don't I don't love that let

1006
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:28,579
me tell you what I like better I do I do

1007
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:31,130
think I like this better I think I like

1008
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:33,259
this better I think I like passing the

1009
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:44,390
hit test in and I think I like saying

1010
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:47,150
something like this and maybe we do that

1011
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:48,710
we basically say like look whether or

1012
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:52,550
not you should hit test is actually a

1013
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:54,190
separate setting and you always get one

1014
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,260
of these

1015
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:59,059
that you use and then you all sometimes

1016
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,730
they ask you a test and sometimes they

1017
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:07,090
don't you know I'm saying I like that a

1018
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:07,090
little bit better excuse me

1019
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:13,099
so they don't go with that I'm gonna say

1020
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:14,899
that the result desk group is the hot

1021
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:20,089
group which is exactly what I want there

1022
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:26,119
I'm gonna say that the hot group in this

1023
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:33,019
case - I want to clear it to zero

1024
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:39,739
I want inside my highlight color and I

1025
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:41,960
want to set that - exactly gonna set

1026
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:43,989
this to be the clip space Mouse pee and

1027
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:48,820
we'll play with these a little bit more

1028
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:51,679
highlight asset index it's gonna be zero

1029
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:53,450
so we're just gonna really do some

1030
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:56,239
arbitrary stuff here for the beginning

1031
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:58,159
hit test in the end hit test call not

1032
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,959
gonna do anything just yet we'll you'll

1033
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:03,019
see what we do there a little bit later

1034
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,940
on and then when we've got our should it

1035
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:07,340
test thing we're just gonna use whether

1036
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,869
the desk group was in or out what that

1037
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,490
means is that when I'm gonna come back

1038
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:12,829
here real quick and just when I was

1039
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:14,599
doing that if hip test I'm assuming we

1040
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:18,349
always hip test so I'm just gonna say

1041
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:20,529
look it's now it should hit test because

1042
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:24,110
I'm assuming always have one of those

1043
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:25,370
going on whenever we're in one of these

1044
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,079
routines and it's just a question of

1045
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,900
whether or not it would like us to do

1046
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:32,190
the extra

1047
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:35,338
sing or not right and so that way we can

1048
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:36,838
sort of take this out here and make this

1049
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:39,778
be something where we can always

1050
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:46,650
highlight regardless of whether or not

1051
00:43:39,778 --> 00:43:49,380
oops regardless of whether or not there

1052
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,599
is a hit test in progress we can

1053
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,278
actually always provide highlighting

1054
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,960
supports because that might be something

1055
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:56,849
that happens even when we're not trying

1056
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,190
to hit test and not trying to overwrite

1057
00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:01,200
any of that information so I think

1058
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:03,960
that's what I want here

1059
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:07,439
and that seems fine to me when we do our

1060
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,630
end hit test here what I'm gonna do is

1061
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,480
I'm gonna say look inside the in-game

1062
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:15,630
editor I'm gonna keep an idea of like

1063
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:19,199
what the like editing or what the active

1064
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:22,108
asset index is and I'm gonna go ahead

1065
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:23,909
and and preserve that value so for now

1066
00:44:22,108 --> 00:44:25,679
what I'll do is I'll just round trip it

1067
00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:30,358
always which is not what I will do

1068
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:33,210
eventually but I'll say active asset

1069
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:36,210
index here and then in here I'll rewrite

1070
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:40,619
it in so active asset index equals hit

1071
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:43,108
test highlight oops

1072
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:46,858
whatever the first one is in the hid so

1073
00:44:43,108 --> 00:44:52,619
basically I'll say it's equal to zero if

1074
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:54,630
we had a hit so if the hit test asset

1075
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:57,690
count was written zero because remember

1076
00:44:54,630 --> 00:45:00,329
we may not have any hits then the active

1077
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:07,380
asset index equals the hit test assets

1078
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:09,568
zero asset index right so that's really

1079
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,450
what I want to add that's really what I

1080
00:45:09,568 --> 00:45:16,639
wanted to do there and that'll all work

1081
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:25,139
just fine I think let me go back to

1082
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:26,759
handmade H and we've got this in-game

1083
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,558
editor here remember we're gonna have to

1084
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:36,440
include it so in here I'm gonna have to

1085
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:39,420
say like handmade in-game editor right

1086
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,250
and in here I should provide these

1087
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,818
functions that will be called by

1088
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,880
everyone

1089
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:46,920
the rest of these not really so it's

1090
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,900
really just these two that people might

1091
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,170
be calling the other ones are more

1092
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,389
specific and then inside handmade H I'll

1093
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:57,479
just include that as well make sure that

1094
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:59,458
gets compiled that should give me the

1095
00:45:57,478 --> 00:46:03,179
ability to actually put the editor in

1096
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:06,208
line now so what I can do is in this

1097
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:08,698
code now what we can do is say all right

1098
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:11,969
let's make sure that we begin the hit

1099
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:18,709
test as necessary so inside here the

1100
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:23,940
gamestate editor hears that hit test

1101
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:26,489
will allow it to begin a hit test as

1102
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:28,588
such and then what I'll do at the end

1103
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:30,690
here is a nd hit test and allow the

1104
00:46:28,588 --> 00:46:33,509
editor to do whatever it is the editor

1105
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:35,519
does right but we don't care

1106
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:38,009
and so in here we'll actually let the

1107
00:46:35,518 --> 00:46:40,649
editor do whatever it wants to do should

1108
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:43,079
it actually feel like it's editing and

1109
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:47,009
provide that hit testing information as

1110
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:49,619
well right so then that looks relatively

1111
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:51,929
clean to me that all looks like it would

1112
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:53,759
flow pretty nicely and so then what I

1113
00:46:51,929 --> 00:46:55,169
need to do is for the people in here

1114
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:56,759
we're actually know how to use it I have

1115
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:59,039
to pass down the hip test and that's

1116
00:46:56,759 --> 00:47:00,478
fine so then when I go into world mode

1117
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,559
now what you can see is update and

1118
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:07,558
render world is actually going to get

1119
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:09,359
that information passed into it now so

1120
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:18,989
in here we will essentially have a thing

1121
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:20,548
that says here's the hit test and that

1122
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:23,608
is the thing that will actually get

1123
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:25,679
passed down not the input when we go to

1124
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:28,108
the simulation and the rendering the

1125
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,778
entities and that sort of stuff those

1126
00:47:28,108 --> 00:47:32,278
things will actually the input will not

1127
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:34,619
be the thing that gets passed in

1128
00:47:32,278 --> 00:47:36,088
presumably anymore

1129
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,969
I can't remember what that was getting

1130
00:47:36,088 --> 00:47:42,619
used for exactly we look this up the

1131
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:42,619
other day and it was a little bit weird

1132
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:49,139
so it's brain input so I don't know how

1133
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:52,519
I feel about that either way the hit

1134
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:52,518
test is what comes in here

1135
00:47:53,509 --> 00:48:17,179
and that should be better here that is

1136
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:19,969
actually so that's a little bit of a

1137
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:22,989
problem because that wants a hit test

1138
00:48:19,969 --> 00:48:25,909
always like I say and in this case

1139
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:29,509
simulate wants to not do any hit testing

1140
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:36,709
at all that seems fine actually

1141
00:48:29,509 --> 00:48:43,909
so actually though what I can do is just

1142
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:47,078
pass a no one which is also totally

1143
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:47,079
valued valid

1144
00:48:55,030 --> 00:49:03,590
um that seems good I what's the problem

1145
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,650
here ed oblate it's not overload

1146
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:12,980
operator you're right about that

1147
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:23,300
I do not disagree and this will pick out

1148
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:27,139
just the X Y and then in here we've got

1149
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:29,080
our desk group so basically in here this

1150
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:31,849
is the thing that would have that in it

1151
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:37,610
and so what I can do here is also say

1152
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:38,929
like this is a should hit test call so

1153
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:41,059
really what I want to do is say hey look

1154
00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:42,829
if this thing was a hit testing then

1155
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:45,259
will up if this thing was a hit testing

1156
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:45,889
mode will update if it wasn't then we

1157
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:59,060
won't do that

1158
00:49:45,889 --> 00:50:00,379
right so that's good and then I think

1159
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:02,000
we're done

1160
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:06,500
so now hit testing should be happening

1161
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,659
in line pretty much all the time and so

1162
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,699
now we should go in and and make sure

1163
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:12,949
this stuff works one thing that's a

1164
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:15,769
little messed up actually you can see

1165
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:23,210
it's sort of happening right now is that

1166
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:26,119
I think asset index zero is used for

1167
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:27,800
entities that is also used for entities

1168
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:32,150
that just don't have any bitmap IDs on

1169
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:38,560
them so I kind of need to have a way of

1170
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:38,559
of not allowing that to be a valid hit

1171
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:47,529
you know what I'm saying so like in here

1172
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:47,530
we would sort of have to do like this

1173
00:50:56,548 --> 00:51:01,329
all right so now what I want to do is

1174
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:03,430
make sure that we can actually get that

1175
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:05,920
picking and doesn't look like it's quite

1176
00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:07,208
going through correctly at the moment so

1177
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,548
I want to look at what's going on there

1178
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:16,448
so if the desk group is not equal to

1179
00:51:09,548 --> 00:51:26,349
zero we're gonna update Jimmy to be

1180
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:29,440
whatever the first asset is Oh duh so in

1181
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:32,440
here we never allow ourselves to append

1182
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:35,679
which we kind of want to do so what we'd

1183
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,259
like to do is yeah this this loop is not

1184
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:46,538
really done yet so what we do want to do

1185
00:51:38,259 --> 00:51:50,108
here is say something more like well in

1186
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:52,719
this case we break right and if we

1187
00:51:50,108 --> 00:52:01,838
didn't add so you know something like

1188
00:51:52,719 --> 00:52:15,759
added equals false right if we didn't

1189
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:18,219
add it and we could have added it then

1190
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:19,929
we want to just append it and there's

1191
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:24,099
probably a better way to write this loop

1192
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:26,409
it looks a little messy right now so I

1193
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:30,099
feel like we probably could do a better

1194
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:30,659
job with that but basically this is all

1195
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:36,670
I'm saying

1196
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:39,489
so like yeah if we didn't add one then

1197
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:42,068
and there was room we need to add one

1198
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:45,329
rights that way we can continue to stack

1199
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:45,329
them up here I mean

1200
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:59,259
so now as you can see we can pick

1201
00:52:54,818 --> 00:53:01,478
anything that we want to and anything

1202
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:04,119
that shares that asset ID will get

1203
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:06,368
highlighted because we reading all of

1204
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:09,608
that now you can see we highlight the

1205
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:11,890
actual one that you're on and we also

1206
00:53:09,608 --> 00:53:14,619
highlight all the other ones maybe a

1207
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:20,248
little too much right so maybe we want

1208
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:25,358
to change that to something much more I

1209
00:53:20,248 --> 00:53:28,118
don't know much dimmer right so you can

1210
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:31,179
kind of see like it highlights them very

1211
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:31,960
very faintly or maybe we don't want to

1212
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:38,798
highlight them at all

1213
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:42,099
I don't know right it's hard to say yeah

1214
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:44,579
I don't really know how to I don't

1215
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:49,509
really know what we want to do with this

1216
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:51,910
we'll see because yeah it's sort of an

1217
00:53:49,509 --> 00:54:02,048
open question I'm not sure which we want

1218
00:53:51,909 --> 00:54:12,009
to do there yeah sorry I just don't know

1219
00:54:02,048 --> 00:54:15,190
um so anyway what I'd like to do is play

1220
00:54:12,009 --> 00:54:18,369
with this a little more now so let's

1221
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:22,028
suppose I want to do something where I'm

1222
00:54:18,369 --> 00:54:26,019
going to show the bitmap assets that we

1223
00:54:22,028 --> 00:54:28,268
actually have listed in here and you

1224
00:54:26,018 --> 00:54:31,298
know we did some nice work here with the

1225
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:34,268
HHA edit stuff where we can dump an

1226
00:54:31,298 --> 00:54:38,018
asset and we wrote some code that like

1227
00:54:34,268 --> 00:54:41,949
kind of like does a good job of dumping

1228
00:54:38,018 --> 00:54:44,139
out what's going on it shows asset names

1229
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:46,118
and where they came from and which

1230
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:47,528
spritesheet and all that stuff so what

1231
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,818
I'd like to do is end the errors

1232
00:54:47,528 --> 00:54:50,949
remember I wanted to keep the errors

1233
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:55,538
there too so I'd like to be able to get

1234
00:54:50,949 --> 00:54:58,108
all that stuff out into the actual game

1235
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:59,820
as well where it can sort of print out

1236
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:01,798
everything that we

1237
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:04,869
[Music]

1238
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:09,219
and then allow us to edit those things

1239
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:18,249
in some way right allow us to make some

1240
00:55:09,219 --> 00:55:19,749
sense of it right and I don't have a

1241
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,818
really good plan for that so I'm just

1242
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:23,409
gonna sketch out some stuff and then

1243
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,998
start implementing it right because we

1244
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:27,728
have the ability to do that now so I'm

1245
00:55:24,998 --> 00:55:29,768
just going to do it uh so in the in-game

1246
00:55:27,728 --> 00:55:31,929
editor what I'd like to do so let's do a

1247
00:55:29,768 --> 00:55:39,328
couple things here let's just say first

1248
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:52,659
of all you know we want the ability to

1249
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:54,130
have a mode probably in the editor so

1250
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:56,379
there's like an edit mode where we're

1251
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:59,739
not editing there's an edit mode where

1252
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:02,380
we're like you know Asset picking or

1253
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:03,789
something I don't know I mean you know

1254
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,798
what I'm not gonna fill these in I'm

1255
00:56:03,789 --> 00:56:09,190
just gonna say well we know there's

1256
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:11,498
gonna be some modes right and I'll just

1257
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,729
call it editing for now because all I

1258
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:15,338
really want is brilliant but we'll

1259
00:56:12,728 --> 00:56:18,189
probably expand that notion out a little

1260
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:20,978
bit more so in here I'm gonna say like

1261
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:23,889
mode and that's the mode that we're in

1262
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:34,509
and then we got like what we reading is

1263
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:36,759
listed here and I'm gonna say I'm gonna

1264
00:56:34,509 --> 00:56:39,880
say that like probably there's just a

1265
00:56:36,759 --> 00:56:45,278
keyboard shortcut or something that does

1266
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:47,920
this because there is I don't know and I

1267
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:51,759
would like that to be something that's

1268
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:54,430
like toggleable and and whatnot so we

1269
00:56:51,759 --> 00:56:56,440
run pretty quickly into some issues here

1270
00:56:54,429 --> 00:57:01,989
that we're gonna have these are very

1271
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:03,969
centralized issues that that you have

1272
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:05,409
really in any situation once we

1273
00:57:03,969 --> 00:57:07,088
introduce an editor layer we're gonna

1274
00:57:05,409 --> 00:57:11,259
have to be careful to make sure that

1275
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:13,690
when we do things in the editor they can

1276
00:57:11,259 --> 00:57:14,980
prevent further action from being taken

1277
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:17,858
downstream in the game

1278
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:19,780
and the reason for this is let's suppose

1279
00:57:17,858 --> 00:57:21,429
that we want to be able to type in a

1280
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:25,570
value like we want to be able to type in

1281
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:28,179
1.0 or something well if the one or the

1282
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:30,039
period or the zero key or something or

1283
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:35,889
let's just say we want to type in a name

1284
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:37,779
like what wh 80 the W key is the a

1285
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:41,139
movement key and the hero would start

1286
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:42,940
hopping around right so we want to make

1287
00:57:41,139 --> 00:57:44,259
sure that we have ways of differential

1288
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:46,750
regions so that's another reason for

1289
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:49,450
this will probably tie in this editor

1290
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:51,190
mode will tie that in to our input

1291
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:55,529
processing loop so that input processing

1292
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:55,530
is suppressed when we are editing

1293
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,320
alright so I'm gonna go into edit mode

1294
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:04,539
here and I'm gonna say that when we do

1295
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:11,680
begin hit test I'm gonna say that if the

1296
00:58:04,539 --> 00:58:13,659
editor mode equals edit mode you know

1297
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:17,649
editing then it will fill out the hit

1298
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:19,719
test and if not then it won't and so

1299
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:23,349
that way what'll happen is right off the

1300
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:26,500
bat in that situation because it's

1301
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:30,219
initialized to zero that the editor will

1302
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:32,530
by default not be picking things right

1303
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:34,539
so what I'd like to do is then add a

1304
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:37,180
toggle so we can get in and out of that

1305
00:58:34,539 --> 00:58:39,070
mode as necessary what we can do there

1306
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:41,589
is when we're in our begin hit test call

1307
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:51,820
we could take a look at the input and

1308
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:53,500
the game input there we go inside the

1309
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:56,500
game is but we have information that we

1310
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,480
can use here F key pressed basically

1311
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:01,300
lets us know which one of these things

1312
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:04,929
is going down or up so what we could do

1313
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:09,160
here is say look if the input F key

1314
00:59:04,929 --> 00:59:13,859
pressed for you know let's say I'm going

1315
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:17,359
to use f9

1316
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:17,360
[Music]

1317
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:28,999
so let's say I say we've got fq press 9

1318
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:30,498
that's gonna put me into my edit mode or

1319
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:35,298
maybe that's going to take me out of it

1320
00:59:30,498 --> 00:59:39,468
maybe let's do it this way so I'll just

1321
00:59:35,298 --> 00:59:44,599
look at these FK presses here so if I'm

1322
00:59:39,469 --> 00:59:48,139
in my edit mode or not I can just toggle

1323
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:50,749
between them with an F key press so when

1324
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:52,129
I'm actually and you know I look at it

1325
00:59:50,748 --> 00:59:53,988
I'm not thrilled with it I think maybe

1326
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:56,088
f1 and f2 might be better

1327
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:58,568
I think those were locked to other

1328
00:59:56,088 --> 01:00:04,338
things but I kind of liked the idea of

1329
00:59:58,568 --> 01:00:05,989
loops it should probably on the left

1330
01:00:04,338 --> 01:00:07,460
hand because I'm using the mouse I don't

1331
01:00:05,989 --> 01:00:10,548
want to go all the way over to f9 and

1332
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:12,999
f10 really but we'll see we'll see how

1333
01:00:10,548 --> 01:00:12,998
we go with that

1334
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:23,420
so there's edit mode on and off and I

1335
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:27,440
may have some more edit modes that I

1336
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:31,608
want to put in there right so there's my

1337
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:35,298
edit mode it's all good and now we'll go

1338
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:39,108
ahead and actually put in some time

1339
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:40,429
display so like I said don't really know

1340
01:00:39,108 --> 01:00:42,409
what kind of editing we're really gonna

1341
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:45,228
be doing here exactly but you know so

1342
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:48,068
let's you know say that this you know I

1343
01:00:45,228 --> 01:00:55,068
guess we kind of do know here we're like

1344
01:00:48,068 --> 01:00:57,409
editing bitmap right so we're editing

1345
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:59,268
bitmaps in this case what that means is

1346
01:00:57,409 --> 01:01:02,118
when they head and hit test comes on I

1347
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:05,179
can't do something like we do in the

1348
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:06,769
debug UI so in here where we've kind of

1349
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:08,868
got this you know we've got these

1350
01:01:06,768 --> 01:01:11,598
notions of text ops and all this sort of

1351
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:14,028
thing right what I want to do is

1352
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:21,229
something very similar that so when when

1353
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:23,389
we go ahead and do our like debug sort

1354
01:01:21,228 --> 01:01:25,460
of setup there and we kind of give

1355
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:27,230
ourselves a drawing surface we really

1356
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:30,530
just wanted you that

1357
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:34,070
so in here where we set everything up

1358
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:37,160
right and we do our debug in it that's

1359
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:42,080
really what we want to be doing so we

1360
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:43,429
wanna we want our our debugging it where

1361
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,179
we do like the width and height and that

1362
01:01:43,429 --> 01:01:46,250
sort of stuff right

1363
01:01:44,179 --> 01:01:49,549
we want our debug stuff to follow this

1364
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:52,489
this rule and so in order to do that we

1365
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:54,349
need to create a render group and to

1366
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:56,149
create a render group we just need to

1367
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:58,660
call begin and clear out the depth

1368
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:00,410
buffer so that we don't have any depth

1369
01:01:58,659 --> 01:02:04,009
fighting with with stuff that's

1370
01:02:00,409 --> 01:02:05,089
underneath what we're trying to draw so

1371
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:09,980
I'm just gonna have a function here

1372
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:12,289
called like render editor or update and

1373
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:15,740
render editor or something like that so

1374
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:24,320
inside and hit test we're gonna call out

1375
01:02:15,739 --> 01:02:28,879
to that and that's going to take our

1376
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:31,900
editor and it's gonna do a render group

1377
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:34,700
it's gonna need the game render commands

1378
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:38,300
probably the assets that's well in order

1379
01:02:34,699 --> 01:02:42,069
to draw from the font because it needs

1380
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:44,720
that information right it needs to know

1381
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:48,859
which kind of font is going there I

1382
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:52,399
don't remember push font to be honest

1383
01:02:48,858 --> 01:02:55,789
with you I don't really remember what

1384
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,139
that does that's like one of those

1385
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:58,940
things that you're just like alright I'm

1386
01:02:57,139 --> 01:03:01,250
sure that does something cool but I have

1387
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:05,119
no idea what it was even though I wrote

1388
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:06,710
it still don't know and so you know what

1389
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,910
maybe from here too I could actually I

1390
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:13,730
could make this be something that's

1391
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:15,019
called from outside right so updating

1392
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:22,690
render editor could get these things

1393
01:03:15,019 --> 01:03:27,380
that's pretty straightforward yeah

1394
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:29,690
so if I'm going to do that I need to

1395
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:31,818
make a camera transform that gives me

1396
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:34,369
what I want which i think is basically

1397
01:03:31,818 --> 01:03:42,190
this so I can basically say look give me

1398
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:45,260
a camera transform say render group here

1399
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:47,059
give me a camera transform that's just

1400
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:50,950
going to be an orthographic projection

1401
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:55,190
with no clipping to speak up really and

1402
01:03:50,949 --> 01:03:58,879
that's what we're gonna draw to and then

1403
01:03:55,190 --> 01:04:01,700
I should be able to just dump text you

1404
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:07,579
know text down into there and I think

1405
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:09,980
inside the text op stuff I'm not really

1406
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:12,500
sure to what extent the debug state is

1407
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:19,358
really necessary I think it just gets

1408
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:23,000
the font from those things you know and

1409
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:25,009
so I think we could expand this text up

1410
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,219
to be something we can use pretty much

1411
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:35,839
anywhere that we want to and that might

1412
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:39,528
be good so we can get the size to so

1413
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:41,088
this seems good to me you know so I

1414
01:04:39,528 --> 01:04:43,250
think we'll maybe make this into a more

1415
01:04:41,088 --> 01:04:45,318
general routine right we'll make this

1416
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:48,079
into a routine that that can be used

1417
01:04:45,318 --> 01:04:51,250
anywhere and that maybe you use as a

1418
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:53,420
render group more if that makes sense

1419
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:56,019
somebody tell me what push font is

1420
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,019
because I've known

1421
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:08,459
so okay so what pushpot does is it just

1422
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:08,459
makes sure that the font is loaded

1423
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:25,318
I mean that that's all does it doesn't

1424
01:05:22,778 --> 01:05:25,318
do nothing else

1425
01:05:41,509 --> 01:05:46,179
that is is not what I was looking for

1426
01:05:52,530 --> 01:06:07,740
so what does it actually load it just it

1427
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:16,679
just loads the the like glyph and

1428
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:19,889
Unicode map that that's it right it

1429
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:29,809
doesn't load the bitmap IDs so you know

1430
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:35,009
I would say to be honest uh that was not

1431
01:06:29,809 --> 01:06:37,429
probably a very good idea so you know

1432
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:40,680
I'm not gonna change it right now but

1433
01:06:37,429 --> 01:06:45,059
you really don't need to do that like

1434
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:48,119
for a game we can just keep the the font

1435
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:52,519
tables in memory so I think those could

1436
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:54,690
have just been in the hhas as

1437
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:58,829
permanently loaded data that doesn't

1438
01:06:54,690 --> 01:07:02,010
need to get loaded delayed because they

1439
01:06:58,829 --> 01:07:03,929
just don't take up that much room the

1440
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:05,910
number we're not gonna have very many

1441
01:07:03,929 --> 01:07:07,769
fonts you know there's gonna be like 10

1442
01:07:05,909 --> 01:07:10,409
fonts in the whole game tops or

1443
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:13,679
something so you're talking about like

1444
01:07:10,409 --> 01:07:17,279
you know 200k or 300k of data or

1445
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,750
something like this it just doesn't make

1446
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,310
a lot of sense to have gone through that

1447
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:28,550
extra effort so that was probably dumb

1448
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:28,549
and didn't really need to happen

1449
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:41,369
you know I'm saying to you so oh well

1450
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:44,099
you know don't know why we made that

1451
01:07:41,369 --> 01:07:48,559
decision but we know we could find out

1452
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:51,750
why because we can go back to the

1453
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:55,798
handmade hero archives and look but I

1454
01:07:51,750 --> 01:08:03,838
don't know why because I forgot so

1455
01:07:55,798 --> 01:08:05,818
anyway let's go ahead and keep going and

1456
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:09,869
we can get the font stuff straightened

1457
01:08:05,818 --> 01:08:14,880
out so inside our debug UI stuff like I

1458
01:08:09,869 --> 01:08:19,949
saying you know we've got the font and

1459
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:21,179
font info stuff here and we we can go

1460
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:23,159
ahead and do exactly the same thing

1461
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:25,670
inside the in-game editor right so then

1462
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:29,099
we get our font stuff straightened out

1463
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:33,810
that font stuff is I assume just yeah

1464
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:39,329
like pretty basic like loaded font in

1465
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:41,600
HHA font so we can get those two pretty

1466
01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:41,600
easily

1467
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:53,350
I think that's all good

1468
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:58,030
render groups when you call begin render

1469
01:08:53,350 --> 01:09:01,210
group I don't actually remember does

1470
01:08:58,029 --> 01:09:03,779
that return it though wholesale to you

1471
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:07,779
[Music]

1472
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:15,369
yeah so I thought so it should really

1473
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:18,069
look like that more like that

1474
01:09:15,369 --> 01:09:22,029
and as far as font idea is concerned I

1475
01:09:18,069 --> 01:09:24,338
don't really know exactly how we get the

1476
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:31,599
font ID for the debug system in the

1477
01:09:24,338 --> 01:09:34,890
first place let's take a look so we just

1478
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:38,650
we just do it this way so we we look for

1479
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:40,869
a debug font and the same would probably

1480
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:43,389
be true here right and so we could do

1481
01:09:40,869 --> 01:09:45,399
this on initialization as well and we

1482
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:48,130
probably will in the future for right

1483
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:53,049
now I'm going to leave it like that and

1484
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:54,609
we'll get the font ID here so this would

1485
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:58,840
give us the ability to start rendering

1486
01:09:54,609 --> 01:10:01,539
text is fine and so you know let me just

1487
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:04,989
compile to get rid of the bugs here the

1488
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:11,619
typos and such so we need to specify the

1489
01:10:04,989 --> 01:10:15,840
width size that can come straight out of

1490
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:15,840
the commands there probably right

1491
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:26,140
so we have our window with and window

1492
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:28,839
height right here and that's presumably

1493
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:33,430
all we actually need so I'm just gonna

1494
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:37,779
say that the width and height of this

1495
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:51,789
system come from the commands window

1496
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:55,000
width and window height that may be

1497
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:57,369
about it what I do need to do is call

1498
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,899
this because no one will be calling it

1499
01:10:57,369 --> 01:11:01,689
so at the end of hand-made where I

1500
01:10:58,899 --> 01:11:03,279
finished the hip test at some point here

1501
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:06,460
we need to update and render the editor

1502
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:08,500
which I guess I can do here and that

1503
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:10,659
provides us an easy way to do it because

1504
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,560
we are slipstreaming the render commands

1505
01:11:10,659 --> 01:11:14,019
here and that's pretty straightforward

1506
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:16,780
we also know that we do have the game

1507
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:20,230
assets in tow because those would have

1508
01:11:16,779 --> 01:11:22,179
had to be initialized right up here so

1509
01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:23,979
we can pass those as well so everything

1510
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:26,560
is in a good position at this point in

1511
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:35,709
the code to ask the renderer to to

1512
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:37,750
render so now we need to do is actually

1513
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:39,699
try to have a way to leverage our

1514
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:43,000
existing display code so we don't have

1515
01:11:39,699 --> 01:11:45,399
to write it all multiple times that

1516
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,020
shouldn't be too hard either so ok again

1517
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:48,969
we get back to where we were so you can

1518
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:51,880
see we're just kind of doing our thing

1519
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:53,829
here and that's all fine so now what I

1520
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:56,800
want to do is make a way of displaying

1521
01:11:53,829 --> 01:11:59,380
that information if I go over to the

1522
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,210
debug UI stuff and I look at that text

1523
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:05,529
up again I think these are the sorts of

1524
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:07,810
calls that I want to be able to make

1525
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:09,639
here what you can see from them is that

1526
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:11,980
they take the debug state and that's

1527
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:13,660
really the thing that would prevent me

1528
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:15,339
from be able to use them the rest of

1529
01:12:13,659 --> 01:12:18,729
stuff like drawing size text I could

1530
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:21,310
just use exactly it is and so really

1531
01:12:18,729 --> 01:12:23,799
it's it's this debug state that would

1532
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:26,350
cause the problem what I can look at

1533
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:29,020
here in doing is making this into a more

1534
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:31,270
generic piece of code that can be used

1535
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,040
so that I don't have to worry as much

1536
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:38,850
about that

1537
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:49,199
right and some of the other things here

1538
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:50,910
even probably could be used as well like

1539
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:52,710
just looking at these sorts of things

1540
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:54,510
here right you can see like a lot of

1541
01:12:52,710 --> 01:13:00,270
these things or things that I might want

1542
01:12:54,510 --> 01:13:04,949
to use tooltips for example so I kind of

1543
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:07,920
feel like this debug UI thing and the

1544
01:13:04,949 --> 01:13:11,010
layouts as well it feels to me like this

1545
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:14,250
probably just wants to actually be moved

1546
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:25,590
into something that can be used without

1547
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:27,300
the debug system right so I think really

1548
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:29,130
we can lean on a lot of this code I

1549
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:31,409
think a lot of this code we can just

1550
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:35,909
kind of like clean up and package into

1551
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:37,829
sort of a generic like UI displaying

1552
01:13:35,909 --> 01:13:43,769
thing and we don't really have to

1553
01:13:37,829 --> 01:13:45,210
rewrite it you know it looks like we've

1554
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:47,550
got all the stuff here that we would

1555
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:49,140
want and so what we want to do is take

1556
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:51,449
it out of the debug system so that you

1557
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:54,990
don't have to be using it for the

1558
01:13:51,449 --> 01:13:56,909
express purpose of debugging so that it

1559
01:13:54,989 --> 01:13:58,590
can be used for an in-game editing

1560
01:13:56,909 --> 01:14:00,739
operation that's supposed to ship with

1561
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:03,390
the game and not necessarily compile out

1562
01:14:00,739 --> 01:14:10,109
but who knows these things may kind of

1563
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:11,430
merge slowly over time too it's hard to

1564
01:14:10,109 --> 01:14:13,229
say because we may want to ship with

1565
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:15,090
something but you know we don't we

1566
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:16,619
fundamentally don't want the debug

1567
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:17,400
system to have to run at runtime because

1568
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,229
it's too slow

1569
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:20,309
so we do kind of want to make a little

1570
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:22,589
bit of a distinction between those two

1571
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:25,950
things right so I think I'm going to

1572
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:30,060
keep that going for now I would like to

1573
01:14:25,949 --> 01:14:31,939
know why I think like is hex could be

1574
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:33,840
something that's kind of in the generic

1575
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:35,429
library that we've got here you know

1576
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:39,920
we've got a bunch of stuff here for that

1577
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:44,670
sort of thing and I do kind of feel like

1578
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:45,748
you know we there's there's really no

1579
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:49,439
reason not to have

1580
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:52,438
be in here you know we've got is white

1581
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:53,999
space so why not a new tax right so I

1582
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:55,798
think it is hex would be totally

1583
01:14:53,998 --> 01:14:57,358
reasonable I think a get hex would be

1584
01:14:55,798 --> 01:15:02,399
totally reasonable to put in here as

1585
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:02,999
well that's right those seem really

1586
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:06,619
straightforward

1587
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:11,059
I feel like get hex would maybe already

1588
01:15:06,618 --> 01:15:11,058
have existed to like

1589
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:28,130
uh so I guess we didn't have a hexlen

1590
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:28,909
that maybe that's the only one so that's

1591
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:32,810
fine I guess

1592
01:15:28,909 --> 01:15:34,609
you know totally fine let's keep moving

1593
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:36,590
forward so I'm gonna look at the debug

1594
01:15:34,609 --> 01:15:38,659
UI stuff and maybe like I said pull that

1595
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:41,210
out into just generic UI so we might not

1596
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:43,430
call this debug UI anymore let's take a

1597
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:44,359
look at debug interaction I want to

1598
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:46,190
understand that a little bit better

1599
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:51,380
because that may want to move into the

1600
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:54,109
debug system only not sure that's pretty

1601
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:55,640
hard to determine but this stuff you can

1602
01:15:54,109 --> 01:15:56,899
see so other than the fact that it has

1603
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:59,750
the debug state in it

1604
01:15:56,899 --> 01:16:03,199
this layout stuff is otherwise pretty

1605
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:09,189
you know pretty pretty not that for lack

1606
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:09,189
of a better term it allows us mostly to

1607
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:13,420
it looks like it allows us mostly just

1608
01:16:11,869 --> 01:16:17,779
program it the way we would want

1609
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:23,210
let me try putting this in to sort of a

1610
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:26,449
handmade UI or handmade well you know

1611
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:34,250
handmade debug UI is not a bad name for

1612
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:36,649
it because it kind of is for that but I

1613
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:38,329
feel like maybe handmade developer UI is

1614
01:16:36,649 --> 01:16:40,489
better because it's not necessarily for

1615
01:16:38,329 --> 01:16:42,500
debugging but it's only for editing I

1616
01:16:40,489 --> 01:16:44,359
don't know it's really hard call but

1617
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:46,220
let's take a look and see what would

1618
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:51,739
happen if we were to sort of make these

1619
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:53,990
things a little bit more generic so I'm

1620
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:55,219
gonna look at interactions are equal and

1621
01:16:53,989 --> 01:17:02,329
I want to see where that's getting

1622
01:16:55,220 --> 01:17:07,190
called traction is hot so here's an end

1623
01:17:02,329 --> 01:17:08,840
element call right and you can see it's

1624
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:10,729
using this interaction thing to see

1625
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:16,940
whether or not it's something that

1626
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:19,579
should be interacted with in the debug

1627
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:21,859
state but you know again that

1628
01:17:19,579 --> 01:17:24,369
interaction could be very made very

1629
01:17:21,859 --> 01:17:24,369
generic

1630
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:45,469
so yeah it's laughs I'm just not sure

1631
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,170
where I want to break this code off

1632
01:17:45,469 --> 01:18:00,770
because one way to do it is to just use

1633
01:17:48,170 --> 01:18:03,890
the the drawing bits and so I'm just not

1634
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:06,500
sure whether you know which is those I

1635
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:11,079
want to do - I just want to do the

1636
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:11,079
drawing bits or would I rather

1637
01:18:27,229 --> 01:18:36,209
and I'm not sure what I want to do on

1638
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:39,690
this side of the code might be

1639
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:45,180
instructive to look at so maybe I want

1640
01:18:39,689 --> 01:18:49,339
to do something come to me and say look

1641
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:49,340
if the editor mode is not equal to none

1642
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:57,569
right so if we're gonna be doing some

1643
01:18:52,109 --> 01:18:59,789
editing I'll do this stuff and then I'm

1644
01:18:57,569 --> 01:19:05,009
gonna look and see well what mode am I

1645
01:18:59,789 --> 01:19:15,090
actually in and if I'm in the bitmap

1646
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:20,869
editing mode then I'll do like some kind

1647
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:20,869
of call here like or like I don't know

1648
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:29,700
you know what I mean

1649
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:31,800
and so in here what I want to do is say

1650
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:33,689
well there's a bitmap editor right and

1651
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:36,570
so the bitmap editor wants to do some

1652
01:19:33,689 --> 01:19:41,099
stuff with the information that it has

1653
01:19:36,569 --> 01:19:43,769
accessible to it right so it wants to be

1654
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:46,380
able to say something like I know I've

1655
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:48,090
got an active asset index so I would

1656
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:51,659
like to display the information about

1657
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:53,190
that particular asset right which we

1658
01:19:51,659 --> 01:19:56,760
kind of know what that looks like

1659
01:19:53,189 --> 01:20:00,799
because we know it looks like this so I

1660
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,800
probably want to do something like this

1661
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:14,869
well I guess you know we could just have

1662
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:23,409
that the inline with it right you know

1663
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:23,409
it could be something more like this um

1664
01:20:24,939 --> 01:20:37,460
where's that sitting so if we're in the

1665
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:42,010
asset edit mode you know then we want to

1666
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:42,010
basically do something like this right

1667
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:52,730
and so in here when we're in the asset

1668
01:20:49,789 --> 01:20:56,720
editor we want to be able to print this

1669
01:20:52,729 --> 01:20:58,609
out right and in here there should be

1670
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:02,659
something which which lets us sort of do

1671
01:20:58,609 --> 01:21:05,719
each of these individual things so in

1672
01:21:02,659 --> 01:21:09,189
handmade asset h you know i need to be

1673
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:09,190
able to get one of these assets

1674
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:18,950
excuse me out so i want to be able to

1675
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:23,630
get you know an asset so i want to go

1676
01:21:18,949 --> 01:21:26,029
say asset equals you know get asset in

1677
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:28,640
the asset system and I know that the one

1678
01:21:26,029 --> 01:21:31,429
that I'm looking at is like the active

1679
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:35,990
asset index right so we want to be able

1680
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:39,140
to get that out I probably need to say

1681
01:21:35,989 --> 01:21:41,779
something like you know if the active

1682
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:44,480
asset index is not equal to zero you

1683
01:21:41,779 --> 01:21:50,239
know what I mean I could also do it more

1684
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:51,500
like this right and I'm not sure you

1685
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:54,649
know exactly what that look like but

1686
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:57,109
we'll look at that in a second so then

1687
01:21:54,649 --> 01:21:59,359
in here you know we've we know we've got

1688
01:21:57,109 --> 01:22:02,960
a couple different things so we know

1689
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:07,369
we've got the HHA asset and that's going

1690
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:11,390
to be equal to the asset HHA thing and i

1691
01:22:07,369 --> 01:22:14,470
might just call that hij for now we know

1692
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:14,470
we've got the annotation

1693
01:22:16,469 --> 01:22:21,130
so I've got those two pieces of

1694
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,420
information here we've got a header I

1695
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:24,550
don't know that I care about the header

1696
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:26,920
much we've got kind of the file indexed

1697
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:29,920
stuff what I can do is pull the file out

1698
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:33,489
so you know I can also grab the file

1699
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:44,500
that you know that it came from because

1700
01:22:33,488 --> 01:22:46,539
I know that as well like so and that

1701
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:52,020
gives me I think most of the things that

1702
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:57,819
we would be looking at here as I go so

1703
01:22:52,020 --> 01:23:01,570
in in this case I then want to more or

1704
01:22:57,819 --> 01:23:07,719
less do this you know what I mean I want

1705
01:23:01,569 --> 01:23:10,238
to be able to like I want to be able to

1706
01:23:07,719 --> 01:23:15,420
put all this information in there right

1707
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:20,169
so I want to do something like all right

1708
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:22,389
all of the like a piece of lint floating

1709
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:24,819
by me I want to be able to put the

1710
01:23:22,389 --> 01:23:31,500
errors in there you know I want to be

1711
01:23:24,819 --> 01:23:31,500
able to put put the tags in there I

1712
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:43,479
don't care about this because that's

1713
01:23:35,619 --> 01:23:44,800
just a global tag list so yeah so I want

1714
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:50,669
to just be able to put all this stuff in

1715
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:50,670
there now the hh8 annotation stuff I

1716
01:23:51,149 --> 01:23:58,888
don't actually load any of that

1717
01:23:55,420 --> 01:24:04,270
information in the annotation part is

1718
01:23:58,889 --> 01:24:10,179
not saved if I remember correctly so

1719
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:13,060
like we would have to issue file reads

1720
01:24:10,179 --> 01:24:15,429
to get that information and so at the

1721
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:22,690
moment I feel like the way we would get

1722
01:24:15,429 --> 01:24:26,889
that is probably also by having the

1723
01:24:22,689 --> 01:24:29,669
loaded asset thing so meaning we would

1724
01:24:26,889 --> 01:24:29,670
kind of need

1725
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:40,178
we would kind of need that load as well

1726
01:24:36,099 --> 01:24:48,460
like we would need this same concept in

1727
01:24:40,179 --> 01:24:51,059
here this thing would need to exist in

1728
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:51,059
both places

1729
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:57,569
and I could literally just copy it out

1730
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:16,299
which I might want to do yeah I think I

1731
01:25:14,349 --> 01:25:19,840
do want to do that and then we can do is

1732
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:22,300
we can lazily load those potentially so

1733
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,389
we don't actually load them in normally

1734
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:26,349
but if someone starts editing we would

1735
01:25:24,389 --> 01:25:29,859
would be I guess the way that I would

1736
01:25:26,349 --> 01:25:35,710
put that so the loaded HHA annotation is

1737
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:42,789
just like well you know that's what

1738
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:46,658
happens if you load one of these in like

1739
01:25:42,789 --> 01:25:49,319
so and so you know we we would do

1740
01:25:46,658 --> 01:25:49,319
something like this

1741
01:25:58,739 --> 01:26:04,059
so I can call the asset system and say

1742
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:05,680
hey I need the annotation for this thing

1743
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:08,710
because I'm an editor and I need that

1744
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:11,970
sort of thing so you need to give me

1745
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:17,730
that right and off we go

1746
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:17,730
so once I do that and this could be like

1747
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:24,789
marked as such so you know that these

1748
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:26,440
are not calls that like are supposed to

1749
01:26:24,789 --> 01:26:28,569
be happening in the normal course of

1750
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:31,539
gameplay they're just things that are

1751
01:26:28,569 --> 01:26:36,099
supposed to be happening when an editor

1752
01:26:31,539 --> 01:26:39,189
kicks in right which is legal in the

1753
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:41,950
release mode it's just not performance

1754
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:44,139
oriented tested well whatever like it's

1755
01:26:41,949 --> 01:26:46,539
like kind of a spec fringe thing that

1756
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:51,789
only a developer is gonna be using

1757
01:26:46,539 --> 01:26:56,920
potentially right so I think that's what

1758
01:26:51,789 --> 01:27:03,069
we would like to do here that is what

1759
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:04,300
makes sense to me anyway yeah so then I

1760
01:27:03,069 --> 01:27:05,920
just want to dump everything right I

1761
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:08,289
want a way to like dump everything and

1762
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:19,720
so I want to do like you know something

1763
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:22,829
like this so I want to do something like

1764
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:26,740
I can do a begin section sort of thing

1765
01:27:22,829 --> 01:27:30,420
and I want to be able to put some

1766
01:27:26,739 --> 01:27:35,159
information probably on that line

1767
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:35,159
something of this section would be like

1768
01:27:45,689 --> 01:27:51,129
so what I kinda wanna do here to say

1769
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:53,710
like look it's it's sort of an if sort

1770
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:57,690
of thing so I want to kind of do a thing

1771
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:57,689
where I'm like look this is a section

1772
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:05,710
and maybe I have two ways of printing

1773
01:28:02,738 --> 01:28:10,769
this out so you know there's a section

1774
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:17,890
that shows you all of the data about the

1775
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:21,850
asset or something like asset layout or

1776
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:23,530
something like that and if you do or

1777
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:27,039
don't get it you might print out things

1778
01:28:23,529 --> 01:28:31,509
differently that's all I was thinking so

1779
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:36,060
what I want to show here is I want to

1780
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:38,050
show like in the actual asset thing I

1781
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:41,340
want to show like a bunch of this stuff

1782
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:41,340
so I want to like

1783
01:28:49,560 --> 01:29:19,590
we want to show like the state I want to

1784
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:29,060
show the file index and I want to show

1785
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:32,159
like the asset index in that file right

1786
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:36,510
like I kind of want that layout stuff to

1787
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:38,460
be available so that we can know like

1788
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:41,010
especially we got the debug stuff that

1789
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:47,010
we're editing we can know like what that

1790
01:29:41,010 --> 01:30:03,600
is I'm gonna put in here just the global

1791
01:29:47,010 --> 01:30:06,289
asset index so something like that so

1792
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:09,760
that we can see these things

1793
01:30:06,289 --> 01:30:09,760
[Music]

1794
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:21,279
and maybe I want these to sort of be a

1795
01:30:15,789 --> 01:30:24,539
little bit more Squinkie I need to think

1796
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:24,539
about these a little bit more

1797
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:28,199
[Music]

1798
01:30:35,939 --> 01:30:47,339
I need to like think about these a

1799
01:30:45,988 --> 01:30:49,379
little bit more don't quote me on this

1800
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:50,789
because that's probably not not what I

1801
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:54,779
actually want so we're gonna play with

1802
01:30:50,789 --> 01:30:56,729
this a little bit more but then once we

1803
01:30:54,779 --> 01:31:00,840
get to the asset itself the fight the

1804
01:30:56,729 --> 01:31:02,279
actual like information you want the

1805
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,180
other thing I probably want to do is

1806
01:31:02,279 --> 01:31:10,500
like if you can section like asset file

1807
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:18,710
like that and maybe this kind of makes a

1808
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:18,710
little bit more sense over here too

1809
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:29,100
I'm just I'm sorry I'm not describing

1810
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:30,570
what's in my head very well basically

1811
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:33,180
what I'm thinking is how I want these

1812
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:34,920
things to be output cuz I kind of want

1813
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:40,560
them to maybe be sort of more similar to

1814
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:42,960
a printf in that way and it's hard to

1815
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:46,500
decide which way I actually want that to

1816
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:48,689
go right and so it's hard to think

1817
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:50,520
through exactly what I want to have

1818
01:31:48,689 --> 01:31:52,198
happened here and I'm in my head kind of

1819
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,670
weighing some different options and I

1820
01:31:52,198 --> 01:31:57,689
really should be talking about them out

1821
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:59,579
loud so that you can hear them what I

1822
01:31:57,689 --> 01:32:02,219
want to do is make the easiest possible

1823
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:04,469
way to describe this data so that I can

1824
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:07,350
see it and also for the ones that are

1825
01:32:04,469 --> 01:32:09,359
editable edit it there aren't that many

1826
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:10,770
that are editable so I'm thinking like

1827
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:13,229
this is probably a waste of everyone's

1828
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:15,630
time because you can't really edit any

1829
01:32:13,229 --> 01:32:18,599
of these you 32s and you're never going

1830
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:21,239
to be able to write so I don't really

1831
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:24,510
think I really need that actually so I

1832
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:30,889
think it should probably be more like

1833
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:35,010
something like this where we say okay

1834
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:36,869
you know there's gonna be like a like an

1835
01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:40,260
expandable or collapsible section

1836
01:32:36,869 --> 01:32:42,569
probably and maybe that thing sort of

1837
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:45,289
tells us some information about the

1838
01:32:42,569 --> 01:32:45,289
asset itself

1839
01:32:48,779 --> 01:32:53,409
like something like that you know

1840
01:32:51,310 --> 01:33:00,580
and in there we're just saying look

1841
01:32:53,409 --> 01:33:02,680
alright you know we've got this this

1842
01:33:00,579 --> 01:33:05,590
sort of set of things that we're gonna

1843
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:07,180
pass down to you and what we're gonna do

1844
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:09,610
is we're gonna have certain ones of

1845
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:10,690
those be editable potentially but most

1846
01:33:09,609 --> 01:33:17,079
of the time they're just going to be

1847
01:33:10,689 --> 01:33:23,199
output as individual strings that just

1848
01:33:17,079 --> 01:33:25,029
get displayed you know what I mean it's

1849
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:26,529
it's just again I'm really having a hard

1850
01:33:25,029 --> 01:33:28,000
time seeing that far in the future so

1851
01:33:26,529 --> 01:33:29,349
it's hard for me to even type in what I

1852
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,340
actually want cuz we're gonna have to

1853
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:32,620
kind of get down there a little bit more

1854
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:34,569
to see it but let's focus on what we

1855
01:33:32,619 --> 01:33:36,460
actually need first so I've got these

1856
01:33:34,569 --> 01:33:38,769
bitmaps here right

1857
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,409
and so in there these are the things

1858
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:44,110
that I actually want to do this reserved

1859
01:33:41,409 --> 01:33:45,789
is probably gonna be a scaling value I

1860
01:33:44,109 --> 01:33:48,880
would say

1861
01:33:45,789 --> 01:33:48,880
[Music]

1862
01:33:58,579 --> 01:34:03,199
although I think we actually decided

1863
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,550
that goes into the align point itself so

1864
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:07,189
the scaling values are actually in the

1865
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:09,380
align points not in here so that's fine

1866
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:15,079
this this might in the future though

1867
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:16,520
have a source size that actually like

1868
01:34:15,079 --> 01:34:24,380
the original slides I think that might

1869
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:25,910
be because we may need that alright so

1870
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:28,369
basically this is the main thing that

1871
01:34:25,909 --> 01:34:31,639
we're trying to edit right is the HHA

1872
01:34:28,369 --> 01:34:34,609
align point and so let's focus on that

1873
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:36,860
right so we know we've got some number

1874
01:34:34,609 --> 01:34:38,299
of align points so we want to have a

1875
01:34:36,859 --> 01:34:41,449
little thing that lets us edit those

1876
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:45,699
somehow right so we want to do a thing

1877
01:34:41,449 --> 01:34:45,699
here that's like you know begins section

1878
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:53,420
alignment points you know we're going to

1879
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:54,680
do something like this and you know

1880
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:58,760
we're gonna have a layout here or

1881
01:34:54,680 --> 01:35:00,590
whatever and what we want to do is go

1882
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:03,970
through all the alignment points that we

1883
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:03,970
have right

1884
01:35:18,539 --> 01:35:25,569
and for each one of those aligned points

1885
01:35:22,359 --> 01:35:31,529
provide the data and also a way to edit

1886
01:35:25,569 --> 01:35:31,529
that data right so if this is the point

1887
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:37,090
then I've got a couple different pieces

1888
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,889
of data here I've got P percent size and

1889
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:44,199
type I want to be able to edit all of

1890
01:35:38,889 --> 01:35:47,560
those right so inside the file formats

1891
01:35:44,198 --> 01:35:51,039
there I believe we've got ways each of

1892
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:54,699
you know each of these and I want to be

1893
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:57,698
able to edit all of them right so I

1894
01:35:54,698 --> 01:36:06,879
actually want to be able to do the

1895
01:35:57,698 --> 01:36:17,229
parent thing I want to be able to do the

1896
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:30,639
type I want to be able to do the P

1897
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:35,519
percent will just continue calling that

1898
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:35,520
that and then we also want the size

1899
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:46,120
so I want to get all of those and I want

1900
01:36:42,729 --> 01:36:52,269
all of them to be editable furthermore

1901
01:36:46,119 --> 01:36:55,329
at the end if the I really probably want

1902
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:59,560
this to be out here and I want this to

1903
01:36:55,329 --> 01:37:02,019
be a while loop that does this and each

1904
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:03,580
time through the while loop I want to

1905
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:06,130
check to see for every one of these

1906
01:37:03,579 --> 01:37:09,579
points whether it actually is valid or

1907
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:11,050
not right so each one of these points

1908
01:37:09,579 --> 01:37:12,488
I'm gonna have a thing where you know

1909
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:19,029
we've got a line points in here and

1910
01:37:12,488 --> 01:37:26,559
whatever I want to have a thing that for

1911
01:37:19,029 --> 01:37:29,259
each of the align points I assume honest

1912
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:40,780
I guess I don't even know I assume we

1913
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:43,360
want these to be like if we delete one

1914
01:37:40,779 --> 01:37:48,340
from the middle of the array we want to

1915
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:52,238
collapse the array I assume but honestly

1916
01:37:48,340 --> 01:38:00,279
we don't really have to do that because

1917
01:37:52,238 --> 01:38:02,529
we could just choose to like display the

1918
01:38:00,279 --> 01:38:03,670
twelve points and you delete the one you

1919
01:38:02,529 --> 01:38:07,769
want and there's just twelve slots

1920
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:07,770
because that's actually what's going on

1921
01:38:21,029 --> 01:38:29,639
so I guess I might say we're just maybe

1922
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:33,840
I take it back maybe we're just gonna do

1923
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:35,700
it like that so in here what I want to

1924
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:39,869
do now is I want to like have these

1925
01:38:35,699 --> 01:38:50,460
things be like I want to be able to have

1926
01:38:39,869 --> 01:38:54,689
these things be editable so there's like

1927
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:58,500
it attaches to parent boolean here you

1928
01:38:54,689 --> 01:38:59,759
know what I mean and you know if that

1929
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:09,680
gets toggled I'm going to do something

1930
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:09,680
with it right I've got like a size here

1931
01:39:11,329 --> 01:39:21,449
that size has bounds that have to be

1932
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:27,750
respected so we know that like we don't

1933
01:39:21,449 --> 01:39:30,779
want it to we don't want you to be

1934
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:34,350
changing it to really nearly so well I

1935
01:39:30,779 --> 01:39:36,529
guess I'll leave that for a little bit

1936
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:36,530
later

1937
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:41,449
um we've got a pipe

1938
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:53,319
and types are a little bit harder

1939
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:55,630
because they allow you to select you

1940
01:39:53,319 --> 01:39:58,328
know in order to select from it for the

1941
01:39:55,630 --> 01:40:05,469
type County the list of what are the

1942
01:39:58,328 --> 01:40:09,819
things that the type represents and I'm

1943
01:40:05,469 --> 01:40:14,618
not sure the best way to do that exactly

1944
01:40:09,819 --> 01:40:16,238
in this case however we may be able to

1945
01:40:14,618 --> 01:40:20,670
get away with something fairly

1946
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:20,669
straightforward by just saying well

1947
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:32,109
here's the set of align points that the

1948
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:40,150
code understands right and we can easily

1949
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:46,000
translate to and fro so in some sense we

1950
01:40:40,149 --> 01:40:50,649
could say it's easy to pass what the

1951
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:55,960
thing was because we can always say a

1952
01:40:50,649 --> 01:41:00,729
line point name from type right like

1953
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:04,000
that the hard part is inside this

1954
01:41:00,729 --> 01:41:06,729
routine it's gonna be pretty hard for it

1955
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:12,510
to know what the things are that you

1956
01:41:06,729 --> 01:41:18,039
were actually editing we can do some

1957
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:21,369
tomfoolery here we can do a thing that

1958
01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:24,039
does tell it I don't know that we really

1959
01:41:21,368 --> 01:41:26,859
want to so I may just leave it at that

1960
01:41:24,039 --> 01:41:28,868
for now and we may have a crappy editor

1961
01:41:26,859 --> 01:41:30,488
for this I can show you how to make a

1962
01:41:28,868 --> 01:41:39,368
better one sometime if people really

1963
01:41:30,488 --> 01:41:42,638
want too hard to say so let's go ahead

1964
01:41:39,368 --> 01:41:44,908
and create the edible percentage stuff

1965
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:44,909
here

1966
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:59,260
soon here what we want to do is we want

1967
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:01,989
to be able to edit all of these things

1968
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:04,900
so we all we want to be able to edit

1969
01:42:01,989 --> 01:42:10,359
both the X&amp;Y as well and we kind of want

1970
01:42:04,899 --> 01:42:13,329
that to be an editable XY position sort

1971
01:42:10,359 --> 01:42:17,170
of thing we all have to specify the

1972
01:42:13,329 --> 01:42:18,729
bounds here probably as well and I don't

1973
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:29,859
know exactly how we want to do that but

1974
01:42:18,729 --> 01:42:31,629
it's probably something like this and

1975
01:42:29,859 --> 01:42:33,579
the same is probably true here like I

1976
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:35,500
don't really want things to be too small

1977
01:42:33,579 --> 01:42:40,779
and I don't really want things to be too

1978
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:42,640
large or whatever right so I'm just

1979
01:42:40,779 --> 01:42:45,519
specifying a range so that it kind of

1980
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:46,960
knows what the scale is sizes may just

1981
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:48,790
not need that because sizes are

1982
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,140
generally best edited you know I'm gonna

1983
01:42:48,789 --> 01:42:56,800
get rid of that sizes are generally

1984
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:59,260
edited best to fit a relative motion so

1985
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:01,900
I think that you know unlike positions

1986
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:04,539
which are absolute kind of motions so I

1987
01:43:01,899 --> 01:43:08,469
think that's probably how we would want

1988
01:43:04,539 --> 01:43:10,420
that to work out um so this would allow

1989
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:12,130
us to express what needs to get edited

1990
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:16,350
as far as the things we actually cared

1991
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:20,079
about with the alignment points and such

1992
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:22,240
and if any of them actually get set then

1993
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:25,510
what we can do is call the corresponding

1994
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:28,319
function inside the asset system file

1995
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:33,010
format stuff to actually set that stuff

1996
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:36,099
back right and so we want to do here is

1997
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:37,659
like set the alignment point based on on

1998
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:42,940
whether these things happen

1999
01:43:37,659 --> 01:43:44,769
now I don't know that we need to put

2000
01:43:42,939 --> 01:43:46,899
that inside each of these but I want to

2001
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:49,030
make sure each of them gets called so I

2002
01:43:46,899 --> 01:43:54,039
think what I'm going to do is just do

2003
01:43:49,029 --> 01:43:55,599
like an edited thing and you know just

2004
01:43:54,039 --> 01:43:58,510
have that be false and then in each of

2005
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,500
these things you know I'll I'll set it

2006
01:43:58,510 --> 01:44:02,920
to true

2007
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:10,420
and you know there's ways we could do

2008
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:18,010
that that are better and you know what

2009
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:25,600
I'm just going to do them I'm gonna do

2010
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:27,400
something like this so in here we

2011
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,500
basically like let's begin an edit block

2012
01:44:27,399 --> 01:44:45,238
I'm gonna specify what the editable

2013
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:53,380
things are here they are so do this and

2014
01:44:45,238 --> 01:44:55,119
then do if and edit block then do that

2015
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:56,590
so that way we have a clean way of

2016
01:44:55,119 --> 01:45:01,029
saying these things that added together

2017
01:44:56,590 --> 01:45:03,659
if they were edited in some way then

2018
01:45:01,029 --> 01:45:12,639
it's a good time for us to say let's set

2019
01:45:03,659 --> 01:45:14,800
everything on our point and by the way

2020
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:20,010
we'll have to have an ability to flush

2021
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:20,010
back to the HHA now as well

2022
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:35,920
I think that's really mostly what I want

2023
01:45:32,949 --> 01:45:41,079
to do I wanted to have a way of

2024
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:44,859
specifying the Airstream here so I again

2025
01:45:41,079 --> 01:45:46,720
want to be able to load that and print

2026
01:45:44,859 --> 01:45:50,170
out some more of these things but I'm

2027
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:57,520
not sure I really care about the rest of

2028
01:45:50,170 --> 01:45:59,829
them so yeah what I do want to do is

2029
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:04,270
move this into the bitmap side of things

2030
01:45:59,829 --> 01:46:06,369
so I want to put that in here right and

2031
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:13,570
then other stuff that gets edited we

2032
01:46:06,369 --> 01:46:20,229
don't really have any need for font

2033
01:46:13,569 --> 01:46:22,299
editing and so on right so you know if I

2034
01:46:20,229 --> 01:46:24,269
look at what I actually need for editing

2035
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:26,890
the things I actually wanted to edit

2036
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:28,630
they're actually pretty minimal so I

2037
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:30,460
could I could really just focus on doing

2038
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:32,050
this and not care too much to get

2039
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:34,090
carried away with other stuff that might

2040
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:36,550
be nice to have but isn't super relevant

2041
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:40,119
at the moment we really would just need

2042
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:42,640
this and then when you actually edit one

2043
01:46:40,119 --> 01:46:44,710
of these we will need a way to save it

2044
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:51,760
back and so we'll need a way to sort of

2045
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:54,850
say look this stuff kind of has to be

2046
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:57,850
marked as dirty and later we'll save it

2047
01:46:54,850 --> 01:47:00,610
and we may want to do like the ability

2048
01:46:57,850 --> 01:47:02,710
to revert or undo as well because we may

2049
01:47:00,609 --> 01:47:05,559
not want to save the changes

2050
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:08,189
so although we want to always set the

2051
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:11,350
align point whenever you make a change

2052
01:47:08,189 --> 01:47:14,169
we don't actually want to allow you to

2053
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:15,400
make changes to the file directly we

2054
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:16,750
want to just do them in memory like

2055
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:21,029
we're doing here and then we'll have a

2056
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:21,029
way to flush them to disk after the fact

2057
01:47:25,809 --> 01:47:32,538
so yeah I think really this doesn't have

2058
01:47:29,628 --> 01:47:36,288
to happen at the moment and I think we

2059
01:47:32,538 --> 01:47:38,448
can just do it like this and focus on

2060
01:47:36,288 --> 01:47:40,458
that and we'll see and we can expand it

2061
01:47:38,448 --> 01:47:54,138
to be better later but the moment that

2062
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:56,479
maybe the more reasonable thing right so

2063
01:47:54,139 --> 01:47:58,699
if we were to come through here then

2064
01:47:56,479 --> 01:48:01,789
what we would need we need to have a way

2065
01:47:58,698 --> 01:48:04,938
to make this layout thing actually do

2066
01:48:01,788 --> 01:48:06,618
something and you know to be clear it

2067
01:48:04,939 --> 01:48:08,659
would look more like this right because

2068
01:48:06,618 --> 01:48:13,188
it's gonna have to have actual stuff in

2069
01:48:08,658 --> 01:48:15,248
it but that's mostly what we're talking

2070
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:15,249
about

2071
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:32,439
and I think really what's gonna happen

2072
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:36,780
here is that each of these points to

2073
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:36,779
would would really be specified

2074
01:48:46,849 --> 01:48:59,849
like this can just be one line of data

2075
01:48:52,948 --> 01:49:02,009
right it can just be one line on the

2076
01:48:59,849 --> 01:49:04,800
screen and I would like it to sort of

2077
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:11,179
collapse that up right into like just a

2078
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:14,010
thing that it shows a single line of and

2079
01:49:11,179 --> 01:49:18,838
so you know I kind of want to say

2080
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:24,800
something like you know begin line and

2081
01:49:18,838 --> 01:49:24,800
wine and this would be something like

2082
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:30,898
you know I want to be able to say this

2083
01:49:27,929 --> 01:49:33,050
is the enth one of these you know what I

2084
01:49:30,899 --> 01:49:33,050
mean

2085
01:49:37,829 --> 01:49:43,729
that's more or less what I want to do

2086
01:49:50,989 --> 01:49:58,199
you know and there are some other ways I

2087
01:49:55,949 --> 01:50:00,449
could do that and I'm not sure which one

2088
01:49:58,199 --> 01:50:03,710
of those would be the best but it's more

2089
01:50:00,449 --> 01:50:06,510
or less that where I basically just have

2090
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:08,100
let's make a line it should have this

2091
01:50:06,510 --> 01:50:14,840
stuff on it

2092
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:22,850
and if I think I also here want to say

2093
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:26,930
you know if this point is like an on

2094
01:50:22,850 --> 01:50:40,110
point so the type is null

2095
01:50:26,930 --> 01:50:43,200
it's where are you lying there it is so

2096
01:50:40,109 --> 01:50:52,949
if we're talking about this if it's just

2097
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:55,369
none right then I kind of just want a

2098
01:50:52,949 --> 01:50:55,369
like

2099
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:12,230
a button that just says add point right

2100
01:51:17,368 --> 01:51:23,439
or maybe that so just list the ones

2101
01:51:21,969 --> 01:51:25,510
around user you can click on one and it

2102
01:51:23,439 --> 01:51:27,460
would add it so if in this case you did

2103
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:30,100
it would just create a default alignment

2104
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:35,439
point there so it would do like a set

2105
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:38,320
alignment point and it would say like

2106
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:41,198
alright by default then we just say like

2107
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:45,368
you know it doesn't go to the parent

2108
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:47,319
the size is 1.0 and the p percent is

2109
01:51:45,368 --> 01:51:49,238
like point five twenty five so if you

2110
01:51:47,319 --> 01:51:50,799
create a new point it just creates that

2111
01:51:49,238 --> 01:51:55,899
and then you can do whatever you want

2112
01:51:50,800 --> 01:52:13,360
with it after that right so I think

2113
01:51:55,899 --> 01:52:17,408
that's fine right so off we go

2114
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:22,719
we build a line of of crap here we put

2115
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:24,368
these editable things in there and that

2116
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:25,779
gives us all of that like if we

2117
01:52:24,368 --> 01:52:29,109
implemented that it would give us

2118
01:52:25,779 --> 01:52:31,899
everything that we wanted we do need

2119
01:52:29,109 --> 01:52:38,979
some way of deleting it so I think we

2120
01:52:31,899 --> 01:52:44,618
also want to be able to put here a way

2121
01:52:38,979 --> 01:52:46,988
to like delete right so we want to have

2122
01:52:44,618 --> 01:52:49,420
a button that deletes it and if we were

2123
01:52:46,988 --> 01:52:55,169
going to delete it then what we would do

2124
01:52:49,420 --> 01:52:55,170
is say okay like set the type to be

2125
01:52:59,719 --> 01:53:08,789
none right and that seems fair right

2126
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:10,349
that seems like a pretty easy way to

2127
01:53:08,789 --> 01:53:13,979
construct the interface that we would

2128
01:53:10,350 --> 01:53:18,239
need for this set of things to work and

2129
01:53:13,979 --> 01:53:20,849
I don't know like there's two ways we

2130
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:26,218
could have done this I'm not sure which

2131
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:29,699
one we really want cuz they're pretty

2132
01:53:26,219 --> 01:53:32,039
different so one way is that you

2133
01:53:29,698 --> 01:53:35,069
actually just stuff everything into the

2134
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:39,210
format function and the other way is

2135
01:53:35,069 --> 01:53:53,840
this so to show you what I mean it'd be

2136
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:53,840
like more like this I so like

2137
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:21,940
something more like this

2138
01:54:18,189 --> 01:54:26,979
so you'd basically do like okay you know

2139
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:36,599
this thing is gonna have two branches

2140
01:54:26,979 --> 01:54:38,979
here one of which is HHA aligned none

2141
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:41,289
and in that case you're just going to

2142
01:54:38,979 --> 01:54:44,019
have one button which is like the unused

2143
01:54:41,289 --> 01:54:45,909
thing and the other way is you're going

2144
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:48,190
to have this and either way they're

2145
01:54:45,909 --> 01:54:50,260
gonna have a backslash and at the end

2146
01:54:48,189 --> 01:54:56,109
and maybe both cases they've got the

2147
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:59,619
number right and it's just that's the

2148
01:54:56,109 --> 01:55:01,899
line right if that makes sense

2149
01:54:59,619 --> 01:55:05,849
and I can still do it the other way so

2150
01:55:01,899 --> 01:55:05,849
you know you could still do it this way

2151
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:20,159
it's really up to you which one you want

2152
01:55:10,779 --> 01:55:20,159
and so

2153
01:55:25,399 --> 01:55:29,909
it would basically look like everything

2154
01:55:27,630 --> 01:55:32,579
stuffed behind a printf the printf looks

2155
01:55:29,909 --> 01:55:34,139
like this in these two cases we do these

2156
01:55:32,579 --> 01:55:37,439
two things and then what you do is you

2157
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:41,760
wrap your values in things that create

2158
01:55:37,439 --> 01:55:45,029
little trucks on the stack that tell the

2159
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:48,539
system what each thing should be so this

2160
01:55:45,029 --> 01:55:52,289
all gets stuffed into one thing right it

2161
01:55:48,539 --> 01:56:15,350
looks like this where you just have like

2162
01:55:52,289 --> 01:56:15,350
you know I'm saying to you

2163
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:28,229
does anyone know I'm talking about here

2164
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:37,810
right and there's advantages and

2165
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:39,340
disadvantage to each of them in this

2166
01:56:37,810 --> 01:56:40,330
case the problem is you end up in things

2167
01:56:39,340 --> 01:56:42,460
where you have to create synthetic

2168
01:56:40,329 --> 01:56:44,050
variables to record results such as if

2169
01:56:42,460 --> 01:56:46,480
you want the button here you can't just

2170
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:48,880
do if button delete you have to do like

2171
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:59,799
delete like here's the thing to edit

2172
01:56:48,880 --> 01:57:03,400
right and I don't know which one of them

2173
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:05,529
you know you would prefer I implement

2174
01:57:03,399 --> 01:57:09,369
it's six and one-half dozen the other

2175
01:57:05,529 --> 01:57:12,429
it's both of them are problems with the

2176
01:57:09,369 --> 01:57:14,079
way that C and C++ work neither is

2177
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:16,810
particularly good language for these

2178
01:57:14,079 --> 01:57:19,899
sorts of operations there's a lot of

2179
01:57:16,810 --> 01:57:23,110
limitations to it and that's just kind

2180
01:57:19,899 --> 01:57:25,359
of the way it goes but you know you can

2181
01:57:23,109 --> 01:57:27,939
sort of see how they would shake out and

2182
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:30,579
you know where you might like or not

2183
01:57:27,939 --> 01:57:35,469
like stuff

2184
01:57:30,579 --> 01:57:43,269
in either case right so this is what

2185
01:57:35,470 --> 01:57:45,940
they would both look like and yeah

2186
01:57:43,270 --> 01:57:48,010
that's that's all I got for you I mean

2187
01:57:45,939 --> 01:57:50,199
that's that's the difference between the

2188
01:57:48,010 --> 01:57:52,180
two and one thing you can't see about

2189
01:57:50,199 --> 01:57:57,880
them is they're not that different right

2190
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:59,470
I mean they look pretty similar and it

2191
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:01,239
really just comes down to whether you

2192
01:57:59,470 --> 01:58:03,730
prefer to be able to specify your

2193
01:58:01,238 --> 01:58:06,359
formatting this way or whether you want

2194
01:58:03,729 --> 01:58:09,279
to build it up out of calls like this

2195
01:58:06,359 --> 01:58:10,750
and I don't have a strong opinion about

2196
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:12,729
which one of those two things should

2197
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:18,010
happen there are advantages to each

2198
01:58:12,729 --> 01:58:19,719
right and I don't know so I think maybe

2199
01:58:18,010 --> 01:58:23,760
I'll go with the more function heavy

2200
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:26,980
approach for now rather than this one

2201
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:28,480
just because it seems maybe a little

2202
01:58:26,979 --> 01:58:33,189
more in keeping with how we have tended

2203
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:34,599
to do things on handmade hero and so you

2204
01:58:33,189 --> 01:58:37,089
know maybe I'll say this is what we're

2205
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:48,310
gonna go with so that'll leave us with a

2206
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:49,900
bunch of things oops that'll leave us

2207
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:52,810
with a bunch of things that we haven't

2208
01:58:49,899 --> 01:58:59,219
implemented and so what we'll have to do

2209
01:58:52,810 --> 01:59:01,929
here is no with this asset memory header

2210
01:58:59,219 --> 01:59:03,760
so we'll have to do here is implement

2211
01:59:01,929 --> 01:59:05,618
these things tomorrow like that

2212
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:08,349
basically tells us exactly what we're

2213
01:59:05,618 --> 01:59:10,448
going to be doing and so we'll do that

2214
01:59:08,349 --> 01:59:16,270
and probably using again that code that

2215
01:59:10,448 --> 01:59:17,529
we already sort of had as a way to not

2216
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:19,570
have to re-implement those things

2217
01:59:17,529 --> 01:59:21,969
because they're all pretty much already

2218
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:24,359
what we want and we just need to extend

2219
01:59:21,969 --> 01:59:28,599
them a little bit does that make sense

2220
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:32,189
so I'll go to a brief Q&amp;A and we'll

2221
01:59:28,599 --> 01:59:32,190
we'll write that stuff tomorrow

2222
02:00:12,219 --> 02:00:16,309
off-topic how do you index large

2223
02:00:14,210 --> 02:00:19,760
messages would you divide into multiple

2224
02:00:16,309 --> 02:00:24,079
chunks yes I would divide into multiple

2225
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:26,690
chunks generally speaking my experience

2226
02:00:24,078 --> 02:00:29,590
with GPUs is that you just want to

2227
02:00:26,689 --> 02:00:35,089
minimize the amount of space things take

2228
02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:38,960
you know so there's like very little

2229
02:00:35,090 --> 02:00:45,590
chance that you can't break things into

2230
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:46,788
chunks of 65,000 vertices right I mean

2231
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:49,610
come on

2232
02:00:46,788 --> 02:00:51,109
like how can you not right so I would

2233
02:00:49,609 --> 02:00:58,549
always break them up into those chunks

2234
02:00:51,109 --> 02:01:00,139
so that my indices could be smaller have

2235
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:02,389
I changed my fur coat accustomed since I

2236
02:01:00,139 --> 02:01:07,368
handed over to Alan Alan generally keeps

2237
02:01:02,389 --> 02:01:09,618
it updated so that if you are mmm what

2238
02:01:07,368 --> 02:01:12,589
do I want to say if you're for coder if

2239
02:01:09,618 --> 02:01:15,308
you if you're if you bought for coders

2240
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:17,869
super super or whatever it's called

2241
02:01:15,309 --> 02:01:20,960
you just get it so it should be in the

2242
02:01:17,868 --> 02:01:22,460
distro I think he keeps it up to date so

2243
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:25,279
as he changed as discussed earlier he

2244
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:28,179
like backports it and I usually just

2245
02:01:25,279 --> 02:01:28,179
pull the changes from him

2246
02:01:32,939 --> 02:01:37,089
not really on topic but how would you go

2247
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:39,130
about implanting a generic resizable

2248
02:01:37,090 --> 02:01:42,610
array as you said you don't like to use

2249
02:01:39,130 --> 02:01:44,710
templates in my experience there is no

2250
02:01:42,609 --> 02:01:51,339
way to implement a generic resizable

2251
02:01:44,710 --> 02:01:54,489
array in c and c++ period it doesn't

2252
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:56,409
work so you assuming you want to be

2253
02:01:54,489 --> 02:02:00,269
typed like just forget about it doesn't

2254
02:01:56,409 --> 02:02:03,970
work templates are horrible for this

2255
02:02:00,270 --> 02:02:06,100
macros are horrible for this void

2256
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:07,600
starters are horrible for this you need

2257
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:09,190
a meta programming language anytime you

2258
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:10,600
want a generic anything you need a meta

2259
02:02:09,189 --> 02:02:16,059
programming language because you want to

2260
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:18,010
look at stuff like when the array I mean

2261
02:02:16,060 --> 02:02:22,330
let me just let me show you a very

2262
02:02:18,010 --> 02:02:24,789
simple example of how bad c and c++ are

2263
02:02:22,329 --> 02:02:26,619
at this and why you need to let meta

2264
02:02:24,789 --> 02:02:29,369
programming language it's it's very very

2265
02:02:26,619 --> 02:02:29,369
obvious right

2266
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:52,730
and like I'm gonna say this this is

2267
02:02:50,599 --> 02:02:54,050
always enrages me so I apologize to the

2268
02:02:52,729 --> 02:02:55,698
comments I'm about to make about how

2269
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:57,469
stupid everyone is but I'm going to make

2270
02:02:55,698 --> 02:02:59,750
those comics invariably because I get so

2271
02:02:57,469 --> 02:03:02,000
angry at C++ because it seems to be

2272
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:04,939
specified by people who never even write

2273
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:07,789
any code it's just it drives me insane

2274
02:03:04,939 --> 02:03:09,738
and so I end up being very angry about

2275
02:03:07,789 --> 02:03:11,510
it which isn't necessarily productive

2276
02:03:09,738 --> 02:03:14,750
because they never change so it doesn't

2277
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:15,170
matter I might as well not but what can

2278
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:19,969
I say

2279
02:03:15,170 --> 02:03:21,590
so here's what C++ looks like right I

2280
02:03:19,969 --> 02:03:27,260
mean generally you would do something

2281
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:30,199
like this right or that I think is their

2282
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:33,260
typical way they write it and they say

2283
02:03:30,198 --> 02:03:36,769
you know here's my thing I'm gonna make

2284
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:37,820
you know and you know I want to put some

2285
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:39,320
stuff in it of course they would always

2286
02:03:37,819 --> 02:03:41,719
they would always write class even

2287
02:03:39,319 --> 02:03:44,029
though it you know I love it they do

2288
02:03:41,719 --> 02:03:47,408
this all the time even though that's

2289
02:03:44,029 --> 02:03:49,789
just of this I don't know why but anyway

2290
02:03:47,408 --> 02:03:58,069
so you know I want to make one of these

2291
02:03:49,789 --> 02:04:00,198
things and you know it's gonna have a an

2292
02:03:58,069 --> 02:04:01,849
array pointer sorry it's gonna have an

2293
02:04:00,198 --> 02:04:04,308
array pointer in here that's like here's

2294
02:04:01,849 --> 02:04:06,110
the storage you know and then inside

2295
02:04:04,309 --> 02:04:09,829
here I'm gonna have you know like a

2296
02:04:06,109 --> 02:04:11,269
count or something you know and then

2297
02:04:09,828 --> 02:04:13,158
what I want to do is I want to influence

2298
02:04:11,270 --> 02:04:15,440
things that let me just like put stuff

2299
02:04:13,158 --> 02:04:19,969
in whatever the science theory is so you

2300
02:04:15,439 --> 02:04:25,269
know I want to have something like an

2301
02:04:19,969 --> 02:04:28,158
operator you know that it's gonna let me

2302
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:30,320
access things in here and something like

2303
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:34,488
this you know and inside here I'm gonna

2304
02:04:30,319 --> 02:04:36,889
pass an index right so I can create some

2305
02:04:34,488 --> 02:04:39,919
size things and I want this thing to

2306
02:04:36,889 --> 02:04:43,400
just work you know I just want it to

2307
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:47,840
work so I want to say when I look at

2308
02:04:43,399 --> 02:04:51,710
element 16 its there and I can write to

2309
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:52,849
it you know what I mean so in somewhere

2310
02:04:51,710 --> 02:04:56,989
like here they would do something like

2311
02:04:52,849 --> 02:04:59,069
okay here's the index right I'll return

2312
02:04:56,988 --> 02:05:01,889
that but by the way

2313
02:04:59,069 --> 02:05:04,769
you know if the index is out of bounds

2314
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:07,619
then you know like allocate and copy or

2315
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:10,020
something right there's some there's

2316
02:05:07,619 --> 02:05:12,539
some function in here it'll do that this

2317
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:14,130
is basically what you do right so then

2318
02:05:12,539 --> 02:05:16,470
in here I say oh I want one of these

2319
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:21,380
things this is gonna be awesome

2320
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:21,380
it's great and then somebody writes this

2321
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:54,600
okay so what are you going to do now

2322
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:57,329
right what are you gonna do well the

2323
02:05:54,600 --> 02:06:01,230
language literally gives you no way to

2324
02:05:57,329 --> 02:06:02,600
do anything about this it's just over

2325
02:06:01,229 --> 02:06:05,549
before it starts

2326
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:08,070
this will literally call allocate and

2327
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:10,560
copy however many times the grow rule

2328
02:06:08,069 --> 02:06:14,189
goes for so people end up doing things

2329
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:17,490
like oh I'll do like twice the size

2330
02:06:14,189 --> 02:06:19,739
right like each time or something like

2331
02:06:17,489 --> 02:06:21,090
this so I grow by an exponential amount

2332
02:06:19,739 --> 02:06:23,550
or something like that right

2333
02:06:21,090 --> 02:06:27,360
that means I'll waste all this storage

2334
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:31,260
whatever it's so clear from this code

2335
02:06:27,359 --> 02:06:33,059
how many things you needed right this is

2336
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:37,650
how many I hate it in the container it's

2337
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:40,560
obvious right so one of the things that

2338
02:06:37,649 --> 02:06:41,819
you want to do the obvious piece of code

2339
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:44,610
that you would write if you're

2340
02:06:41,819 --> 02:06:47,579
metaprogramming right is you go like all

2341
02:06:44,609 --> 02:06:49,109
rights for each place and I don't know

2342
02:06:47,579 --> 02:06:50,880
the syntax of this meta protein language

2343
02:06:49,109 --> 02:06:53,670
because they've never given it to me but

2344
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:58,109
for each place you know container calls

2345
02:06:53,670 --> 02:07:01,819
operator blah you know get parent you

2346
02:06:58,109 --> 02:07:04,769
know parent or containing scope you know

2347
02:07:01,819 --> 02:07:09,869
equals get parent scope we're it ever

2348
02:07:04,770 --> 02:07:12,560
right while you know this look up

2349
02:07:09,869 --> 02:07:16,489
through each one you know easy

2350
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:20,900
a loop if is loop okay

2351
02:07:16,489 --> 02:07:23,389
you know get bounds of the loop look at

2352
02:07:20,899 --> 02:07:26,539
the balance of the loop if I can see

2353
02:07:23,390 --> 02:07:30,170
what they are then allocate that many

2354
02:07:26,539 --> 02:07:32,060
ahead of time right that's that's what I

2355
02:07:30,170 --> 02:07:34,010
want you know in my language I want to

2356
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:36,289
be able to just write that in there you

2357
02:07:34,010 --> 02:07:37,820
know look and see what happens in this

2358
02:07:36,289 --> 02:07:42,100
loop how many there are

2359
02:07:37,819 --> 02:07:46,579
better yet you know give me some way of

2360
02:07:42,100 --> 02:07:49,190
of asking the programmer right maybe I

2361
02:07:46,579 --> 02:07:53,659
can't see what this is like it's just

2362
02:07:49,189 --> 02:08:00,529
like foo say like look if it's a loop

2363
02:07:53,659 --> 02:08:06,349
then like remind programmer you know did

2364
02:08:00,529 --> 02:08:08,840
you reserve space for those and then put

2365
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:11,150
this print this out for each one of

2366
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:14,119
these and then allow the programmer to

2367
02:08:11,149 --> 02:08:17,119
say yes I did on them right and remember

2368
02:08:14,119 --> 02:08:18,470
which ones they were or something all of

2369
02:08:17,119 --> 02:08:20,479
these things would be really good

2370
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:24,800
instead what happens is they're just

2371
02:08:20,479 --> 02:08:27,139
like no you know what you forget it

2372
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:35,300
there's no way do any of that so you

2373
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:36,650
just end up with this every time and if

2374
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:40,489
they forgot to do this then the code

2375
02:08:36,649 --> 02:08:48,170
just sucks you know what I mean

2376
02:08:40,489 --> 02:08:51,079
it's just the idea behind having generic

2377
02:08:48,170 --> 02:08:53,180
things is they're only useful if I can

2378
02:08:51,079 --> 02:08:55,309
actually make them do the right thing

2379
02:08:53,180 --> 02:08:56,659
that I would have done if I just had

2380
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:59,510
written the code the right way in the

2381
02:08:56,659 --> 02:08:59,869
first place right and if you can't do

2382
02:08:59,510 --> 02:09:01,970
that

2383
02:08:59,869 --> 02:09:06,140
then what's the point I don't this is

2384
02:09:01,970 --> 02:09:08,869
bad code right if this ever runs your

2385
02:09:06,140 --> 02:09:12,500
code is bad there is never a time when

2386
02:09:08,869 --> 02:09:14,079
this code is good ever ever ever ever

2387
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:16,369
right

2388
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:18,859
exponential growth is not a good

2389
02:09:16,369 --> 02:09:21,590
predictor it's terrible it either wastes

2390
02:09:18,859 --> 02:09:25,159
space or wastes time but it's it's or

2391
02:09:21,590 --> 02:09:26,420
both usually right so if you want a

2392
02:09:25,159 --> 02:09:28,579
generic container that I'm

2393
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:31,130
to not have to think about using then

2394
02:09:28,579 --> 02:09:33,590
you need to actually have our sorry

2395
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:36,679
imaginary Kenner a container that grows

2396
02:09:33,590 --> 02:09:38,600
automatically it should be smart it has

2397
02:09:36,679 --> 02:09:41,449
to look at the code and figure out

2398
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:42,440
what's going on right and if it can't

2399
02:09:41,448 --> 02:09:45,500
figure out what's going on it should

2400
02:09:42,439 --> 02:09:48,799
throw up a warning like hey I can't tell

2401
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:50,659
you got to tell me I don't know what you

2402
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:54,829
know tell me how many things this loops

2403
02:09:50,659 --> 02:09:59,750
gonna do right give me that give me that

2404
02:09:54,829 --> 02:10:02,569
bonus that's generic programming that's

2405
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:05,719
encoding the logic necessary to create

2406
02:10:02,569 --> 02:10:07,329
the correct code into the code what c++

2407
02:10:05,719 --> 02:10:11,569
does is it gives you the ability to

2408
02:10:07,329 --> 02:10:12,890
encode the worst possible crap code to

2409
02:10:11,569 --> 02:10:15,139
be automatically generated by your

2410
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:18,010
compiler because it's like if i wanted

2411
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:20,539
to have the dumbest possible intern

2412
02:10:18,010 --> 02:10:23,469
implement everything that I told them to

2413
02:10:20,539 --> 02:10:26,238
implement in the worst possible way that

2414
02:10:23,469 --> 02:10:28,399
c++ right it's the dumbest possible

2415
02:10:26,238 --> 02:10:30,500
intern running the worst possible code

2416
02:10:28,399 --> 02:10:32,929
and that's the only thing you can

2417
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:34,880
generate you can't ever write generic

2418
02:10:32,929 --> 02:10:36,050
stuff that generates good code that a

2419
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:37,699
good programmer would have written

2420
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:41,000
because it doesn't give you the ability

2421
02:10:37,698 --> 02:10:43,639
to look at the enclosing scopes where

2422
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,800
things are used so you can't actually

2423
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:48,079
encode the logic that a programmer would

2424
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:51,380
have used to do something smart there

2425
02:10:48,079 --> 02:10:55,448
and you can't failing that you can't

2426
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:58,520
even output code that tells you that you

2427
02:10:55,448 --> 02:11:01,099
to please do it for me

2428
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:04,010
right I can't even output something here

2429
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:09,980
that says oh don't do this inside this

2430
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:10,460
loop this way right so like I don't know

2431
02:11:09,979 --> 02:11:13,669
what to say

2432
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:16,850
right and so basically every time

2433
02:11:13,670 --> 02:11:17,960
someone does us uses the C++ feature to

2434
02:11:16,850 --> 02:11:20,719
implement something what they're

2435
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:24,649
effectively doing is saving themselves

2436
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:31,909
typing time by putting code into a

2437
02:11:24,649 --> 02:11:34,189
generic system by accepting worse code

2438
02:11:31,909 --> 02:11:36,409
then they would have had if they had

2439
02:11:34,189 --> 02:11:38,719
written it in the place from scratch

2440
02:11:36,409 --> 02:11:41,720
right

2441
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:43,340
and it's that's not what you want in the

2442
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:44,570
language you don't want to have to make

2443
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:47,150
that trade-off I don't want to

2444
02:11:44,569 --> 02:11:49,279
constantly be thinking oh do I want to

2445
02:11:47,149 --> 02:11:51,559
save myself some programming time by

2446
02:11:49,279 --> 02:11:54,259
making this into a crappy generic thing

2447
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:55,610
that doesn't work very well or do I want

2448
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:58,250
to spend the extra time to write it

2449
02:11:55,609 --> 02:12:00,139
correctly and like should I defer that

2450
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:01,850
decision too late like I just want to be

2451
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:02,869
on the write it right like why can't I

2452
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:04,240
just read it what games give me a

2453
02:12:02,869 --> 02:12:06,470
language that lets me write it correctly

2454
02:12:04,239 --> 02:12:10,429
you know how hard would that have been

2455
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:12,590
I I would argue not very hard you just

2456
02:12:10,430 --> 02:12:14,630
need to give people access to the ast

2457
02:12:12,590 --> 02:12:17,029
and you need to allow them to ask

2458
02:12:14,630 --> 02:12:18,859
questions about the structure of the

2459
02:12:17,029 --> 02:12:23,119
code that they were being called with

2460
02:12:18,859 --> 02:12:24,979
right and I don't think it's

2461
02:12:23,119 --> 02:12:26,930
fundamentally that hard it certainly

2462
02:12:24,979 --> 02:12:28,579
isn't as hard as making compiler that

2463
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:34,550
does all the rest of the crap that's in

2464
02:12:28,579 --> 02:12:36,949
C++ 17 X 11 27 35 Blade Runner 43 or

2465
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:41,449
whatever right like it's definitely not

2466
02:12:36,949 --> 02:12:43,699
as hard as making that compiler it's way

2467
02:12:41,449 --> 02:12:45,050
easier because they've added so much

2468
02:12:43,699 --> 02:12:47,239
crap on top of crap on top of crap

2469
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:48,890
trying to solve problems like these that

2470
02:12:47,239 --> 02:12:50,329
would have just been solvable if you'd

2471
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:52,460
allowed the programmer to have a meta

2472
02:12:50,329 --> 02:12:54,609
programming a actual meta program you

2473
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:54,609
know

2474
02:12:59,679 --> 02:13:06,760
I watched the episodes that you

2475
02:13:04,149 --> 02:13:08,348
presented premultiplied alpha and I

2476
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:12,449
remember you mentioned that you prefer

2477
02:13:08,349 --> 02:13:15,819
to defer multiplying by alpha at the end

2478
02:13:12,448 --> 02:13:19,089
hmm can you explain what that means

2479
02:13:15,819 --> 02:13:21,819
also what's the benefit of pre mult than

2480
02:13:19,090 --> 02:13:23,739
the fact that it is a linear operation

2481
02:13:21,819 --> 02:13:24,998
if that's the case I can only see the

2482
02:13:23,738 --> 02:13:27,308
value if you're compositing multiple

2483
02:13:24,998 --> 02:13:28,988
transparency layers opaque geometry on

2484
02:13:27,309 --> 02:13:30,639
one layer and fancy doesn't really

2485
02:13:28,988 --> 02:13:34,419
benefit from it am I missing something

2486
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:35,979
you are missing something but I'm not I

2487
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:38,489
can in the second half of the question

2488
02:13:35,979 --> 02:13:41,550
the first half the question I'm not sure

2489
02:13:38,488 --> 02:13:44,828
exactly what you're referring to

2490
02:13:41,550 --> 02:13:46,510
Toofer multiplying by alpha at the end

2491
02:13:44,828 --> 02:13:47,948
I'm not sure what you mean by that

2492
02:13:46,510 --> 02:13:49,360
because I don't remember the context in

2493
02:13:47,948 --> 02:13:52,118
which I set it so I apologize I can't

2494
02:13:49,359 --> 02:13:54,670
give answer to that on the reason why I

2495
02:13:52,118 --> 02:13:58,208
use premultiplied alpha actually you

2496
02:13:54,670 --> 02:13:59,889
need alpha to be linear everywhere it's

2497
02:13:58,208 --> 02:14:02,050
not just for multiple blending

2498
02:13:59,889 --> 02:14:05,380
operations and the reason for that is

2499
02:14:02,050 --> 02:14:08,679
that inside almost every rendering

2500
02:14:05,380 --> 02:14:10,779
operation there are linear operations

2501
02:14:08,679 --> 02:14:13,989
happening whether you like it or not so

2502
02:14:10,779 --> 02:14:15,938
for example bilinear blending it's got

2503
02:14:13,988 --> 02:14:19,448
linear write in the name every single

2504
02:14:15,939 --> 02:14:21,939
pixel we draw goes through a bilinear

2505
02:14:19,448 --> 02:14:24,879
blend that's how we get scaling to look

2506
02:14:21,939 --> 02:14:27,070
smooth is the bilinear blend right that

2507
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:30,069
bilinear blend will produce an incorrect

2508
02:14:27,069 --> 02:14:32,380
result if the underlying information is

2509
02:14:30,069 --> 02:14:34,868
itself not linear because a bilinear

2510
02:14:32,380 --> 02:14:37,510
blend blends linearly if the underlying

2511
02:14:34,868 --> 02:14:39,908
stuff is not linear then the bilinear

2512
02:14:37,510 --> 02:14:43,420
blend will produce a nonlinear result

2513
02:14:39,908 --> 02:14:46,299
and so even just shrinking a sprite down

2514
02:14:43,420 --> 02:14:48,729
reduces produces incorrect results if

2515
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:51,670
you were using non premultiplied alpha

2516
02:14:48,729 --> 02:14:53,829
so premultiplied alpha is is necessary

2517
02:14:51,670 --> 02:14:56,889
right from the first time you start

2518
02:14:53,828 --> 02:14:58,359
doing anything even scaling now because

2519
02:14:56,889 --> 02:15:00,309
modern hardware is very powerful

2520
02:14:58,359 --> 02:15:02,288
you can decide and do other things now

2521
02:15:00,309 --> 02:15:05,079
you could use non premultiplied alpha

2522
02:15:02,288 --> 02:15:09,009
and write your own blending routines

2523
02:15:05,078 --> 02:15:10,618
that do things inside them to fix it but

2524
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:13,510
assuming that you're using the hardware

2525
02:15:10,618 --> 02:15:15,429
bilinear blend you don't can't do that

2526
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:17,019
and so to be on the fast path you

2527
02:15:15,429 --> 02:15:20,980
typically still want premultiplied alpha

2528
02:15:17,019 --> 02:15:23,849
even today so hopefully that helps

2529
02:15:20,979 --> 02:15:23,848
answer the question a little bit

2530
02:15:38,409 --> 02:15:42,130
and as for whether or not see those

2531
02:15:40,149 --> 02:15:43,659
first forces used as templates or not it

2532
02:15:42,130 --> 02:15:45,010
doesn't force you use templates but if

2533
02:15:43,659 --> 02:15:46,420
you want to write a generic container

2534
02:15:45,010 --> 02:15:52,989
you have to they don't provide any other

2535
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:54,940
features for doing so so it's like

2536
02:15:52,989 --> 02:15:56,800
either you don't get a generic container

2537
02:15:54,939 --> 02:15:58,349
or you have to use templates they have

2538
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:00,579
no other meta programming features I

2539
02:15:58,350 --> 02:16:04,740
think they're adding introspection

2540
02:16:00,579 --> 02:16:07,600
somewhere at some point right finally

2541
02:16:04,739 --> 02:16:08,859
that was my understanding anyway and

2542
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:10,660
whether or not that goes through a

2543
02:16:08,859 --> 02:16:12,609
different path or something I don't know

2544
02:16:10,659 --> 02:16:15,789
I don't know how these aren't gonna end

2545
02:16:12,609 --> 02:16:17,949
up shoehorning that in but just in terms

2546
02:16:15,789 --> 02:16:20,409
of generic containers I would love to

2547
02:16:17,949 --> 02:16:21,550
write generic containers C++ does simply

2548
02:16:20,409 --> 02:16:26,349
doesn't support them to my satisfaction

2549
02:16:21,550 --> 02:16:28,449
so I don't bother but in an in a proper

2550
02:16:26,350 --> 02:16:35,770
meta programming language all of my

2551
02:16:28,449 --> 02:16:37,539
containers would be generic it's the

2552
02:16:35,770 --> 02:16:39,250
asset to a fixed from day for something

2553
02:16:37,540 --> 02:16:41,860
I wasn't able to build some of the tools

2554
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:47,469
coming up a little bit oh that's a good

2555
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:49,720
point the test asset builder probably

2556
02:16:47,469 --> 02:16:52,659
needs to get merged in now which I

2557
02:16:49,719 --> 02:16:54,549
should probably do you know this is

2558
02:16:52,659 --> 02:16:56,139
something we should probably do soon so

2559
02:16:54,549 --> 02:16:58,659
I don't really want to it tomorrow but

2560
02:16:56,139 --> 02:17:03,819
probably next weekend we should merge

2561
02:16:58,659 --> 02:17:05,139
the font stuff and the sound stuff we

2562
02:17:03,819 --> 02:17:07,090
should just move those in for the

2563
02:17:05,139 --> 02:17:09,430
automatic importing so that you can

2564
02:17:07,090 --> 02:17:12,430
basically just never have to use this

2565
02:17:09,430 --> 02:17:15,670
stuff again right that would also allow

2566
02:17:12,430 --> 02:17:18,729
us to stop you could do a build straight

2567
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:21,540
from our source inputs again which is

2568
02:17:18,729 --> 02:17:25,389
better right that's just a better thing

2569
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:29,950
so we should do that soon but no you

2570
02:17:25,389 --> 02:17:32,729
can't really do that at the moment all

2571
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:32,730
right that's it for today

2572
02:17:36,750 --> 02:17:40,270
all right thank you for joining me for

2573
02:17:39,309 --> 02:17:41,591
this so to hand me here it's Owen

2574
02:17:40,270 --> 02:17:43,329
pleasure coding with you as always if

2575
02:17:41,591 --> 02:17:44,800
you would like to follow along with the

2576
02:17:43,329 --> 02:17:46,389
series you can always hear the game on

2577
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:48,670
handmade hero or it comes to the source

2578
02:17:46,389 --> 02:17:51,039
code which allows you to follow along at

2579
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:53,170
home and play around with stuff that

2580
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:56,591
we're doing I'll be back here tomorrow

2581
02:17:53,170 --> 02:17:58,210
and we'll implement that editor stuff by

2582
02:17:56,591 --> 02:17:59,860
basically taking our debug UI code and

2583
02:17:58,209 --> 02:18:01,989
just maybe unifying it a bit so that we

2584
02:17:59,860 --> 02:18:04,659
can use it for edit versus debug and so

2585
02:18:01,989 --> 02:18:06,520
on hope see you back here for that until

2586
02:18:04,659 --> 02:18:07,149
then have fun partnering I'll see you on

2587
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:09,720
the Internet

2588
02:18:07,149 --> 02:18:09,719
take it easy everybody
