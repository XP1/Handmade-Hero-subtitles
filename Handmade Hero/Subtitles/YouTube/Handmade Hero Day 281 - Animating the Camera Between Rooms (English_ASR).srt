00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:10,320
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,589
Hero the show where we code a complete

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,190
game live on stream the live astons

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:22,740
streamis that one can possibly be when

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:27,480
one is live on stream look I'm not gonna

6
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:29,969
I'm not gonna lie to you we've you know

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,279
we've got we've got some serious entity

8
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:34,710
work to do we did a bunch of cool stuff

9
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,680
to our entity system but now's the time

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,200
to start you know start getting real in

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,329
there start start you know facing up to

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,890
it to the hard life the hard reality

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,250
reality is the harsh realities of life

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,530
is an entity and I'd like to dive right

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,000
into it so today is day 281 I think

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,739
we've got that right is that right let's

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,738
double check if today is in fact a to 81

18
00:00:54,738 --> 00:01:00,808
to 79 oh well looks like the episode

19
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:05,128
guide may be missing a day let's double

20
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:08,938
check from the YouTube and made archive

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,650
you know what is it youtube.com slash

22
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,478
user hammer here because such great

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,820
vanity URLs from YouTube right they

24
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,280
nailed it but yeah day two eighty so

25
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,500
stay to 81 here we reset see try that's

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,509
the only reason that I'm wanted to

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,219
double-check that so day two 81 is what

28
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,409
we're on you want to unpack day two 80s

29
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,060
source code if you want to follow along

30
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,340
with what I'm doing that's what I'm

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,269
starting with and if I remember

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,180
correctly we ended yesterday on a slight

33
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:39,118
bug I wanted to look at I probably will

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,909
look at it now and that's just a glitch

35
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,739
we reimplemented basically room based

36
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,259
movement it would reimplemented strong

37
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:50,188
term we basically just turned it back on

38
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:53,938
again and so what I wanted to do was

39
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:56,218
take a look at exactly how this

40
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:58,648
transition was working when I come up

41
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:00,989
here there's some kind of I believe a

42
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,930
glitch where I see for a split second I

43
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:07,109
felt like I was seeing yeah I still am I

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,909
see a flash it's like an instant flash

45
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:15,539
of this of a different screen

46
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:18,060
and and it's like I don't know how it's

47
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,459
getting that but it's obvious to me or

48
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,430
at least it seems relatively clear to me

49
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,920
that the camera update takes two frames

50
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,260
to work properly you might not be able

51
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,459
to see that because of the twitch you

52
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,750
know it's your compress you're getting a

53
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:36,390
compressed video stream and it probably

54
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:38,129
throws that frame out entirely but

55
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:43,349
you'll just have to trust me it's there

56
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:47,060
I know that it's there and let's go

57
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:49,349
ahead and yeah come on come on mr.

58
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,030
potato there we go

59
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,189
and so I just want to take a look at

60
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,659
that logic it's not like it's the final

61
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:57,090
logics that's gonna be used in the game

62
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,650
at all but I want to make sure that

63
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,330
there isn't something deeper going on

64
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,800
because we were just sort of finishing

65
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,900
up how this code was going to work and

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,820
we don't want to have some stuff in

67
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,740
there that we don't understand right

68
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,539
like I don't want there to be something

69
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,370
weird happening and I don't understand

70
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,199
what it is if it's just something like

71
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,640
Sogo we got to write the final camera

72
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,919
code later and it'll be different that's

73
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,809
fine but I don't want there to be a

74
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,879
glitch that's happening for some other

75
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,319
reason and so I want that's why I'm

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,479
interested in investigating this

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,680
particular thing so here we go with our

78
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,009
camera movement you can see here when we

79
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,330
do NCM we do unpacks into the into the

80
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:35,099
buffer here

81
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,980
I'm sorry pax into the buffer where we

82
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,289
do a sort of all of our entity right out

83
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:43,049
and before we do anything else you can

84
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:46,590
see here we before we pack the entity

85
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,510
into the permanent storage we go through

86
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,039
and we update the camera if this happens

87
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,709
to be the entity that the cameras

88
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,659
following right now why we check every

89
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,490
time I don't know that's not a

90
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,229
particularly interesting thing to do we

91
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,969
could just check outside this loop and

92
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,989
that's probably smarter I'm gonna leave

93
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:02,400
it in there though because the whole

94
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,480
point is to investigate this bug so I

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,780
don't want to start touching things

96
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,159
until I actually know what's going on so

97
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,180
I'm gonna take a look inside here we're

98
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,650
gonna say all right we've got this

99
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,790
entity we know that this is the one we

100
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,590
are following we have not touched the

101
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,900
entity yet right there's been no editing

102
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,560
of the entity code yet so we dropped

103
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,780
through here and we say okay let's

104
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,899
process this thing you can see that

105
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,819
we've got this global render

106
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:28,519
camera room base that's what's actually

107
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:30,469
happening here if you turn that off you

108
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,120
go into scrolling mode and I guess I

109
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,490
should mention we haven't tested that

110
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,750
scrolling mode I probably want to delete

111
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,100
it because there's never gonna be a

112
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,279
scrolling mode in this game it is not

113
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:43,370
something that actually is allowed but

114
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,888
if I wanted to yeah so it looks like

115
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,228
that still works just fine it can track

116
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:52,519
the player exactly and nothing weird

117
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:55,610
happens there it's kind of kind of

118
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,579
nauseating I don't think we would want

119
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,830
it to follow the jumping like that but

120
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:05,060
it's kind of funny that it does to say

121
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:06,680
the least anyway so that's clearly

122
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,538
working fine so the only thing that's

123
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,150
not working is that update that's based

124
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:14,418
on the room location and so what I'm

125
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:16,370
guessing is that this particular this

126
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:18,829
information here is really what the

127
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,680
problem is so if we take a look at

128
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:24,079
what's going on we can see here that

129
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:30,439
we're testing the entity's displacement

130
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:32,120
from the sim region center right because

131
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,649
the sim Region center is of course with

132
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,598
the cameras we're testing the

133
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:37,788
displacement from the sim region center

134
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:40,129
and we're seeing whether it's more than

135
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:42,399
nine in the x-direction or more than

136
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:45,860
five in the y-direction and if it is

137
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,239
we're just placing it now I could pretty

138
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,710
much tell you what the bug is already

139
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,590
because I'm just looking here it's like

140
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:55,569
that's the bug right for some reason

141
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:58,310
there's still a value of x displacement

142
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,439
being stuck in there and what's kind of

143
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,839
interesting is this is sort of a

144
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,719
feedback based operation what's amusing

145
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,250
is it's self-corrected right so you can

146
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,820
see what happens is it displaces the

147
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,519
camera 18 units to the right and then 10

148
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:17,418
units upward and so effectively what was

149
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,788
happening when we were moving out side

150
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:24,139
there

151
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:28,009
here's day 281 effectively what was

152
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:30,228
happening is here's the camera this is

153
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:33,589
what we're looking at we hop off the

154
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:35,329
edge it detects that okay it hits this

155
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:36,810
case which is we're greater than five

156
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:39,240
units off of

157
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,819
the center line right so then it says

158
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,579
well I'd better displace this thing 18

159
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,980
and 10 is the de placement it uses so

160
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:49,979
it's basically putting the camera like

161
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,600
over here somewhere now that's the 18 is

162
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,850
what we would normally displace for the

163
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,560
whole sideways motion so it's basically

164
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,610
doing this I don't really know how far

165
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,040
we move it sideways if it's one whole

166
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,199
screen whatever it is that's what we're

167
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,600
doing effectively so the camera moves

168
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,668
here and then what happens is and we see

169
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,379
one frame with it there but then the

170
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:10,319
very next frame it goes oh hey guess

171
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,879
what that entity we're gonna check its

172
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,099
location again and it sees that it's

173
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,529
more than negative nine off it's it's

174
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,390
more than nine units this way right so

175
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:20,729
then it goes oh I'd better apply that

176
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:24,779
displacement which is this which

177
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,430
subtracts the 18 back off again right so

178
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,319
we effectively do this

179
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,660
to get there so just the way that we

180
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,060
happen to write the routine

181
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,590
self-corrected which i guess is good but

182
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,149
that's definitely a bug obviously we

183
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,279
only want to displace the camera in the

184
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,779
direction we're trying to go and not in

185
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,449
some other direction that's kind of

186
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:44,219
self-evident so now when I hop off I'm

187
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:46,529
expecting something cleaner and I got

188
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,600
something cleaner we're no longer really

189
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:50,459
locked to the size of a screen it looks

190
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,039
like so we should probably take some

191
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:54,989
time to get that looking a little bit

192
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,589
more correct and the other thing that I

193
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:02,639
would like to do is I think I would like

194
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:04,829
to have a more stable idea of what's

195
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,110
supposed to happen for the camera in

196
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:10,019
terms of interpolation because what we'd

197
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,669
probably like to do is even though I

198
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:13,649
don't want any smooth scrolling in the

199
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:15,779
game like I was saying it would be nice

200
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:17,639
to do a smooth transition between them

201
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,459
so even though you're locked to this

202
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,430
view while this little fellow is hopping

203
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:25,949
around when you go through here even the

204
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,240
8-bit Legend of Zelda it like that Peppa

205
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,829
Peppa you know it kind of like

206
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,329
transitioned the screen in sense we've

207
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:32,610
got plenty of horsepower it seems like

208
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:36,978
it would be nice to give the user a nice

209
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:39,210
animated transition between those and

210
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,770
and and so I think that's what we'll

211
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,450
play around with today like obviously we

212
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,889
fix that very simple bug but you know

213
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,420
maybe now's a good time look at that

214
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:47,970
camera code and actually make something

215
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:49,839
real I also think that now hopefully we

216
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,899
shouldn't have any bugs with

217
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,639
with any of the camera motion like and

218
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:57,240
so we can hit up against these and we

219
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,470
don't get any bugs and so that's nice

220
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,669
we're nice and stable here and that's

221
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:05,320
good so I'm pretty happy about that and

222
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,479
we're starting to things are starting to

223
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,070
shape up here for our actual game code

224
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,750
which is nice because we're gonna start

225
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,820
dropping a bunch of logic in there and

226
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,100
you know enemies and fighting and stuff

227
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:24,339
like this we don't want to be in a bad

228
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:26,440
situation oh that's interesting Wow Wow

229
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,880
so because our room thing happens to

230
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,470
just be like sort of weird and buggy

231
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:31,870
right now and just makes random stuff I

232
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,050
guess you can have those points occur

233
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,659
further away and so then you can like oh

234
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:39,399
that's great because remember I said I

235
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:41,199
wanted to make it so it's not on a fixed

236
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,079
grid well it happened to create a longer

237
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:51,370
hop and he hops it how cool is that

238
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:56,500
that's just great I love it ha that's

239
00:09:51,370 --> 00:10:01,539
hilarious okay well um yeah so can we

240
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,019
just full-on abuse this system that's so

241
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:04,750
cool

242
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:08,110
I guess those we shouldn't have put

243
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,909
hopital squares where the trees are but

244
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,110
that's kind of funny right because we

245
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,929
don't do any collision section on the

246
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,430
body now remember we assume that

247
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:17,229
anywhere that there's a hobble right now

248
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:18,459
it actually lets it go through there's a

249
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,990
bunch of work we're gonna do on that

250
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,210
later so that's that's like a separate

251
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,950
issue but that's just kind of funny yeah

252
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:28,180
oh that's so cool

253
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,250
sorry this is what happens when you

254
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:32,049
start making games is you find little

255
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,149
things that your think are funny and you

256
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:36,370
play with them what can you do alright

257
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:37,559
enough of that sorry to waste your time

258
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,179
there

259
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,219
so anyway point being what I'd like to

260
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:44,679
do is start looking at how we could have

261
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,050
a more solid notion of where the cameras

262
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:50,169
should be looking and then you know I'd

263
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:52,620
like to make some sort of an idea of how

264
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:56,139
it's going to interpolate back and forth

265
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,600
that's that would be my preference so I

266
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:00,429
think what I'd like to do is I'd like to

267
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,889
introduce a more stable notion of that

268
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:04,479
size of the screen and when we're

269
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:06,039
what we're gonna do is we're gonna test

270
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,798
more stable e where we are in that

271
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:11,169
that's in that sort of screen boundary

272
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:13,720
and then do some interesting things with

273
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:15,818
it I think that's the best way to go so

274
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,540
let me pop over to the whiteboard for a

275
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:23,469
second here and just talk about you know

276
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:24,608
camera control and some things that we

277
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,899
want to think about when we're doing

278
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:31,989
camera controls okay so the first thing

279
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:34,839
that I want to explain or maybe the

280
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:36,309
really one of the only things that I

281
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,899
want to explain that's sort of a new

282
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:40,088
concept to us that we haven't talked

283
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:45,068
about very much is the concept of

284
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:47,379
hysteresis and I don't know how to spell

285
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:51,488
hysteresis any more than you do so let's

286
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:55,778
just say that it's hysteresis I don't

287
00:11:51,489 --> 00:12:01,809
know like that maybe I have no idea how

288
00:11:55,778 --> 00:12:05,999
to spell that word there we go we were

289
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:05,999
close we just missed the eye right

290
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:15,388
and hysteresis is kind of an important

291
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:16,828
concept especially with cameras there

292
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:18,778
are other situations where it's

293
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:20,669
important to understand what that means

294
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:23,189
and why you should care but camera

295
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:26,240
controls are probably the most important

296
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:28,860
because camera controls are the things

297
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,028
or rather how your game deals with a

298
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:36,449
camera especially in 3d but also in 2d

299
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:37,919
basically no matter what hysteresis sort

300
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:39,240
of is a concept that comes into play in

301
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,159
a lot of ways and so let's talk about

302
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,068
what that means and why we should care

303
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,439
all right so camera control is sort of

304
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:48,088
the person's perception of where they

305
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,130
are to a large extent right because

306
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,040
remember when you put VR goggles on or

307
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:56,429
something like if you're wearing an HTC

308
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,769
vive or something then your point of

309
00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:00,568
view of the world is controlled by you

310
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,100
in a natural way right look I've moved

311
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:03,360
my head around and it knows where I'm

312
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,490
looking and all these are the sorts of

313
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,720
things and so there's no real disconnect

314
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:12,509
between the person and the point of view

315
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,730
but in a game where we're talking about

316
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:16,528
a monitor right and you're and you're

317
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,389
sort of presenting this view of the

318
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:20,578
world through that monitor and the

319
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:22,589
person's movement of their head and how

320
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:25,138
they look is disconnected from what's

321
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,209
actually going on the screen you

322
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,528
essentially have a perception problem

323
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:35,159
right you sort of have like a perception

324
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:38,100
almost like a perception grammar you

325
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,719
might even say that's going on when you

326
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,220
look through this monitor so I look at

327
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,079
the monitor you know when I see some

328
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,550
things around in the monitor or whatever

329
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:46,948
you know when I see them moving in

330
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:48,568
certain directions and I know because

331
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:49,889
I'm a video game player and I've been

332
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:51,088
conditioned for a long time to

333
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:53,278
understand what I've seen the screen I

334
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:55,470
know a bunch of things when handmade

335
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,028
hero comes up it's not like oh my god

336
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,920
what's going on I don't understand it's

337
00:13:57,028 --> 00:14:01,019
like no I immediately see oh this looks

338
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,789
orthographic I can see by the way like

339
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,139
the trees are in the ground and even

340
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:05,669
though we don't even have the final art

341
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,438
in there you're still already like I

342
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:10,860
just get it right I can move my guy

343
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:13,289
around and whatever whatever right and

344
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,720
so what you have to remember is even

345
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:19,458
though you probably know all this stuff

346
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,459
and so do the gamers and everything else

347
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,899
just because we all take it for granted

348
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,820
doesn't mean it's not still there so

349
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:29,590
there's constantly this sort of thing

350
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:34,930
that's happening where you've kind of

351
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:36,310
got you let me give you a little bit of

352
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:38,559
hair just a tiny bit of hair there

353
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:40,239
you've got you and you're looking at the

354
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,129
screen right and then you've got your

355
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,620
hand on the on the mouse or the keyboard

356
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:47,740
or whatever right and you're doing stuff

357
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,240
this sort of arc that goes through where

358
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,190
you're like seeing something making

359
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,799
decisions going through there's a huge

360
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,270
amount of perception that's going on

361
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,919
there there's all of these sort of

362
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,139
things that you're doing in your brain

363
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:03,250
to allow you to be able to play this

364
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:05,769
game and the camera because it is out of

365
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,529
your control right it's moving around

366
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,899
not in the way your head moves but

367
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,549
rather in some sort of secondary

368
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:15,269
response to what you're doing with the

369
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:18,189
keyboard or the mouse it's moving right

370
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:19,600
your ability to do what you need to do

371
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,520
with the controls and your ability to

372
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,290
perceive the game and your ability not

373
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,019
to get sick and vomit all over the place

374
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:28,449
right all of that is sort of tied up in

375
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:31,149
the camera controls right and so there's

376
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:33,879
two things that are happening there one

377
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:37,509
is like your you know your ability to

378
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:39,730
sort of project right your ability to

379
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:41,350
know what you know I'm seeing what's in

380
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,690
the world and I'm kind of imagining what

381
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,580
that actually is in 3d and how it works

382
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,940
and then there's your ability to like

383
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:51,700
control it okay and both of these are

384
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,290
effectively have a transform happening

385
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,430
right your head is taking all these

386
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:56,889
symbols it's seeing they're very

387
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:58,779
abstract and they're not really in 3d

388
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,699
they're ins like pseudo 3d it's making

389
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:02,709
this sort of understanding of what it

390
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,930
really means and then you are sort of

391
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:08,350
formulating what you would need to do

392
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:09,609
with the controls to affect the change

393
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,170
that you want to see happen on the

394
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,659
screen and how you want to play the game

395
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:15,370
you're doing that process right so it's

396
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:16,449
like this step of like first construct

397
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,250
what's actually happening the world

398
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,050
based on what I see construct what the

399
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,289
controls are that I should use and like

400
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:24,990
do that right and the camera messes with

401
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:28,209
this more than anything else right

402
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:32,080
because let's say for example that I'm

403
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,920
looking at the screen okay and you know

404
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,320
I've got my guy here

405
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,990
and I'm like walking him forwards or

406
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,959
something like this and I'm trying to

407
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,820
understand what I'm going to go hit when

408
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,549
I'm here and the camera just starts

409
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,470
scrolling this way right now my brain

410
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:50,269
has to do this thing all of a sudden

411
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,889
where it's like trying to go like okay

412
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:53,600
the screens moving this way so I'm

413
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:54,829
predicting the motion of these things

414
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,290
and I know that I would like Kerr

415
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:59,659
slightly left or whatever right so the

416
00:16:57,289 --> 00:17:01,278
camera is like drastically change that

417
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:04,159
perception let's say I wrote start to

418
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,410
rotate it so I'm pushing up on the thing

419
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,410
well now what happens does my guy keep

420
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,269
pushing up as he turns or does he always

421
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,160
move upwards in screen space even though

422
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:16,160
the cameras like spinning him around or

423
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,919
whatever right and if you don't believe

424
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,689
me or can't think of an example try to

425
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,009
think of the last time you played a game

426
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:30,650
that had clockwise clap counterclockwise

427
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:32,509
in it because this is the place where

428
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,009
you can really tell especially if you're

429
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,289
like me and aren't super good at doing

430
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:37,940
the mapping right there are these games

431
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:41,089
that are like oh let's say I push the a

432
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,580
key my guy rotates that way and I push

433
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:45,439
the like D key and my guy rotates this

434
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:45,980
way right so he's pointing this

435
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,440
direction

436
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,940
I pushed the the you know the a key and

437
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,558
he starts to rotate that direction

438
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,200
I pushed the D key and he starts to

439
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:55,730
rotate the other direction right well if

440
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,900
you've ever been in that situation you

441
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,490
know that when your guys pointing

442
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,290
downward oftentimes you make this make

443
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,558
of like I wanted to rotate this way I

444
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:05,329
push D and it doesn't like go that way

445
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,308
it goes this way because D is for

446
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:10,639
rotating around in the clockwise fashion

447
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:12,918
right your ability to perceive like what

448
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,110
the controls were will do right relies

449
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:16,580
on your brain's ability to constantly do

450
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:18,889
these mappings of what do the controls

451
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:21,019
me and so the cameras orientation its

452
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,030
position its motion all of those are

453
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:27,548
like affecting your brains ability to do

454
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:27,548
stuff right so yeah

455
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,450
in handmade hero I hate I hate this

456
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:38,240
stuff so there will be none of that ever

457
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:40,730
in handmade hero I went with a control

458
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,990
scheme that's like you've moved by just

459
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,370
pushing the direction you want to go and

460
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,220
you attack them by pushing the Russian

461
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:48,109
you want to attack right it's a standard

462
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,569
control scheme that everyone understands

463
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:52,309
and that does not involve any of those

464
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:53,929
things so there's all sorts of issues

465
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:55,549
with controls in your perception all

466
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,140
that sort of stuff I'm just choosing the

467
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:58,399
sidestep those and not tackle them

468
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,570
because I think it's way better just

469
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,990
have nice direct controls don't have

470
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:04,909
that problem so we don't have that but

471
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,440
we still have all the same problems with

472
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:11,240
the camera and let's take as an example

473
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,380
to introduce the concept of hysteresis

474
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,450
that I said it's what I want to talk

475
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,000
about here let's just take for example

476
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:20,000
even what I'm already looking at right

477
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,400
now okay now you can see when I kind of

478
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,160
move through there right when I when I

479
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,050
do that jump it's very sharp you know we

480
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,430
don't really have a game going on here

481
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,529
right we haven't made enemies that

482
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,360
attack you so it's not it's like it's

483
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:33,680
low stress that it's not a problem

484
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:35,449
that's jarring because I don't need to

485
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,610
do anything I'm not in imminent danger

486
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,440
anything but you can imagine if I just

487
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:41,059
hopped in here and bam hopped in here

488
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,410
and all of a sudden the screen comes up

489
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,819
and there's like lava right in front of

490
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,970
me I'm about to die or whatever right

491
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:48,859
that's not a good experience right so

492
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,049
even just what we have right now we

493
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:54,109
would start to worry about that whole

494
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:56,869
perception loop are we allowing the

495
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:59,419
player the ability like are we giving

496
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:01,879
them what they need in terms of a

497
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,080
pleasant experience of moving from room

498
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,080
to room and the answer is like kind of

499
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:08,449
already know all right so let's talk

500
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,879
about what hysteresis is hysteresis is a

501
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:14,240
word that essentially means you know

502
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,100
sort of in printer products takes into

503
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,079
account the previous frame might be the

504
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:20,480
way to put it but another way to say it

505
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:23,389
is that it's not time independent right

506
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,860
so I can make a function that does

507
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,920
something and it could be completely

508
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:29,299
independent of time okay and that's what

509
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,830
we have right now like if you take a

510
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:33,069
look at how our camera code works

511
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,879
effectively it's not dependent on time

512
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:37,700
really any significant degree

513
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,220
it's just dependent on position so

514
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,289
wherever the player goes we will figure

515
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,220
out where they're supposed to go based

516
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:44,808
on this now it's

517
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,210
not strictly true because since this is

518
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:49,308
a delta technically it is based on time

519
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,659
a little bit it's based on the order in

520
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:52,819
which you did things and you can see

521
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:54,320
that in fact if I restart the game you

522
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,548
can kind of see that it is that does

523
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,740
have a little bit of a dependence there

524
00:20:55,548 --> 00:21:00,650
right which is to say I come up here I

525
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,558
come down here and I can get it to be

526
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,600
well actually no I guess that's not true

527
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,009
our deltas are exactly even so I guess

528
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,029
it isn't I was gonna say you could get

529
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:09,829
it into a different state but I guess

530
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:12,529
you can't because our deltas are always

531
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:14,240
exactly the same so even so yeah so it's

532
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:16,158
pretty much not depending on time at all

533
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,960
it's just wherever the person is there's

534
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,520
a specific camera a position that is

535
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:27,380
that is the cameras gonna look at and

536
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:29,450
when they get there I think I feel like

537
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,350
is even that because the 918 I don't

538
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,240
know that might not be true it doesn't

539
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:34,519
matter point being ignore that for a

540
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,169
second and let's just say this is only

541
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:37,339
dependent on position rather than trying

542
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:40,400
to figure out whether there's a way you

543
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:41,959
could get it to not be right that

544
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,850
doesn't take into account time it

545
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,490
doesn't take an account the path that

546
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:48,500
the player flowed through the world

547
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,900
right it just knows when the person's

548
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:54,109
here I want to show them this particular

549
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,210
camera angle now hysteresis is about not

550
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:58,308
doing that it's about saying let's take

551
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,200
into account time let's take into

552
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:02,389
account the path by which something

553
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,690
arrived where it's going to be and let's

554
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,759
make our algorithms aware of that okay

555
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,759
now why is that important well I'll give

556
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:18,319
you a very simple example let's say that

557
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:20,419
we had a room perhaps and you know we we

558
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:24,019
well trying to think of what the what

559
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:26,890
the easiest way to to to describe

560
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:26,889
something like this is

561
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:38,330
let's say that we have a room and we

562
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,799
were trying to figure out where to place

563
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:47,599
the camera in this room right and there

564
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,549
is a a obstacle okay that the player has

565
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,859
to navigate in some way

566
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:53,990
it's like somewhat difficult for them to

567
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:57,439
navigate right look maybe it's a locked

568
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:59,839
door or something like this right and so

569
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,269
I've got like a situation where I've got

570
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,759
this door here right and then I've got a

571
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:06,829
wall and and then I've got you know some

572
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:09,279
stuff down here or whatever and then

573
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:13,849
there's like an opening over here right

574
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:16,759
okay now let's say that our solution for

575
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:18,109
how we were going to do the camera was

576
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,849
just that it's a fixed thing in the

577
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:21,829
world and maybe this is what the the map

578
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:24,619
was going to be and so the the way that

579
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:26,929
the the partitions for the world work

580
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:30,319
out is here's where like one camera

581
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:33,440
angle is right and here's where another

582
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:38,139
camera angle is okay

583
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:41,450
and here's where another one is right

584
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:43,009
and you can imagine that if all I was

585
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,410
gonna do is just pick one of these based

586
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:48,109
on where I was I don't get a very

587
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:50,630
satisfying result from this right

588
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:52,879
because if I'm walking up to the room

589
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,500
this way right if this was the way I was

590
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,670
coming in and maybe I can see you know

591
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,769
what let me simplify this a little and

592
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,820
just consider the top two parts back

593
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,819
since that'll be a little bit easier

594
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:08,529
okay

595
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:08,529
so here's one let's let's do it this way

596
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:18,399
here's one here's the other so I'm

597
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,788
coming in this way I walk in through the

598
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:24,069
door at the open area in here and then

599
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:26,980
I'm in this area and I can't even see

600
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:28,359
this yeah right I walk off the side of

601
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,278
the screen which appears to have nothing

602
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:32,439
on it and then I'm in this little tiny

603
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,690
sliver of space with the door and I see

604
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,740
all this stuff over here right that's

605
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:41,590
what I that's what I'm getting okay

606
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,419
now if instead I was let's say there was

607
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:45,069
another entrance over here if instead I

608
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:46,899
walked this way and came around through

609
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:48,668
here then I'm get a much more pleasant

610
00:24:46,898 --> 00:24:50,739
thing what I would expect I'd be able to

611
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:53,169
see the room I was in I'd be able to see

612
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,339
the door right and only a little bit of

613
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:58,450
what's on the other side of it makes

614
00:24:54,339 --> 00:25:00,388
good sense right now if you take a look

615
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,038
at this and go I would like both

616
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:05,439
approaches I would like both of these to

617
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,058
work properly then what you want right

618
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,090
is a camera scheme that takes into

619
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:12,609
account where you came from right if I'm

620
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:14,138
approaching from this side I want to see

621
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:15,638
up to the door and end if I'm

622
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,589
approaching from this side I want to see

623
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:20,288
up to the door and end right so I'm

624
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:23,079
gonna have like different views for

625
00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:26,679
potentially similar locations depending

626
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:31,990
on when I came through right and that's

627
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,809
the nature of hysteresis not the best

628
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,528
example and I apologize for that I

629
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:37,089
wanted to give at least one other

630
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:39,519
example and for some reason I'm having

631
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:41,378
trouble thinking one now I will give you

632
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,579
the example I actually care about which

633
00:25:41,378 --> 00:25:45,759
is what we need to use a foreign

634
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:47,528
handmade hero okay now I just said what

635
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,139
I wanted to do when we were talking

636
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:51,849
about it before is I've got a room based

637
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:53,740
camera model so this sort of thing is

638
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:56,500
not super concerning to us because we're

639
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,319
building our like individual play units

640
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,778
to be contained inside a screen anyway

641
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:04,538
right so I don't need to worry about

642
00:26:01,778 --> 00:26:06,099
picking camera views the camera views

643
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:09,099
are created as part of the world

644
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:10,658
creation we know what a room is and

645
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:12,069
regardless of how big or small we make

646
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:14,528
rooms or even if there are multiple room

647
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:15,908
sizes the camera has always has very

648
00:26:14,528 --> 00:26:18,909
strict information this is what you

649
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:20,139
should show show this right so we don't

650
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:21,278
have that mr. Reese's problems talked

651
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:23,829
about four but we do have a different

652
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:26,829
one and that is our standard

653
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:29,079
kind of layout right will be one that

654
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:31,179
looks sort of like this will have two

655
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:33,429
different camera views right here's

656
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,620
camera view a and here's camera view B

657
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,060
and we've got a passageway in between

658
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,859
them and the player will cross that

659
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:41,559
threshold at some point and we'll watch

660
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:44,169
a transition from the camera from A to B

661
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,659
right and what I want to do there is I

662
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:51,070
want the camera to sort of smoothly vary

663
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:53,200
from A to B and back right and so

664
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:55,119
there's a couple different ways that we

665
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,830
might want to do this and I'm not sure

666
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,000
exactly how we want to do them but I

667
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:59,470
wanted to talk to you about the

668
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,710
hysteresis after that so when I start

669
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:04,930
mentioning that as we sort of play with

670
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,059
things we may choose to use a method

671
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:09,730
that takes into the into the that into

672
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:12,929
account now a method that has no

673
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:16,299
hysteresis like I just said will always

674
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:19,049
will mean that wherever the player is

675
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:21,970
right at any time anywhere that I pick

676
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:23,769
it does not matter how they got there we

677
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,870
will be able to say exactly where the

678
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:27,549
camera is so if the thing is here the

679
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:30,669
camera angle is B if the things here

680
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:35,250
it's a right and we can construct a

681
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:39,190
smooth scrolling camera system right

682
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:42,009
that would work with this the way we

683
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:45,970
would do that is we would take some

684
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:48,339
region in between the two and say as the

685
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:52,480
player transits between these two

686
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:55,089
locations right we take the T value that

687
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,319
maps from camera A to B right we've got

688
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:59,259
sort of a camera

689
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,329
ATB thing happening here that outputs

690
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:04,720
some kind of interpolation between the

691
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:06,639
two okay we could say that that T value

692
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,410
that interpolation T value is just based

693
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,630
on where you are in this narrow corridor

694
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,540
right and that will probably be the

695
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,940
first thing I'll try if it's good great

696
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:17,649
but we may have a problem and what the

697
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,809
problem might be is what if the player

698
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,730
Dali's in here what if the player just

699
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:24,009
kind of hops back and forth in between

700
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:27,490
here the camera will just be going like

701
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:29,049
this like crazy right maybe that's what

702
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,910
we want to have happen

703
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:33,159
I don't know and like I said we'll play

704
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,779
with it but maybe we don't and if we

705
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,769
don't want that to happen that's where

706
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,240
we have to start thinking about

707
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:38,650
hysteresis and

708
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,299
but hysteresis will tell us in this

709
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,290
situation is we have to pay attention to

710
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:46,000
what the players actually been doing and

711
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,720
then we can figure out whether we want

712
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,170
this to happen

713
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,600
so for example if the player starts

714
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:55,690
hovering in here maybe we want to bring

715
00:28:52,599 --> 00:29:00,399
the camera to a rest straddling the two

716
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:03,130
rooms right until they cross this side

717
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,410
of the threshold for more than a second

718
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,940
or something right and again so then

719
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,910
we're putting in that hysteresis that

720
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:12,190
measurement of where they've been wow I

721
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,509
can't even write that we're putting in

722
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,750
that measurement of where they've been

723
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:18,609
and we're figuring out how to sort of

724
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,920
change the function of the camera so

725
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:22,959
that it has state associated with it

726
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:27,130
based on what the player has been doing

727
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,720
okay and so I'm not sure exactly which

728
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,710
one we're gonna do or how we're gonna do

729
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,809
that but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

730
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,920
do the direct mapping one first and the

731
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:35,289
way that I'm gonna do that is I'm just

732
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,450
gonna introduce essentially a apron

733
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:39,399
right I'm gonna say that there's there

734
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:45,039
sort of this this border region here

735
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:51,670
right where as you cross into it if you

736
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:52,869
cross into one of these areas and I

737
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:56,440
don't know what we'll do if you're in

738
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:58,779
one of these maybe both transitions I'm

739
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,970
not sure but if you cross into one of

740
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:05,349
these areas it will start to do the

741
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:07,660
interpolation right and and as it starts

742
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:09,490
to do that interpolation if you come

743
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,380
back it'll it'll it'll just use

744
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,859
basically your distance in there to

745
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:18,760
figure out what the you know what that

746
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:20,379
interpolation level should be okay so

747
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,750
what this is going to mean is we're

748
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,580
going to need some information like our

749
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,859
camera our understanding of where the

750
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:29,319
camera is needs to be a little bit

751
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:31,299
broader because right now we have this

752
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:34,179
concept that the simulation region and

753
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:39,460
the camera are coincident but that's not

754
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:41,440
actually what we want in it to be right

755
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,850
our simulation region should always be

756
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,590
the room you're in and only when it

757
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:47,259
crosses so like this I guess I'm saying

758
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:49,750
is this code is actually correct for the

759
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:50,799
camera as far as the simulation region

760
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,359
is concerned

761
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,369
that's fine and then once you cross into

762
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,669
another room we move the simulation

763
00:30:54,369 --> 00:31:01,709
region over there right and that's fine

764
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:05,050
but we need sort of this other idea of

765
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:07,120
of displacement of the camera and so in

766
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:09,490
addition I'm gonna go into world mode in

767
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,589
and add a concept here that we have a

768
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,480
displacement now this is probably a good

769
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:15,069
thing in general not just for our smooth

770
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,360
scrolling and the reason that it's

771
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:22,000
probably a good thing in general right

772
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:23,829
is because we want for sure we want like

773
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,420
things like screen shake and stuff to be

774
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:27,399
easy to implement like if we want to

775
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,230
shake the screen like a big monster like

776
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,550
stomps on the ground or something we

777
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,500
might want to shake the screen or

778
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:34,089
something like this so we would we

779
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,470
wanted the ability to displace things

780
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:37,569
around anyway

781
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,670
and so that's you know just kind of a

782
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:41,829
natural thing we might want to do so

783
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,440
what I'm gonna do in here since we have

784
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:46,599
the concept of the camera Pete I don't

785
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,220
know what last camera P is for in fact

786
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:49,389
before we get started I just want to see

787
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,019
what what is that even used for

788
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:58,630
absolutely nothing so then I'm gonna

789
00:31:53,019 --> 00:32:00,609
have a you know camera displacement and

790
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,670
all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna when we

791
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:10,389
actually go ahead and use the camera P

792
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:13,630
to sort of actually create the here when

793
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:16,060
we use that to create the center of the

794
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,620
of the sim region you can see we do this

795
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,779
begin sim and then we start drawing

796
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:21,369
things and that sort of stuff right what

797
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:23,319
I want to do is I want to be able to

798
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:26,469
displace this without displacing the

799
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:28,119
simulation region right and the way that

800
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,940
I'm going to do that is just by saying

801
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:32,500
well okay we we know that we have some

802
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,640
rendering that's occurring right and

803
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,049
effect I guess I don't know where we

804
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,360
actually start the render here's where

805
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:39,430
we start the render and we do this

806
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,139
perspective where we do we do a

807
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,840
perspective transport here right and

808
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,580
what I want to do is when we start doing

809
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,250
the offsets because we do entity

810
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:49,809
transforms offset P and we do this stuff

811
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:53,109
here where we do get grounded we point

812
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:56,589
that stuff I want to move the camera by

813
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:58,269
that amount right and by the way I don't

814
00:32:56,589 --> 00:33:02,259
want to really displace these I don't

815
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:04,329
think because these should actually be

816
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:06,970
there well I'll actually guess they

817
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:09,490
should move hmm how do I want to do this

818
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:17,140
exactly I guess I want to set this right

819
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:19,509
off the bat right you can see default

820
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:23,940
upright and a transformed say any

821
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:23,940
transform off the oops that's no good

822
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,120
there we go

823
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,660
default upright transform and then

824
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:40,389
offset P in here what I want to do is I

825
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,820
want to see it can I just displace that

826
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,350
basically set the camera up to be

827
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:46,149
pointing in a different location because

828
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:50,230
all these guys use the entity transform

829
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:52,540
right I think everyone does yeah so if I

830
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,490
want to I could displace everything by

831
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:59,170
saying whatever the camera displacement

832
00:33:54,490 --> 00:34:01,720
is I can just add that in here and I

833
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:07,720
could do the same thing for for these

834
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:10,599
push rect outlines as well right now

835
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,940
it's not the kind of thing the annoying

836
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:18,519
thing about it I don't know what we

837
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:21,389
actually do with camera P here I guess

838
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:21,389
it's behind my head

839
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:34,230
get granted any point entity - camera P

840
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:35,579
camera relative round P ah so the only

841
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,050
reason we were even using the camera P

842
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:40,409
is just to fade things in and out as we

843
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:43,560
went up and down yeah but anyway so our

844
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:45,059
camera P when we do this subtraction all

845
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:46,320
we would need to do is its add the

846
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:47,969
displacement in here and then we know

847
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,890
where the cameras placement is in the

848
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:55,829
world right so this is just our world

849
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,929
mode camera displacement so we know

850
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:59,730
where the camera is but then what we

851
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,079
have to do is when we do default flat

852
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,579
transfer here everything is going to be

853
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,230
have to beat when we do our transference

854
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:07,170
it's going to have that world transform

855
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:10,679
in it and so yeah so I'll change this

856
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:13,860
here to be camera P I guess camera P is

857
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:15,750
actually is not the camera displacement

858
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,480
though camera P is where the camera is

859
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:20,820
the displacements the negative of that

860
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,260
so we still want to do we still want to

861
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:29,990
have a thing called camera displacement

862
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:29,990
if that makes sense yeah

863
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:44,609
so camera displacement to avoid having

864
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:48,929
that be negative I guess what we would

865
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:51,030
say is maybe we'd call that Delta camera

866
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:53,069
P or something like this I just want I

867
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,769
need to know how to call it or camera

868
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:57,180
offset let's call it camera offset

869
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:59,130
that's easier because camera

870
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:02,039
displacement it's hard to tell which way

871
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,349
it's phrased is it phrased in the in

872
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,059
terms of I'm going I'm it is how much

873
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:07,529
the camera moves or is it the opposite

874
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:09,869
which is how much things move because of

875
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,610
the camera right so I'm gonna call it

876
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:13,440
camera offset so then we know that

877
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,630
that's true and the entity transform

878
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:21,260
right is going to be the negative of the

879
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:23,099
camera P right so let's say this here is

880
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:28,170
the

881
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:42,630
you will transform and that's just the

882
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:48,298
camera P inverted right so these guys

883
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:59,160
are going to have world transform will

884
00:36:48,298 --> 00:37:02,009
transform world transform and then down

885
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:15,440
here where we do displacement again I'll

886
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:18,389
just instead do - camera feet alright

887
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:26,940
offset is not a member of what is it

888
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:30,659
then I'll set P sorry alright so I think

889
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,659
that's all correct let's double check by

890
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:38,848
maybe playing with that a little bit so

891
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:41,399
here I am in right in this world here

892
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:44,130
I'm gonna try just placing myself by

893
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,289
moving the camera I'm gonna move the

894
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,729
camera this way which would move

895
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:51,229
everything else in that way so I'm going

896
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:51,228
to move the camera one unit to the right

897
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:03,370
okay perfect

898
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:07,590
that's what I wanted to see and I'm

899
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:10,539
going to try the same thing in Y yeah

900
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:12,970
okay so that's what I was hoping for and

901
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:14,559
you can see what I was hoping would be

902
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:16,449
true is true which is the simulation

903
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,639
boundary is shown right there which is

904
00:38:16,449 --> 00:38:20,829
what I wanted

905
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,599
okay so now we have the ability to have

906
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:25,710
a camera offset so what I'm going to do

907
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:39,489
is I'm just gonna start very lightly

908
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:43,300
playing with that so today in here where

909
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:45,699
we do our stuff for room based camera

910
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,769
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say let's

911
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:49,689
add some displacement in here for the

912
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:51,789
camera and I'm just gonna make it be

913
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,159
based off of that apron so if I know

914
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:55,599
that when I transition is nine I'm gonna

915
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,179
use like everywhere from like eight

916
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,619
point five to nine for example to

917
00:38:58,179 --> 00:39:04,809
displace the camera towards the other

918
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:07,089
screen right so what I want to start is

919
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:12,420
I want to define something here first I

920
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:16,840
wanted to find like a v3 which is the

921
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:21,789
you know room Delta or something and the

922
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:24,789
room Delta is going to be 1810 right

923
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:27,279
that's how much we move when we go you

924
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:30,550
know if we were to go the X component is

925
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,320
how much we go for a room horizontally

926
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:36,370
and the Y component is how much we go

927
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,500
for a room vertically so then when we

928
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:41,739
come in here I would know that all right

929
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:46,179
let's see like like H room Delta maybe

930
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:50,939
is half of that so now I can say like

931
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:56,609
okay if we're each room Delta X right or

932
00:39:50,940 --> 00:40:01,269
negative H room Delta X H room Delta Y

933
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:03,070
negative H room Delta Y okay and then

934
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:05,820
when we do our displacement here I know

935
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:09,190
I can say well this is room Delta X

936
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:13,910
negative room Delta

937
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:16,429
room Delta Y negative room Delta Y and

938
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:18,789
the reason I want that encoded now is

939
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:23,119
because obviously I want to make sure

940
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:25,550
that I don't have to that everything is

941
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,230
based on a size we can change and that

942
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:32,600
could even change dynamically maybe if I

943
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:34,130
want it to right okay so one other thing

944
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,809
I wanted to try guests that I didn't try

945
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:40,039
is I want to be able to displace the

946
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:42,529
camera away from me as well so I'm just

947
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:46,670
gonna quickly also say what if I was to

948
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:50,030
do whatever the world is here I'm gonna

949
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:52,820
take the camera off set and I'll make

950
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:57,320
the Z equal to one so that we displace

951
00:40:52,820 --> 00:41:00,410
the camera vertically does that work at

952
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,750
all oops world mode is spelled wrong so

953
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:04,429
no it certainly wouldn't okay good

954
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,750
because that's another thing I want to

955
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:09,379
be able to do is I want to make sure I

956
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:14,630
can displace the camera vertically I

957
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:15,710
mean a depth wise well to the screen all

958
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,690
right so now what I'm going to do is

959
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,590
gonna say what happens when I'm in that

960
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:23,480
apron right so what happens when because

961
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:24,950
I know what happens when I move right I

962
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,619
know what happens when I do the

963
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:32,569
displacement here but I also want to be

964
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:34,460
able to say once I know once I know that

965
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:37,519
I'm outside of a sort of more

966
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:39,050
conservative region what's that and so

967
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,380
I'm gonna do a thing that's like room

968
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:44,690
apron here and room apron I'm just gonna

969
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,570
say for now is like seventeen point five

970
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,369
eight and nine point five F I'd let me

971
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:52,370
just say like point five of the way

972
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:57,799
there okay so what I'm going to do is

973
00:41:52,369 --> 00:42:01,569
gonna say if entity P dot X is greater

974
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,570
than H room Delta

975
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:05,809
and we'll just do one for now and then

976
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,449
we'll see how we can kind of generalize

977
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:10,670
that up I'm now gonna say okay instead

978
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:22,789
of atrium Delta I'm gonna use like H

979
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:25,909
room apron and I guess actually that's I

980
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:27,679
really just want that right so I guess

981
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:29,359
what I really want to say is a true

982
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,949
apron is just whatever the half room

983
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:38,500
Delta X is minus that 0.5 right -

984
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:46,039
whatever the the apron value is like so

985
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:48,579
right so when I do this I now want to

986
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:51,889
set the cameras displacement value

987
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:54,739
specifically right so what I want to do

988
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:58,099
is assume I'll start out by assuming

989
00:42:54,739 --> 00:43:03,859
that if nothing else happened right that

990
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:06,889
the world modes camera offset is just

991
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,510
going to be nothing so we'll assume it's

992
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:11,420
nothing and that'll reset it right so

993
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:13,130
now we're in the normal case and I guess

994
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,360
I should work on the Y value for us

995
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,680
because we're gonna go off the top of

996
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:20,930
the screen as the test so let's do this

997
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:22,250
one first so if I want to go off the top

998
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:23,719
of the screen what I want to do is do

999
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,360
something interesting when I get to this

1000
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:30,559
half point here and you'll note it's not

1001
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:32,000
quite right it's we're it seems like

1002
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,860
we're off by one so I feel like this

1003
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,090
really shouldn't should be like 19 or

1004
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,460
something I don't know what the value

1005
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:42,050
should be but it feels like it's wrong

1006
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:45,050
at the moment right it needs to be it

1007
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:47,800
needs to go up by one screens worth and

1008
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:51,940
it doesn't at the moment so I'm not sure

1009
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,940
not sure what the deal is with that

1010
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:09,630
that's much better

1011
00:43:58,728 --> 00:44:11,188
is 12 better 12.5 I'm not sure like I

1012
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,539
said well after we have to go look at

1013
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:16,228
what we're actually creating for room

1014
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:21,359
sizes first all right so let's start it

1015
00:44:16,228 --> 00:44:24,448
out doing it based on Delta's like that

1016
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,759
is probably also not a great idea and so

1017
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:26,938
we should probably fix that too all

1018
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:28,498
right

1019
00:44:26,938 --> 00:44:30,828
at least we're now a little bit cleaner

1020
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:30,828
there

1021
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:43,579
okay so when I am going off the top of

1022
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,949
the screen and I see that I'm past the

1023
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:47,809
apron value what I want to do is I want

1024
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:49,879
to do a clamp map to range remember

1025
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:52,820
we've got our sort of standard way of

1026
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,590
taking getting a t-value from from to

1027
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:58,610
sort of boundary points and a point in

1028
00:44:54,590 --> 00:45:02,090
between so clamp zero I think it's

1029
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:04,700
called like clamp zero one map to range

1030
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:06,410
yeah so I want to do one of those clamp

1031
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:08,869
zero one map to range to get myself a

1032
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:11,779
t-value and I know what my min is my min

1033
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:15,139
is my room apron right my age room apron

1034
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:22,519
and I know what my max is it's my H room

1035
00:45:15,139 --> 00:45:24,500
Delta so all I need now is the actual

1036
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,820
thing to map and obviously that's the

1037
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:30,559
location of the player right because I

1038
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:33,289
know that player is between these two so

1039
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,029
that gives me back a T value and I can

1040
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:36,800
use that T value to control the camera

1041
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:40,040
offset what I'm gonna do is make the

1042
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,830
camera offset so that as it goes it's

1043
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:43,699
gonna go about halfway to where I want

1044
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:45,079
it to change

1045
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,879
and then it'll flip and we'll go the

1046
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,529
other half of the way right so what I'm

1047
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:53,050
gonna do is say okay the camera offset

1048
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:53,050
in this case is going to be equal to

1049
00:45:53,559 --> 00:46:01,519
whatever the whatever the room Delta

1050
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:03,590
would be and I want it to go to half of

1051
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:07,579
that basically so I want to take my T

1052
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:10,070
value and I wanted to make the camera

1053
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:16,130
offset be half of whatever that room

1054
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:20,620
Delta is and we'll see what this does is

1055
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:20,619
we kind of go back to code right

1056
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:32,030
it seems really fast oh you know what I

1057
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:37,309
mean

1058
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:39,710
not I'm using the body right now which

1059
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:45,380
moves it really quickly I think I want

1060
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:49,340
to use the head no hold on a second

1061
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:51,400
I need something slower here so let's do

1062
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:53,300
an ad player

1063
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,099
what are we tracking

1064
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:58,640
yeah it's tracking the body in you

1065
00:46:55,099 --> 00:47:00,139
subtract the head all right that's a

1066
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:01,549
thing that's at world creation time so

1067
00:47:00,139 --> 00:47:07,279
I'm gonna have to restart in order to

1068
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:09,680
make that happen but that's okay okay so

1069
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,200
there you can see right we're doing that

1070
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:14,089
half interpolation right and then when

1071
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:15,889
it gets to the halfway point it snaps

1072
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:18,650
why did it snap well because we haven't

1073
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:20,359
done the corresponding side yet right so

1074
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:23,180
let's go ahead to the sim region and do

1075
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,440
the corresponding side here is the exact

1076
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:25,849
same code and again like we're gonna

1077
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,750
want to generalize this out and do a

1078
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:30,769
bunch more work on it so bear with me

1079
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:32,480
but we're gonna do the exact same thing

1080
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:34,039
here if we're less than the negative

1081
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:39,289
room apron we're gonna do the exact same

1082
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:44,170
mapping from negative 8 room Delta Y to

1083
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:44,170
each room apron Y and you notice I

1084
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:49,359
inverted those right because this is the

1085
00:47:52,409 --> 00:48:01,509
sorry still the same so yes so I have to

1086
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:03,369
make these negative because I'm talking

1087
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:04,778
about the bottom part of the screen now

1088
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:05,829
instead of the top part of the screen so

1089
00:48:04,778 --> 00:48:07,389
I'm talking about the negative apron

1090
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:10,960
right and I'm mapping between the

1091
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:12,368
negative apron and the negative Delta to

1092
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,929
figure out where we are and I'm gonna do

1093
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:16,210
the exact same thing but only this time

1094
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:17,440
I'm talking about moving backwards right

1095
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:20,679
so I'm talking about sliding the camera

1096
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,659
the other direction so now when we pop

1097
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:25,058
the camera over we'll be on the other

1098
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:32,139
side of the apron and we should get the

1099
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:33,278
other part of the scroll right so

1100
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:39,848
hopefully you can kind of see how that's

1101
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:45,130
working right now that's like one of

1102
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:47,140
those things that's one of those things

1103
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,900
that's better to look at I think if we

1104
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:52,179
can slow time down a little bit here so

1105
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,528
what I'd like to do because there's a

1106
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,318
couple things that we think we want to

1107
00:48:53,528 --> 00:48:58,750
wait and that's not what I wanted to do

1108
00:48:55,318 --> 00:49:00,429
where is the simulation there it is I'm

1109
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:03,760
gonna I'm gonna crank the simulation

1110
00:49:00,429 --> 00:49:05,679
time step-down it to really slow so now

1111
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:14,770
we're just moving it molasses speed so

1112
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:17,278
now I'm gonna move down right and now I

1113
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:17,278
move up again

1114
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:34,170
and so what I'm noticing is I'm noticing

1115
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:39,660
a little glitch there right when we

1116
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:46,800
transition between the two I'm not sure

1117
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:50,819
if you guys can see it when we change

1118
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,930
simulation regions there's a little bit

1119
00:49:50,820 --> 00:50:01,769
of a glitch but I don't know what it's

1120
00:49:51,929 --> 00:50:05,789
from so we still have we have some kind

1121
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:11,429
of a bug there with our camera change

1122
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:13,619
over and again this is something that

1123
00:50:11,429 --> 00:50:16,289
we're gonna clean up so that's no big

1124
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:18,750
deal but you know just be aware that

1125
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:21,389
it's there as we as we sort of converge

1126
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:24,210
on this all right mm-hmm

1127
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:27,239
and that could be because - we're not

1128
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:28,800
really again we take we may have not

1129
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:30,239
quite written it correctly so that we're

1130
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,320
not continuous through there's all kinds

1131
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,289
of things we could have done wrong so

1132
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,880
we'll get there so what I want to do now

1133
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:38,099
is I want to just tune this a little bit

1134
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,789
I'm gonna make that room that I think

1135
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:44,190
this was a little bit too too small

1136
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:46,800
right so I'm going to go back here and

1137
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:51,240
I'm gonna make it a little bit bigger

1138
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:54,050
oh whoops that's not at all that's the

1139
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:54,049
wrong value

1140
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,039
so we were talking about 1/2 meters was

1141
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:20,389
a meters worth of play I'm gonna make it

1142
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:22,639
to ya all right so you can see that if

1143
00:51:20,389 --> 00:51:26,659
we allow it to be too you can actually

1144
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:29,239
stand in there right so maybe that's a

1145
00:51:26,659 --> 00:51:33,559
little bit too much I'll I'll drop it

1146
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:35,449
down to like 7 and now you can't stand

1147
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:39,340
now as you transition between the two

1148
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:39,339
right but it feels pretty good to me

1149
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:48,639
except for the glitch right so that's

1150
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,640
getting better

1151
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:07,250
all right so yeah we got to fix that

1152
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:09,530
glitch but other than that we're getting

1153
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:12,199
into better shape here what I also want

1154
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:14,570
to do is I want to add a little bit of

1155
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:18,469
Bounce here so what I want to do is I

1156
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:21,200
want to say let's have a bounce height

1157
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:23,899
or something where we displaced by like

1158
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,969
up to a meter in Z and the reason I want

1159
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,139
to do this is just for fun it's just

1160
00:52:25,969 --> 00:52:29,269
kind of silly but I think it might be

1161
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:30,949
fun so I'm gonna put a bounce height in

1162
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:35,780
here and the bounce height is just gonna

1163
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:37,339
be like squared T so as as we like go to

1164
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:41,570
that middle point we just do a parabolic

1165
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:42,320
arc up to the bat site right if that

1166
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,920
makes sense

1167
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:48,109
is that right so squared T no that would

1168
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,599
be that would be this curve so I needed

1169
00:52:48,108 --> 00:52:53,269
to go the other way right I needed to

1170
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:56,630
actually be square root of T right I

1171
00:52:53,269 --> 00:53:00,079
need it to be I need to be this shape so

1172
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:01,849
that it will it will play effectively

1173
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:11,299
need it to be an inverse parabola so I

1174
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:14,349
suppose what I actually want is well

1175
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,350
let's see what I actually want

1176
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:18,900
let's see what I actually want

1177
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:28,689
so what I want is I want this upside

1178
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:33,889
down right so I pretty much want that

1179
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:38,119
right I want negative T squared and I

1180
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:42,139
want it to be displaced over so that

1181
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:43,940
it's so that it starts at the origin and

1182
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:47,179
goes up to the height of the parabola

1183
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:52,338
and then down right inside the you know

1184
00:53:47,179 --> 00:53:55,598
at though at the one point right so oops

1185
00:53:52,338 --> 00:53:58,250
I didn't mean to undo that there we go

1186
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:03,140
so essentially you know I want it so

1187
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:06,380
that I actually have a displaced T so

1188
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:10,429
that the height is there and I guess

1189
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:14,180
that's negative T I need it to also be

1190
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:19,578
so that it gets back to zero at the

1191
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:20,838
start right so since rather than playing

1192
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:23,298
with the graph I think it's easier to

1193
00:54:20,838 --> 00:54:26,449
just write it out what I want is I want

1194
00:54:23,298 --> 00:54:31,969
an F of T that's equal to a T squared

1195
00:54:26,449 --> 00:54:33,949
plus BT plus C right so nodes I want a I

1196
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:40,009
want a parabolic arc

1197
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:44,750
I want f of 0 to be 0 and I want F of 1

1198
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:47,569
to be 1 right so I should be able to

1199
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:49,639
start out by solving that and then I

1200
00:54:47,568 --> 00:54:52,009
guess I don't have any other information

1201
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:53,480
about it I need one more piece of

1202
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:55,670
information which I guess I want it to

1203
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,829
be curved upwards not downwards probably

1204
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:02,838
enough but we'll see so if I solve this

1205
00:54:57,829 --> 00:55:03,980
out right if f of 0 is 0 well that

1206
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:06,558
doesn't really tell me anything other

1207
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:08,179
than C is 0 right meaning because as I

1208
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,740
as I which is fine I mean I need to

1209
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:14,598
solve for three things but so I plug in

1210
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:16,929
a 0 here I get 0 plus 0 equals C right

1211
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:22,298
and that equals 0 so C is definitely 0

1212
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:22,298
okay so that's simple enough

1213
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:29,889
that's right right yeah and F of 1

1214
00:55:26,768 --> 00:55:33,608
equals 1 which means that when I have T

1215
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:36,989
squared plus T that's got to be equal to

1216
00:55:33,608 --> 00:55:43,088
1 so I have T squared plus T equals 1

1217
00:55:36,989 --> 00:55:46,509
right so yeah so from that I can

1218
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:49,659
determine ooh that's what am I talking

1219
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:52,329
about my brain is fried today for some

1220
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:54,338
reason I have a plus B equals 1

1221
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:56,920
probably prep plug in for the right term

1222
00:55:54,338 --> 00:56:02,920
there right so I know that a plus

1223
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:06,459
vehicle's equal also equals 1 so I could

1224
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,959
just say all right a is 1 minus B or I

1225
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:12,338
guess we went in alphabetical order we

1226
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:18,118
could say B is 1 minus a right so all I

1227
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:18,119
need to know is what my actual value for

1228
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:23,979
what I'm actually gonna plug in for a

1229
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:27,129
and so I don't know if there's anything

1230
00:56:23,978 --> 00:56:28,478
else I want to know about this value I'm

1231
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,068
trying to think of like like I said

1232
00:56:28,478 --> 00:56:33,578
whether it curves up or down would be

1233
00:56:30,068 --> 00:56:38,009
mostly all I would need to know so if I

1234
00:56:33,579 --> 00:56:48,369
have if I write a thing here that's like

1235
00:56:38,009 --> 00:56:50,199
80 squared plus 1 minus a T right I can

1236
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:52,329
take a look at the graph of that for I

1237
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:55,809
can try some different values of a and

1238
00:56:52,329 --> 00:57:01,749
see what they look like so let's see

1239
00:56:55,809 --> 00:57:06,999
here if I say graph a T squared so let's

1240
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:08,588
say 1 T squared plus that would be 1

1241
00:57:06,998 --> 00:57:13,268
minus 1 so that'd be 0 so it would just

1242
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:15,400
literally be a T squared right and then

1243
00:57:13,268 --> 00:57:18,218
I get the shape that I didn't want so if

1244
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,028
instead we plug in like a negative 1 for

1245
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:21,028
that right

1246
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:35,969
let's say I'm just gonna see if that

1247
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:48,269
helps us that would be negative 1

1248
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:55,529
squared which of course is oops key

1249
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:55,530
squared plus negative T

1250
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:13,429
and that also goes the other direction

1251
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:16,039
though does it not what did I do wrong

1252
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:18,429
here cuz this should always give me F of

1253
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:23,119
1 equals 1 right

1254
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:29,139
did I plug that in wrong oh right sorry

1255
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:33,050
it's negative T squared minus T and

1256
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:36,469
there's what I actually wanted of course

1257
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:42,830
that but that does that goes backwards

1258
00:58:36,469 --> 00:58:48,230
there did I plug that in wrong again 1

1259
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:50,029
minus a ah that would be 2t man plugging

1260
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:53,840
in this way is tricky that's what I

1261
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:56,750
wanted so I guess that is the values I

1262
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,858
actually want that's a slow math day

1263
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:00,889
here in case you couldn't tell

1264
00:58:57,858 --> 00:59:04,940
brain is fried this math was actually

1265
00:59:00,889 --> 00:59:06,319
correct but doing this took forever not

1266
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:10,309
sure what the easiest way would have

1267
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:12,950
done oh I know how we would have done

1268
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:14,869
that I guess we could have said what we

1269
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:16,519
wanted the derivative to be here well ok

1270
00:59:14,869 --> 00:59:18,108
anyway point thing we figured it out so

1271
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:24,349
this is the equation we actually want

1272
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:26,500
which is negative T squared plus 2t all

1273
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:33,819
right

1274
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:41,349
so let's just say it's negative T

1275
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:41,350
squared plus 2t times the bounce site

1276
00:59:44,489 --> 01:00:02,099
to give that little parabolic flavor if

1277
00:59:50,800 --> 01:00:02,100
you will there we go lovely

1278
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:11,259
yeah

1279
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,940
okay so now it's again it's a little bit

1280
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:16,360
too fast like I would like it to be

1281
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:23,019
maybe not as fast as that cuz it's a bit

1282
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:25,269
too much I feel like at this point or

1283
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:28,289
maybe it just needs to be more subtle

1284
01:00:25,269 --> 01:00:31,469
you know maybe bounce height should be

1285
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:31,469
something less

1286
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:59,010
all right well that's good enough for

1287
01:00:56,789 --> 01:01:00,059
now but like I said tomorrow I think are

1288
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,500
probably the first thing we should do is

1289
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:02,759
figure out why we're getting a glitch

1290
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,829
there cuz we're definitely getting a

1291
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:08,550
glitch as we go across and we want to

1292
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:10,049
clean up this camera code anyway as we

1293
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,580
go forward so we should probably figure

1294
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,750
out what that is and what cuz we're

1295
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:15,690
definitely getting like a little hitch

1296
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:17,579
again you might not be able to see it

1297
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:20,010
because depending on like your

1298
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:22,769
compression like how the video stream is

1299
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:25,170
coming across you may be getting like

1300
01:01:22,769 --> 01:01:29,190
better or worse ability that you know to

1301
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:31,320
see what's actually happening there but

1302
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:35,250
on the transition we're definitely

1303
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:38,390
getting a bug there it might be because

1304
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:41,219
the camera offset oh you know what it is

1305
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:46,710
it's that the camera offset is not

1306
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:50,639
taking into account the change this

1307
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:53,639
change so probably what we would need to

1308
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:57,299
do is say okay this has to happen

1309
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:58,529
afterwards and since weird right because

1310
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,190
you can you can see what's happening

1311
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:03,480
there right we move the camera and then

1312
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:05,909
we were still using the offset from the

1313
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,380
previous frame so it's way offset then

1314
01:02:05,909 --> 01:02:10,440
it gets solved properly on the next

1315
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:13,019
frame and jumps back so in order to do

1316
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:15,470
that right when we do a mapping here we

1317
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:19,170
would have to update what the entities

1318
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:21,179
position is in order to compute this so

1319
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:26,340
we'd need to basically say like we

1320
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:27,929
compute a new entity P after we update

1321
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:31,019
to figure out what the cameras offset

1322
01:02:27,929 --> 01:02:32,699
should be for the next frame right which

1323
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:35,730
is kind of janky but that's what we're

1324
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:37,500
what we have to do so in order to do

1325
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:40,980
that what we could say is like well

1326
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:43,670
alright if we'd apply this offset then

1327
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:47,369
we know what that is right the enemy P

1328
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:49,559
that we would use is just going to have

1329
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:51,750
that same offset applied right

1330
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:55,159
so whatever the Delta is that we apply

1331
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:55,159
here we've got to save it right

1332
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:29,960
so we'd have to say like okay apply

1333
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:32,840
Delta is whatever this is and what I'm

1334
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:34,820
thinking probably I'm just guessing but

1335
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,200
like I thinking the way we probably will

1336
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:39,950
end up cleaning this up is just by

1337
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:41,449
making the camera an enemy right so that

1338
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:45,589
we don't have to deal with any of this

1339
01:03:41,449 --> 01:03:50,239
stuff anymore for either all right but

1340
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:52,039
let's try that although if the camera

1341
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:53,689
goes by the applied Delta then this

1342
01:03:52,039 --> 01:04:00,009
little piece of that will be subtracted

1343
01:03:53,690 --> 01:04:00,010
away right Hey look the glitch is gone

1344
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:15,510
okay so let's actually go to the Q&amp;A

1345
01:04:59,289 --> 01:05:02,719
keeper Caleb are you concerned about the

1346
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:04,460
player Singh outside the boundaries of

1347
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:07,099
the map or seeing into other rooms in

1348
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:08,869
the camera zooms out no but that's a

1349
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:11,900
game design thing not an implementation

1350
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:13,730
problem right that has nothing to do

1351
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,079
with the implication if you if that's a

1352
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:16,280
game design decision that someone wants

1353
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:18,549
to make at some point they can just turn

1354
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,550
it off

1355
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:27,650
cast a 5 so no more sterling yeah the

1356
01:05:25,099 --> 01:05:29,569
game design requires there to not be

1357
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:32,660
smooth scrolling it has to be room based

1358
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:34,340
so when you go to a room you're in that

1359
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:35,509
room until you're like done with what

1360
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:40,870
you're doing in there and then you can

1361
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:40,870
go to the next one

1362
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:52,969
soy sauce the kid I know the rooms are

1363
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:55,130
going to fit the screen but will there

1364
01:05:52,969 --> 01:05:58,489
be variable sized rooms with the camera

1365
01:05:55,130 --> 01:06:01,280
making it fit to the screen so yeah I

1366
01:05:58,489 --> 01:06:04,429
don't know whether I'll ever want rooms

1367
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:07,970
other than the standard size room but

1368
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:09,829
I'm guessing that that maybe once or

1369
01:06:07,969 --> 01:06:10,819
twice for interest purposes we will

1370
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:15,860
allow that to happen

1371
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:18,740
there's no nothing like there's nothing

1372
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:23,539
in the simulation that requires us to

1373
01:06:18,739 --> 01:06:31,118
have rooms be this size right does this

1374
01:06:23,539 --> 01:06:31,119
stuff work right now - yeah

1375
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:48,539
it's funny to see it so tiny like that

1376
01:06:46,739 --> 01:06:50,798
hmm

1377
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:52,900
when thinking of enemies would you have

1378
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:55,329
classifications for AI level one

1379
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,980
approach constantly zombie what would be

1380
01:06:55,329 --> 01:06:59,920
the main levels you'd say for difficulty

1381
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:05,650
earthling that's game design again which

1382
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:10,829
I don't do and guessed a 5 I am already

1383
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:10,829
39 someone probably needs to update the

1384
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:22,450
the 38 in their popcorn have you seen

1385
01:07:20,048 --> 01:07:26,079
the work glitch from Link's Awakening

1386
01:07:22,449 --> 01:07:28,808
how would you avoid that mmm

1387
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,950
what is the Warped glitch in Link's

1388
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:31,950
Awakening I don't know

1389
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:48,670
does anybody know what that is the work

1390
01:07:44,829 --> 01:07:49,809
glitch or can explain it is it simple

1391
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:53,099
enough to explain there was something

1392
01:07:49,809 --> 01:07:53,099
complicated that I'd have to see

1393
01:08:10,179 --> 01:08:20,329
so this one is about it looks like 24

1394
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:23,119
maybe to 23.5 I should say let us see

1395
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:26,180
what we actually make our gonna need to

1396
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:29,890
actually make sure that we have concepts

1397
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:29,890
of how big rooms are if that makes sense

1398
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:46,269
that's a weird number to guess it 24 I

1399
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:53,469
don't know what was it gonna say here -

1400
01:08:46,269 --> 01:09:00,690
oh right so the can if we want to just

1401
01:08:53,469 --> 01:09:00,689
copy this out where everything's an X

1402
01:09:16,649 --> 01:09:22,629
just to see what looks like while I wait

1403
01:09:20,889 --> 01:09:29,679
for someone to tell me whether they know

1404
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:32,469
what links awakenings glitch is you

1405
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:35,230
press Start when before you enter a room

1406
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:43,109
and the link will end up on the top of

1407
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:45,488
the screen well we don't have that so

1408
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:47,500
I'm guessing the reason they have that

1409
01:09:45,488 --> 01:09:50,318
well I can I can sort of explain why I

1410
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:52,899
suspect they have that bug and we don't

1411
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,400
have the same kind of bug we don't have

1412
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:55,988
the same kind of engine I guess is what

1413
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:57,339
I would say so we probably wouldn't be

1414
01:09:55,988 --> 01:10:06,339
able to have the same kind of bug as

1415
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:09,690
that right doo-doo-doo sorry go just I

1416
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:09,690
got to hop a little bit here

1417
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:29,439
yeah I'm stuck I can't get back at the

1418
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:30,699
world okay there we go um so the reason

1419
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:31,869
that I'm assuming that they have that

1420
01:10:30,698 --> 01:10:33,368
bug and I don't really know anything

1421
01:10:31,868 --> 01:10:37,719
about Link's Awakening but I'm just

1422
01:10:33,368 --> 01:10:39,969
gonna say what I assume so you know we

1423
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:42,880
actually have a coherent sense of world

1424
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:45,639
space in a certain in a certain sense

1425
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,650
meaning that we actually know where you

1426
01:10:45,639 --> 01:10:49,748
are in the world because when we pack

1427
01:10:47,649 --> 01:10:51,670
you into world chunks right you know

1428
01:10:49,748 --> 01:10:55,269
we've got a world that's divided up into

1429
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:56,859
these world chunks and we know you're

1430
01:10:55,269 --> 01:10:58,929
like you know this far from the center

1431
01:10:56,859 --> 01:11:00,728
of this world chunk and then when we

1432
01:10:58,929 --> 01:11:02,859
simulate you we simulate you in a real

1433
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:06,458
Cartesian space there and then we pack

1434
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:08,558
you back in so at no time are we unaware

1435
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:09,998
of where you actually really are in the

1436
01:11:08,559 --> 01:11:12,309
world like we have a very coherent

1437
01:11:09,998 --> 01:11:13,779
definition of that so I don't think we

1438
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:17,139
can have that bug we're gonna have other

1439
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:19,809
bugs but not that one what I assume they

1440
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:23,199
did is they had something like well okay

1441
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:25,538
we've just got a sprite position on the

1442
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:27,098
screen so here's the screen and like

1443
01:11:25,538 --> 01:11:29,288
link is walking towards the top of the

1444
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:30,550
screen and he gets here right so links

1445
01:11:29,288 --> 01:11:32,800
there and they're like we got to trigger

1446
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:35,590
the scroll subroutine so you go out to

1447
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:38,260
like scroll right and now what happens

1448
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:41,349
is the scroll routine makes link

1449
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:42,939
I don't know disappear or who knows how

1450
01:11:41,349 --> 01:11:44,199
they draw him right I don't I have like

1451
01:11:42,939 --> 01:11:47,650
I said haven't seen the game but we

1452
01:11:44,198 --> 01:11:50,379
scroll the background this way right but

1453
01:11:47,649 --> 01:11:52,748
we haven't updated links actual position

1454
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:55,779
values to be anywhere other than here

1455
01:11:52,748 --> 01:11:58,059
and so if we can interrupt the thing

1456
01:11:55,779 --> 01:12:00,630
that tells it to reset its position to

1457
01:11:58,059 --> 01:12:04,570
down here then he'll just be at the top

1458
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:07,150
right but we don't have that happening

1459
01:12:04,569 --> 01:12:09,219
like we're not ever unaware of where you

1460
01:12:07,149 --> 01:12:11,649
actually really were in the world we

1461
01:12:09,219 --> 01:12:13,958
don't have any screen space location for

1462
01:12:11,649 --> 01:12:16,328
you we have a simulation space but we

1463
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:18,368
unpack into it and pack out of it during

1464
01:12:16,328 --> 01:12:20,590
every frame so there's no way for you to

1465
01:12:18,368 --> 01:12:22,679
interrupt that process if that makes

1466
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:22,679
sense

1467
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,619
sergeant Carnival if you want a good

1468
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:16,119
hysteresis example a heater controller

1469
01:13:11,619 --> 01:13:17,590
does the job yeah I guess I mean it's

1470
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:19,929
hard to explain if people don't already

1471
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:21,100
know control theory but like yeah if you

1472
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:24,219
have something where you're like I got a

1473
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:27,070
turn heater on to heat a room or turn it

1474
01:13:24,219 --> 01:13:28,630
off based on a thermostat right you want

1475
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:30,488
to like you don't want to constantly

1476
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:31,900
turn the heater on off on off on off on

1477
01:13:30,488 --> 01:13:34,178
off on off all the time to try and keep

1478
01:13:31,899 --> 01:13:36,009
the temperature right what you want to

1479
01:13:34,179 --> 01:13:37,929
do is heat it up to like a bit above the

1480
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:39,850
temperature let it come down a little

1481
01:13:37,929 --> 01:13:41,230
bit below the temperature and then turn

1482
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:44,020
it back on again right so if you can

1483
01:13:41,229 --> 01:13:46,419
kind of keep it within a band I'm

1484
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:49,590
guessing not that I've ever written a

1485
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,590
thermostat controller but

1486
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:28,018
alright sounds like we are done okay

1487
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:30,419
thank you everyone for joining me for

1488
01:14:28,019 --> 01:14:32,010
another episode of handmade hero it has

1489
01:14:30,418 --> 01:14:34,948
been a pleasure coding with you as

1490
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:37,619
always if you would like to follow along

1491
01:14:34,948 --> 01:14:39,058
at home you can always peer to the game

1492
01:14:37,618 --> 01:14:40,648
on hand made here it organic comes with

1493
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:43,559
the source code so you can follow along

1494
01:14:40,649 --> 01:14:44,849
with what we're coding you can also go

1495
01:14:43,559 --> 01:14:46,559
to the forum site if you want to ask

1496
01:14:44,849 --> 01:14:47,909
questions you can go to our patreon page

1497
01:14:46,559 --> 01:14:49,619
for a support the video series you can

1498
01:14:47,908 --> 01:14:51,029
go to our schedule bot if you want to

1499
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:53,728
know when we're live and you can go to

1500
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:57,538
our episode guide to catch up on past

1501
01:14:53,729 --> 01:14:59,699
episodes and that is really all there is

1502
01:14:57,538 --> 01:15:01,998
to say about that I will be back here

1503
01:14:59,698 --> 01:15:06,238
tomorrow 5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time

1504
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:07,918
when we will do probably a little bit

1505
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:09,598
more camera work but that's mostly all I

1506
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:10,738
really need to do for the camera for now

1507
01:15:09,599 --> 01:15:13,769
we'll probably just get a better sense

1508
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:15,898
of rooms and then I think it's time to

1509
01:15:13,769 --> 01:15:18,239
start thinking about our actual like

1510
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:19,469
physics updating representations and

1511
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:21,029
stuff like that so we're probably gonna

1512
01:15:19,469 --> 01:15:23,969
have to start getting into some multi

1513
01:15:21,029 --> 01:15:27,118
entity you push a block around other

1514
01:15:23,969 --> 01:15:27,989
things like of this nature not really

1515
01:15:27,118 --> 01:15:29,759
push the block around cause you don't

1516
01:15:27,988 --> 01:15:31,198
super do that in this game but you know

1517
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,880
what I mean those sorts of things where

1518
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:34,198
we have some entities interacting with

1519
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,630
each other so that we can clean up that

1520
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:38,038
part of the code that's about it hope

1521
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:41,399
see you guys back here tomorrow until

1522
01:15:38,038 --> 01:15:44,389
then have fun programming and I'll see

1523
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:44,389
you on the Internet take it easy
