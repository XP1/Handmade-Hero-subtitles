00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:04,679
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:07,859
here sure we code a complete game live

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:11,218
on stream we've got some parts to do

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,759
today probably I'll catch you up if you

5
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:19,618
missed yesterday's stream as to what's

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,028
going on here so we have art stuff we

7
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,960
want to put in the game that's what

8
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:27,240
we've been doing and we have a situation

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,010
where we've finished importing all of

10
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,768
our art assets and doing that sort of

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,050
thing but we now have like some assembly

12
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:36,570
that we need to do in order to like put

13
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:38,699
our stuff together right and you can

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,759
kind of see here I'm a ridiculously huge

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,960
cat now for no apparent reason but if

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,219
you take a look at like when we place

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,870
things in the world like everything's

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,340
all discombobulated like the heads and

19
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,140
the bodies they all just show up

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,989
centered around whatever the placement

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,759
point is we have no coherent way of like

22
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:55,619
placing these things so that the heads

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,589
go on top of bodies and stuff like that

24
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,030
and that expands more generally to other

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,979
types of things you might want to do for

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:07,049
example if you want to have heads that

27
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:09,450
go on top of bodies and then hats that

28
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,070
go on top of heads and so on you kind of

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,650
have this idea that there are points

30
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,629
inside these objects inside these

31
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,930
bitmaps that you know kinda have to snap

32
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:21,569
together and we need to have ways of

33
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,020
like selecting that sort of information

34
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:27,000
and you know basically preparing

35
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:30,509
something useful to happen there you

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,810
know we we just need something to we

37
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,060
need some way to make that work and so

38
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,299
what we're trying to do now is get that

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,509
going and what we did is we augmented

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,280
our ability to store this data I

41
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,899
remember you have an HSA file format

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,170
that stores game native for us we go in

43
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:56,968
here in our native directory we have

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:59,340
this concept of HHA files and we

45
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:02,669
augmented them yesterday to include a

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,579
bunch of information that could be used

47
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,799
to create exactly the thing in question

48
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:10,709
here right exactly is the ability to

49
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,170
snap things together using points and we

50
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,000
made it so that it you know

51
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:16,068
could import old ones and work the way

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,289
it used to as well but also support this

53
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:20,329
new stuff and so we have this this new

54
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:22,219
idea of alignment points and each asset

55
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,469
can have a set of alignment points in it

56
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:26,780
so in addition to tagging it with like

57
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:29,359
why you might want to use this resource

58
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,159
in a gameplay sense we also now have

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,900
alignment that says if you're using this

60
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,049
resource with other resources how might

61
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,840
it snap together and so we have two

62
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,630
things we need to be able to do now

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,039
and one of those things has two parts so

64
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,799
you might say we have three things we

65
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,739
have to write number one is we have to

66
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,959
actually use these things like supplying

67
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,759
the placement points doesn't really help

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,009
if we don't have any code that actually

69
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:58,129
then tries to snap things together using

70
00:02:55,009 --> 00:03:00,139
those points so that's the thing we got

71
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:03,079
to do and then another thing we have to

72
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:05,779
do is get the data in there so we have

73
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,370
to have a way of of actually putting in

74
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,349
the information about where we want

75
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,789
these things you know where does the

76
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:13,789
head snap onto the body and stuff like

77
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:16,849
that so that's the part that has two

78
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:19,219
parts to it one is we need a way of

79
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:21,049
storing that stuff in some kind of form

80
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:22,519
that we can consider authoritative and

81
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,959
permanent which means probably not the

82
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,579
HHA files because that's supposed to be

83
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,500
a runtime format that we can delete and

84
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:29,109
rebuild if you want to change how the

85
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,639
runtime format works or stuff like that

86
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:33,320
so we probably don't want to rely on it

87
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,608
being stored permanently in there it's

88
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,078
actual work that we're doing we're

89
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:37,250
actually spending time to like place

90
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,829
these points you want to preserve that

91
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,049
work so you have to redo it every time

92
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:44,180
we want to rebuild Rho J's or something

93
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,650
so we need some way of storing that

94
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,930
perfectly I was suggesting just a simple

95
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,189
text file that corresponds to the PNG so

96
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,709
it's just you know again the simplest

97
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:52,759
possible thing nothing too complicated

98
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,340
so we would need some way of parsing

99
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,078
those text files and then taking that

100
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,120
information and placing it into the HHA

101
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,040
when we actually do our importing so

102
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,230
that's you know one thing the other

103
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,209
thing that we want to do is have a way

104
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:06,768
of seeing those results and editing them

105
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,389
in real time because what we'd like to

106
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,420
be able to do is make it really really

107
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:13,609
easy to set all of those parameters to

108
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,949
exactly what we want so you know one way

109
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,780
we could do it is just constantly tweak

110
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:19,370
the text file and then see what the

111
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:22,819
results were and tweak the text file

112
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,228
until it's right and that's the simplest

113
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:25,759
solution in terms of programming because

114
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:26,139
it doesn't require anything other than

115
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,918
the

116
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:32,800
just the text import and that's it but

117
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,839
if we really wanted to make it easy for

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,180
us to do large batches of these assets

119
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,209
without too much fuss then I think we

120
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,009
want something a little bit more

121
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:43,688
complete we would like some way of

122
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,729
having those text files be like

123
00:04:43,689 --> 00:05:00,629
graphically editable right like we would

124
00:04:45,728 --> 00:05:05,198
like some way we would like some way of

125
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:07,778
taking the like making a user interface

126
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,150
inside the game we can just at any time

127
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:12,069
say oh those two things mean like need

128
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:13,538
to line up like this and then that

129
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:16,870
information just gets saved back into

130
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:19,658
the text file for us right and that's

131
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,959
just a way of simplifying that process

132
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:24,699
so that it's not you know a big deal to

133
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,620
adjust it and doesn't take a bunch of

134
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:30,009
time and wasted energy

135
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,139
having that import work right so that's

136
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:33,639
all we're trying to do here it's really

137
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:35,710
pretty simple you know that right

138
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,418
there's not much to it but it's just

139
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,859
there's a bunch of grunt work involved

140
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:40,269
so we kind of got to go do that grunt

141
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,658
work if we want this thing to work out

142
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:49,088
okay so that's all we're talking about

143
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:51,639
that's what I want to do now and so we

144
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:53,649
just got to get started now like I said

145
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:58,210
where we're at here we kind of have to

146
00:05:53,649 --> 00:06:00,879
imagine getting this stuff to work right

147
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:03,278
so I don't know where where the best

148
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,490
place to start is you know one way might

149
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:08,620
be to say let's go ahead and try to try

150
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,129
to make the Edit part well just start

151
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,838
with that

152
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:12,490
right so we'll start by trying to make

153
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:15,370
the thing that allows us to you know

154
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,288
edit those placement points and then

155
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,658
we'll go from there so you know if we

156
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:23,620
wanted to edit that sprite we saw you

157
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:26,050
know we see that it's wrong and we need

158
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,639
to be able to mark it up so we need to

159
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,930
be able to take this one and make a

160
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,129
placement point on it and we need to be

161
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,930
able to take this one and make a

162
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:34,269
placement point on it and then have

163
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,269
those things snap together in some kind

164
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:38,680
of a satisfying way that would be what

165
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,519
we're trying to that that's the goal

166
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,300
we're trying to comp

167
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:47,409
sure you know I'm saying uh so let's

168
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,900
think about how we would do this when we

169
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:55,150
actually have stuff that's incorrect on

170
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:58,388
on on the screen how are we going to fix

171
00:06:55,149 --> 00:07:01,269
it right and one of the things that we

172
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,560
have here is if we were to pick one if

173
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:04,779
you know if we were to have some kind of

174
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,740
an editing mode we could go into where

175
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:10,239
we can pick these things here we would

176
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,978
then have to you know maybe show

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,250
something I don't know like using the

178
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:17,879
debug you are using something we would

179
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,288
have to have some way that we could show

180
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,889
what's going on with with one of these

181
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:26,709
entities and allow us to add or adjust

182
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,030
points in the entities you know what I

183
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:29,799
mean

184
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:34,209
and so that's kind of what we would want

185
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,098
to do here now this is a little bit

186
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:39,848
interesting because in some senses this

187
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:41,348
isn't really a debug UI it's hard to say

188
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,848
like one of the things I think we

189
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:46,478
probably didn't do very good on handmade

190
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:49,000
hero is respect the fact that the debug

191
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,769
UI maybe isn't really a debug UI or at

192
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,269
least a lot of the things that would be

193
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,889
going on View mode UI maybe shouldn't be

194
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:55,658
debug UI like maybe they should actually

195
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,908
just be systems that are part of the

196
00:07:55,658 --> 00:08:00,519
main game and the reason that I say that

197
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:03,490
is because since a meteor is a teaching

198
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,620
tool it means that probably you want to

199
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,718
just let people play with the internals

200
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:12,340
even in the shipping version of the game

201
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:13,629
you don't want to do the same kind of

202
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:15,758
architecture you do in a normal game

203
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:16,959
where you try to actively remove all

204
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,479
that stuff when you ship it like you

205
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,000
don't want any of those things to be in

206
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,528
the game you want those things to be

207
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,709
compiled out completely and not ship at

208
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:28,509
all and so we kind of have a little bit

209
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,098
of a potential mistake there just in

210
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,050
terms of philosophical mistake in terms

211
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:35,288
of any philosophical is probably the

212
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:39,668
wrong term but maybe I'll say a mistake

213
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:41,918
regarding what the goal is of any

214
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:43,328
particular system and so we may want to

215
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,069
think a little bit more critically about

216
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:46,870
that and start to move it away from that

217
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,730
a little bit more and so when we're

218
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,110
talking about this you know maybe we

219
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,570
want this to be something that you can

220
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,500
just do in the game you know like if you

221
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,710
decide to

222
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:01,450
go into a debug mode in the actual game

223
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,769
proper then you maybe can just do you

224
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,600
know you can just get that this stuff

225
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,699
all the time so it's not something that

226
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,250
would be removed from the game in the

227
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,320
shipping version like we normally would

228
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,419
if we were making a game that was not

229
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,010
that did not have a teaching component

230
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:20,860
to it if that makes sense so we can keep

231
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:23,289
that in mind so if we go in here to the

232
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,769
enemy system for example you know we've

233
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:28,419
got a notion that we may want to you can

234
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,879
see here we've got like debug pick

235
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:33,579
entity right and we've got some stuff

236
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,899
about that and you know maybe what we

237
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,850
want to do I guess what I'm saying is

238
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:40,529
maybe we want to make this picking

239
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,460
procedure be a little bit more

240
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:44,289
integrated into the game so that you

241
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,540
just have a way of going into a debug

242
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:48,159
mode and if you go into the debug mode

243
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:49,659
then you can start clicking on things

244
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,870
you know that's just how it works or

245
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:54,490
whatever right it's just a thought so if

246
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,320
I want to do something like that what I

247
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,409
could do is when we're doing our picking

248
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,150
here right what I could do is have a

249
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:03,519
thing that checks to see what mode were

250
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:04,329
in in the game right you know let's

251
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,610
check something

252
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,750
what kind of mode am I in am I in a mode

253
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,419
where I actually be able to edit

254
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,539
something and then if I are if I if I

255
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:15,639
are wow that's good if I am then I would

256
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:17,588
like to do some picking perhaps maybe on

257
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,569
these like piece and indexes or whatever

258
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:21,940
here right and one of the things that we

259
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:28,120
know is you know we've already written

260
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:30,330
code in to do box intersection so we

261
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,419
kind of have ways already of picking

262
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:40,660
things in the world using Ray's because

263
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:42,969
we already have a notion of we already

264
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:46,088
have multiple notions we have things

265
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:48,100
that can intersect raisin boxes so for

266
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:51,070
example in our lighting code we already

267
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,950
wrote things that do this so if you look

268
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,720
at for example where we do our ray

269
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,660
casting you know we already wrote a

270
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,269
bunch of code that does testing of Ray's

271
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:04,389
versus boxes and in fact we have an

272
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:07,120
optimized one even the tests a bunch of

273
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:11,620
rays and boxes at the same time

274
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:15,000
stuff like that right so we have the

275
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,860
notion in the box intersection we also

276
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,399
have the understanding of how to

277
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,980
unprotect points so if we go into the

278
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:28,600
render itself there's actually an

279
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:30,850
unprotected here and what you can see is

280
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,320
what do you call this you can actually

281
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:39,450
get you know if you say here is what

282
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:43,750
clip space is you know here's what

283
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:46,900
here's where my point is on the screen

284
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,360
and then you can say if I was this far

285
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,120
away from the camera where would I be

286
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,089
like where you know in in the worlds

287
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,909
would I be right uh so we actually have

288
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,740
multiple ways of doing this and it seems

289
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:01,659
like at this point we could even just we

290
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,110
don't really even need box intersection

291
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:06,759
because if we have the ability to do a

292
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,009
3d reverse projection at a particular

293
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,480
distance we could just say look where is

294
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:13,480
this entity piece that we're talking

295
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,389
about let's go ahead and just do a

296
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,800
projection back to that Z depth and then

297
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:19,480
we'll look to see if we're inside a

298
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,208
rectangle that's roughly the size of the

299
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,370
sprite right because again this isn't

300
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,439
part of game play so it doesn't need to

301
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,970
be exact we just need an easy way of

302
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,270
looking at something on the screen and

303
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:33,430
selecting it right because that way we

304
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:35,350
don't have to go looking through some

305
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:37,269
we're not to make like a lister that

306
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,860
lists all those sprites and you know we

307
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:40,929
pick them and whatever we can just when

308
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,580
we see something that's off wrong we can

309
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:44,349
just fix it right there you know it's

310
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:49,450
pretty nice and handy in that sense

311
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:51,430
right so let's just do that you know

312
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,920
let's just see what happens if we just

313
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:55,208
did that right so we have a render group

314
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,028
that we know that we're drawing these

315
00:12:55,208 --> 00:13:00,399
things in and we know that we have these

316
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:03,100
piece indexes and all this stuff right

317
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,309
and we know we can so we can know we can

318
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,899
do a crappy like hit test without too

319
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,399
much trouble if we want to and I'll just

320
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,990
turn this on by default we're worried

321
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,750
about where them worry about where the

322
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,860
mode switch is later so then in here you

323
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,320
know when we're actually looking at this

324
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,879
stuff I'll just pretend that

325
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,570
everything's a cube for now and we'll

326
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,939
just take a look at what that cube

327
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,790
information is and we'll just say like

328
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,760
alright so you know here's where the

329
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:32,750
thing would be right and here's how big

330
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:35,389
the thing would be and so if we have

331
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:40,610
that information we know the the world P

332
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:42,409
of the piece we know the world dim of

333
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,610
the piece that's not exactly right

334
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:44,839
because we interpret it somewhat

335
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,820
differently but we can start

336
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,700
regularizing that stuff a little bit

337
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,500
more or make this code more exact by

338
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,530
checking what kind were working with who

339
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,179
knows right um but what we could do

340
00:13:54,529 --> 00:14:00,370
first you just say all right so let's

341
00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:03,769
just actually with me do it this way

342
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:06,529
let's just first say okay you know if we

343
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:09,949
were going to actually put one of these

344
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:12,220
things in here and we wanted for every

345
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:19,580
sprite to just draw a little rectangle

346
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:22,310
what would it look like so I'm just

347
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,310
gonna start by first of all pushing a

348
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:27,229
rectangle on there to make sure we've

349
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:29,689
got some representation of the pieces at

350
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:33,289
all that's all I want to do is just get

351
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:35,480
that right to begin with right and so

352
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,750
here I'm gonna take a look at at where

353
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,009
those things are you know what I mean

354
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,750
and just try to figure out what's going

355
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:49,879
on so what you can see here is we've got

356
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:53,149
some weird that's kind of cool

357
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,889
we've got some weird placements of those

358
00:14:53,149 --> 00:15:00,370
rectangles I'm not sure what exactly

359
00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:07,029
that's doing this is the inner transform

360
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:07,029
offset P plus the piece offset right

361
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:23,939
not sure exactly you go to the render

362
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:37,709
here I'll be honest I don't really

363
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:45,510
remember what push rekt even does oh all

364
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:47,939
right so here's Abba transform offset

365
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:49,350
and dimension right so I'm passing the

366
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,790
dimension I want to draw here I'm

367
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:56,519
passing the world peak here so it does a

368
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:58,319
bunch of nonsense yes so I don't really

369
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,110
want to be using this I want to use

370
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,820
something that's more specific right so

371
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:07,889
I probably want to do not sure what you

372
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,899
know maybe this is a little bit better

373
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:14,549
so here it does push rect outline is

374
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,470
really probably what I wanted cuz the

375
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:19,169
other one's a little bit nuts right it's

376
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,940
it's doing totally different stuff in

377
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:24,809
terms of how it's gonna interpret the

378
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,130
interpret the rectangle let me see if

379
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:28,129
this is a little bit better first yeah

380
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:37,020
so that makes a little more sense there

381
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:44,359
but only a little and it kind of looks

382
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:46,740
like it looks like it's scaled out wrong

383
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,970
like everything is bigger than it should

384
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,970
be right

385
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:05,759
because if I was to push a cube I should

386
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,078
get exactly the same locations as I was

387
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,078
getting with everything else right

388
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:28,850
and again I just want to make sure that

389
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:43,400
I get this stuff correct I don't really

390
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:50,929
want a bitmap ID in there all right um

391
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:53,030
so I want to just be able to draw

392
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,600
something that's a non that doesn't

393
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:58,509
really have I want to be able to draw

394
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:02,000
something that doesn't really have any

395
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:03,799
weirdness to it on the you know on the

396
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,890
cube front here I guess the other

397
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:13,069
problem so I guess the other problems in

398
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,870
any transform automatically has that

399
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:18,139
baked into it so that's probably

400
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:20,329
actually what I was seeing there so that

401
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:25,850
makes some sense so probably this is

402
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:28,159
actually what what I was seeing right I

403
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:29,779
was applying the entity transform twice

404
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,300
because it's already gonna get applied

405
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:34,039
automatically by that routine yeah there

406
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:38,930
we go so that that was just me being

407
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:40,670
stupid so if I go look at where those

408
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,340
are they're kind of embedded in objects

409
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:46,789
most of the time as you can see and

410
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:48,829
that's exactly what we would expect to

411
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,259
see happen there to the largest and I

412
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:58,939
want to see if I can get the world dim

413
00:18:51,259 --> 00:19:00,879
stuff a little bit better just see if I

414
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,870
can approximate the size of these things

415
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,290
but now we're kind of in better shape

416
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,289
here

417
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,069
kind of need a wireframe render mood I

418
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:18,670
also I need better luck debug camera

419
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:20,650
tools I need a lot of things so looking

420
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,539
at that it looks like it's got the why

421
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,670
and not the X which makes perfect sense

422
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:29,619
because the way that we did things in

423
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:32,529
the in the bitmap rendering is you just

424
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:35,979
kind of pass down a dimension in Y and

425
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:37,960
it blows the X out for you right so when

426
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,789
we're actually doing this in a sense you

427
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,410
know that that part is actually being

428
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:43,450
taken care of inside the thing that

429
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:47,410
looks up what the bitmap itself actually

430
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,880
would be and so you know for us it's a

431
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,890
little bit trickier because we don't

432
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,790
really know what it should be at this

433
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:57,130
point so you know hard to say how we

434
00:19:54,789 --> 00:20:00,339
want to handle that going forward but

435
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:02,290
you know for the moment if we did this

436
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:03,548
we wouldn't be too far off we'd be a

437
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:04,720
little bit far off in certain

438
00:20:03,548 --> 00:20:06,609
circumstances depending on the

439
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,140
eccentricity of the thing involved but

440
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:13,629
you know it's not the worst

441
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,370
approximation at the moment so again

442
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,760
there's the cat right and now you can

443
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:22,058
see that those rectangles would be

444
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:23,289
pickable and so we should now be able to

445
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:28,619
write something that just kind of

446
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:28,619
selects very easily can select something

447
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:33,609
so that we you know can can highlight

448
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:40,298
things by just looking at where they are

449
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:41,798
and maybe get a little bit of just get a

450
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:45,069
little bit cleaner in terms of like how

451
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:48,548
we're how we're gonna pick objects to

452
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:51,250
edit in a particular time so let me go

453
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:53,579
ahead and allow that to happen so if I

454
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,169
come in here and I want to do a pick

455
00:20:53,579 --> 00:21:00,009
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna

456
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:03,270
first check to see a what it would look

457
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:05,950
like if I just highlight things that are

458
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:07,950
under the mouse cursor so we can see

459
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:12,569
whether or not we can pick them properly

460
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,569
and if I do a none project here

461
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:24,170
like so I should be able to get back a

462
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:25,730
cursor in worlds kind of a thing so I

463
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:28,850
should be able to take like wherever the

464
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,200
mouse is and I should be able to do that

465
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:33,889
transfer and to figure out what's going

466
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,750
on yeah I mean and so in order to get

467
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,580
the render group transform we know this

468
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:41,660
just whatever the current transform is

469
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:43,970
right but I don't want the games

470
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,580
transfer I want the debug transform

471
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,940
because if I'm in debug camera mode I

472
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:52,639
want to be a pic from there so I'm going

473
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,049
to past the debug transform as the

474
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,540
default one because we always want to

475
00:21:54,049 --> 00:22:01,279
use that rather than the game one in the

476
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:03,440
case where the game is in debug mode so

477
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,029
the clip space XY we need to know where

478
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,340
the mouse cursor is we'll do that in a

479
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:11,839
second world distance from camera Z we

480
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:15,139
know what that is because we know we

481
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:17,779
know how far this world point is from

482
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:22,850
the camera if we want to because we can

483
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:28,519
just figure out where the we can just

484
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:31,490
use the Delta between the camera and the

485
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,210
sprites location and we can just measure

486
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:40,549
that along the cameras z-axis right so

487
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:43,910
it's not that hard to get that right in

488
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:46,220
fact it's pretty easy so our big problem

489
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,320
is getting the clip space XY and to do

490
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,880
that right what we'd have to do is we

491
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,009
have to be able to look up where the

492
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,550
mouse actually is now fortunately we

493
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:58,069
know where the mouse probably is because

494
00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:00,109
we can feed that information forwards

495
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:02,869
now the problem that we're gonna have of

496
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:04,699
course is that that doesn't come into

497
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:06,079
the update and render entities that's

498
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,319
okay cuz I don't know that we

499
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:12,649
necessarily even need to be in here you

500
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:14,179
know we may want this to be you know the

501
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,509
cut we may want this to be something

502
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,730
that happens outside of there anyway and

503
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:21,529
that happens in world mode or in some

504
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,960
kind of code that's like you know the

505
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:26,059
picking part of world mode so in here

506
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,909
where we do update and render world you

507
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,940
know we know that we

508
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:32,369
you have the camera inside the mouse

509
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:37,109
because we know that information from

510
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:38,608
the mouse pee that we generate right so

511
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:40,739
we use the user input here to get that

512
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:42,749
so we should be able to pick entities

513
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:46,229
with that as well so for example in here

514
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:52,679
where we do render entities which

515
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:57,558
happens inside I think should be like

516
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,559
right here I think it happens inside

517
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:09,229
does it happen inside simulate it must

518
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,228
which is weird

519
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,720
you can see it happening here inside

520
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:17,720
simulate

521
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:28,710
I wonder why it happens inside Soumya

522
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,450
light I guess because the sim region you

523
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:40,409
know you can't render once you've closed

524
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:44,179
the sim region but it still seems like

525
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:44,179
you could have just put that out here I

526
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,898
mean the fact that it's update and

527
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,909
render entities I guess is probably the

528
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:55,288
reason right so you know inside simulate

529
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:57,539
you're gonna do both at once so I

530
00:24:55,288 --> 00:24:58,859
suppose that does make some sense so

531
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:01,950
anyway we have a couple choices here you

532
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:05,069
know one of them is we could just do the

533
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,630
the testing in line and the other is not

534
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:08,700
since we're rendering in line

535
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,110
I guess testing in line is fine too but

536
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:14,759
what we need to do is we need to pass

537
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:16,459
the mouse information down because if we

538
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:20,250
don't there's no way we can pick it

539
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,620
right so inside simulate here when we're

540
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,778
going to do up it and render em entities

541
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:28,138
we need to pass some input information

542
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:33,569
down to it which we can do this like

543
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:35,369
this and we can say you know only do

544
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:36,778
this if we actually got the input you

545
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:37,648
know only do this if someone extra so

546
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:38,940
that way they don't actually have to

547
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:45,058
pass it to us if they don't want to

548
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:46,320
which seems good right and so then all

549
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:50,220
we need to do is actually think about

550
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:54,298
how we're going to actually create that

551
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:57,750
and we have in debug mode we already

552
00:25:54,298 --> 00:26:00,480
have sort of a notion that we're going

553
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,220
to have to map these things and do a nun

554
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,519
project in fact there's a nun project

555
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,519
here right and so inside the IMP the

556
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:11,099
input we have a clip space mouse key

557
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:13,169
which is this thing and so in theory if

558
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:16,469
we just actually asked for this we

559
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:18,659
should get back what we expect for the

560
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:21,058
clip space Mouse that should already be

561
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:22,528
correct and so then what we need to do

562
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:24,928
is just figure out what the world

563
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:26,220
distance is going to be now to figure

564
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:28,048
out what the world distance is what we

565
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,200
want to do is measure how far along the

566
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:33,119
cameras the access you would have to go

567
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,470
in order to get to the place that we're

568
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,319
going right now

569
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,829
we

570
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:40,210
that the world position of the entity we

571
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:44,949
know that the world position of the

572
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:47,049
camera which we actually have because if

573
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,549
you look at inside the renderer you know

574
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:51,839
we were careful to save this kind of

575
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:56,559
information so if you take a look at the

576
00:26:51,839 --> 00:27:00,309
like for example the render transform

577
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,829
debug X X form you can see here that it

578
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:06,819
has the position from which you are

579
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:11,799
rendering baked into it right and the

580
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:14,049
projection matrix there so I assume and

581
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:18,789
you know I guess now I think about it I

582
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:22,240
don't remember exactly how the render

583
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:26,019
transform stuff is encoded so I have to

584
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,170
think about that but it can't be entity

585
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:31,180
based it has to be camera based I think

586
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:32,440
in fact because you know you don't have

587
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,560
any entity information when you're doing

588
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,750
this here so the the debug transform is

589
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:41,289
going to be the cameras position in

590
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:43,319
there and the cameras z-axis in here

591
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:46,569
right

592
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:48,429
that's my contention anyway so and I'll

593
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:55,509
verify that let me just go ahead and do

594
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:57,039
that so in here we say camera X Y Z P so

595
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:58,809
let's see what we do with the camera P

596
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,740
there it is right so we just set those

597
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:05,529
directly so what we have is inside this

598
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,740
the debug X forum and I can you know do

599
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:07,740
this

600
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:24,398
and that way we actually have one of

601
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:31,898
those that we can coherently access so

602
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:33,908
if I want to do the you know from camera

603
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:35,469
vector basically so if I want to

604
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:40,419
construct a vector that just goes from

605
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:44,108
the camera point which is this and I

606
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:47,619
want it to go to the you know I want to

607
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:50,259
go from the camera to the element that

608
00:28:47,618 --> 00:28:53,108
I'm testing this would give me that

609
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:55,679
vector now I don't actually want that

610
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:59,618
vector now talk about why in a second

611
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:02,609
but if we want to get world distance

612
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:02,608
from camera oops

613
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:08,169
to plug into this function then you have

614
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:10,329
to ask yourself well okay if I have a

615
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:12,940
vector that goes from the camera to the

616
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:15,970
entity I want to be able to take an

617
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:20,440
inner product right to measure along the

618
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:23,019
cameras z-axis I want to be able to

619
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,359
measure how long that vector is along

620
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:27,489
the z axis because that's exactly what

621
00:29:25,358 --> 00:29:30,278
that will be right so I take the camera

622
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:32,108
z-axis and I measure and I say using

623
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:34,419
that as the measurement if I take the

624
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:36,728
vector from where the camera is to where

625
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:39,700
the entity is how long is it that gives

626
00:29:36,729 --> 00:29:41,558
me the distance in Z the problem with

627
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,859
this is it's going going to go the wrong

628
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:45,038
way

629
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:48,788
the z axis actually points backwards it

630
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:51,460
points like towards the viewer right so

631
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:54,009
the z axis points backwards towards the

632
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,808
viewer the from cameras gonna point

633
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:57,729
forward when I do the inter plug it's

634
00:29:55,808 --> 00:29:59,979
gonna be negative for things that are in

635
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:03,009
front of the camera so what I really

636
00:29:59,979 --> 00:30:05,979
want is the opposite right I want a to

637
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:08,470
camera vector so I want to say from the

638
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:10,359
entity to the camera that goes the same

639
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,700
direction as the Z so then I'm actually

640
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:14,019
measuring without having to do an

641
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,798
additional negation there to get the

642
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:19,479
right answer right so that gives me now

643
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:21,339
the ability to take the cursor in the

644
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:24,159
world so now I have where the cursor is

645
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:25,569
in the world and I have where the thing

646
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,940
is in the world right I have both of

647
00:30:25,569 --> 00:30:30,249
those two things so now what I can do is

648
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:35,320
say if I want to I can actually figure

649
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:37,028
out where in this in that plane I can

650
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:41,048
figure out where the mouse cursor is in

651
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:44,348
the plane of the entity right so I can

652
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:47,679
basically say like you know entity Mouse

653
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:50,230
here or something right and the entity

654
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:55,739
Mouse PD is equally simple all I have to

655
00:30:50,230 --> 00:31:00,269
do is say look I know that I've got I

656
00:30:55,739 --> 00:31:05,019
know that I've got a point in the world

657
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:07,899
where the entity is and I know that I've

658
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:10,858
got where the cursor is in the world in

659
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:15,008
that same Z plane you know what I mean

660
00:31:10,858 --> 00:31:18,069
so if I take a entity to cursor vector

661
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:24,038
and I basically say I have where the

662
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:26,829
entity is I so I know the world P and I

663
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:29,019
just subtract that from where the cursor

664
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:32,230
is I get a vector that goes from the

665
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:34,450
entity to the cursor and then I can just

666
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:38,319
dot part that with the X and Y axis of

667
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:43,538
the camera and I'm done right so if I

668
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:50,858
say X form X first sorry entity to

669
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:53,648
cursor X form Y entity to cursor then I

670
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:55,658
now have a location in space relative to

671
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:58,058
the entity and I can now test to see

672
00:31:55,659 --> 00:32:00,700
whether it falls inside the dimension

673
00:31:58,058 --> 00:32:06,398
that I've specified so if the entity

674
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:11,669
mouse piece of that that measurement

675
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:16,709
there right if the entity Mouse P X is

676
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:16,710
less than the world MX

677
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,130
and the absolute value y is less than

678
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:27,390
the world didn't like then I just know

679
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:28,770
that I'm inside the rectangle right and

680
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,690
if not then I'm outside the rectangle

681
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:32,910
and that's the end of it so it's

682
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,230
basically just a 2d hit test you know

683
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,269
what I mean

684
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:41,460
and so now we just have to debug it

685
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:43,168
right and and and then we're good to go

686
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,779
so the first thing I want to do so we're

687
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:49,140
not awful like you can see it sort of

688
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:50,250
works but it's not quite right you can

689
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,929
see we're kind of a little bit off it

690
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:57,900
looks like our Y is messed up for some

691
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:59,780
reason there why is our Y messed up I do

692
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:05,400
something strange with our Y

693
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:16,109
probably not but we'll see in a second I

694
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:21,390
would like to draw this line as well we

695
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:23,129
have a push line segment call right um

696
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,630
so anyway that's the fundamental

697
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,400
construction it's kind of just like

698
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,870
hacky I'm just like let's just test this

699
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,309
somehow and that seems like a reasonable

700
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:30,989
enough for your test so I'm just going

701
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:32,970
to bug that and we'll use that as our

702
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:35,480
way of simple picking you know just like

703
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:39,409
basic picking of the entities there um

704
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:47,690
so here's the render group here's a

705
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:51,210
texture for the line segment okay I

706
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:55,220
guess that's fine I don't remember how

707
00:33:51,210 --> 00:34:02,788
to specify a texture that's just pure

708
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:07,079
white there there you go so I want to go

709
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:16,889
from the camera I'm sorry from the

710
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:18,779
entity position oh this again so yeah

711
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,250
this is gonna be annoying so the fact

712
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,869
that we're using this sort of offset

713
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,480
transform thing is a little annoying

714
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:29,190
because you can see I did it again I had

715
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,559
exactly the same bug this world P here

716
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,030
you know it really wants to take into

717
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:35,460
account

718
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:38,310
when we're doing that what the transform

719
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:41,159
what the entity offset would be I don't

720
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:44,789
I really don't like that transform stuff

721
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,800
it just it leads to all these bugs like

722
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:48,210
that and you know I don't know I kind of

723
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,500
feel like we shouldn't do it it should

724
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:54,168
just the renderer should just work in

725
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:56,398
world space here I think would be better

726
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:58,289
we'll have to see what we think of that

727
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,509
but I feel like that's just it's just

728
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:02,099
dumb and so I feel like we should

729
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:06,300
probably get rid of that because I hate

730
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:08,789
having bugs like that I want this stuff

731
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,320
to just always be in world space so you

732
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:12,329
know because of this the under transform

733
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,090
thing here we want to do just the piece

734
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:18,210
offset because it's gonna add that thing

735
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:19,650
in so you know it looks like that but

736
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:23,369
then here where we do the push line

737
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,869
segment right I mean let me pause this

738
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:26,430
cuz I'm like let me see if that just

739
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:29,670
works that might actually have been the

740
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:31,169
only problem because obviously that's

741
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:35,639
just gonna be offset everything's gonna

742
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:38,900
be offset incorrectly so we'll see so it

743
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:38,900
looks like our Y is wrong there

744
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:48,010
but it's pretty close right you can kind

745
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:52,929
of see that like we're it's just a Y the

746
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:56,820
Y is a little bit wrong I'm not 100%

747
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:56,819
sure why pun intended

748
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:07,210
it's like both are a little big I guess

749
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:09,640
one thing I don't know is does this

750
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:13,809
entity transform stuff have a scale in

751
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:19,139
it I assume it doesn't yeah it doesn't

752
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:19,139
look like it does and so yeah

753
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:44,400
looks roughly correct so here's a couple

754
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,480
things I would say also I just want do

755
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:52,500
this before I forget if the world

756
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,429
distance from camera Z so if that's like

757
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,500
less than the near clip plane basically

758
00:36:55,429 --> 00:37:06,239
which I don't know if we really

759
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:08,010
articulate here anywhere not really

760
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:11,519
so what I'll basically say is if it's

761
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:15,000
less than like some some close value

762
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:17,699
there whatever we're not gonna look at

763
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,980
it right so you know when we when we

764
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:21,779
actually compute how far away this thing

765
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,500
is we're gonna we're not gonna look at

766
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:27,180
things that are behind us right and that

767
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,980
doesn't have anything to do with what

768
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:31,379
we're not looking at there are no things

769
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,579
behind us in the current setup so it's

770
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,500
not relevant but I just wanna put that

771
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:36,840
in there before I forget so anyway we

772
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,210
got our X form in here we then do our

773
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:42,440
entity cursor I want to draw that line

774
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:49,260
so I can see it and see if it's accurate

775
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:52,010
so there's the world position looks like

776
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,010
that's just a color

777
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:05,688
2p is going to be the entity to cursor

778
00:38:03,768 --> 00:38:13,938
is just cursor in a world I guess is

779
00:38:05,688 --> 00:38:15,739
where I would want to draw that and then

780
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:21,038
the thickness can just be whatever I

781
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:21,039
don't know probably too thick

782
00:38:35,978 --> 00:38:52,068
it looks like current wads runs out of

783
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:54,489
and trees there but I'm not super sure

784
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:54,489
why

785
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:13,749
so here's push line segment Oh because

786
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,748
it doesn't actually get quads

787
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:28,519
right which is kind of annoying

788
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,750
yeah that's kind of annoying you want

789
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,730
there to be a call where it'll actually

790
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:58,869
do something for you there I don't know

791
00:39:48,730 --> 00:40:01,150
why it doesn't that so it looks like

792
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:05,819
this was coming up

793
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,820
oops sorry say

794
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:19,030
so you know that's actually quite

795
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:23,950
accurate I mean that's pegged right to

796
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:30,510
the cursor so I'm not quite sure why

797
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:33,368
we're getting an error there I guess

798
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,380
so one thing that's true is this is

799
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:38,530
irrespective of the transform so

800
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:43,690
probably what I would say is because so

801
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:49,720
we're not actually getting like we don't

802
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:51,280
actually have the Delta in that we don't

803
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:55,719
actually know what the dimensions of

804
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:59,019
that rectangle are in that plane is I

805
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:02,289
guess kind of one negative aspect of how

806
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:05,108
this is being done so like for example

807
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:10,900
in here yeah we can sort of see exactly

808
00:41:05,108 --> 00:41:13,960
what the problem is where you know we're

809
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:18,670
we're looking at its side on and here's

810
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,838
that vector it's totally it's totally

811
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,170
wrong in terms of how it's being

812
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:30,699
projected down so I don't know how I

813
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:34,170
want to do that I could project the

814
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:34,169
mouse cursor onto the plane

815
00:41:39,278 --> 00:41:43,608
it's always hard to decide because since

816
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,710
these things are not real 3d shapes it's

817
00:41:43,608 --> 00:41:49,308
hard to know how you should be picking

818
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,960
them if that makes sense look normally

819
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:52,970
you just raycast against the 3d shape

820
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,380
but there is no 3d shape it's just kind

821
00:41:52,969 --> 00:42:00,608
of an abstract blob that's kind of stuck

822
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:00,608
on the world if I did want to do that

823
00:42:02,528 --> 00:42:07,269
now if we have a wrote a ray intersects

824
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:07,269
plane

825
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,630
doesn't look like we did so we could

826
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:27,579
write one of those and then just take

827
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,710
the intersection of the camera vector

828
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:42,700
with the plane instead and do it that

829
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:48,099
way is that better and worse than

830
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:50,528
testing a box I mean I guess the nice

831
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:52,809
thing about doing a box test is the box

832
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:56,528
test would work for the cubes too so

833
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:59,170
maybe we should just do the box test and

834
00:42:56,528 --> 00:43:03,760
then we just sort of make a fake box for

835
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:07,059
the entity in question and let the Box

836
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:13,390
test deal with it so if we want to do

837
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:15,460
something like that you know we can

838
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:17,108
generate the Ray ahead of time so you

839
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,949
know what I can do to generate the Ray

840
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:22,389
direction is actually pretty simple we

841
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:23,858
just used the same code that we have

842
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:26,348
here but we just do it in a slightly

843
00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:29,018
different way so you know what I can do

844
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:32,588
is say all right take you know before we

845
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:35,879
start let's generate a picking ray and

846
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:35,880
so here I'll just say

847
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:54,608
if you gave me a render group then what

848
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:59,710
I'm going to do is take a picking ray

849
00:43:54,608 --> 00:44:09,548
and the picking ray is going to go from

850
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:11,858
the camera out into the world by taking

851
00:44:09,548 --> 00:44:14,588
whatever the clip space is and just

852
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:18,848
going one unit out because who cares

853
00:44:14,588 --> 00:44:32,588
it's a ray right so we will do the

854
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:36,119
unprojected just say just normalize the

855
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:39,699
vector from the camera to that point and

856
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:42,640
that's our picking ray so if we have a

857
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:45,038
picking ray then what we can do is we

858
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,989
can just use the picking ray to

859
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:50,940
intersect with a phantom box we

860
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:50,939
construct like a made up box basically

861
00:44:51,028 --> 00:44:59,769
and we just use that made up box we

862
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,359
don't need to do any of this really but

863
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:05,440
we do need to right oops

864
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:07,358
little box intersection code um so once

865
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,539
we have this information here we can

866
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:18,068
basically you know fake the dimensions

867
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:20,410
of this box and we can for actual cubes

868
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:24,608
we could make it exact but for other

869
00:45:20,409 --> 00:45:26,259
things you know we can't so we you know

870
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:30,130
we have to fake it for sprites because

871
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:32,770
they don't have a real shape um so

872
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:37,980
anyway if we did that then what we could

873
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:43,538
do is just say like if ray intersects

874
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:47,380
box and then we would just pass here's

875
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:51,460
the world P here's the worlds dim and

876
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:56,519
here's the picking ring we know the

877
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:56,519
picking origin as well

878
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:16,929
because of course it's just this because

879
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:20,590
we're always starting from the camera uh

880
00:46:16,929 --> 00:46:22,269
so I think that's it and that would give

881
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:24,039
us the ability to do it as if they were

882
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:25,358
boxes which seems a little better just

883
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:27,489
having play with the lives like oh yeah

884
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:30,369
right you know we don't we want to be

885
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:31,750
able to sort of still do it in pseudo-3d

886
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:33,010
even though things aren't 3d I don't

887
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:36,699
know so which argues for the Box

888
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:38,470
construction to me um and so if we did

889
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:40,029
that we just need to provide that actual

890
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:41,349
function now there are some other things

891
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,850
we would want to do here I'll show you

892
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:48,759
in a second so we don't really want ray

893
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:50,739
intersects box per se so we need to do a

894
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,410
little bit more work there but at the

895
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:55,569
moment you know it should still be okay

896
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:58,420
now the other thing I can do here is

897
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,710
actually draw this as well so you know I

898
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,590
could just make sure are picking array

899
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:04,869
is correct I can do a push line segment

900
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:08,530
that just says let's draw the quad from

901
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:10,090
the origin to the Ray or from zero zero

902
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,500
to the right just as a quick way of

903
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,789
making sure that there are picking ray

904
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,170
is actually correct because we don't

905
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:16,570
really know what it is

906
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:19,210
so if I said look let's draw from let's

907
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:21,820
say just the origin of the world and

908
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:26,380
then to the picking origin plus the

909
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:28,539
picking ray we should see that end at

910
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,858
the end of the cursor right and that

911
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:31,840
just lets us know that our picking ray

912
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:36,819
isn't garbage right it like that we

913
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:38,108
actually did that work correctly okay so

914
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,039
what I'll do is I'll just stub this in

915
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,750
here and then we'll talk a little bit

916
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:41,949
more about what we want to do so for

917
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:45,670
right now what I'll do is I'll just say

918
00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:55,059
hey you know when you do put caps left

919
00:47:45,670 --> 00:48:05,920
on um when you ask me to go from origin

920
00:47:55,059 --> 00:48:08,679
Direction box P box radius I am just

921
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,980
going to tell you that the result is you

922
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:12,519
did

923
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:14,199
hit anything right and so that will just

924
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:16,840
work in the sense that it will never

925
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:20,949
actually queue the hit code and we can

926
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:23,680
run the app on its own right oh and we

927
00:48:20,949 --> 00:48:26,139
still have this stupid problem I don't

928
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:28,108
know what I want that that that's so

929
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:32,559
weird do we have a way of calling that

930
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:37,210
that accounts for its own quads like why

931
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:38,920
don't we have one of those that accounts

932
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,599
for its own quads that just seems really

933
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:45,180
strange

934
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:45,179
we don't write like we don't have that

935
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:20,980
push line segment render group so this

936
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:24,809
will do it for us from free from CF 2 P

937
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,809
2 CF and fitness

938
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:44,690
um so again yeah someday polish up the

939
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:48,199
renderer

940
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:52,429
what is this saying recursive you're

941
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:55,639
correct that's what I actually wanted to

942
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:56,989
say there and so now at least we can

943
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:01,789
just call that and not have to think

944
00:49:56,989 --> 00:50:03,379
about that - all right so let's try to

945
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:10,239
get this to be pegged to their correct

946
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:10,240
location it looks like it basically is

947
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:24,500
so I mean I think we're okay there all

948
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:28,250
right so if we have our picking array

949
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,659
doing its little picking picky poo then

950
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,460
what we need to do is have a way for

951
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:33,859
this box stuff to do something

952
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,210
reasonable and so what I want to do here

953
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:38,360
is just say look okay we've got a world

954
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:41,750
Tim we're gonna push a rect outline on

955
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:44,170
here and get that highlighting in the

956
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:46,909
case where it actually needs to get hit

957
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:49,250
what we could also do is just show those

958
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:51,109
irrespective and change the color so

959
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,000
that might be a little bit more fun at

960
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:55,370
the start just again as we're debugging

961
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:03,440
this so let's suppose we said that the

962
00:50:55,369 --> 00:51:06,829
color was going to be black and it only

963
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,610
turns or yellow when you actually hit

964
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:16,639
the thing when the mouse is actually

965
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:20,059
poking through right so we'll always

966
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:22,339
draw the rectangle and we'll just draw

967
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:25,599
it by passing the right color in there

968
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,600
so what's the complaint here

969
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:51,519
Oh got the thickness I guess I pushed on

970
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:58,619
their group v3 neither of these are the

971
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:58,619
render transform version how did we get

972
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:19,240
how do we not have I want something that

973
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:22,599
draws the outline of a cube push volume

974
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:24,250
outline and like this whole time I'm

975
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:28,150
like being frustrated I'm like don't we

976
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:29,949
hi we do we drew cages before how can we

977
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:33,070
can't throw them now and it's like well

978
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:35,079
that's why alright good so then we can

979
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:37,750
say that we've got this rectangle

980
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:39,098
dimension here that's what I wanted to

981
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:44,260
pass the first place so that's much

982
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:46,559
happier all right good good good mystery

983
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:49,270
solved

984
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,150
so that's good all right cannot give her

985
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:53,829
a target three two rectangle three okay

986
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:56,588
that's fine we can create a rectangle

987
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:58,420
three let me just look really quickly so

988
00:52:56,588 --> 00:53:00,549
it doesn't take a position right so it

989
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:03,940
wants you to build a rectangle three out

990
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:07,420
of these two things so we just want to

991
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:10,300
do a center radius Oh Center dimension

992
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:15,420
right like that it's not really a radius

993
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:15,420
I guess should it be left to see

994
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:26,010
I'm pretty sure we have one of these

995
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:28,709
yeah so now we should see a bunch of

996
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:32,490
little like floating black outline

997
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:39,329
things right and and that is what we see

998
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:41,819
which is good and if we were to do this

999
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:44,159
without like instead of sprites if we

1000
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,960
were to do this like so we were assuming

1001
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:48,509
sprites there but let's let's say that I

1002
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,980
just I don't do the world dim stuff

1003
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:53,060
there so let's suppose that what I

1004
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:56,219
actually did is I just go like okay

1005
00:53:53,059 --> 00:53:59,009
let's actually create the outline sir so

1006
00:53:56,219 --> 00:54:02,359
it looks like those are radius calls and

1007
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:06,119
this is a dim call so like I just want

1008
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:09,240
this world dim it's really a world

1009
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:12,260
radius here and I'm saying which is what

1010
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:12,259
I was planning for anyway

1011
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:23,340
and so if we do that what we want to do

1012
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:26,369
is is when we create this rec center dim

1013
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:29,160
we really want rec center half dim in

1014
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:35,640
that sense because it's the radius not

1015
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:37,079
the diameter and so now you can see we

1016
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,929
get those thick outlines around

1017
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:41,608
everything which is what we want and now

1018
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:43,529
what we want to see happen and we'll nor

1019
00:54:41,608 --> 00:54:44,789
the sprites for a second but we want to

1020
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:51,060
see happen as I want to be able to pick

1021
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:53,429
those blocks right and so we have an

1022
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:55,108
optimized version of Ray intersects box

1023
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:56,399
that's made for patches and we're

1024
00:54:55,108 --> 00:55:00,029
working on the lighting but we don't

1025
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,039
really have one it's not optimized so

1026
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,109
what I'd like to do here is just figure

1027
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:07,409
out some way to actually get this stuff

1028
00:55:04,108 --> 00:55:08,460
to be you know inside there like let's

1029
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:10,440
just take a look at what we're doing

1030
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:14,429
here and see cuz we kind of already

1031
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,619
worked that stuff out right so if you

1032
00:55:14,429 --> 00:55:18,690
look at what we're doing here we have a

1033
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:20,250
box P we already know what that is and

1034
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,559
we have a box radius and we already know

1035
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,570
what that is so if we wanted to do a box

1036
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,980
man in a box max we could do that

1037
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,890
exactly the same way we were doing it in

1038
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,780
our sim decode and similarly if we want

1039
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:32,789
to do

1040
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:36,030
this sort of nonsense here we should be

1041
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:42,800
able to do that as well if we are

1042
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:46,370
looking at what's going on here the x in

1043
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,370
brady though

1044
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:12,289
that's a little bit saucy er so that's

1045
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,460
actually doing

1046
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:15,460
[Music]

1047
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:39,239
that's actually doing something slightly

1048
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:45,869
more competent here so that pre inverts

1049
00:56:39,239 --> 00:57:07,289
the Ray test right like this so it's

1050
00:56:45,869 --> 00:57:10,079
effectively doing that and so what it's

1051
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:15,210
doing here is the same if I pre invert

1052
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:16,619
and then I divide each of them axes by

1053
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:21,380
the pre advert like so I'm basically

1054
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:21,380
dividing each one by the Ray stepping

1055
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:40,670
then I can come up with which axis I

1056
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,670
would hit earliest

1057
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:54,600
we don't really need an early out

1058
00:57:52,739 --> 00:58:06,449
condition here so this should be

1059
00:57:54,599 --> 00:58:10,230
sufficient so this is whether or not the

1060
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:16,339
hip actually hit you don't care about

1061
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:16,340
the T inside I don't think

1062
00:58:36,818 --> 00:58:42,969
yeah so I think we're really just

1063
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:51,829
looking at look if the hit is between

1064
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:53,149
here and the max is not on the earlier

1065
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:55,550
side of it so this is basically the

1066
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:56,838
thing that says what's going on so this

1067
00:58:55,550 --> 00:59:07,160
this is really what we're talking about

1068
00:58:56,838 --> 00:59:08,690
here right that's our key key valid

1069
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:10,789
results so that's this is like good B

1070
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:14,119
hit right

1071
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:15,139
and so our Max and mins are fine this is

1072
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:16,670
the part that we're gonna have a little

1073
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:18,769
bit problem with so this is effectively

1074
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,369
a Hadamard product here I think that's

1075
00:59:18,769 --> 00:59:22,730
correct

1076
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:24,200
I'd have to read the algorithm that we

1077
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:27,349
were using there which is kind of an

1078
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:34,039
accelerated box test right but it's a

1079
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:38,599
little swing key let me go ahead and

1080
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:40,250
make this happen um so this is doing you

1081
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:44,838
an inversion I don't know that we ever

1082
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:46,639
actually did that in our in our routine

1083
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:49,119
where you could invert by a scaler where

1084
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:54,379
you're basically saying look I want to

1085
00:59:49,119 --> 01:00:00,950
invert each element of my my Ray and go

1086
00:59:54,380 --> 01:00:03,318
from there so we have like divided looks

1087
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:09,189
like we did divided by a constant but

1088
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:11,599
not be divided so let's let's just do it

1089
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:13,400
so in order to do that all we have to do

1090
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:18,079
is reverse the meaning of these two

1091
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:21,139
things right so if we want to do this to

1092
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:27,470
each of our individual elements then

1093
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:33,289
what we want to do is say well okay B

1094
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:36,969
gets divided by a X a Y and a Z and

1095
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:36,969
produces the final result

1096
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:51,379
um seems like I don't know that we ever

1097
01:00:48,530 --> 01:01:00,048
did am in here so what are you thinking

1098
01:00:51,380 --> 01:01:02,930
sighs we don't actually we don't

1099
01:01:00,048 --> 01:01:09,500
actually have a min that operates on

1100
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:11,149
vectors right that does kind of seem

1101
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,739
good though so I feel like these things

1102
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:14,539
that we were taking for granted in the

1103
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:17,269
sim D context you probably should have

1104
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:21,440
them for our regular vectors as well I

1105
01:01:17,269 --> 01:01:25,130
mean it just seems good right like if we

1106
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,750
do a min of a and B like it seems like

1107
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:32,930
you would want to just be able to do

1108
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:43,059
look that's min ax BX it just maps over

1109
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:43,058
the vector right

1110
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:19,809
is ma'am macro like if this remember how

1111
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:22,990
we set that up right so is minimum of

1112
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:25,659
macro yeah so that's kind of annoying

1113
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:27,519
this is again just the CMAs of it all

1114
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:28,960
it's kind of annoying we can't really do

1115
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:33,059
what we would have wanted to do with min

1116
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,059
and Max there but yeah oh well

1117
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:49,000
so in theory that would do the

1118
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,289
intersection I have to walk to that

1119
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,880
routine again and make sure some it

1120
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:53,528
makes clear sense and other parts of it

1121
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,180
are a little bit they're like okay

1122
01:02:53,528 --> 01:02:58,150
you've done some steps with the algebra

1123
01:02:55,179 --> 01:02:59,828
there and so I don't necessarily want to

1124
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:02,349
call that correct for an app but that's

1125
01:02:59,829 --> 01:03:03,400
basically what we're dealing with so it

1126
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:06,278
looks like we translate it correctly

1127
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,900
because the picking is working and so

1128
01:03:06,278 --> 01:03:10,449
then we just have to deal with the the

1129
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:12,880
part that I was saying we we don't

1130
01:03:10,449 --> 01:03:14,199
exactly want rated sex box so the reason

1131
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,568
we don't exactly want it is like if you

1132
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:19,058
look at what happens if I you know pick

1133
01:03:16,568 --> 01:03:21,518
down the middle all the hits all get

1134
01:03:19,059 --> 01:03:24,849
recorded so what I really want to do is

1135
01:03:21,518 --> 01:03:28,028
actually provide the the T value coming

1136
01:03:24,849 --> 01:03:32,079
back and so in here what we really want

1137
01:03:28,028 --> 01:03:35,768
is something that's more like you know

1138
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:38,259
f-22 result equals you know some value

1139
01:03:35,768 --> 01:03:39,879
that's not gonna sort properly and so

1140
01:03:38,259 --> 01:03:44,019
maybe what we do is we just say look the

1141
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:47,528
the result would be f-22 Max and then

1142
01:03:44,018 --> 01:03:51,719
you know we check to see if you did hit

1143
01:03:47,528 --> 01:03:55,289
oops and if you did hit then we will

1144
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:57,969
return you the actual hit in question

1145
01:03:55,289 --> 01:04:00,309
that way when you do Ray intersects box

1146
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:03,788
here what we can do instead of doing it

1147
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:09,150
this way is then go ahead and just just

1148
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:12,160
pull this back out to its own sort of

1149
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:13,389
well you know what it's really just a

1150
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:15,639
render that has to change

1151
01:04:13,389 --> 01:04:19,358
so in here we can basically just take

1152
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:26,710
the best hit and then at the end render

1153
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:28,960
the volume outline in question right so

1154
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:30,639
what we would do there is again just as

1155
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,409
we run through the entities we would

1156
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:34,028
just say look which entity is the actual

1157
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:37,509
one that looks like the person's on top

1158
01:04:34,028 --> 01:04:39,518
of and which piece index as well so we

1159
01:04:37,509 --> 01:04:43,539
can just say look you know what's the

1160
01:04:39,518 --> 01:04:46,719
hit entity index and what's the kick

1161
01:04:43,539 --> 01:04:49,150
entity piece those the two pieces of

1162
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:51,719
information we actually need and what we

1163
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,720
can say is

1164
01:04:53,639 --> 01:05:00,009
when we go through we'll just track

1165
01:04:56,018 --> 01:05:04,538
whichever one that is so in here when

1166
01:05:00,009 --> 01:05:06,039
we're actually looking at the hits this

1167
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:08,528
also we can roll this into the other

1168
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:10,839
loop too which is kind of nice so we'll

1169
01:05:08,528 --> 01:05:12,309
just go ahead and do that in a second

1170
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:16,259
here but what we can then do is say all

1171
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:16,259
right when we do Ray intersects box

1172
01:05:20,278 --> 01:05:27,219
that'll give us back the T hit if the

1173
01:05:23,918 --> 01:05:30,129
best hit is greater than the T hit then

1174
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:35,289
we'll go ahead and grab it so we'll just

1175
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:42,809
say at that point grab the best hit it's

1176
01:05:35,289 --> 01:05:47,739
now that this is the entity we hit hello

1177
01:05:42,809 --> 01:05:49,599
and this is the piece that we hit so now

1178
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:52,298
we know which one of those we actually

1179
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:54,729
hit and now inside the render group we

1180
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:55,958
can just say well I'm sorry inside the

1181
01:05:54,728 --> 01:05:59,858
test at the end we could just say well

1182
01:05:55,958 --> 01:06:02,918
alright if is a render group and the

1183
01:05:59,858 --> 01:06:08,798
best hit is not you know a nonsense

1184
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:10,509
value then assume we hit something we'll

1185
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:14,259
just pull out whatever that entity is

1186
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:16,239
and draw the the piece in question right

1187
01:06:14,259 --> 01:06:18,039
now we may want to make that a little

1188
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:25,528
easier on ourselves by just recording it

1189
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:28,929
because we can hit P and hit him

1190
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:31,509
that just seems nicer just to make it a

1191
01:06:28,929 --> 01:06:33,418
little easier on ourselves so I'm gonna

1192
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:38,728
do that too so here we'll just do like

1193
01:06:33,418 --> 01:06:44,558
hit P equals world P get dimples radius

1194
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:45,968
and then it'll just draw those so we

1195
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,339
don't have an indeed transform and

1196
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:52,119
that's fine because I don't really want

1197
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:54,578
one anyway and I'm not sure how to get

1198
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:57,298
just a generic transform I guess we

1199
01:06:54,579 --> 01:06:57,298
would just say

1200
01:06:57,349 --> 01:07:00,449
[Music]

1201
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:17,539
you know I'm not sure which default

1202
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:26,279
transform we really want to use here and

1203
01:07:17,539 --> 01:07:33,838
so I couldn't really tell you should

1204
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:35,790
make that a rectangle too so I want to

1205
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:37,049
play with that a little bit I may just

1206
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:39,929
want to remove those transcripts all

1207
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:42,930
together - I don't like them I don't

1208
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:44,190
think they're good but anyway so now

1209
01:07:42,929 --> 01:07:48,318
when we're doing picking you can see

1210
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:52,260
like it only picks the closest hit right

1211
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:53,759
and so that's nice because that means

1212
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:55,650
that we don't have to worry about that

1213
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,119
so now let's see if we can make

1214
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:59,400
ourselves pick sprites because we're

1215
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,809
really not going to pick sprites now and

1216
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,490
sprites are the main thing we want to

1217
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:03,838
pick like it's nice to be able to pick

1218
01:08:02,489 --> 01:08:04,889
entities who's we probably will care

1219
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:07,289
about that but I'd like to be able to

1220
01:08:04,889 --> 01:08:09,420
pick the sprites as well and so what I'd

1221
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:11,159
like to do is roll this actually back up

1222
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:13,289
into the old routine so instead of

1223
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:14,670
actually doing that as a separate pass

1224
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:17,039
now when we're actually going through

1225
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:19,770
the piece indices here what I'd like to

1226
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:22,528
do is make that happen like sort of

1227
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:26,250
right in line with retiring the pieces

1228
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:28,500
of cells so when we do this we can now

1229
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:30,029
sort of have that happen as its own

1230
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,988
little pass when we're actually looking

1231
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:37,020
for input there and so when this part

1232
01:08:33,988 --> 01:08:39,959
happens what we now know is that we have

1233
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:42,839
more information about what we might

1234
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:46,829
want to use because these paths that

1235
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:48,719
branch can now record what the world

1236
01:08:46,829 --> 01:08:52,109
position and stuff like that should

1237
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:54,390
actually be and that's good for us right

1238
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:55,949
so we know that the world P is always

1239
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:59,069
that what we don't know is what the

1240
01:08:55,948 --> 01:09:01,759
world radius actually is and so if I was

1241
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:04,100
to say look let's get the world radius

1242
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,359
information we'll stick that in here

1243
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:09,600
when we come down through here the

1244
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:12,750
lights as you can see that'll just work

1245
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:15,660
the cube version will just work and so

1246
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:18,719
the only issue is this path here which

1247
01:09:15,659 --> 01:09:24,809
we don't know so in that case what I can

1248
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:27,300
do is set these now to be based on the

1249
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:30,900
you know sort of bogus values that we're

1250
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:33,810
just slamming in for sprites so now

1251
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:35,068
it'll do that testing and we'll be in

1252
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:36,990
good shape don't ask me why there's a

1253
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:39,630
color value of being set there we don't

1254
01:09:36,989 --> 01:09:41,068
need that anymore and so now in theory

1255
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:43,520
we should be able to put in phantom

1256
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:45,690
boxes for each sprite that can be picked

1257
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,030
and those boxes are not going to be

1258
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:51,809
exactly right but you can see now we are

1259
01:09:48,029 --> 01:09:53,608
picking them and so we'll probably need

1260
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:55,310
to do some work to make those more

1261
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:58,530
accurate for an individual sprites

1262
01:09:55,310 --> 01:10:00,210
probably by working with the bounds that

1263
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:02,550
we know from like looking at the bitmap

1264
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:05,069
and stuff like that but like let's say

1265
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:06,570
we go in here now I should be able to

1266
01:10:05,069 --> 01:10:09,420
pick yeah and I can you know I could

1267
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:16,829
pick like this sort of fakes bright for

1268
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:22,279
the the cat right so there's the cat

1269
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:26,659
body and there's the right and so yeah

1270
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:30,149
it's not perfect but it's not horrible

1271
01:10:26,659 --> 01:10:31,889
and so that's that's basically allows us

1272
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:36,449
to reach in and get exactly what we want

1273
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:37,200
uh so that's pretty easy you know that

1274
01:10:36,449 --> 01:10:39,689
wasn't too bad

1275
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:41,220
was a little bit of fussing but but not

1276
01:10:39,689 --> 01:10:42,750
too bad and that would allow us to pick

1277
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:45,180
things the only issue that we're gonna

1278
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:46,979
have there is again like we don't know

1279
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:49,079
the right sizes these things because we

1280
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:52,379
don't look at the bitmap dimensions and

1281
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:55,769
we probably need to write so that's one

1282
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:58,770
that's a little Squinkie and you know

1283
01:10:55,770 --> 01:11:00,720
probably busted there's a lot of things

1284
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:02,130
that are busted about that and stuff we

1285
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,449
can fix now because one of the things

1286
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:05,609
you have to remember is the bitmap

1287
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:08,579
dimension stuff we now have all the time

1288
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:11,339
so there's no reason to defer the amount

1289
01:11:08,579 --> 01:11:14,010
of information back on the bitmap front

1290
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:15,300
we should just get the bitmap and look

1291
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,369
at what it's actual thing is because

1292
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:20,039
even if it hasn't been loaded yet its

1293
01:11:17,369 --> 01:11:22,829
dimensions have so it's not like we

1294
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:24,600
don't know where the bitmap is or how

1295
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:26,760
big it is we just may not have its

1296
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,710
pixels so there's no real reason not to

1297
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:33,500
have that information directly in there

1298
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:33,500
and so that's just a little stupid right

1299
01:11:33,569 --> 01:11:37,679
but anyway other than that I think we're

1300
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:38,250
in good shape so now we can let click on

1301
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,430
these entities

1302
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:43,649
you know and we can you know do whatever

1303
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:47,579
we want there and and you know who knows

1304
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:50,609
what right so let's go ahead and see

1305
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:52,350
about now adding something where we

1306
01:11:50,609 --> 01:11:54,719
could adjust information about one of

1307
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:56,280
these entities so if I was to like pick

1308
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,560
one of the cats bright ones or whatever

1309
01:11:56,279 --> 01:12:01,679
and by the way when we're doing this

1310
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:13,080
again like I said you know it's it's a

1311
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:15,150
little confusing because I don't when we

1312
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:17,279
have sprites stacked up on top of each

1313
01:12:15,149 --> 01:12:19,409
other we need to know how big the actual

1314
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:22,319
sprites are and that's something that

1315
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:23,819
we're not really doing so again like

1316
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:25,019
this all kind of ties in it'll get

1317
01:12:23,819 --> 01:12:27,989
better

1318
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:29,550
as we fix and finish the placement

1319
01:12:27,989 --> 01:12:34,679
routines which is what we want to do

1320
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:37,380
anyway so being able to pick the you

1321
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:40,800
know the individual pieces will get

1322
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:43,109
better - at the moment let's say even

1323
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,750
what we could say is that even if we it

1324
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:48,359
was this crappy though like even if we

1325
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:50,810
never fixed it we actually do have an

1326
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:53,549
easy way of making this be sufficient

1327
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:56,550
because all we actually have to do to

1328
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:59,010
fix it is say look when I pick one of

1329
01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:03,210
these then just give me like a hotkey to

1330
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:05,579
cycle through the pieces right so it's

1331
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:07,140
actually not we only really need to pick

1332
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:09,449
entities we don't need to pick

1333
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:11,850
individual pieces anyway so it's fine

1334
01:13:09,449 --> 01:13:14,849
like this is way good enough and it's

1335
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:16,800
exact for any actual 3d stuff and it's

1336
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:18,060
only a problem when we have these

1337
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,500
individual pieces because we don't

1338
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:21,840
really have tight balance on them yet

1339
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:23,579
when we had type bounce we might be fine

1340
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,440
with that too but even then you might

1341
01:13:23,579 --> 01:13:26,909
you know sprites layer in complex ways

1342
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:29,159
and you know especially like imagine of

1343
01:13:26,909 --> 01:13:30,539
translucent sprites so you don't even

1344
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:32,250
know which one you're picking did you

1345
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:33,569
want the one that you can see through to

1346
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:35,430
the back or did you want the one that

1347
01:13:33,569 --> 01:13:37,949
was in the front there's no real answer

1348
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:39,240
for those so you know you you probably

1349
01:13:37,949 --> 01:13:42,689
would need something for disambiguation

1350
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:44,579
in those cases anyway and so that's kind

1351
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:46,859
of a separate issue too but anyway

1352
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:48,960
that's you know that's it and that's

1353
01:13:46,859 --> 01:13:50,399
fine so let's try and make something

1354
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,369
where we can actually adjust those

1355
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:56,679
pieces of

1356
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:59,439
formation and you know get it so that we

1357
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:01,570
can edit it in the game and just it

1358
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,269
won't be saved so it's like any work we

1359
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:05,679
do just gets thrown away unfortunately

1360
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:08,800
but let's just get that working and then

1361
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:11,530
we can work on this next step after that

1362
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:14,650
which is getting it through line the the

1363
01:14:11,529 --> 01:14:16,179
whole pipeline right so at the moment

1364
01:14:14,649 --> 01:14:20,229
I'm just looking it looks like we got

1365
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:23,050
about thirty minutes left is that right

1366
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:25,079
or did I go over time how much time do

1367
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:29,619
we have

1368
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:32,340
does anyone know how much time do I have

1369
01:14:29,619 --> 01:14:34,239
am i over time I'm out over time right I

1370
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,529
don't know how much time is left this

1371
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:37,889
thing doesn't usually tell you how much

1372
01:14:35,529 --> 01:14:37,889
time is left

1373
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:48,368
sixteen minutes into the cute well

1374
01:14:45,498 --> 01:14:48,368
really

1375
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:58,879
I guess I don't have time left then

1376
01:14:55,609 --> 01:14:58,880
never mind

1377
01:15:07,779 --> 01:15:10,898
[Music]

1378
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:22,810
does anybody know what the actual time

1379
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:27,159
is because I started I started it 1

1380
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:31,119
o'clock right so now we have 30 minutes

1381
01:15:27,158 --> 01:15:32,198
left because I started at the beginning

1382
01:15:31,118 --> 01:15:34,089
of stream I was working on the hash

1383
01:15:32,198 --> 01:15:37,269
thing and I didn't start the timer

1384
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:39,340
I moved the timer up to 1 o'clock so I

1385
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:40,900
didn't start at noon in so that's

1386
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:42,520
probably going on the assumption that we

1387
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:45,549
actually started at the publish time but

1388
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:47,500
I actually started an hour later because

1389
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:58,900
we were doing other non handmade here at

1390
01:15:47,500 --> 01:16:01,630
programming right I feel like I'm gonna

1391
01:15:58,899 --> 01:16:03,039
be excited to do some more improvements

1392
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:05,980
to the lighting because the lighting is

1393
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:08,710
almost starting to be cool and when it

1394
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:09,968
becomes a little bit cooler than it is

1395
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:13,389
right now I think it's gonna be very

1396
01:16:09,969 --> 01:16:14,340
cool and that's all I have to say about

1397
01:16:13,389 --> 01:16:17,920
that

1398
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:19,300
all right so yes so I guess what I want

1399
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,699
to do now is be able to like pick one of

1400
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:24,550
these things and just figure out some

1401
01:16:21,698 --> 01:16:28,888
convenient way to to talk about like the

1402
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:34,420
various points that are involved right

1403
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:43,000
so I want some way to like take a thing

1404
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:46,210
and annotate it with points I guess I

1405
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,539
don't know if I care if I can add points

1406
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,539
or not

1407
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:12,640
I'm not sure what I want to do here I

1408
01:17:10,449 --> 01:17:14,710
have no idea so I'm gonna start doing

1409
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:19,660
something and we'll see what develops I

1410
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:25,260
guess that's just how it's gonna go so

1411
01:17:19,659 --> 01:17:29,889
let's suppose that I want to edit a

1412
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:35,020
bitmap thingy so I want to be able to

1413
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:44,800
display like some information about it

1414
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:52,560
and I want to be able to like like

1415
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:55,840
here's what here's what I want to do so

1416
01:17:52,560 --> 01:18:04,330
one of the things we did in the importer

1417
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:07,000
right is inside world no asset so here

1418
01:18:04,329 --> 01:18:09,189
so I'm gonna start with okay so inside

1419
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,680
the asset importer one things we did is

1420
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:15,669
there's a way of getting errors right so

1421
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:18,340
like you can generate errors and errors

1422
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:27,130
go on the file in question right and

1423
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:28,510
that sort of thing and so like if

1424
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:30,039
there's parse errors is the name of the

1425
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:32,470
file or stuff like that like it comes

1426
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:37,359
out and the bitmaps have you know errors

1427
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:38,590
in them or whatever right and so one of

1428
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:45,759
the things that I'm interested in is

1429
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:49,840
like what if I just want to see those

1430
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:51,100
errors for a particular bitmap so so

1431
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,960
we're not even to try and edit anything

1432
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,489
like what if I just I just wanted to

1433
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,659
play something so I want to be able to

1434
01:18:54,488 --> 01:19:01,238
pick a bitmap in the world right and I

1435
01:18:58,659 --> 01:19:10,059
want you to tell me I want you to print

1436
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:15,479
out you know what is what the errors you

1437
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:15,480
recorded for that bitmap

1438
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:28,369
I mean that seems reasonable right

1439
01:19:44,189 --> 01:19:49,589
and I mean I guess I don't necessarily

1440
01:19:46,859 --> 01:19:51,689
know if we have a way of telling which

1441
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:54,480
file a bitmap came from but I think we

1442
01:19:51,689 --> 01:19:58,229
do because I seem to recall in here when

1443
01:19:54,479 --> 01:20:00,929
we actually have the assets themselves

1444
01:19:58,229 --> 01:20:04,679
right they they now store this little

1445
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:08,850
u-32 pair which means that they know

1446
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:17,239
which file and which asset in which file

1447
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:17,239
they were so if you were to click like

1448
01:20:27,469 --> 01:20:34,248
well mm-hmm so we have a forward mapping

1449
01:20:32,779 --> 01:20:38,118
but we don't necessary have a backward

1450
01:20:34,248 --> 01:20:39,920
mapping so we know what hh-hey it came

1451
01:20:38,118 --> 01:20:42,558
from but we don't necessarily know

1452
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,328
anything else about it we do however

1453
01:20:42,559 --> 01:20:46,760
have annotation for it

1454
01:20:44,328 --> 01:20:54,978
so if we put the errors into the

1455
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:57,289
annotation then that would work and that

1456
01:20:54,979 --> 01:20:58,610
would work nicely which is probably more

1457
01:20:57,288 --> 01:21:01,908
what we would want anyway

1458
01:20:58,609 --> 01:21:07,779
and in fact I'm not sure why we didn't

1459
01:21:01,908 --> 01:21:07,779
do it that way that seems good to me

1460
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:25,719
so if we look at the HHA look at the

1461
01:21:22,329 --> 01:21:28,719
file formats here if we look at the HHA

1462
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:31,420
like so for each one of the the assets

1463
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:35,189
in question we have this annotation

1464
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:37,510
thing and we've got like this reserved

1465
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:39,369
block here so we can actually add

1466
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:41,320
additional stuff one of the things that

1467
01:21:39,369 --> 01:21:44,680
we should probably add I feel like is

1468
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:48,359
just errors right so like were there

1469
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,360
errors on the import of this thing

1470
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:01,410
and that way you could you could do two

1471
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:02,880
things one is you can ask if there's any

1472
01:22:01,409 --> 01:22:06,389
errors in a file and it will be like

1473
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:10,650
yeah here they are and the other is you

1474
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:12,510
can for any given asset you could say

1475
01:22:10,649 --> 01:22:16,500
where there any area any errors on this

1476
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:19,770
asset or any warnings on this asset that

1477
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:24,949
you know me retention that seems pretty

1478
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:29,550
good right so if I cut that down and say

1479
01:22:24,949 --> 01:22:37,159
error offset or airstream offset and

1480
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:37,159
error stream counts

1481
01:22:45,869 --> 01:22:48,680
right

1482
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:12,920
so if I just add one more in there I can

1483
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:15,050
say hey here's the Airstream I'll set

1484
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:17,269
and here zero stream count I can take to

1485
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:20,150
you six fours away and just like put in

1486
01:23:17,269 --> 01:23:23,389
one pad there and then nothing really

1487
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:28,189
has to change right the file format

1488
01:23:23,389 --> 01:23:31,748
doesn't change at all but I can do that

1489
01:23:28,189 --> 01:23:31,748
and then I can actually look at errors

1490
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:45,230
so I think that's good I don't really

1491
01:23:41,238 --> 01:23:48,919
know if it's good or not but it seems

1492
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:51,049
good so if we look at like when we get

1493
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,908
the author here right when we read in

1494
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:55,429
one of these files now I can just add

1495
01:23:52,908 --> 01:23:58,368
another one of those like okay so here's

1496
01:23:55,429 --> 01:24:02,960
the Airstream and I could say era stream

1497
01:23:58,368 --> 01:24:08,109
asset and their stream count and in

1498
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:08,109
theory that should just make a thing

1499
01:24:13,059 --> 01:24:21,800
right

1500
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:28,460
I think so I don't know if that needs to

1501
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:37,159
be so when you write an HHA this is

1502
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:39,109
actually a rate h hav to write so if you

1503
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:41,420
write an HH a when you write these yeah

1504
01:24:39,109 --> 01:24:55,789
so we'd need to do one more of these as

1505
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:58,069
well but I think other than that it's

1506
01:24:55,789 --> 01:24:59,630
just that was it and now you can just

1507
01:24:58,069 --> 01:25:08,689
you can bake those in there if you want

1508
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:17,690
to and so at the end when you when you

1509
01:25:08,689 --> 01:25:19,009
go to import these I suppose when we

1510
01:25:17,689 --> 01:25:27,549
dump

1511
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:27,550
we should also print those out so

1512
01:25:33,559 --> 01:25:40,739
this is a little bit harder because if

1513
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:42,989
we go to print out the Airstream we kind

1514
01:25:40,738 --> 01:25:44,879
of need to reformat the Airstream at

1515
01:25:42,988 --> 01:25:47,488
least a little bit if it has lots of

1516
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:56,208
lines in it in order to like not mess up

1517
01:25:47,488 --> 01:25:56,208
our output here so this is like

1518
01:26:02,359 --> 01:26:09,779
somewhere we kinda have to take that a

1519
01:26:05,429 --> 01:26:15,719
little more seriously than we were now

1520
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:18,050
we could I mean we could I guess just do

1521
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:18,050
it like this

1522
01:26:21,649 --> 01:26:25,219
print out the header

1523
01:26:31,789 --> 01:26:36,409
and then we would have to essentially do

1524
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:41,810
like a four loop here where we loop over

1525
01:26:36,409 --> 01:26:53,710
and try to get that data out I in some

1526
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:53,710
way and so we would say something like

1527
01:26:59,619 --> 01:27:06,319
something like what's the say ummm so we

1528
01:27:04,069 --> 01:27:13,340
would say something like count left

1529
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:15,409
equals you know whatever the whatever

1530
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:18,350
the amount is we start with and then we

1531
01:27:15,409 --> 01:27:22,639
would just say looking while we've got

1532
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:28,000
that remaining or I suppose another way

1533
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:33,140
to do it would be this way start at zero

1534
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:38,930
and just go till you find something so

1535
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:42,650
you could say while it's left while it's

1536
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:44,659
you know has not exceeded that size and

1537
01:27:42,649 --> 01:27:53,719
then I could say well you know for each

1538
01:27:44,659 --> 01:28:00,800
of these things in here if it equals if

1539
01:27:53,720 --> 01:28:07,760
it equals the line and character then

1540
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:12,789
we'll print a line in the other thing I

1541
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:12,789
could do is say if

1542
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:20,370
yeah like if it is also the ending

1543
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:34,220
then print that - yeah let's do it

1544
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:38,179
so in here if I go ahead and say I'm

1545
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:44,600
starting at zero I need to know where

1546
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:47,450
the like I need to know where the start

1547
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:49,670
of what I would print would be so the

1548
01:28:47,449 --> 01:28:55,939
first thing is gonna be you know the

1549
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:59,449
first thing there right so I'm gonna

1550
01:28:55,939 --> 01:29:01,519
start with this index and I'm gonna you

1551
01:28:59,449 --> 01:29:03,649
know consider it going here and we got

1552
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:07,480
to do smaller than 64 bit here even

1553
01:29:03,649 --> 01:29:07,479
though these are strings at some level

1554
01:29:07,659 --> 01:29:12,109
all right so what I want to do is say

1555
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:16,520
let's start with the data in question

1556
01:29:12,109 --> 01:29:21,039
we're going to advance along it until we

1557
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:26,030
see ourselves hit the end of it when we

1558
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:27,800
look at each individual piece we're

1559
01:29:26,029 --> 01:29:30,590
going to look to see if we've hit an end

1560
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:38,619
of line and if we have then we'll print

1561
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:42,020
from the base through to the current

1562
01:29:38,619 --> 01:29:45,529
location right and I guess you know what

1563
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:48,470
I could do it like this might be a

1564
01:29:45,529 --> 01:29:55,789
little bit better right so what we're

1565
01:29:48,470 --> 01:30:03,289
gonna say here is take whatever if you

1566
01:29:55,789 --> 01:30:05,779
do it this way so we know we want to

1567
01:30:03,289 --> 01:30:08,000
print out wherever we are - wherever

1568
01:30:05,779 --> 01:30:12,590
we're starting and we know that we need

1569
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,659
to go from the base every time we print

1570
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:16,489
so that's how we would print out one

1571
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:19,849
segment and then what we would say is

1572
01:30:16,489 --> 01:30:23,329
okay from then on we are going to want

1573
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:25,300
to go one forward right another way to

1574
01:30:23,329 --> 01:30:32,630
do that would be to look at it like this

1575
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:34,850
right and so yeah not super confusing

1576
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:37,579
seems reasonable so you say look look if

1577
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:39,380
it's an end of line we print it and then

1578
01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:42,260
we skip the end of line character

1579
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:47,300
like we don't print that particular

1580
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:50,389
character otherwise we just keep going

1581
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:52,909
forward and so the only problem with

1582
01:30:50,389 --> 01:30:54,260
this is we really need to be able to

1583
01:30:52,908 --> 01:30:56,779
print we want to be able to do this

1584
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:58,579
print out on the last one as well so we

1585
01:30:56,779 --> 01:31:09,649
want to be able to say look if it was

1586
01:30:58,579 --> 01:31:19,609
one we also need this end criteria in

1587
01:31:09,649 --> 01:31:23,988
addition so if it's the last thing or if

1588
01:31:19,609 --> 01:31:28,029
it was a backslash n then we need to do

1589
01:31:23,988 --> 01:31:31,279
the print and we're done

1590
01:31:28,029 --> 01:31:34,969
when it is the last one we have a little

1591
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:37,340
bit of an issue because we want to be

1592
01:31:34,969 --> 01:31:40,850
able to print the final character in the

1593
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:45,679
case where it wasn't a backslash n so I

1594
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:57,350
think what we want to say there is this

1595
01:31:45,679 --> 01:32:00,889
plus plus at can happen early so we can

1596
01:31:57,350 --> 01:32:02,980
say look go one more than you were but

1597
01:32:00,889 --> 01:32:11,859
you know print one additional character

1598
01:32:02,979 --> 01:32:11,859
if it is a backslash n

1599
01:32:13,418 --> 01:32:19,179
I think that would do it for us we'd

1600
01:32:15,998 --> 01:32:21,309
have to look and see at the moment it

1601
01:32:19,179 --> 01:32:26,529
will do nothing because there are no

1602
01:32:21,309 --> 01:32:32,979
errors in our HHA files so if I do you

1603
01:32:26,529 --> 01:32:41,708
know a dump of one of these things let

1604
01:32:32,979 --> 01:32:46,899
me do local and then I look at the tab

1605
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:49,479
view of it so I shouldn't see any of

1606
01:32:46,899 --> 01:32:52,659
those because we don't save any error

1607
01:32:49,479 --> 01:32:56,260
streams to disk right so you can see it

1608
01:32:52,658 --> 01:33:01,648
doesn't really say anything and so what

1609
01:32:56,260 --> 01:33:05,079
I'd like to do is go ahead and see about

1610
01:33:01,649 --> 01:33:08,439
actually putting something in there so

1611
01:33:05,078 --> 01:33:21,069
inside the asset system when we actually

1612
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:22,209
import one of these things let me see so

1613
01:33:21,069 --> 01:33:25,478
when we actually import one of the

1614
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:28,688
things we have this Airstream thing

1615
01:33:25,479 --> 01:33:33,280
there and the errors are currently

1616
01:33:28,689 --> 01:33:40,079
stored not really on the actual files

1617
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:40,078
themselves right so

1618
01:33:45,408 --> 01:33:50,759
when we like the one thing that's a

1619
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:52,590
little bit mismatched II here is just

1620
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:54,840
that we have the concept that errors

1621
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:58,078
just happen on the import we don't

1622
01:33:54,840 --> 01:34:03,179
really know which asked to which assets

1623
01:33:58,078 --> 01:34:07,049
they would correspond right and so like

1624
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:10,289
in here for example you've got errors

1625
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:13,139
that apply to the whole file and you've

1626
01:34:10,289 --> 01:34:16,078
got errors that only apply to a

1627
01:34:13,139 --> 01:34:18,029
particular asset and we don't really

1628
01:34:16,078 --> 01:34:22,408
have a way of differentiating between

1629
01:34:18,029 --> 01:34:27,000
those two things specifically which we

1630
01:34:22,408 --> 01:34:29,908
would like to do right so in one in in

1631
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,760
the plate and single tile export cases

1632
01:34:29,908 --> 01:34:37,679
the errors can all just go to the same

1633
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:49,530
place and it's totally fine but in the

1634
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:53,059
other cases we can't do that you know so

1635
01:34:49,529 --> 01:34:53,059
I'm not sure how we want to report that

1636
01:34:54,469 --> 01:35:03,840
because we really have to we really have

1637
01:34:59,969 --> 01:35:08,929
two places errors in that case like need

1638
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,929
to go right

1639
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:17,829
so I think what I would want to do there

1640
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:17,830
say well you know let's

1641
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:42,979
let's just say that like all of these

1642
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,980
kind of errors right

1643
01:35:59,649 --> 01:36:06,408
in some sense you just want any asset

1644
01:36:03,288 --> 01:36:08,599
that was part of that import to have any

1645
01:36:06,408 --> 01:36:11,238
file errors attached to it so you know

1646
01:36:08,599 --> 01:36:15,110
that it's wrong it should be fixed

1647
01:36:11,238 --> 01:36:17,629
eventually but the only problem with

1648
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:18,859
that is there are some errors that there

1649
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:21,828
are some situations that produce

1650
01:36:18,859 --> 01:36:23,839
literally no assets so for example if

1651
01:36:21,828 --> 01:36:27,969
you end up in a situation where the

1652
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:30,769
thing can't parse the file name at all

1653
01:36:27,969 --> 01:36:33,230
then you don't really have a place to

1654
01:36:30,769 --> 01:36:35,210
put those error messages other than to

1655
01:36:33,229 --> 01:36:36,618
display them at the time because there's

1656
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:38,599
no other place to put them right you

1657
01:36:36,618 --> 01:36:41,238
have to display them on import like just

1658
01:36:38,599 --> 01:36:43,038
on the screen or something because

1659
01:36:41,238 --> 01:36:44,779
there's no way to actually capture the

1660
01:36:43,038 --> 01:36:46,550
fact that that error happened you can't

1661
01:36:44,779 --> 01:36:48,170
just bolt it onto the file somehow

1662
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:54,260
because that's not actually sufficient

1663
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:59,420
right so I guess what I would say is you

1664
01:36:54,260 --> 01:37:00,829
know in the case where we do it here we

1665
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:07,309
know that the asset source files

1666
01:37:00,828 --> 01:37:09,319
Airstream is being built up and when we

1667
01:37:07,309 --> 01:37:11,840
actually go to write the image the HHA

1668
01:37:09,319 --> 01:37:14,750
it's pretty easy to just bolt that on

1669
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,969
there but we probably need when we do

1670
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:19,010
this we probably need to have another

1671
01:37:16,969 --> 01:37:23,149
source of errors in addition to the file

1672
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:27,949
errors that we print I guess that's what

1673
01:37:23,149 --> 01:37:32,479
I'd say um so in here when we go to the

1674
01:37:27,948 --> 01:37:35,299
the stream stuff what I want to be able

1675
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:38,658
to do here is you know this thing

1676
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:41,659
creates these stream chunks right and

1677
01:37:38,658 --> 01:37:44,089
Scott like here's all the stuff that we

1678
01:37:41,658 --> 01:37:48,109
put in there so we want to be able to do

1679
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:50,150
is I want to be able to do a one of

1680
01:37:48,109 --> 01:37:53,719
these like write a set string calls

1681
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:57,679
basically but I want to be able to merge

1682
01:37:53,719 --> 01:38:03,908
that data in so what I want to do is is

1683
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:07,340
sort of have a write asset stream almost

1684
01:38:03,908 --> 01:38:10,839
ensue yeah like if we look at what

1685
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:10,840
happens inside write a set string

1686
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:17,779
you can see what goes on so I need to be

1687
01:38:15,859 --> 01:38:20,448
able to do a reserve data for the entire

1688
01:38:17,779 --> 01:38:22,250
size of the Airstream

1689
01:38:20,448 --> 01:38:24,828
and then I need to be able to actually

1690
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:28,789
write the asset data that is the stream

1691
01:38:24,828 --> 01:38:35,229
in question right and so what I want to

1692
01:38:28,789 --> 01:38:35,229
do here is say that the that this is

1693
01:38:39,189 --> 01:38:48,109
going to be equal to whatever the total

1694
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:50,030
size is of both streams right now one of

1695
01:38:48,109 --> 01:38:51,889
those streams is fictitious because I

1696
01:38:50,029 --> 01:38:54,889
don't have it yet but I know that I'm

1697
01:38:51,889 --> 01:38:58,460
gonna have it right so I'll just make a

1698
01:38:54,889 --> 01:39:01,819
dummy here and that dummy stream will

1699
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:04,868
have nothing right ensue

1700
01:39:01,819 --> 01:39:07,939
you know we'll call this the asset

1701
01:39:04,868 --> 01:39:11,929
specific stream or whatever like asset

1702
01:39:07,939 --> 01:39:13,309
specific errors or something right so

1703
01:39:11,929 --> 01:39:17,060
there's like asset errors and file

1704
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:21,349
errors something like that so if I type

1705
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:25,760
the asset errors in here so that I can

1706
01:39:21,349 --> 01:39:27,619
say tell me how big this actually is and

1707
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:31,310
then I also know that I've got the file

1708
01:39:27,618 --> 01:39:34,009
errors themselves right so because

1709
01:39:31,310 --> 01:39:36,530
that's another stream I can see how big

1710
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:39,260
is the total set of errors and it'll

1711
01:39:36,529 --> 01:39:44,618
just give me that and then that's good

1712
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:44,619
then I can reserve that amount of space

1713
01:39:46,359 --> 01:39:52,519
so that I say our error stream counts

1714
01:39:49,908 --> 01:39:54,888
so the error stream offset is gonna be

1715
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:59,530
reserved however much space I just said

1716
01:39:54,889 --> 01:39:59,529
that I actually needed right

1717
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:16,460
and then I just need to write into it so

1718
01:40:09,029 --> 01:40:19,349
then I just need to like copy stream I

1719
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:22,619
don't know how you want to it's it's

1720
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:28,200
really a it's really a four I loop over

1721
01:40:22,619 --> 01:40:28,829
the stream here so that's that's how

1722
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:31,199
that would work

1723
01:40:28,829 --> 01:40:33,510
so if I want to loop over a particular

1724
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:35,869
stream I need a utility here that would

1725
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:38,760
do that for me right but I know

1726
01:40:35,869 --> 01:40:41,849
otherwise exactly what's going on right

1727
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:45,630
I know that this is the offset at which

1728
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:50,940
you would start writing and furthermore

1729
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:55,650
I know that the the stream is the file

1730
01:40:50,939 --> 01:40:57,119
era stream just the first one and I

1731
01:40:55,649 --> 01:41:01,309
probably need to think here too that's

1732
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:04,680
the that's the size in question for

1733
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:10,080
whatever this air stream is here so I

1734
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:13,650
need to know the file error stream size

1735
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:21,149
so right here where I get those two

1736
01:41:13,649 --> 01:41:23,279
things I know that I need to reserve

1737
01:41:21,149 --> 01:41:27,299
space for both streams that I'm going to

1738
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:29,069
do so that's what I do but then I when I

1739
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:34,320
go to write them I know that I need to

1740
01:41:29,069 --> 01:41:37,738
write both streams like so and I write

1741
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:39,389
one at the offset that is how far how

1742
01:41:37,738 --> 01:41:43,319
much space the other one would have

1743
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:46,500
already taken up right and so that's

1744
01:41:43,319 --> 01:41:48,889
where the the asset specific stream

1745
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,890
would go

1746
01:41:52,600 --> 01:42:00,470
so this would do that writing in terms

1747
01:41:56,119 --> 01:42:02,630
of the the right size I don't know if

1748
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:04,909
this thing ever has a way of finding out

1749
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:09,199
how big the entire thing is it doesn't

1750
01:42:04,909 --> 01:42:12,529
look like it to me so I think we would

1751
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:13,880
need both of those functions so one of

1752
01:42:12,529 --> 01:42:17,389
them's general-purpose is one of them is

1753
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:28,690
not so the right stream part is not

1754
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:33,070
right what's this called right string

1755
01:42:28,689 --> 01:42:37,039
where's where is that function

1756
01:42:33,069 --> 01:42:40,340
that's right asset data so I call this

1757
01:42:37,039 --> 01:42:43,760
right asset stream and I just need to

1758
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:47,690
call this like multiple times right so I

1759
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:50,510
need here's my file and I need my

1760
01:42:47,689 --> 01:42:56,149
starting data offset and then I need

1761
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:57,350
whatever the actual stream is and then

1762
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:59,029
it's pretty straightforward right I'm

1763
01:42:57,350 --> 01:43:02,000
just looping over these chunks so I'm

1764
01:42:59,029 --> 01:43:09,019
basically saying like all right so

1765
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:11,239
whatever the first chunk is I'm gonna go

1766
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:15,260
through and I'm just gonna write to the

1767
01:43:11,239 --> 01:43:19,550
file each individual trunk and each time

1768
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:28,030
I'll just move forward by however big

1769
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:28,029
the chunk actually is and that's it

1770
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:41,549
and that should just write it and we

1771
01:43:38,819 --> 01:43:45,090
need to cast it down because it's gonna

1772
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:47,159
be too big right so this these are going

1773
01:43:45,090 --> 01:43:48,719
to be larger than we would have lab but

1774
01:43:47,159 --> 01:43:50,880
we know that we're never doing buffers

1775
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:52,560
that big in this particular context so

1776
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:54,090
that's okay I think although actually

1777
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,870
this in this case we're actually fine

1778
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:57,029
with that because we're actually

1779
01:43:54,869 --> 01:43:58,529
tracking it's this good position so well

1780
01:43:57,029 --> 01:44:00,059
we would have to truncate the right we

1781
01:43:58,529 --> 01:44:01,590
could actually continue to move the

1782
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:02,969
pointer correctly which is interesting

1783
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:06,060
in and of itself I suppose

1784
01:44:02,969 --> 01:44:07,859
um so writing the asset streams pretty

1785
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:09,900
easy and similarly getting the total

1786
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:11,549
size is also really easy right because

1787
01:44:09,899 --> 01:44:12,839
again all it is is a loop over the

1788
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:15,810
string to see how much space there

1789
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:17,369
actually is so all you really need to do

1790
01:44:15,810 --> 01:44:19,500
is say look how big is this stream you

1791
01:44:17,369 --> 01:44:21,090
would say well the stream is however big

1792
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:24,479
all the chunks are if we add them

1793
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:28,500
together right so that's it I mean it's

1794
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:30,599
a stupid function barely even exists and

1795
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:33,840
it's just a case of of having to do a

1796
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:35,070
loop over all the chunks which may not

1797
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,329
be the most efficient thing in the world

1798
01:44:35,069 --> 01:44:38,039
but it's totally fine in our case

1799
01:44:36,329 --> 01:44:42,090
because this is only for asset importing

1800
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:44,250
we don't really care about that so if we

1801
01:44:42,090 --> 01:44:46,789
asked for get total size here in

1802
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:49,890
handmade stream let me just go ahead and

1803
01:44:46,789 --> 01:44:51,840
get total size of the stream we should

1804
01:44:49,890 --> 01:44:54,690
now be able to ask for what the total

1805
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:59,550
size stream is and get it we should also

1806
01:44:54,689 --> 01:45:02,250
be able to produce the right stuff here

1807
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:05,570
I again have that you know the problem

1808
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:08,039
of not actually we don't actually handle

1809
01:45:05,569 --> 01:45:12,569
64 bits worth of space on any of these

1810
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:18,329
things that's intentional so anyway when

1811
01:45:12,569 --> 01:45:22,049
we actually do the the asset data

1812
01:45:18,329 --> 01:45:24,510
reserves I don't really remember how

1813
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:25,409
that function works so I want to make

1814
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:28,320
sure I'm passing the right parameters

1815
01:45:25,409 --> 01:45:34,800
there just take a quick look so we need

1816
01:45:28,319 --> 01:45:36,090
assets asset file asset data size that's

1817
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:39,420
isn't that correct

1818
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:41,440
assets so that's that's its source file

1819
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:46,480
so we actually need the asset

1820
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:52,029
to file in this case so that's a little

1821
01:45:46,479 --> 01:46:01,000
bit different so we actually need to do

1822
01:45:52,029 --> 01:46:03,550
that and this is right asset stream so

1823
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,529
in theory now when we do an import it

1824
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:14,409
should actually put those airs into the

1825
01:46:05,529 --> 01:46:16,448
file now at least in theory we'll see we

1826
01:46:14,409 --> 01:46:18,369
can test it because right now there is

1827
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:20,259
some stuff spewed to that stream for no

1828
01:46:18,369 --> 01:46:23,319
reason like we stuck this in there just

1829
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:25,840
to see I think if anything happened so I

1830
01:46:23,319 --> 01:46:28,479
can force a rien port and see what

1831
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:32,980
happens right if I delete the local HHA

1832
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:39,369
it will rebuild oh sorry I have to

1833
01:46:32,979 --> 01:46:41,259
actually make one so if I tell it hey do

1834
01:46:39,369 --> 01:46:42,670
some reading it should do the reading

1835
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:44,860
and in theory now it should dump the

1836
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:48,489
errors out to each individual assets so

1837
01:46:44,859 --> 01:46:52,000
any asset that's in there we'll get a

1838
01:46:48,488 --> 01:46:59,289
error stream and in theory if I dump the

1839
01:46:52,000 --> 01:47:05,198
air stream I should see that now

1840
01:46:59,289 --> 01:47:07,180
maybe we hope right that doesn't look

1841
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:08,769
like our printouts working so it looks

1842
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:10,539
like we actually sort of did do that

1843
01:47:08,770 --> 01:47:13,030
correctly but a printout doesn't look

1844
01:47:10,539 --> 01:47:14,769
like it's working properly so maybe I

1845
01:47:13,029 --> 01:47:16,679
just screwed up that lip-lip because I

1846
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:25,060
kind of threw that in there it wasn't

1847
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:28,300
particularly bright so that makes it

1848
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:30,430
pretty obvious obviously we don't want

1849
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:33,520
those two things to both be true we need

1850
01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:35,909
only one of them to be true let's try

1851
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,910
that one more time

1852
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:50,220
so we're almost right still a little bit

1853
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:51,750
busted but this is great because now you

1854
01:47:50,220 --> 01:48:01,230
can see what the errors are in a file

1855
01:47:51,750 --> 01:48:04,369
per per thing and I like that the this

1856
01:48:01,229 --> 01:48:04,369
looks like it's skipping

1857
01:48:14,319 --> 01:48:17,849
but I'm not sure why

1858
01:48:24,198 --> 01:48:33,519
Oh because now we're doing that

1859
01:48:30,979 --> 01:48:33,519
pre-increment

1860
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:40,100
and I see yeah it's the other way around

1861
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:42,320
this isn't not equal to right we're

1862
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:43,940
supposed to do the pre-increment only in

1863
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:47,119
the case where it's actually the final

1864
01:48:43,939 --> 01:48:50,479
character that's actually what we were

1865
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:52,550
supposed to do there so yeah so that was

1866
01:48:50,479 --> 01:48:54,589
just a little bit busted so I think

1867
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:57,020
we're good now the only thing is we we

1868
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:59,810
need the backslash ends to be in the

1869
01:48:57,020 --> 01:49:01,310
actual file in the actual air as you can

1870
01:48:59,810 --> 01:49:04,250
see that our errors don't have backs SMS

1871
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:06,500
on them which is not good so we need to

1872
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:13,100
fix that but otherwise it looks like

1873
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:15,260
we're in good shape now right and so one

1874
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:18,620
more check we might want to do in here

1875
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:21,440
if we find that there wasn't any actual

1876
01:49:18,619 --> 01:49:23,420
thing to print right

1877
01:49:21,439 --> 01:49:26,349
so if essentially what we're saying here

1878
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:31,819
is like okay we got to the last

1879
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:35,870
character but there wasn't anything to

1880
01:49:31,819 --> 01:49:38,420
print so if base is not equal to at but

1881
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:40,309
we don't want to include an extra empty

1882
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:42,550
line for no reason I guess it's all I'm

1883
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:42,550
saying

1884
01:49:54,390 --> 01:50:00,490
so something more like that not the

1885
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:07,470
prettiest loop in the world I'll give

1886
01:50:00,489 --> 01:50:07,469
you that um so now are we better off

1887
01:50:23,029 --> 01:50:28,130
so I'm going to use four as an example

1888
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:32,060
and now I'm just gonna go in and fix

1889
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:34,819
some of our errors here inside the asset

1890
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:37,010
streaming stuff so I'm just gonna look

1891
01:50:34,819 --> 01:50:39,439
at all of our out FS and see which ones

1892
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:43,760
should have had like things at the end

1893
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:45,919
of them right so I may think quick spin

1894
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:49,060
through and just look at like out F yeah

1895
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:49,060
that should be it one there

1896
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:23,569
so that looks pretty good and so if we

1897
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:25,100
just get rid of the re-imported thing

1898
01:51:23,569 --> 01:51:27,649
because that doesn't really tell us any

1899
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:29,360
information is not an error then what we

1900
01:51:27,649 --> 01:51:31,699
should be able to do is now see like

1901
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:33,859
when we've actually got errors we should

1902
01:51:31,699 --> 01:51:36,529
be able to see them only on files that

1903
01:51:33,859 --> 01:51:40,359
actually had something go wrong and so

1904
01:51:36,529 --> 01:51:44,149
if I delete local daily HHA now and

1905
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:46,369
create a dummy one it'll force the

1906
01:51:44,149 --> 01:51:48,319
re-export and now it should export our

1907
01:51:46,369 --> 01:51:50,720
errors correctly and we should be able

1908
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:56,029
to see those errors nice and clean with

1909
01:51:50,720 --> 01:52:04,070
no no fussing so if I go ahead and and

1910
01:51:56,029 --> 01:52:06,500
re dump that file like so we can now see

1911
01:52:04,069 --> 01:52:09,109
probably errors where they exist right

1912
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:12,800
so now we see like tile errors that had

1913
01:52:09,109 --> 01:52:15,589
to had stuff happen to them or whatever

1914
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:19,909
and we know ones that don't it didn't

1915
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:21,350
have that right so that's pretty good

1916
01:52:19,909 --> 01:52:23,389
and we can make a thing that just dumps

1917
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:25,490
the HHA only the air is neat to say to

1918
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:27,470
but I'm gonna leave it at that and then

1919
01:52:25,489 --> 01:52:29,149
what I want to be able to do now next

1920
01:52:27,470 --> 01:52:30,440
weekend what I'll do is I'm gonna make

1921
01:52:29,149 --> 01:52:34,039
it so I can pick an entity and show

1922
01:52:30,439 --> 01:52:35,329
those errors on like live and then we'll

1923
01:52:34,039 --> 01:52:37,250
make something that loves to edit the

1924
01:52:35,329 --> 01:52:39,800
points I think that's basically where I

1925
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:44,750
want to be at so let's go to brief Q&amp;A

1926
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:47,079
here just for a few minutes five minutes

1927
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:47,079
or so

1928
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:16,109
is it possible to account for sprite

1929
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:17,698
opacity when selecting items physician

1930
01:53:16,109 --> 01:53:20,189
to be more intuitive is it useful

1931
01:53:17,698 --> 01:53:25,198
generate a more slim triangulation for

1932
01:53:20,189 --> 01:53:27,719
sprites but both of the answers is yes

1933
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:30,809
so if you want to account for sprite

1934
01:53:27,719 --> 01:53:35,630
opacity you certainly can what you have

1935
01:53:30,810 --> 01:53:39,690
to do is when you actually pick a point

1936
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:41,130
inside the box you have to then figure

1937
01:53:39,689 --> 01:53:42,928
out what texture would be on that face

1938
01:53:41,130 --> 01:53:44,690
and which face you're on and then you

1939
01:53:42,929 --> 01:53:47,639
have to go and look up into the bitmap

1940
01:53:44,689 --> 01:53:49,888
the way we're doing it right now you

1941
01:53:47,639 --> 01:53:53,400
really wouldn't want to do that because

1942
01:53:49,889 --> 01:53:55,109
we're making fake boxes because we're

1943
01:53:53,399 --> 01:53:58,439
we're actually wanted we all want to be

1944
01:53:55,109 --> 01:53:59,759
able to pick sprites like from a debug

1945
01:53:58,439 --> 01:54:02,219
view where they're not even facing the

1946
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,449
camera so you really wouldn't want to do

1947
01:54:02,219 --> 01:54:05,730
that you want to just pretend there's a

1948
01:54:03,448 --> 01:54:07,529
selection nub and you can just draw the

1949
01:54:05,729 --> 01:54:09,629
selection nub if you it's too hard to

1950
01:54:07,529 --> 01:54:11,698
hit for a sprite and you want just pick

1951
01:54:09,630 --> 01:54:16,289
that like a handle because otherwise

1952
01:54:11,698 --> 01:54:18,658
it's gonna be totally random if you were

1953
01:54:16,289 --> 01:54:19,829
always picking sprites head-on then it

1954
01:54:18,658 --> 01:54:22,198
makes a lot more sense to look at the

1955
01:54:19,829 --> 01:54:23,908
opacity because then you could just say

1956
01:54:22,198 --> 01:54:28,829
well I'm just picking pixel based and

1957
01:54:23,908 --> 01:54:31,319
off you go so you know as for generating

1958
01:54:28,829 --> 01:54:34,529
slimmer triangulations for sprites uh it

1959
01:54:31,319 --> 01:54:36,809
does help if you want to minimize over

1960
01:54:34,529 --> 01:54:39,300
draw and you have your sprites have a

1961
01:54:36,810 --> 01:54:42,000
lot of empty space in them yes it can be

1962
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:43,529
very handy because it prevents the

1963
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,319
graphics card from having to iterate

1964
01:54:43,529 --> 01:54:48,000
over and do simple tests and like haze

1965
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:50,279
or any alpha and this block of texture

1966
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,840
no okay skip it but it doesn't have to

1967
01:54:50,279 --> 01:54:53,009
do that check if you just never iterate

1968
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:56,429
over the first place so there's usually

1969
01:54:53,010 --> 01:54:58,500
a sweet spot too much triangulation can

1970
01:54:56,429 --> 01:55:00,239
be bad because then you're forcing too

1971
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:02,340
much stuff through the vertex pipe for

1972
01:55:00,238 --> 01:55:03,359
no real benefit but two little triangle

1973
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:04,949
a she could also be bad so we're

1974
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:06,960
probably a little under triangulated by

1975
01:55:04,948 --> 01:55:08,879
doing quads that's probably not enough

1976
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:10,859
triangulation you could probably add a

1977
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:12,690
little more triangulation and get some

1978
01:55:10,859 --> 01:55:15,809
speed winds but you can't go too far you

1979
01:55:12,689 --> 01:55:16,559
have to you know pick a happy medium

1980
01:55:15,810 --> 01:55:17,730
because if you put too much

1981
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,530
triangulation then you're actually just

1982
01:55:17,729 --> 01:55:21,059
slowing things down by forcing the

1983
01:55:19,529 --> 01:55:22,649
graphics card to iterate over a lot more

1984
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:24,510
triangles and a lot more fractional

1985
01:55:22,649 --> 01:55:36,809
pixels and stuff and that's

1986
01:55:24,510 --> 01:55:37,980
not good either instead of fussing with

1987
01:55:36,810 --> 01:55:39,539
selecting the individual sprite parts

1988
01:55:37,979 --> 01:55:40,439
wouldn't be handier to list them in a

1989
01:55:39,539 --> 01:55:41,789
picked entity hood

1990
01:55:40,439 --> 01:55:43,710
yeah and that's sort of what I was

1991
01:55:41,789 --> 01:55:45,180
saying like just have a hot key that

1992
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:48,449
allows me to walk through the parts

1993
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:51,480
quickly and then I just don't care about

1994
01:55:48,449 --> 01:55:53,069
picking them exactly is the count

1995
01:55:51,479 --> 01:55:54,779
inclusive with strings in the words do

1996
01:55:53,069 --> 01:56:00,809
you really need the nested ifs in the

1997
01:55:54,779 --> 01:56:02,219
line printer.i yes it is well I don't

1998
01:56:00,810 --> 01:56:08,940
know what you mean by inclusive

1999
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:10,770
inclusive of what it's in a lot of time

2000
01:56:08,939 --> 01:56:12,539
operas the hash function but is it worth

2001
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:14,010
it most of time you calculate hashes

2002
01:56:12,539 --> 01:56:16,229
when doing IO which will always be

2003
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:17,400
significantly slower so you'll save more

2004
01:56:16,229 --> 01:56:20,879
time if you calculate the hash in

2005
01:56:17,399 --> 01:56:22,649
parallel with IO this way now Hassen sh8

2006
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:24,480
512 would have the same impact on run

2007
01:56:22,649 --> 01:56:29,789
time straighten me out hash being eight

2008
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:40,139
times faster so I guess what I would say

2009
01:56:29,789 --> 01:56:43,019
there is so definitely not suggesting

2010
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:45,390
that IO is the primary bound for hashing

2011
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:48,780
doesn't really make any sense

2012
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:53,640
io in my experience literally is never

2013
01:56:48,779 --> 01:56:58,139
the IO is almost never the problem ever

2014
01:56:53,640 --> 01:57:00,270
with hashing I can't think of a time

2015
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:02,750
when I've ever been i/o bound when I was

2016
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:06,990
using a hash it's just not a use case

2017
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:09,420
that I can even think of actually and

2018
01:57:06,989 --> 01:57:13,130
the reason is because in game

2019
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:18,239
development that's not what you're doing

2020
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:20,609
you are in put bound on beginning your

2021
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:27,479
data processing so when you have to load

2022
01:57:20,609 --> 01:57:29,729
say a PNG right or a PSD file which is

2023
01:57:27,479 --> 01:57:31,949
like typical like a 1935 let's say we

2024
01:57:29,729 --> 01:57:33,209
load a PSD file and that PSD files like

2025
01:57:31,949 --> 01:57:35,909
a hundred and sixty megabytes or

2026
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:39,480
something let's say so we are in put

2027
01:57:35,909 --> 01:57:42,539
bound looting in the PSD because we got

2028
01:57:39,479 --> 01:57:44,879
a weight to get 160 megabytes right so

2029
01:57:42,539 --> 01:57:47,618
the best we can do is be processing some

2030
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:52,689
other file while we're loading that file

2031
01:57:47,618 --> 01:57:53,948
so that is a given but once you start

2032
01:57:52,689 --> 01:57:55,209
pressing and you look at the total

2033
01:57:53,948 --> 01:57:56,529
amount of time it's going to take you to

2034
01:57:55,208 --> 01:57:58,389
process the file if you've got it in

2035
01:57:56,529 --> 01:57:59,618
memory and turnaround time is critically

2036
01:57:58,389 --> 01:58:00,969
important here remember like if an

2037
01:57:59,618 --> 01:58:02,558
artist wants to see an update to

2038
01:58:00,969 --> 01:58:03,519
something you need the credit that you

2039
01:58:02,559 --> 01:58:04,029
want the turnaround time to be as small

2040
01:58:03,519 --> 01:58:07,719
as possible

2041
01:58:04,029 --> 01:58:10,509
so once you've got the PSD in memory now

2042
01:58:07,719 --> 01:58:14,319
what you're doing is you're blowing out

2043
01:58:10,510 --> 01:58:16,300
those layers to individual tiles or

2044
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:18,698
chunks or hovering across them you need

2045
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:20,590
to hash each individual chunk and then

2046
01:58:18,698 --> 01:58:23,708
you need to check to see whether that

2047
01:58:20,590 --> 01:58:25,809
chunk is already a chunk that you've

2048
01:58:23,708 --> 01:58:28,479
worked with before so you're gonna look

2049
01:58:25,809 --> 01:58:31,809
to a memory resident hash table for a

2050
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:34,539
collision right and that hash table

2051
01:58:31,809 --> 01:58:36,309
ain't gonna be that big right so the

2052
01:58:34,538 --> 01:58:39,728
number of cache misses in walking the

2053
01:58:36,309 --> 01:58:41,050
hash table isn't massive it's way less

2054
01:58:39,729 --> 01:58:43,659
than the size of the thing that you're

2055
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:45,219
hashing so not only is the thing that

2056
01:58:43,658 --> 01:58:48,009
you're hashing in cache and it's

2057
01:58:45,219 --> 01:58:51,399
probably about 64 K or 32 K or something

2058
01:58:48,010 --> 01:58:52,869
like that not only is that Orion memory

2059
01:58:51,399 --> 01:58:55,090
so you're hitting the cache the entire

2060
01:58:52,868 --> 01:58:56,558
time so you're not waiting at all when

2061
01:58:55,090 --> 01:59:01,569
you're running the hash because you just

2062
01:58:56,559 --> 01:59:04,329
produced the thing but you're also about

2063
01:59:01,569 --> 01:59:06,998
to not do anything on the back end so

2064
01:59:04,328 --> 01:59:08,799
you're using the hash to avoid having to

2065
01:59:06,998 --> 01:59:11,889
actually do any IO because it's probably

2066
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:13,389
a duplicate that is exactly the same as

2067
01:59:11,889 --> 01:59:15,489
the last time this thing was imported

2068
01:59:13,389 --> 01:59:21,179
but we don't know that it is yet because

2069
01:59:15,488 --> 01:59:25,029
we haven't looked right um so no like

2070
01:59:21,179 --> 01:59:27,489
literally IO time is not a bottleneck at

2071
01:59:25,029 --> 01:59:29,648
all in the part of the thing where the

2072
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:32,259
hash is being used the things that are

2073
01:59:29,649 --> 01:59:35,439
bottlenecks are usually LZ compression

2074
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:42,789
and hashing that's usually the

2075
01:59:35,439 --> 01:59:44,860
bottlenecks maybe sometimes bit entropy

2076
01:59:42,788 --> 01:59:48,238
encoding but not really compared to LZ

2077
01:59:44,859 --> 01:59:48,238
in my experience

2078
02:00:25,368 --> 02:00:30,210
I'm already be past the last character

2079
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:32,070
history oh I see what you're saying now

2080
02:00:30,210 --> 02:00:33,779
yeah you could be right maybe I can make

2081
02:00:32,069 --> 02:00:35,819
that simpler again the loop was it was

2082
02:00:33,779 --> 02:00:49,500
not particularly attractive loop I will

2083
02:00:35,819 --> 02:00:57,889
give you that so I guess what I'd say

2084
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:57,889
here is once at equals the count

2085
02:01:10,189 --> 02:01:22,909
I guess no I I can't see how you do it

2086
02:01:15,969 --> 02:01:24,469
simpler oh I see yeah yeah yeah so so

2087
02:01:22,908 --> 02:01:26,738
this actually is the part that we don't

2088
02:01:24,469 --> 02:01:26,739
need

2089
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:39,029
yeah I think you're right

2090
02:01:42,270 --> 02:01:53,040
good catch where's my tab you at

2091
02:02:07,729 --> 02:02:12,488
why might not seen any errors at all

2092
02:02:24,579 --> 02:02:27,579
up

2093
02:02:28,998 --> 02:02:39,569
so I'm looking at the wrong text there

2094
02:02:36,448 --> 02:02:40,678
we go yeah good catch yeah that's right

2095
02:02:39,569 --> 02:02:46,469
we didn't really actually have to do

2096
02:02:40,679 --> 02:03:00,239
that all right uh I think we're good for

2097
02:02:46,469 --> 02:03:03,599
now and yet like yeah that there's a lot

2098
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:05,398
of excuses about hashes that I don't

2099
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:07,590
super understand on that sort of level

2100
02:03:05,399 --> 02:03:08,939
that last topic a lot of people say like

2101
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:11,788
well it doesn't matter cuz it has

2102
02:03:08,939 --> 02:03:13,769
because it's gonna be memory bound or

2103
02:03:11,788 --> 02:03:16,889
this hashes memory bound anyway or

2104
02:03:13,769 --> 02:03:18,628
whatever almost no there's only like two

2105
02:03:16,889 --> 02:03:27,269
hashes I've ever profiled that are

2106
02:03:18,628 --> 02:03:30,208
memory bound really like almost every

2107
02:03:27,269 --> 02:03:32,760
hash is not memory bound at all like

2108
02:03:30,208 --> 02:03:34,438
they're not they're just not like they

2109
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:36,689
could be going faster than they are

2110
02:03:34,439 --> 02:03:40,050
they're not memory bound they most of

2111
02:03:36,689 --> 02:03:42,389
them hash it like four four bytes per

2112
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:44,609
cycle and could hash it eight bytes per

2113
02:03:42,389 --> 02:03:47,519
cycle or six bytes per cycle if they

2114
02:03:44,609 --> 02:03:50,340
remember bound so that's not usually

2115
02:03:47,519 --> 02:03:52,918
what it looks like to me and the other

2116
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:55,288
thing is IO bound but they're never i/o

2117
02:03:52,918 --> 02:03:58,918
bound like you have to be doing a very

2118
02:03:55,288 --> 02:04:01,858
weird specific case where you literally

2119
02:03:58,918 --> 02:04:05,550
just read and hash and that's the only

2120
02:04:01,859 --> 02:04:07,530
thing you do which is like disk

2121
02:04:05,550 --> 02:04:11,788
utilities or something like I don't know

2122
02:04:07,529 --> 02:04:14,429
what I don't know what case that is I

2123
02:04:11,788 --> 02:04:15,958
can't even think of what it is like I'm

2124
02:04:14,429 --> 02:04:17,699
sure there is one like I don't mean to

2125
02:04:15,958 --> 02:04:21,378
suggest there isn't a case where your

2126
02:04:17,698 --> 02:04:21,378
i/o bound or the hashing but it's just I

2127
02:04:21,529 --> 02:04:28,349
can't think of it I certainly never have

2128
02:04:24,179 --> 02:04:31,559
that case if there is something that's

2129
02:04:28,349 --> 02:04:33,689
that's slowing down things that that

2130
02:04:31,559 --> 02:04:37,050
makes the hash not relevant it's never

2131
02:04:33,689 --> 02:04:39,659
IO it's usually like some other heavy

2132
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:41,739
weight stream operation that's just much

2133
02:04:39,658 --> 02:04:43,538
slower than a hash like you know

2134
02:04:41,738 --> 02:04:44,738
if you wanted to optimal parse an IOC or

2135
02:04:43,538 --> 02:04:47,380
something and you're just like sitting

2136
02:04:44,738 --> 02:04:50,348
there cranking away with all these tests

2137
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:51,788
or something right like I mean there's

2138
02:04:50,349 --> 02:04:53,170
ways you can have stream processing to

2139
02:04:51,788 --> 02:04:57,069
be very slow and then it doesn't matter

2140
02:04:53,170 --> 02:05:00,429
but it's just it's not it's one of those

2141
02:04:57,069 --> 02:05:02,618
excuses that hashes are slow and you

2142
02:05:00,429 --> 02:05:05,800
know they do slow things down it's just

2143
02:05:02,618 --> 02:05:08,109
it's very hand wavy to say that like

2144
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:12,760
memory bandwidth is the issuer size it's

2145
02:05:08,109 --> 02:05:15,488
this not true so like I would much

2146
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:18,159
prefer meow hash always it's just it's

2147
02:05:15,488 --> 02:05:20,529
not strong enough to really use always

2148
02:05:18,158 --> 02:05:22,268
as your hash and the problem at the

2149
02:05:20,529 --> 02:05:24,429
moment is I just don't know how weak it

2150
02:05:22,269 --> 02:05:29,380
actually is in data collision practice

2151
02:05:24,429 --> 02:05:31,328
so you know I don't know I would love to

2152
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:33,130
just be able to use it always but I

2153
02:05:31,328 --> 02:05:35,529
don't know how strong it actually will

2154
02:05:33,130 --> 02:05:37,900
prove to be and so we would like to find

2155
02:05:35,529 --> 02:05:41,920
ways of potentially strengthening it to

2156
02:05:37,899 --> 02:05:43,538
be more cryptographic ish just because

2157
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:45,279
the closer you can move towards

2158
02:05:43,538 --> 02:05:46,569
cryptographic the more assured you're

2159
02:05:45,279 --> 02:05:47,979
gonna be that you don't have spurious

2160
02:05:46,569 --> 02:05:50,649
collisions when used in non

2161
02:05:47,979 --> 02:05:54,248
cryptographic cases and so that's really

2162
02:05:50,649 --> 02:05:56,439
you know the thing that's that's I would

2163
02:05:54,248 --> 02:05:58,748
like to figure out if there's any way to

2164
02:05:56,439 --> 02:06:06,009
do but I haven't really found a way to

2165
02:05:58,748 --> 02:06:08,979
get maximum throughput without with

2166
02:06:06,010 --> 02:06:11,579
anything that can strengthen I just

2167
02:06:08,979 --> 02:06:11,578
haven't figured it out

2168
02:06:13,908 --> 02:06:27,138
so at the moment it's gonna have to stay

2169
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:28,579
as a sort of like you know who knows one

2170
02:06:27,139 --> 02:06:35,359
in

2171
02:06:28,579 --> 02:06:37,729
you know a hundred billion case or

2172
02:06:35,359 --> 02:06:39,559
whatever like you know I don't know what

2173
02:06:37,729 --> 02:06:42,289
the actual practical collision rate is

2174
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:45,320
gonna be that one again also one of the

2175
02:06:42,289 --> 02:06:49,970
big problems that you always have with

2176
02:06:45,319 --> 02:06:52,279
with hashes is you're like hey what's

2177
02:06:49,970 --> 02:06:53,960
the collision rate what's the expected

2178
02:06:52,279 --> 02:06:57,109
random collision rate on this hash

2179
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:59,930
well you can't ever find it I mean if

2180
02:06:57,109 --> 02:07:04,309
it's sufficiently high but still not

2181
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:09,650
that high like you know how are you let

2182
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:14,600
let's say that meow hash was 40 bits or

2183
02:07:09,649 --> 02:07:21,019
something right you have to basically do

2184
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:27,079
a big data run to find those collisions

2185
02:07:21,020 --> 02:07:28,970
if if your hash is literally only like

2186
02:07:27,079 --> 02:07:31,640
if your hash is literally only 40 bits

2187
02:07:28,970 --> 02:07:34,579
meaning it's a 40-bit hash so your

2188
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:37,490
birthday rate is 20 bits no problem you

2189
02:07:34,579 --> 02:07:39,979
could find that immediately just by

2190
02:07:37,489 --> 02:07:43,880
testing right but if your hash has a

2191
02:07:39,979 --> 02:07:46,489
probability of random collision of forty

2192
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:51,800
four bits 42 bits you're never gonna

2193
02:07:46,489 --> 02:07:54,529
find it right and soup going forward

2194
02:07:51,800 --> 02:08:02,930
knowing what that Headroom is would be

2195
02:07:54,529 --> 02:08:06,469
really nice but you know finding it's

2196
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:08,150
really hard and especially in a case

2197
02:08:06,470 --> 02:08:10,490
like now hash where you know like okay

2198
02:08:08,149 --> 02:08:11,659
so it's gonna be this specific the kinds

2199
02:08:10,489 --> 02:08:14,619
of things that will collide are these

2200
02:08:11,659 --> 02:08:18,250
specific things that have to do with AES

2201
02:08:14,619 --> 02:08:21,949
one to thirty two expansions kind of

2202
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:22,689
collisions how often will those happen

2203
02:08:21,949 --> 02:08:25,729
in practice

2204
02:08:22,689 --> 02:08:28,429
nobody knows right like it you just

2205
02:08:25,729 --> 02:08:29,629
don't know so it's kind of annoying

2206
02:08:28,430 --> 02:08:30,950
that's why strengthening it a little

2207
02:08:29,630 --> 02:08:32,869
would be nice and we could find some way

2208
02:08:30,949 --> 02:08:35,689
to do it because then we don't have to

2209
02:08:32,869 --> 02:08:38,599
wonder about whether those things would

2210
02:08:35,689 --> 02:08:41,309
happen in practice cuz you know then

2211
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:43,680
that would be a problem with the hash

2212
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:45,660
right so it's really tough it's just

2213
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:47,520
it's hashes are nasty that way they're

2214
02:08:45,659 --> 02:08:49,019
really hard to know if it's a

2215
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:50,460
cryptographic hash it's much easier

2216
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:55,230
because then you just know if you found

2217
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:57,000
a hole then you can't use it right but

2218
02:08:55,229 --> 02:09:03,119
with a non cryptographic hash it's like

2219
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:05,520
I don't know I know this thing gets half

2220
02:09:03,119 --> 02:09:09,319
as fast if I wanted to make it stronger

2221
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:13,370
is that a good decision possibly not

2222
02:09:09,319 --> 02:09:19,399
right ah so who knows

2223
02:09:13,369 --> 02:09:21,239
all right anyway I'm gonna wrap it up

2224
02:09:19,399 --> 02:09:22,379
thank you everyone for joining me for an

2225
02:09:21,239 --> 02:09:24,420
episode of hand made hero its what a

2226
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:26,909
pleasure coding with you as always if

2227
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:27,960
you would like to follow along at home

2228
02:09:26,909 --> 02:09:29,579
you can always period of game on

2229
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:31,319
handmade hero org and it comes to the

2230
02:09:29,579 --> 02:09:35,210
source code so you could follow along at

2231
02:09:31,319 --> 02:09:37,199
home I'll be back next weekend wait I

2232
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:40,289
don't know if I will be easy

2233
02:09:37,199 --> 02:09:43,409
Thanksgiving weekend we'll see what's

2234
02:09:40,289 --> 02:09:44,909
scheduled so I don't I haven't posted

2235
02:09:43,409 --> 02:09:48,510
dates for that yet this was the stream

2236
02:09:44,909 --> 02:09:50,579
we just finished so I will post schedule

2237
02:09:48,510 --> 02:09:52,020
and that is when I will be back I got to

2238
02:09:50,579 --> 02:09:53,309
see what my schedule looks like but

2239
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:55,470
we'll be back either next we could live

2240
02:09:53,310 --> 02:09:59,160
again after and then we can play around

2241
02:09:55,470 --> 02:10:01,890
with viewing entity info and and editing

2242
02:09:59,159 --> 02:10:03,930
the entity info in some way and when

2243
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:06,300
we're done with that then I think we can

2244
02:10:03,930 --> 02:10:09,300
call ourselves officially done with the

2245
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:11,070
art importing process and then I guess

2246
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:12,779
we gotta go in to start getting

2247
02:10:11,069 --> 02:10:14,069
decoration stuff working plugin I have

2248
02:10:12,779 --> 02:10:15,449
to work on the world generator because

2249
02:10:14,069 --> 02:10:17,599
we're gonna have to generate one

2250
02:10:15,449 --> 02:10:19,800
generate more stuff ground cover and

2251
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:21,770
furniture and stuff like that and so

2252
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:23,699
because we'll have those in there and

2253
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:25,290
we're gonna have to figure out how to

2254
02:10:23,699 --> 02:10:29,789
put them in the world in some meaningful

2255
02:10:25,289 --> 02:10:31,350
way all right that's it for day hope see

2256
02:10:29,789 --> 02:10:32,880
you back here next time check the

2257
02:10:31,350 --> 02:10:34,170
schedule for when that will be until

2258
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:35,400
then have fun programming and I'll see

2259
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:37,520
everyone on internet take it easy

2260
02:10:35,399 --> 02:10:37,519
everybody
