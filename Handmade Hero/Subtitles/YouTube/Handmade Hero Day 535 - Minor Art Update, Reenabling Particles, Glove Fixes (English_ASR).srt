00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,310
hello everybody and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:10,080
here I'll show a recode a complete game

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:12,259
live on stream we have to do a little

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:18,560
bookkeeping before we start today

5
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:22,289
because I as you know last weekend's

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:25,288
sunday stream my Masai I posted a bunch

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,609
of art to dues to the github it's the

8
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,050
first time we're doing this but now that

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,400
we sort of have we're kind of building

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,349
out the world and we're gonna start

11
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:35,759
really kind of trying to pull the game

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:38,730
together as a game again not really my

13
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,109
strong suit not a game designer so you

14
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:42,058
know take it with a grain of salt but

15
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,009
just doing the engine part of let's

16
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:45,689
let's build a nice world that part I can

17
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:49,558
do because that's that's just engine

18
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:51,780
programming um so at this point we're

19
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,878
gonna start hitting art bugs right we

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,239
try to put something in and that the you

21
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,710
know it's not right or we decide that we

22
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:00,899
need to shuffle the way that we're doing

23
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,579
this like how we're building the our

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,469
nests the first place so we're gonna

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,609
have art bugs and those need to get

26
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:09,810
fixed by the artists it's just Anna on

27
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,950
this product but if you imagine like a

28
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,329
bigger project if you round like a

29
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,359
triple-a game there's a whole art team

30
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:18,539
and our director in an art process right

31
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:20,280
and so you have to kind of send reports

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,600
back that are like hey we're doing this

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,950
programming we're putting this stuff in

34
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,209
and it didn't work the way it's supposed

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,490
to or we're changing something we need

36
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:30,149
the art team to change stuff with us so

37
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:32,399
what i did is i'm just using because we

38
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,100
already have it i'm using the github

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,618
issue system to just mark art things and

40
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:42,629
i set up anna's computer to have a way

41
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,759
for her to list those and she went

42
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:47,489
through and made the changes that we

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,040
asked for you can see for example these

44
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:53,069
are commented by her there's a done on

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,450
on these so what i did was i grab the

46
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:59,489
files from her and put them here this is

47
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,070
the updated art files so the first thing

48
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:05,968
i want to do is just merge these updated

49
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:08,008
art files with our existing art files so

50
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:10,019
that we can get those updates a lot of

51
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,059
them aren't changed because there wasn't

52
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,760
anything wrong with them

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,549
but some of them

54
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,548
have been right and like so she did some

55
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:21,560
stuff to after I told her because

56
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:23,329
remember we made this change after I

57
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,759
told her about how we were doing scenery

58
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:27,790
now she went through and like built you

59
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,098
know various things for the scenery

60
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:34,908
files and whatnot right does that have a

61
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:36,859
pink that's got a like a pink thing that

62
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:38,840
wasn't that's still there or something I

63
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,200
should I should well again this is why

64
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,519
we have an art bug list so we when we go

65
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,449
through these and actually put them in

66
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,480
we can see whether or not they're

67
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:54,469
correct or not right so anyway what we

68
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,988
want to do now is we would like to start

69
00:02:54,469 --> 00:03:02,239
to incorporate these into the game and

70
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:04,489
we would like to basically take any old

71
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,289
files that we have and delete them if

72
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,359
they don't like correspond anymore I

73
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:10,939
don't know what the easiest way to do

74
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:12,859
this is because normally on my machine I

75
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:15,259
use a commercial program called beyond

76
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:18,530
compare that I'll usually use for stuff

77
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:20,719
like this it's a pretty good program

78
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,620
actually it's similar to Reaper in the

79
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,120
beginning of the stream I was ranting

80
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,319
about how bad software is and I was

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,150
trying to point to if someone's there

82
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,828
actually good Reaper was one of them

83
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,289
beyond compare it's actually one to it's

84
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,519
pretty good I haven't had a lot of

85
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:36,168
problems with it and I've been using it

86
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:40,009
for a long time so if we go ahead I

87
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:43,219
think meld is on here which is a similar

88
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:44,598
tool to beyond compare and I like I said

89
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:47,539
I try to use things that are free or

90
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,009
cheap really cheap on the stream because

91
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:52,459
I don't know you know people especially

92
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:54,739
people who are you know young don't

93
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,030
maybe have any money I don't want to be

94
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,759
using stuff on the stream that costs a

95
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:02,449
billion dollars to use right but anyway

96
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:07,899
so if I do a directory comparison here I

97
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:07,900
should be able to say hey if we go to

98
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:15,349
this export directory and pick that and

99
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:20,478
then I go to the directory inside

100
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:21,228
handmade hero that has the base game

101
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,019
assets

102
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:27,019
I should here be able to have this do a

103
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:29,389
diff on them to see

104
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:31,339
which of these things are the same and

105
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,019
which of them are different now I don't

106
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:35,839
know to what extent it can actually

107
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:39,288
provide me a diff of these things

108
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,779
because these are binary files and

109
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:43,610
having double clicked on that and having

110
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:48,279
it go away forever suggests to me that

111
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:51,680
it's going to try to do the diff in text

112
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:54,489
which is not great so you know this is

113
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,288
something again if you like I should

114
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,090
point out beyond compare it's really it

115
00:04:57,288 --> 00:05:00,228
is a good tool and if people have a

116
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:04,399
little bit of money it's not that

117
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:06,110
expensive and and I bought I think I

118
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:10,129
bought multiple licenses for it actually

119
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:12,379
why I don't know I'm just me but so the

120
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,689
this this tool here beyond compare it's

121
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:18,740
how much is it it's you know so it's

122
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:20,418
it's 60 bucks it's not cheap right I

123
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,069
don't know what the difference is

124
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:23,779
between the pro and the standard edition

125
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:29,270
so you know there is a thirty dollar one

126
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:31,129
but I use this Pro Edition the for 60

127
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:33,529
bucks if you are someone with an actual

128
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:36,490
programming job right 60 bucks is not a

129
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:38,809
huge deal so I do recommend that tool

130
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,870
it's it's pretty good and you can see

131
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:45,288
this is just gone completely like it's

132
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,728
forget it right so we can do one of the

133
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:48,709
things we want to do which is just tell

134
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:52,939
us which things changed it can't really

135
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:55,189
apparently do any dips of them that's

136
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:58,009
fine let me just try doing it without

137
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:00,468
doing any diffs and we'll do the merge

138
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:06,968
that way and that's good enough for us

139
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:06,968
right let me go ahead and in here say w

140
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:17,180
handmade sources base game art open so

141
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,050
if I do the compare here what I can see

142
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,848
is you know we've got sort of these

143
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,259
these underscore files using since we're

144
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:25,430
now following art bugs I don't really

145
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,500
think I need to keep those anymore

146
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,189
so I'm just going to delete those two

147
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:34,908
out of here

148
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:37,120
this hero body and the hero head those

149
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:40,180
we had raided a bug on those because

150
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,180
they were

151
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:45,408
if you remember the the facing direction

152
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,748
was wrong so the Kiros like face and

153
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:49,069
body were going like the wrong

154
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:52,189
directions compared to what we were

155
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:55,218
supposed to wind the mass so I want to

156
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:57,800
take those and copy them over right so

157
00:06:55,218 --> 00:07:02,028
that we now have the new versions in our

158
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,288
art file again obstacles forest we

159
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:04,610
deleted on purpose I'm going to leave

160
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,810
those and same with the templates we

161
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,210
move those so I'm going to leave those

162
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,908
the way they are you can see here we've

163
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:15,168
got these particle flowers large splotch

164
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:17,089
stones those you can see that Anna sort

165
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,978
of made her own which is what we want

166
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,128
this was just me experimenting with

167
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:24,680
these things we want the artists to make

168
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:26,509
whatever sets they want here she also

169
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,218
made us some other things like stars and

170
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:29,538
fire and stuff that we can play with for

171
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:33,050
particles that are specifically

172
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:36,519
particles and off we go she also used

173
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,810
the word particles not particle and

174
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,430
there's a couple philosophies on this

175
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,838
right like one is we could go rate a bug

176
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,829
and say hey it's supposed to be particle

177
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:47,569
not particles that is tempting to do and

178
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:49,098
let me just give you a little

179
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,419
perspective on why I'm not going to do

180
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:52,128
it

181
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:53,870
the reason it's tempting to do is not

182
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:55,939
having too much variability can be a

183
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,338
good thing being specific about having

184
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:59,330
sort of work is good however you have to

185
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:01,759
remember when you're working with

186
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:03,468
artists their job is to be artists they

187
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,598
make art for a living that's what they

188
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:09,680
do right they are not meticulous in the

189
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:11,569
way that programmers have to be

190
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,180
meticulous they don't think about things

191
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:17,120
like case sensitivity or exact syntax

192
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,329
right why because that's not what they

193
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,490
do

194
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:21,168
like day-to-day they draw pictures okay

195
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,449
it doesn't ever matter when you're

196
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:25,370
drawing a picture what if you named the

197
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,468
layer with the with a capital letter or

198
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,478
a lowercase letter right it doesn't have

199
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:32,809
any effect on their workflow these

200
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:34,668
things so when we need them to conform

201
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,739
to certain things that our programmer e

202
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:38,838
because they have to flow into an engine

203
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:43,849
pipeline and we need certain information

204
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,250
right um having that be as permissive as

205
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:50,690
possible just smooth things over so I

206
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:54,139
don't recommend being really procrustean

207
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,000
about it I would say loosen up there

208
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,889
don't do what you would do with a normal

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,799
parser which is report errors for

210
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:02,120
everything and force them to be exact

211
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,708
which is what you want to do in a

212
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,269
programming language it's not what you

213
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:09,619
want to do in an arc situation so what

214
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:11,870
I'd like to do here is say all right

215
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,839
we're gonna we're gonna take that cue

216
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,759
the fact that Ana named it particles

217
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,390
instead of particle is just a good

218
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,860
indication that an artist who isn't

219
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:23,750
necessarily thinking about it when

220
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,000
they're going to export will often add

221
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,940
an S on the end of that that's all we

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,129
need to know right it's probably because

223
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,399
we talked about making like particle

224
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:36,620
stars and that was probably made before

225
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,629
we did this and we probably decided on

226
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,078
particles there and then on particle

227
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:44,889
here right so just let them both happen

228
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:48,699
there's no reason for them not to happen

229
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:57,860
so I'm going to copy these over and

230
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:59,959
delete these the scenery here you can

231
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,139
see this like scenery chair what's going

232
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,899
on I thought we did make a chair oh why

233
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:07,639
we need Orphanage chair so I don't care

234
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:13,549
about that Orphanage lamp labeling

235
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:19,939
either so I'm gonna delete those just

236
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:21,500
fine and then also these and then I'm

237
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:28,130
just gonna bulk copy all the stuff she

238
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:32,509
made the way she made it now title

239
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:34,759
screen got moved so again don't care

240
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:36,350
about that so just looking at the expert

241
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,069
directory now I think we're good like I

242
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,909
think we've updated all of these changes

243
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,459
now some of these are gonna have

244
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:45,078
consequences so let's go take care of

245
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,659
those consequences and I can also just

246
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,588
no we don't need that anymore so let's

247
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:55,698
go ahead and open up handmade hero oops

248
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:57,829
and what I want to do is twofold first

249
00:10:55,698 --> 00:11:02,719
any import layer there's a place where

250
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:05,659
we search for particles and as you can

251
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,180
see what we're doing is saying it has to

252
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:13,299
be exactly that

253
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:14,859
let's just not oh wait never mind

254
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,929
that's irrelevant we don't care about

255
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,060
that it's only in the hht I don't know

256
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:21,279
why I thought that that was the case

257
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:23,289
right because this this is not necessary

258
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,980
anymore this is just this is just for

259
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:31,120
our block but the actual the actual

260
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,820
place where this is specified in here

261
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,310
just specifies the name directly so if I

262
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,440
go look at particle you can see that it

263
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:42,299
lists the names here so all it is is

264
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,220
these PNG s would have particles right

265
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:46,990
so this is a trivial fix for us all

266
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,600
right so what we want to do now is say

267
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,970
look all of this stuff like the particle

268
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,950
flowers and grass large and grass watch

269
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:57,100
and all that stuff these have different

270
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,700
names now so we want to go through and

271
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,139
change these to more accurately reflect

272
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,210
what's actually in the directory and I

273
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,789
think all of this stuff remains the same

274
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,769
there were no updates to this part of

275
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:11,409
the code so what I'm going to do at the

276
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:14,649
moment is I'm just gonna sort of you

277
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:17,740
know comment these out really really

278
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:21,669
quickly here and say alright these are

279
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:24,250
gone as things let's go look at what

280
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:29,589
we've actually got now and insert those

281
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:35,230
in so looking at the directory if we go

282
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:38,889
to handmade sources base in here where

283
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:41,230
we've got the art input if I was to do

284
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:43,360
particle star it would list all the

285
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,149
particles that we have and I can just

286
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,669
put those in directly right so if I just

287
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:51,970
copy these and say here's what we're

288
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:54,189
talking about these are the particle

289
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:58,990
files that we now have we've got three

290
00:12:54,190 --> 00:13:01,960
grass types some puffs rocks and stars

291
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,460
the puffs if you're wondering are like

292
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,290
if we want to do smoke or something I

293
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,750
asked Anna just give us a sampling of

294
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:09,370
some generic particles and the reason

295
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,080
for that is we'd like to put in the

296
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,279
particle systems we have particles of

297
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,150
some code we don't use it for anything

298
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,769
right now

299
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:16,720
and so we'd like to experiment with that

300
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,189
at some point so here's some example of

301
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,540
like some little puffs like if we want

302
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,160
like smoke puffs or something like that

303
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:23,339
right

304
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:27,309
if we want some like fire puffs you know

305
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,509
if we want some stars for like when

306
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,099
someone gets punched or something I

307
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:32,409
don't want to throw some stars out there

308
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,870
you know I'm saying so we've got a lot

309
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:37,539
of situations where we we might want to

310
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:41,470
do some stuff with these and that to me

311
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:42,849
is is why I wanted some generic stuff

312
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,259
but before we even really know what kind

313
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,970
of particles we need just something to

314
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:50,470
play with so we can get that system off

315
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:57,100
the ground now coming back in here I'm

316
00:13:50,470 --> 00:14:07,840
gonna go ahead and make this define I'm

317
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:20,290
just gonna say okay each of these should

318
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:25,660
look like this so maybe this and then we

319
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:27,579
just want to go ahead and grab it so

320
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:29,649
that's what we're looking at and these

321
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,720
are gonna have to be tagged with

322
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:35,439
something

323
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,899
each of these which we kind of think

324
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,710
about what that's going to be a lot of

325
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:44,889
these are kind of self-explanatory like

326
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,960
fire or grass or whatever so we should

327
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,909
probably go look at the files this is

328
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,500
pretty basic though this is just like

329
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:56,769
fire and probably it should be tagged

330
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,409
with particle actual particle because

331
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:02,919
it's not just something that is used as

332
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:05,259
a splotch it's actually specifically

333
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:06,669
used as a particle so I think we

334
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:09,850
probably want to do something like that

335
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:11,860
where we say like cover you know like

336
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,779
we've got different things here the

337
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,490
thing about that is I don't know that

338
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,740
could also be something that's a base

339
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,360
type meaning we could make that be

340
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,430
something that's that sort of specified

341
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,889
elsewhere but at the moment it really

342
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:25,479
doesn't I don't know whether we want

343
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,699
that in the tags or whether we want that

344
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:32,980
elsewhere I'm not sure right but you can

345
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:34,660
see that this is really what this sort

346
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,580
of boils down to you

347
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:38,949
it would look like that these things are

348
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,020
things that are used as ground cover not

349
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,180
really particles and these things are

350
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:44,980
actually used as literal particles and

351
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:46,000
we probably want to distinguish between

352
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,539
those two

353
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,450
I'm guessing again whether or not that

354
00:15:49,539 --> 00:16:06,219
should be out here I'm not sure maybe it

355
00:15:52,450 --> 00:16:09,370
should and I don't know we're gonna

356
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,720
leave it like that for now all right so

357
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,830
those are our particles and we're gonna

358
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,639
have to tag them with something useful

359
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:17,290
we've then got our sceneries and between

360
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,179
the particles and the sceneries I think

361
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:22,120
that's everything I don't think there's

362
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:25,689
anything else that was new so I should

363
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:30,399
be able to do this and get all those so

364
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:41,440
here are those and if I go ahead and cut

365
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:45,209
and paste those in here I should be able

366
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:50,200
to do similarly so if I just do this

367
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:56,050
well actually I should get rid of this

368
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:58,990
first I really have to finish up my new

369
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:00,219
for coder well I guess it's not really

370
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:05,740
technically 4-footer anymore because

371
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:14,078
I've ended up writing a whole new thing

372
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:15,789
but the editor put that way okay so this

373
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,059
is what we're looking at for scenery and

374
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:27,938
the same thing applies we're gonna have

375
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:29,829
to there we go we're gonna have to do

376
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:30,759
some tagging here because we don't

377
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:32,679
really know what any of this stuff

378
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:36,640
contains or how its differentiated

379
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:39,779
really you know I'm saying so looking at

380
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,780
these let me see

381
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:53,019
so you know the only thing I would say

382
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:55,329
is I'm not sure why like these this

383
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:58,329
scenery chair Oh - in scenery chair oh

384
00:17:55,329 --> 00:18:00,339
three seem like they're just equivalent

385
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:04,869
right like this those are just variants

386
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:07,569
in the same chair like I I can't think

387
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:09,489
of well maybe not now this is a rocking

388
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:11,139
chair and that's not maybe that's good

389
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,309
enough of a difference a reason to make

390
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:24,610
that different I don't know anyway so

391
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:25,960
yeah like it's hard to say some of the

392
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:28,000
stuff is complicated because it's like

393
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,559
who knows like that that maybe is a

394
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,490
longer ish table than this so I don't

395
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:35,679
know that we'd want to pick those

396
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:37,420
equivalently either anyway so a lot of

397
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,890
this stuff now has to get tagged because

398
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,630
we have no idea what the tags actually

399
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:44,890
are gonna be unless this stuff so we got

400
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:47,530
to start there I think let's take a look

401
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:51,700
at particle grass so the first one

402
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:54,460
particle grass 0 1 which is this looking

403
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,769
at that I don't know what we're gonna do

404
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,230
for differentiation there so I think

405
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:01,869
that's just the size probably so I think

406
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:06,670
we can just use what we were using

407
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:09,339
before here as far as tags to

408
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:20,490
differentiate those I think we could say

409
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:24,369
alright the o2 is the large one and oh

410
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:26,430
one is the small one I'm half water

411
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:34,059
already

412
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:36,930
so grass oh three is flowers right so

413
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:36,929
that's actually this

414
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,740
particle puffs I'm gonna go ahead and

415
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,809
call that smoke I'm gonna call this

416
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:57,559
rocks because I think we've already got

417
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:57,559
that right our stones stone yes stone

418
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:09,650
stars are just stars I think and off we

419
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:15,689
go

420
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:19,070
so inside our tags we need to add those

421
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,070
because we don't have some of those

422
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:33,289
we're gonna need stars right we're gonna

423
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:33,289
need smoke we're gonna need cover

424
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:45,540
we're gonna need particle we're gonna

425
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:49,250
need to not have an extra semicolon we

426
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:52,338
need fire and

427
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,338
[Music]

428
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:04,940
like that's it right eat those zones we

429
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:07,369
added so let's move on to the scenery

430
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,740
now we've got a bunch of chairs here

431
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:10,639
we've got a bunch of lamps we've got a

432
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,710
rug

433
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,169
we've got a table we've got all these

434
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:18,710
trees all of this stuff needs to be

435
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:23,409
labeled I'm gonna go ahead and drop

436
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,409
these into the to the list of tags here

437
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:51,700
so yeah I'm missing some parentheses

438
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:51,699
there there we go no incorrect

439
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:12,859
so we've got that table covered now we

440
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:14,778
need to come look at these again I'm

441
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:16,399
going to go ahead and look at what we

442
00:22:14,778 --> 00:22:18,528
already did here because we kind of

443
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:31,659
worked out what probably most of this

444
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:34,788
stuff is and so the the orphanage chair

445
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:36,350
I'm assuming Molly went to get her

446
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:38,179
dinner I don't know when I don't know if

447
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:39,949
and when she left well I know if she

448
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:41,778
left cuz she's not there anymore but I

449
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,750
could I just heard her like automated

450
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:48,710
feeder go off so that is that it's Meal

451
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:51,288
Time so if we take a look here at like

452
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:56,480
the chair stuff all of this stuff for

453
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:58,730
scenery is all orphanage scenery so I

454
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:20,569
think these are all gonna be like you

455
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:22,880
know this sort of thing now in order to

456
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:24,769
differentiate between these we may need

457
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,390
some additional tags to the extent that

458
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:28,908
we actually care which one of these

459
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,919
we're picking when we look at the chair

460
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:34,659
like these two are kind of a matching

461
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:45,620
set so I'm a kind of call these sofa

462
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:48,860
right that's chair of four I may say

463
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:50,839
that that's size one and this is size of

464
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:54,709
five or something like that you and I'm

465
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:56,058
saying to you these two I don't think we

466
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,269
care about so I think those are

467
00:23:56,058 --> 00:24:03,079
literally just chair I don't know that

468
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:05,658
we care about rocking or otherwise I'm

469
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:08,808
not sure again we can add more of that

470
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:12,080
as we go scenery lamp

471
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:14,480
we've got really sizes on those I think

472
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,210
again so I think this is just going to

473
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,860
be a size of five lamp

474
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:22,509
this is gonna be like a size one lamp

475
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:23,709
kind of a thing the rug I don't know

476
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:27,789
that we need anything other than the

477
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,750
word rug and the table I don't know that

478
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:34,899
we need anything other than the word

479
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:42,309
table for now going by the rest of this

480
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:45,580
here just trying to think in here I

481
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:47,109
don't think we have table right and I

482
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:50,710
don't think we have rug

483
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:52,689
we should have chair right and we have

484
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,549
like orphan right we have all that stuff

485
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,160
we've got lamp

486
00:24:54,549 --> 00:25:03,099
we don't have sofa I think that's all we

487
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:04,509
need for the stuff we added there so

488
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:10,539
again just adding those into the list

489
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:16,240
because C++ is a giant steaming pile and

490
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:18,879
makes you do everything yourself job

491
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,130
security people think of it that way the

492
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,720
C++ committee has your back they will

493
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,720
never let the computer do anything

494
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,860
because the C++ committee wants to make

495
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:32,230
sure that C programmers still have

496
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:35,169
plenty of hours a day of typing to do so

497
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:40,539
that it looks like they're busy so

498
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:43,930
scenery tree we've got a set of those

499
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,819
here and it looks like the evergreen

500
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,890
verse is not is not something Anna

501
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:50,559
wanted to differentiate on it looks like

502
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:59,759
it's more like stumped or not and then

503
00:25:50,559 --> 00:26:04,029
like more like the season I guess maybe

504
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:05,349
and then this I think was I asked her

505
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,389
what these were I think she was saying

506
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:11,500
these are more for spooky like graveyard

507
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:12,310
areas or something like that so I don't

508
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,410
really know

509
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:17,679
they weren't damaged like I thought that

510
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:20,050
was what they might be for but that's

511
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:24,190
not what they're gonna be for I guess so

512
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:29,710
that's just worth noting so evergreen is

513
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:30,070
not actually on the table as a tag this

514
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,150
is

515
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:38,109
probably a deprecated tag for now oh

516
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:41,490
hello miss kitty did you have a good

517
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:45,209
dinner well it's really lunch isn't it

518
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:52,420
how are you doing how are you doing

519
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:57,420
mm-hmm that's a good puss that's a good

520
00:26:52,420 --> 00:27:01,570
place it's raining out did you know that

521
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:06,279
did you look at the rain yet do you want

522
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:07,240
to look do you want to look oh yeah how

523
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,839
are you doing okay

524
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:14,519
that's my oh that's my headphones that's

525
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:17,349
my headphones okay all right let's just

526
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:21,519
maybe we can get the headphones kind of

527
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:25,389
um out from underneath the cat and that

528
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:27,490
would help that's a good kitty do you

529
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:31,600
want to help us program do you want to

530
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:34,299
help us do some programming mm-hmm what

531
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:38,980
do you want to do we can do whatever you

532
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:41,529
want we can do whatever you want do you

533
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,880
want a program we can program if you

534
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:46,259
just want to sit here we can sit here

535
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,260
that's that's good too

536
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:54,570
everyone loves it when you're on stream

537
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:59,699
everyone does yes of course they do

538
00:27:54,569 --> 00:28:02,500
okay if we can convince Molly to not

539
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:07,269
attack the headphones then we can

540
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,049
probably do some more coding here maybe

541
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,799
maybe not

542
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:13,539
we'll see she may demand more attention

543
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:17,430
and then the programming is obviously

544
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:19,960
not possible okay okay

545
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:23,650
all right what's she doing okay now

546
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,500
you're all tangled up what's it gonna be

547
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:28,030
what do you want to do do you want to go

548
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,779
into your Cassatt or do you want to want

549
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:32,920
to go to the cat the the cat I don't

550
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,240
know what you call that it's not really

551
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,880
a cat tree because it's not really a

552
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,670
tree it's like half a cat tree I'm gonna

553
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,670
go into you're half a cat tree okay

554
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:49,809
okay okay all right you know what we're

555
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:54,089
gonna go to the cat tree now because now

556
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:54,089
you're starting to bite and get rowdy oh

557
00:28:54,180 --> 00:29:00,820
okay come on I'm sick all right I need

558
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:11,919
to take this off you totally tangle it

559
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:20,159
up what are you doing there you go

560
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:20,160
you're gonna be okay all right

561
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,700
you wanna how about you look out how

562
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,730
about your little look at the rain for a

563
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,650
while how's that sound okay I don't

564
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,819
really want to get bit right now that's

565
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:34,830
not that wouldn't be that's not my

566
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:37,720
favorite thing to do right now okay yeah

567
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:39,419
yeah there's there's probably birds out

568
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:47,130
there did you look

569
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:49,090
did you look and see yeah okay all right

570
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:51,550
we don't know what Molly's gonna do

571
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:54,879
she's a wild card in this and we'll see

572
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:55,930
but yeah we don't know whether the

573
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,050
headphones will last

574
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:00,820
she likes to chew through cables and

575
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:03,849
stuff that's like just something she

576
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:06,519
will do anyway so we're gonna deprecate

577
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:07,539
the Evergreen for now because we don't

578
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,579
actually know if that's gonna be

579
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:10,690
something that that happens I'm gonna

580
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:12,669
leave the damage tag because that

581
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,340
probably will be something happens I

582
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:20,080
think there's a thing called dark that

583
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:21,789
we had and I may say that maybe dark is

584
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,240
the thing that won't label those sort of

585
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:28,869
like spooky trees with because I mean

586
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,240
why not right so let's see here if we

587
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:34,359
look at scenery tree what we were

588
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:38,470
labeling those with before was like this

589
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:41,979
kind of thing right and so if we come in

590
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:44,289
here and label these with like this sort

591
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:47,170
of stuff we know evergreen isn't there

592
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:50,559
and we know damaged isn't there but like

593
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,570
winter would be there and dark would be

594
00:30:50,559 --> 00:31:00,099
there

595
00:30:52,569 --> 00:31:05,740
and I guess fall would be there do we

596
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:13,408
have that we did and fall so we kind of

597
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:13,409
have like this sort of thing and I guess

598
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,308
you know damaged we could use for the

599
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:27,519
stump maybe it's a little bit of a

600
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:27,940
stretch but maybe we could say that was

601
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,490
true

602
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,490
so maybe scenery tree OH - is like

603
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:47,048
damaged or something I don't know seems

604
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:49,750
possible anyway so in here we've got the

605
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:53,829
fall trees and here we've got the spring

606
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:57,429
trees so I guess we would say that oh

607
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:59,230
three is the fall trees oh four is the

608
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:02,139
dark trees

609
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:04,058
and oh five is the winter trees and just

610
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:14,109
that's good enough for now

611
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:16,538
right so I think that's everything that

612
00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:18,668
we've got and and then we can delete

613
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:20,169
these I don't want to keep the alignment

614
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:21,460
points because they may not be the same

615
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:25,360
there's a couple of these that we

616
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:27,308
aligned but that's not going to be

617
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,949
accurate anymore so I'm just going to

618
00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:32,589
delete those now and then we're gonna

619
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,899
call it a day so I think that's

620
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:38,528
everything if I rebuild we will now have

621
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:41,528
different tags there the evergreen tag

622
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:43,750
has been deprecated because I don't

623
00:32:41,528 --> 00:32:45,490
really think we're gonna it doesn't look

624
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,990
like Anna wants to differentiate maybe

625
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,460
in the future if she does we'll undec

626
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:53,740
ate it but for now I'm just gonna say

627
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:57,879
don't use that so like here I'm gonna

628
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:59,620
say don't use that we could add the

629
00:32:57,878 --> 00:33:03,548
other ones in here so what did we say

630
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:05,299
fall damaged winter and there's one

631
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:11,410
other thing

632
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:17,359
dark so if we add these sort of like

633
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:19,430
random tagging things tag dark isn't

634
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:24,919
undeclared identifier but it's right

635
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:30,400
here could be not too clear that oh it's

636
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,400
dark energy my bad

637
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:39,509
so maybe dark energy isn't quite the

638
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:42,809
best thing for that maybe we should have

639
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:52,670
another one I don't know what it would

640
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:56,099
be like spooky or something I'm not sure

641
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:57,029
let's go ahead and run remedy here and

642
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:00,779
see where we're at

643
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:04,740
I'm gonna load up the handmade hero code

644
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:06,930
I'm gonna run it it's gonna have to do

645
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:11,400
some importing here because we changed a

646
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:13,950
ton of stuff uh if I look at the errors

647
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,000
it looks like we didn't have any oddly

648
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:17,000
enough

649
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,469
which is kind of somewhat surprising

650
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,510
what I will point out is already some of

651
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:23,939
our bugs have been fixed I can tell the

652
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:26,480
hero now faces the right direction so

653
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:29,880
that was a bug that we had recorded

654
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,159
right so that's pretty exciting and we

655
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,420
can actually now say that that you know

656
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,029
because that was annoying the whole time

657
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:39,630
so now that that's fixed that's great so

658
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:51,930
we can fix this or rather mark this as

659
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:54,480
fixed and let's see I don't know what

660
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:57,569
else we have to Marcus fix but we'll see

661
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,099
in a second so here's a bunch of stuff

662
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:05,190
these things need their sizes and

663
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:07,980
alignments modified I would note that

664
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:10,200
this doesn't seem to really be picking

665
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,789
particularly fairly which I'm not sure

666
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:18,449
why that would be that we should

667
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:25,550
probably look to see oh so here's one

668
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:25,549
thing that that yeah

669
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:35,048
so we should probably raid an art bug

670
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:38,019
about on this because I noticed this

671
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:40,858
before and I don't think I ever told

672
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:43,719
Anna about this so it's not clear and

673
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:47,529
one way we could do it is we could go

674
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:49,118
back in and change the parser to look at

675
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:52,390
this but I think there's some negative

676
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,490
consequences to doing that so I would

677
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:57,789
really rather not

678
00:35:54,489 --> 00:36:04,209
and specifically wait I thought I'd just

679
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:09,338
closed that oh that was the body ones so

680
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:18,690
this one these are both closed now these

681
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:18,690
are fixed as well this is fixed as well

682
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:27,449
so really this one turned out to be our

683
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:27,449
fault as well

684
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:40,509
yeah I don't know to do about this let

685
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:42,309
me explain you what the problem is then

686
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:47,020
we can sort of decide what you want to

687
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:51,519
do so if you look at files that have

688
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:54,759
variants in them this is not really what

689
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:58,780
we want what we want for variants is we

690
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:01,420
want there to be like this variant

691
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,220
should actually be over here because

692
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,740
since variant goes zero point two five

693
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:07,980
point five seven five or what it lower

694
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:12,729
bulb no I guess it goes like you know

695
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:15,389
evenly spaced throughout if you pick a

696
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:18,610
random number between zero and one then

697
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:20,739
you're way more often gonna pick this

698
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,750
and you're almost never gonna pick this

699
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:24,609
because you have like a three-quarters

700
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,769
chance of hitting this one and only a

701
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:29,950
1/4 chance of hitting this one so

702
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:32,139
basically three out of four times you're

703
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:36,009
gonna get this guy which is not what you

704
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:39,369
want it you wanted a 50% spread right so

705
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:44,890
I think we want to just call that an art

706
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:51,279
update because what we want to do is we

707
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:52,059
track which label which cell these

708
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,000
things come from

709
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:56,679
so we want to keep them in the same cell

710
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,420
like once you put something somewhere we

711
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:00,460
want to keep it there so that when you

712
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,950
re import it doesn't reinforce

713
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:05,260
more things than necessary and you know

714
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:07,149
stuff like that just easier to track so

715
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:11,340
I think we want to actually ask the

716
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:14,380
artists to put things separated that way

717
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,150
if they're not going to draw all four

718
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,010
now we could do in a different way where

719
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,510
we could just detect how many of them we

720
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:26,470
have and then spread it out among those

721
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:29,430
but I don't really think so so I'm gonna

722
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:29,429
just call that a bug

723
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:54,329
and you know the only thing about that

724
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:56,130
is now that I think as I'm saying it

725
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:57,750
though I realized that this creates

726
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,700
really just annoying stuff for the

727
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,559
artist so that means for particles you

728
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:04,649
would put one in the top one in here and

729
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:07,019
I'd have to pin it so you know what no I

730
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:10,730
think we're gonna have to do the work of

731
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:10,730
spreading those out ourselves

732
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,880
yeah that it just seems to me that we're

733
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,369
gonna have to do it deal with that

734
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,200
ourselves so maybe that's what we do

735
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:29,250
today maybe we've got a we've got to

736
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,389
make that happen

737
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,400
trying to change the way we were doing

738
00:39:30,389 --> 00:39:34,289
things a little bit to make sure that

739
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,750
when we're doing things like parsing

740
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:39,389
variants the variants come out as a

741
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:45,989
count and then distribute along the

742
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:48,139
count that that may be what we have to

743
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:48,139
do

744
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,250
the reason that's super annoying is it

745
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,990
means that we don't have we can't really

746
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:08,840
have templates for our sprite sheets

747
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:10,369
anymore because those templates change

748
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:22,730
depending on how many things you filled

749
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:26,769
up right I'm trying to think if there's

750
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,769
any other way we could really do it

751
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,489
I mean I suppose one thing we could do

752
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:47,049
is we could do some kind of an auto

753
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:49,569
variant thing where variant tags are

754
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:53,220
added at the end based on how many

755
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:53,220
things were seen

756
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:08,559
that's probably the most expeditious way

757
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,900
to do it but it may prove kind of

758
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:23,739
complicated and error-prone to do it

759
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:26,710
that way so I don't know

760
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:56,229
let's also by the way this got finished

761
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:59,440
a long time ago didn't it all right

762
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:01,179
so I think that's probably what we're

763
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,429
gonna have to do because just looking at

764
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:05,440
it's like yeah I could tell Anna to do

765
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:07,929
it that way but it's just annoying and

766
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,039
like if you think about what this file

767
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:11,289
would have to look like it would have to

768
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,119
look like fill this one this would be

769
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:15,070
like a diagonal almost but slightly

770
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,710
different because we got five it's just

771
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:20,200
that's not something artists should have

772
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:22,510
to be dealing with that's like not good

773
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:24,639
so we need some way of assigning the

774
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:29,770
variant number automatically and it

775
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:34,599
needs to be spread out along the 0 to 1

776
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:36,280
range you know very specifically and so

777
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:40,630
I think what we want to do there is

778
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:43,210
let's let's actually let's let's

779
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:46,180
actually try to attack that problem a

780
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:48,699
little more head-on so all right

781
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:51,539
other than that I think we were okay

782
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:55,539
like it looks like we're pretty good

783
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:57,519
otherwise you know what we may also want

784
00:42:55,539 --> 00:43:00,989
to do while we're at it I'm gonna maybe

785
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:00,989
I'll maybe file a bug for that

786
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,789
so I'm calling that an issue and I'm

787
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:39,339
calling it a programming issue because

788
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:41,320
we should probably fix that what I was

789
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,090
gonna say is I do wonder if we could

790
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,220
test the particle stuff what could have

791
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:47,829
put the particles back in like for

792
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:49,989
example maybe I want to spawn some puffs

793
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:51,099
when I hop on the ground we could we

794
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:55,779
could play with that a little bit and

795
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:59,079
just see what's going on I think that

796
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,670
might be fun to do right and then we've

797
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,739
got the furniture in the ground cover so

798
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,599
we've got tons of stuff to work on but I

799
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:08,199
do think we want to go ahead and make

800
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:10,900
sure we can actually do the the variant

801
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:13,509
stuff correctly first because that's

802
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,400
just that that's gonna throw a wrench in

803
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:17,460
any time we try to do randomized picking

804
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,320
right

805
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:25,240
looks like our lamps are working okay as

806
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:27,190
well so that's good yeah all right so

807
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,439
let's go ahead and figure out what we're

808
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:33,130
doing here we'll look maybe we go play

809
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,599
with with that particle thing get that

810
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,970
Rhian abled because we haven't done that

811
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:39,279
in a while let's let's do that and then

812
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:47,759
if we have time after that we'll also go

813
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:50,920
take a look at the variant computation

814
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,170
in the particle system I don't really

815
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,070
remember why it was called spawn fire

816
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:58,210
because it wasn't actually fire but I

817
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:01,269
think that's just because that was what

818
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:03,429
we called our test code so if you look

819
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:04,659
in here a lot of the stuff sift out and

820
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:07,889
there's just weird stuff going on

821
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:13,108
now might be a good time to go ahead and

822
00:45:07,889 --> 00:45:17,259
you know put put this stuff to work I

823
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:20,829
think we want to just start by

824
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:22,960
probably putting these things back in I

825
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:26,799
don't know why there if zero doubt

826
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,500
exactly but the compiler should tell us

827
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,910
pretty much immediately why we it if

828
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:37,239
zero those out right okay so here you

829
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:39,699
can see we don't actually have the world

830
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:46,889
mode getting passed to us so that's a

831
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:46,889
pretty obvious reason why particle sells

832
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:55,780
so this is like doing a hybrid

833
00:45:51,070 --> 00:46:01,410
oh this was like if we were doing hybrid

834
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:01,410
like like hybrid sim like Lagrangian

835
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:05,590
illyrian combined like I think what do

836
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:13,960
they call them nowadays it's called a

837
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:15,340
different thing they call them they had

838
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,579
they have a they have a different name

839
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:20,340
for these things what do you call what

840
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:23,019
do you call it now when you do a

841
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:26,070
Lagrangian I read like Lagrangian or

842
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:26,070
Larian thing like

843
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:47,079
do they do they maybe they don't have

844
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:49,869
another name so I don't I don't know if

845
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:52,119
if they have another name maybe that

846
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:56,740
maybe calling them or hybrid like

847
00:46:52,119 --> 00:47:02,559
Lagrangian or Larian methods is what

848
00:46:56,739 --> 00:47:03,759
it's called so maybe there is no other

849
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:05,829
name for it maybe that's why I can't

850
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,450
think of it anyway we were doing a

851
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:10,269
little bit of that kind of thing here I

852
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:14,439
don't know that we really want to be

853
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:17,108
doing that I think we just can use just

854
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:21,429
regular particles here so I guess this

855
00:47:17,108 --> 00:47:23,679
if zero actually is a real if zero look

856
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:26,949
we don't actually need that in there so

857
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:30,038
this code yeah like it looks fine for

858
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:31,629
doing the rendering looks good so why

859
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:34,510
aren't we getting this did we inside the

860
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:40,660
world code actually like if zero that

861
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:42,880
out is that what happened so we've got

862
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:47,288
to do here for render re-enabled

863
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:50,019
particles but we do have that if one in

864
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:51,910
here to the update and render particles

865
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:54,489
and and it's supposed to be calling

866
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:59,250
update and render fire but it doesn't

867
00:47:54,489 --> 00:48:01,750
actually render anything so why not

868
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:03,760
right if we were actually jumping in

869
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:07,179
here what's what's not happening in

870
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,650
there because the F zero is that around

871
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:11,009
anything important I don't think it is

872
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:11,010
anymore

873
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:25,000
yeah so I fit feels like this should be

874
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:26,559
okay system bitmap ID I don't know to

875
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,550
what extent that's maybe not able to

876
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:32,349
find anything I'm not sure so it could

877
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,780
be that this is just failing but I'm not

878
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:36,670
I'm not certain so what I'd like to do

879
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,740
is maybe step in here and see what's

880
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:47,889
going on I don't know where we call init

881
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:49,779
particle cache but it looks like that is

882
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:53,230
getting set up properly so the particle

883
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:56,890
cache is getting initialized so most of

884
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:58,599
this stuff does seem like it actually is

885
00:48:56,889 --> 00:48:59,859
still getting called so the question is

886
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,230
why aren't we actually seeing anything

887
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:04,750
you know what I'm saying

888
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:07,210
and we should go find out why that's the

889
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:10,449
case the other thing I guess is well if

890
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:12,369
we never spawned any that might do it so

891
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:14,489
it could be that we're just never like

892
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:19,329
maybe we're never spawning anything okay

893
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:21,719
so it might be more like this is the

894
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:21,719
problem

895
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,760
there we go

896
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,610
so now we just need that's like the

897
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,980
that's the first head in the list

898
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,990
I guess so now we just need to instead

899
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,420
of having heads in there but maybe even

900
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:42,919
put the puffs in there so to do that we

901
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:50,409
would just need to query that particle

902
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:53,300
right so in here we would go to the hht

903
00:49:50,409 --> 00:49:59,809
where would we query the particle for

904
00:49:53,300 --> 00:50:20,119
puffs its particle smoke so I guess we

905
00:49:59,809 --> 00:50:23,179
would say we want particle smoke and

906
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:25,160
just see if that loads that in properly

907
00:50:23,179 --> 00:50:27,109
and then we've got to actually go you

908
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:29,029
know I don't think we left the particle

909
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:30,860
systems we just kind of sketch them in

910
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:33,740
there I don't think we left them in a

911
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:35,660
particularly useful state so for some

912
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:37,729
reason that doesn't seem to actually be

913
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:43,179
picking anything which doesn't make a

914
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:43,179
whole lot of sense because it should be

915
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:49,510
right particle smoke we should be

916
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:52,099
getting particle puffs so one I think

917
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:57,369
and then we get this back we should be

918
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:57,368
getting that bitmap ID looking at

919
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:09,669
looking at that asset match oh that's

920
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,670
why it's looking in the wrong category

921
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:19,769
alright so there's the little puffs

922
00:51:15,568 --> 00:51:21,208
right and what we want to do so you can

923
00:51:19,768 --> 00:51:25,368
see there's actually some bugs in there

924
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:27,629
to where we're in terms of the movement

925
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:29,459
right you see how it's moving wrong at

926
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:31,439
the transition point that's because we

927
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:34,108
haven't gone in and made sure that the

928
00:51:31,438 --> 00:51:36,028
particle system displacement was updated

929
00:51:34,108 --> 00:51:37,380
when we did the final camera right our

930
00:51:36,028 --> 00:51:39,659
camera is now basically what it would

931
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:42,539
ship as I don't think we really have to

932
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:46,078
do much else to it so when the camera

933
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:46,829
itself is transitioning the particles go

934
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,420
in the wrong way

935
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:50,400
you can see how they're going totally

936
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,400
wrong so we need to go in and make sure

937
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,889
that the camera properly tells particles

938
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,079
how to adjust so that they align with

939
00:51:55,889 --> 00:52:01,108
the world because particles are just in

940
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:05,489
screen space they don't really exist in

941
00:52:01,108 --> 00:52:07,798
the world per se so it's a little bit I

942
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:10,469
shouldn't say screen space it's really

943
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:12,119
since pace right and so we want to be

944
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:14,639
able to do that and we also kind of need

945
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:15,838
to adjust these particles so if they

946
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:17,188
make a little bit more sense like they

947
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,099
should be smaller and things like that

948
00:52:17,188 --> 00:52:22,438
right but otherwise that's what we

949
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:25,650
wanted so let's go ahead and try to make

950
00:52:22,438 --> 00:52:28,228
that make some of those changes make

951
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:30,389
sense in here so first of all these are

952
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,618
too big and so if you look at what's

953
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:34,469
happening in here right we were doing

954
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:36,329
this push bitmap we want these particles

955
00:52:34,469 --> 00:52:40,019
probably to be smaller than they are and

956
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:44,309
so when we look at how the particle

957
00:52:40,018 --> 00:52:46,578
system is set up you can see here that

958
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:49,859
for some reason we didn't include a size

959
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:52,429
right and I don't know why we didn't

960
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:56,608
normally you've got a size in there and

961
00:52:52,429 --> 00:52:58,769
so it's a little bit weird and we

962
00:52:56,608 --> 00:53:02,038
probably should have one so if you look

963
00:52:58,768 --> 00:53:06,088
at what's happening with say the color

964
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:08,959
and the DDC right we probably want the

965
00:53:06,088 --> 00:53:12,498
same thing to happen with the size and

966
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:12,498
if you look

967
00:53:16,088 --> 00:53:20,409
I think that we just have to be

968
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:22,538
completely separate parameter I'm not

969
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:25,688
sure where else we would really go to do

970
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:28,089
something like that so yeah like looking

971
00:53:25,688 --> 00:53:29,498
in here this parameter right here where

972
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:33,068
it's like how big did you want this

973
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:37,268
thing to be that value should really be

974
00:53:33,068 --> 00:53:38,739
coming from our code and furthermore we

975
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:40,538
could actually support stretching in

976
00:53:38,739 --> 00:53:42,909
there and stuff like that but at the

977
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:52,930
moment I don't see a lot of ways to do

978
00:53:42,909 --> 00:53:57,989
that um the floors e and the chunk Z and

979
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:57,989
that stuff do we really need that like

980
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:07,208
cuz we're full 3d now so this stuff

981
00:54:04,748 --> 00:54:09,958
should just work right like do we even

982
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:09,958
use this anymore

983
00:54:16,108 --> 00:54:21,929
good so this is really all the particle

984
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:24,719
has now and you can see here we've got

985
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:27,419
like four four X versions of these

986
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,608
things because they're wide right we're

987
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:33,028
doing sim D so we can do four particles

988
00:54:29,608 --> 00:54:35,219
at a time and so what we would want to

989
00:54:33,028 --> 00:54:36,869
do here is for any place where we were

990
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:41,130
gonna do like we want to be able to do

991
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:43,650
an f32 4x4 the size right so this is the

992
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:45,420
size of the particle and so in here when

993
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:47,579
we initialize one of these spawn fires

994
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:51,028
we want to do something like size equals

995
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:53,459
mm set expression 1.0 right last we can

996
00:54:51,028 --> 00:54:55,318
adjust that and then in here when we

997
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:58,498
render this thing we want to actually

998
00:54:55,318 --> 00:55:00,239
render it properly now when it's doing

999
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:02,429
the particle updating which is this

1000
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:05,338
garbage here we could also have a size

1001
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:08,278
change I'm not going to do that yet but

1002
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:10,228
we very easily could right so in here

1003
00:55:08,278 --> 00:55:14,429
though what I want to do is grab that

1004
00:55:10,228 --> 00:55:17,548
size out to actually get for any

1005
00:55:14,429 --> 00:55:19,379
individual one of these to do this I

1006
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:25,498
need to be able to get the sub index

1007
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:28,588
which I believe works like this that's

1008
00:55:25,498 --> 00:55:35,478
how we do the extraction what the heck

1009
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:35,478
is M like just pound to find m

1010
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:42,059
what is that actually doing so this is

1011
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:45,239
bad by the way I probably just did this

1012
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:47,069
because it's you know was expedient if

1013
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:48,900
you're gonna extract one of these things

1014
00:55:47,068 --> 00:55:51,150
you actually want to you usually want to

1015
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:54,119
use the actual extraction so there's

1016
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:56,278
actually an mm extract PS that you can

1017
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:58,469
do and that's probably what we want to

1018
00:55:56,278 --> 00:55:59,909
do that actually does an instruction to

1019
00:55:58,469 --> 00:56:04,349
instruct extract the floating-point

1020
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:07,108
value I think that'll be defined here I

1021
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:13,140
cannot convert argument one from 4x to

1022
00:56:07,108 --> 00:56:20,728
m28 how do I actually access the VEX P

1023
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:26,579
so if I just say hey man I can just do

1024
00:56:20,728 --> 00:56:30,309
that like this

1025
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:33,429
should-should get me the actual Cindy

1026
00:56:30,309 --> 00:56:44,529
register and say hey change that to I

1027
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:46,989
they're right mm okay so the problem

1028
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:51,070
with that is it's inside a for loop that

1029
00:56:46,989 --> 00:56:54,759
the compiler is not able to unroll in

1030
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:57,670
that way so I don't know if you can see

1031
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:02,020
what's going on here we want this to

1032
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:05,139
issue an instruction to unpack that set

1033
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:06,789
of four values into one value can

1034
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:10,329
actually pass to somebody you know

1035
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:13,150
saying we want to extract that directly

1036
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:15,610
but in order to do that we would need

1037
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:18,809
this loop to be unrolled because the

1038
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:23,860
instruction takes an immediate not of

1039
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:29,679
variable so we don't really have any way

1040
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:33,550
of unpacking these directly without that

1041
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:35,379
looping unrolled so I guess for now I'll

1042
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,850
leave it the way it is but we probably

1043
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,590
want to unroll that at some point

1044
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:41,199
because you don't want to do that so I'm

1045
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:45,430
just gonna say to do here Casey we

1046
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:58,119
probably want to unroll the loops and

1047
00:57:45,429 --> 00:58:01,599
make these macros use mm extracts but

1048
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:03,579
anyway other than that caveat which we

1049
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,079
will attack right now the size now

1050
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:07,690
should be specifiable per particle

1051
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:10,360
system which is what we want so if we

1052
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:13,869
don't like those sizes right we should

1053
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:15,010
be able to now inside the spawn when

1054
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:16,779
we're actually making one of these

1055
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:21,160
things I should be able to adjust the

1056
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:23,740
size down to something smaller and then

1057
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:27,159
when we hop around the particles should

1058
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:30,129
be tinier right in theory so there they

1059
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:31,449
are it is updated the executable and so

1060
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:35,789
that's like more like what we would

1061
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:38,439
expect right for some puff-puff sizes

1062
00:58:35,789 --> 00:58:40,929
some puff daddy's

1063
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,568
so we want to make a particle system for

1064
00:58:40,929 --> 00:58:46,480
Puffs specifically and so I'd like to do

1065
00:58:43,568 --> 00:58:49,809
that as well but in at the immediate

1066
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:54,880
moment what I'd rather we do just really

1067
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:56,889
quickly here is fix the displacement so

1068
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,869
I'd like to fix the bug where we're

1069
00:58:56,889 --> 00:59:02,799
getting this sort of nonsense happening

1070
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:04,750
right that that sort of garbage there so

1071
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,160
in order to do that I need to go look at

1072
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,929
how we're doing the displacement because

1073
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:11,710
basically what happens is the particles

1074
00:59:07,929 --> 00:59:15,098
are just bulk displaced you can see them

1075
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:18,190
in here this is just a thing that's like

1076
00:59:15,099 --> 00:59:21,150
we expect you to tell us how to do the

1077
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:24,429
camera offset for any given frame please

1078
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:26,980
so make that happen right like where we

1079
00:59:24,429 --> 00:59:28,328
are not gonna worry about it we're

1080
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:34,019
expecting you to do it for us

1081
00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:37,810
so when we call update and render fire

1082
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:39,130
update and render well I guess it's

1083
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:42,429
actually a big minute of particle

1084
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:44,829
systems here this is actually the thing

1085
00:59:42,429 --> 00:59:47,889
that is going to be the problem for us

1086
00:59:44,829 --> 00:59:51,329
right this value needs to be correct and

1087
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:55,809
at the moment it probably isn't correct

1088
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:59,410
how do we make it so so the frame to

1089
00:59:55,809 --> 01:00:01,719
frame camera delta p has to tell us look

1090
00:59:59,409 --> 01:00:13,299
I don't know what that last p thing is

1091
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:15,759
or even okay so we snap we snap the

1092
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:17,710
camera I don't know whether this to do

1093
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,780
is still relevant we snap where the

1094
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:28,838
camera thinks it is here we let it

1095
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:30,609
update right and then we look at the

1096
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:34,239
difference of where it says the camera

1097
01:00:30,608 --> 01:00:36,699
is now I'm gonna go out on a limb and

1098
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:40,049
say that that doesn't really help

1099
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:44,649
probably because the camera was set

1100
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:48,039
beforehand anyway so I'm not sure that

1101
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:52,150
that method of doing things is really

1102
01:00:48,039 --> 01:01:03,068
gonna work anyway I could be

1103
01:00:52,150 --> 01:01:03,940
long about that and I often am but it

1104
01:01:03,068 --> 01:01:07,009
does seem

1105
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:07,010
[Music]

1106
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:16,019
yeah like that could be an issue the

1107
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:18,900
other thing I would like to do is the

1108
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:21,570
debug light P here that should probably

1109
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,460
go away eventually sometime at some

1110
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:25,559
point as well where is the debug light

1111
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,970
this is the different way because we

1112
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:29,909
probably want to actually start putting

1113
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:34,500
correct lighting in as we go further

1114
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:36,118
down that road as well so right I mean

1115
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,429
we we don't want the hero to be carrying

1116
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:40,350
around too light anymore as we get more

1117
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:43,940
towards correct lighting the hero should

1118
01:01:40,349 --> 01:01:47,130
only be lit when the heroes actually lit

1119
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:50,070
all right so anyway what we want to do

1120
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:51,750
here is figure out what the correct plan

1121
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:54,619
is for how this update works so if I

1122
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:57,710
look at update camera for enemy movement

1123
01:01:54,619 --> 01:02:00,800
just gonna look at what happens here so

1124
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:03,809
what does it actually update here's the

1125
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:06,269
interpolation for the camera that you

1126
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:09,000
can see and it looks like what it does

1127
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:13,280
is it says okay we're going to take the

1128
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,280
camera position here and

1129
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:42,809
it looks like the camera position and

1130
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:51,240
the target position there are just

1131
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:54,469
continually mapped into camera P so I

1132
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:54,469
mean I think

1133
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:15,789
I think that's just completely

1134
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:17,409
irrelevant to what we're doing because

1135
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:21,730
these are all going to be relative to

1136
01:03:17,409 --> 01:03:28,019
the center the sim Center right which is

1137
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:28,019
the region origin it's this thing so

1138
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:35,170
what we really want to know is just

1139
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:36,210
where is that right look where is that

1140
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:41,400
happening

1141
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:45,190
so in here like with this simulate call

1142
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:49,630
and we you know this world sim dot sim

1143
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:55,599
region that's actually the thing we want

1144
01:03:49,630 --> 01:04:01,150
to know how that shifted I believe from

1145
01:03:55,599 --> 01:04:03,900
frame to frame that's sort of my story

1146
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:03,900
and I'm sticking to it

1147
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:16,839
alright so I'm gonna try that I don't

1148
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:18,730
actually know if that'll work but if you

1149
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:21,039
look in here and you see right game

1150
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:26,019
camera we've got this world position P

1151
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:28,779
that's not being used anymore what I

1152
01:04:26,019 --> 01:04:31,059
think I want to do here is say well you

1153
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:35,170
know we've got this simulation center

1154
01:04:31,059 --> 01:04:40,840
nonsense here you can see that happening

1155
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:42,039
here and I think that that is where you

1156
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,829
know whatever the world mode camera

1157
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:46,570
simulation center whatever that says I

1158
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:49,509
think that's the thing we want to track

1159
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:53,200
the updates on so I'm guessing that what

1160
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:55,330
we want is to say that this is actually

1161
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:58,179
where what the coordinate system is

1162
01:04:55,329 --> 01:05:01,000
based around we will look at what that

1163
01:04:58,179 --> 01:05:04,629
is after we're done here we'll actually

1164
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,900
look at the difference in simulation

1165
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:09,340
centers for the camera and that I think

1166
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:12,700
would be what the actual coordinate

1167
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:14,470
change is now I have to go look to see

1168
01:05:12,699 --> 01:05:16,659
when it actually changes the simulation

1169
01:05:14,469 --> 01:05:18,129
center because I don't know but I'm

1170
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:20,440
assuming that it changes it in here

1171
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:23,400
so inside update entity for camera

1172
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:26,108
movement we've got the simulation center

1173
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,400
yeah you can see that when it moves from

1174
01:05:26,108 --> 01:05:29,559
room to room that's when that actually

1175
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,760
gets updated and that's the thing we

1176
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:33,130
actually used in the center of our

1177
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,420
coordinate system right here so I think

1178
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:38,470
that's the thing we would actually need

1179
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:41,858
to offset the particles by right and it

1180
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:44,319
looks like it's almost right but it has

1181
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:47,338
a right at the changeover point it looks

1182
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,338
like we get some issues

1183
01:05:52,239 --> 01:06:00,379
so I believe all I think it's probably

1184
01:05:55,730 --> 01:06:01,730
only a one frame issue and the reason

1185
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:03,950
for that is because the simulation

1186
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:07,670
center this time around is still using

1187
01:06:03,949 --> 01:06:09,769
the old one so my assumption is all we

1188
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:12,380
really need to do is because of that one

1189
01:06:09,769 --> 01:06:14,509
frame we're changing the simulation

1190
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:17,210
center for the next time around what we

1191
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:18,410
probably want to do is just say hey when

1192
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:21,409
we're actually applying that

1193
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:25,579
displacement that displacements going to

1194
01:06:21,409 --> 01:06:27,349
get this applied afterward right so in

1195
01:06:25,579 --> 01:06:35,449
other words this whole thing where we do

1196
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:37,519
the frame displacement this right here

1197
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:41,480
this offset really needs to be done

1198
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:44,059
after the particle has been pushed so

1199
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:46,490
it's really this part is really not

1200
01:06:44,059 --> 01:06:48,739
supposed to happen yet this should

1201
01:06:46,489 --> 01:06:52,659
happen and then the particle should

1202
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:52,659
happen so like

1203
01:07:14,449 --> 01:07:19,228
so I think that would eliminate the one

1204
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:20,848
frame glitch that we would have because

1205
01:07:19,228 --> 01:07:23,009
what was happening there is we're

1206
01:07:20,849 --> 01:07:24,778
applying the frame displacement and then

1207
01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:26,248
rendering the particles but the frame

1208
01:07:24,778 --> 01:07:28,018
displacement won't happen till next

1209
01:07:26,248 --> 01:07:31,139
frame because we're already set up to

1210
01:07:28,018 --> 01:07:32,818
send this frame right and so I think

1211
01:07:31,139 --> 01:07:34,409
that's what we would need to prevent

1212
01:07:32,818 --> 01:07:38,038
that and there you know that there you

1213
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:39,960
go right that fixed it so now our

1214
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:42,979
particles are nice and stable and they

1215
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:46,499
track the world properly as you can see

1216
01:07:42,978 --> 01:07:48,978
they're not very good particles yet they

1217
01:07:46,498 --> 01:07:51,358
don't do what we would want them to do

1218
01:07:48,978 --> 01:07:53,038
but you know we can play with that a

1219
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:55,170
little bit later I think the main thing

1220
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:58,859
that I noticed there's the the alpha

1221
01:07:55,170 --> 01:08:03,568
fade needs to be like way faster this

1222
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:04,858
right here should be more like a bat or

1223
01:08:03,568 --> 01:08:13,130
something right

1224
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:17,538
oops so yeah like when we're actually

1225
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:17,538
spawning those particles here

1226
01:08:20,349 --> 01:08:26,909
I want to zoom in there a little bit and

1227
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:26,909
just see what's going on

1228
01:08:35,229 --> 01:08:41,869
so that's a little better right now one

1229
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:45,880
of the weird things is that I do think

1230
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:48,289
the Alpha fading is is not is not

1231
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:50,960
perceptually linear probably because

1232
01:08:48,289 --> 01:08:56,119
it's happening and everything is gamma

1233
01:08:50,960 --> 01:09:00,439
correct gamma correct fading is not

1234
01:08:56,119 --> 01:09:04,729
perceptual fading I know that sounds a

1235
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:07,338
little bit weird but it does seem like

1236
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:09,459
they fade a little fast you know what I

1237
01:09:07,338 --> 01:09:09,460
mean

1238
01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:15,079
not that the speed is too fast but

1239
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:17,239
rather they it's not it it feels

1240
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:21,769
nonlinear the fading it feels like it

1241
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:23,709
accelerates towards the end which is not

1242
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:30,380
exactly what I think we would want there

1243
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:33,230
does that make sense so I am curious

1244
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:37,130
like you know if you were for example to

1245
01:09:33,229 --> 01:09:40,939
take the Alpha level of this thing here

1246
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:43,270
right and say that you squared that or

1247
01:09:40,939 --> 01:09:50,238
something right so you know if you did

1248
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:51,560
something like this or square root of it

1249
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:54,159
I just wanted I just want to play with

1250
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,160
those two and see

1251
01:10:01,639 --> 01:10:11,590
I guess we're not clamping

1252
01:10:23,909 --> 01:10:34,529
so there's what squared alpha press

1253
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:38,380
square root alpha and again I'm just

1254
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:40,359
playing with it here I just want to see

1255
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:43,140
if any of these looks perceptually more

1256
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:43,139
reasonable to me

1257
01:10:49,488 --> 01:10:57,500
so squared alpha actually looks

1258
01:10:52,250 --> 01:11:02,109
perceptually better to me let's try quad

1259
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:02,109
alpha just curious

1260
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:17,779
so I would say squared alpha looks like

1261
01:11:13,939 --> 01:11:20,509
a more reasonable fade to me that's my

1262
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:21,920
favorite of the over the three just

1263
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:29,480
looking at it it just feels a little

1264
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:31,250
better the way that fades out I would

1265
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:32,959
also say and again this was supposed to

1266
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,979
be spawn fire it's not fire it's puffs

1267
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:38,118
right now so we probably want to change

1268
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:40,069
that but when we're actually doing the

1269
01:11:38,118 --> 01:11:43,908
the spawning of the particles here when

1270
01:11:40,069 --> 01:11:46,189
we look at the the DP I also want these

1271
01:11:43,908 --> 01:11:46,939
to kind of poot outward more than they

1272
01:11:46,189 --> 01:11:51,379
are right now

1273
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:54,919
so I think we want like more of a you

1274
01:11:51,380 --> 01:12:00,409
know sort of a strong outward force in

1275
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:03,279
terms of when you splat down and then I

1276
01:12:00,408 --> 01:12:03,279
think we're good

1277
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:15,250
still seems kind of weak which doesn't

1278
01:12:12,609 --> 01:12:16,988
make a whole lot of sense I guess you

1279
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:19,090
know this is not guaranteed to produce

1280
01:12:16,988 --> 01:12:22,659
motion because it could still pick

1281
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:23,800
things in the middle but it may be one

1282
01:12:22,659 --> 01:12:27,519
of those things where we need to like

1283
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:29,170
ensure a certain amount I just I don't

1284
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:33,610
really want to do a cosign there on

1285
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:35,350
spawn so here's what I will say this it

1286
01:12:33,609 --> 01:12:37,420
should probably where you place it is

1287
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:39,640
probably also where it should go so I

1288
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:45,940
guess what I would say is this probably

1289
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:52,270
also wants to be whatever this random

1290
01:12:45,939 --> 01:12:55,389
between is producing I I probably want

1291
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:57,790
to use it for both right so what I

1292
01:12:55,390 --> 01:13:01,780
probably want to do is say like X

1293
01:12:57,789 --> 01:13:08,859
displacement or rather I probably wanted

1294
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:12,939
to get that displacement so like or like

1295
01:13:08,859 --> 01:13:15,250
a direction you know I mean and just say

1296
01:13:12,939 --> 01:13:17,349
look I'm gonna get two Direction values

1297
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:23,890
here and I'm going to use the direction

1298
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:26,410
the same direction value to both place

1299
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:37,719
the puff relative to where the hero is

1300
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:40,738
and to spawn the puff you know to give

1301
01:13:37,719 --> 01:13:43,289
it its velocity and and that way

1302
01:13:40,738 --> 01:13:50,789
hopefully it makes a little more sense

1303
01:13:43,289 --> 01:13:50,789
right except for some reason

1304
01:13:52,929 --> 01:14:04,859
Oh oops that's not what I meant to do

1305
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:04,859
that

1306
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:11,110
mm said expression expands that thing

1307
01:14:08,649 --> 01:14:12,579
out to put one in each of the lanes so

1308
01:14:11,109 --> 01:14:14,289
that was creating four particles that

1309
01:14:12,579 --> 01:14:17,019
all were exactly the same which

1310
01:14:14,289 --> 01:14:22,350
obviously we don't want to do so let me

1311
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:22,350
just change briefly how that's happening

1312
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:31,000
there you go

1313
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,179
so that's what we actually needed to do

1314
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,179
there

1315
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:40,900
that way we'll still get four different

1316
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:43,780
particles hmm but obeying the exact same

1317
01:14:40,899 --> 01:14:48,099
thing as I was saying before why can we

1318
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:49,329
not do multiply here F 32 for X should

1319
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:52,980
should be able to take a multiplier

1320
01:14:49,329 --> 01:14:52,979
right can we just not implement that

1321
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:12,510
looks like we didn't it doesn't really

1322
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:15,689
matter because I can just do this the P

1323
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:31,289
scale and the DP scale can just be made

1324
01:15:15,689 --> 01:15:33,899
into their own values here right so I

1325
01:15:31,289 --> 01:15:38,369
think that should do it and then we can

1326
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:40,500
get proper particle placement there for

1327
01:15:38,369 --> 01:15:44,640
some definition of particle our proper

1328
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:46,140
rather and then you can see now it's

1329
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,640
maybe a little bit too much right but

1330
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:49,289
now it seems to be working better right

1331
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:51,060
that's more like what we would expect

1332
01:15:49,289 --> 01:15:52,979
we also would probably in the future

1333
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:55,560
want to spawn these kind of opposite the

1334
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:57,179
direction you were hitting so if you

1335
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,890
were gonna if your whatever direction

1336
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:00,390
you're going you probably hit the

1337
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:02,579
opposite one and when you stop would

1338
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:04,980
probably go a particular way as well so

1339
01:16:02,579 --> 01:16:06,449
we probably want to like tune that but

1340
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:09,179
that's that's more what I was expecting

1341
01:16:06,449 --> 01:16:10,769
right for puffs but yet they're probably

1342
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:15,510
too fast now so these this should

1343
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:17,130
probably be something lower but we'll

1344
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:20,010
call that a day so all right our

1345
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:22,289
particles are back in that's good our

1346
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:26,579
Arts in that's good too

1347
01:16:22,289 --> 01:16:28,760
so mostly now I don't know we probably

1348
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:32,760
want to go tackle the variant problem

1349
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:34,470
and then probably tomorrow well tomorrow

1350
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,260
we might have to debug the variant stuff

1351
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:39,360
because that's gonna be pretty hairy

1352
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:43,710
tomorrow we can maybe start on the

1353
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:47,880
ground cover stuff or we can go do the

1354
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:52,020
entity entity fix up we're still placing

1355
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:58,520
that chair hilariously in the exit which

1356
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:58,520
is not where chairs should be placed but

1357
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:04,779
let me through let me through

1358
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:14,990
inside the room gencode I don't remember

1359
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:17,590
why it's able to place the furniture

1360
01:17:14,989 --> 01:17:20,719
into that square

1361
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:20,720
[Music]

1362
01:17:27,988 --> 01:17:33,658
I'm gonna say that tile open should not

1363
01:17:30,899 --> 01:17:37,288
include the exits and maybe see if that

1364
01:17:33,658 --> 01:17:41,188
helps so basically like if it says on

1365
01:17:37,288 --> 01:17:44,578
connection so it can't I'm gonna say not

1366
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:47,219
on connection here and just see if we

1367
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:48,688
can patch that for now like creating

1368
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:50,248
some furniture layout code is obviously

1369
01:17:48,689 --> 01:17:53,849
a totally separate thing that we want to

1370
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:57,269
do at some point but for right now I

1371
01:17:53,849 --> 01:18:03,288
just don't want to be blocked by an

1372
01:17:57,269 --> 01:18:03,289
errand chair there we go

1373
01:18:08,349 --> 01:18:14,460
so I make sure it can still go down to

1374
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:14,460
the dungeons yeah

1375
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:35,210
all right that all seems right those

1376
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:35,210
guys want some little boots as well

1377
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:50,050
it's at the end

1378
01:18:54,078 --> 01:19:11,328
that's not maybe could get down here

1379
01:19:02,809 --> 01:19:12,199
further alright um hmm so how much time

1380
01:19:11,328 --> 01:19:19,308
do I have left

1381
01:19:12,198 --> 01:19:23,689
it's 1400 right now so we started at

1382
01:19:19,309 --> 01:19:34,520
what 12:30 right so we have what a half

1383
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:36,529
hour left maybe let's say is that right

1384
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,820
I think that's right

1385
01:19:36,529 --> 01:19:41,059
so I think we've got about a half hour

1386
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:44,299
left trying to think of whether I should

1387
01:19:41,059 --> 01:19:46,159
start down the road to doing the variant

1388
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:49,849
stuff or whether I should do something

1389
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:56,210
else and start the variants first thing

1390
01:19:49,849 --> 01:19:57,889
tomorrow what else do we need to do you

1391
01:19:56,210 --> 01:20:01,069
know other than like big things like

1392
01:19:57,889 --> 01:20:02,690
fixing like finishing the lighting and

1393
01:20:01,069 --> 01:20:05,029
stuff like that

1394
01:20:02,689 --> 01:20:07,339
it's or a small thing I should be doing

1395
01:20:05,029 --> 01:20:13,250
right now that we can do

1396
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:15,828
I could try changing from well no that's

1397
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:17,960
gonna be big too so we went to the

1398
01:20:15,828 --> 01:20:20,750
variants run to the entity change that's

1399
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:25,730
pretty big so those I want to do on

1400
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:29,050
their own day what else are we doing now

1401
01:20:25,729 --> 01:20:29,049
that would make sense

1402
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:36,550
yeah

1403
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:42,719
I think everything that was on my mind

1404
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:44,940
to do is like a day it's like a day long

1405
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,469
thing that probably wants to start the

1406
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:48,029
beginning of the day and there's at

1407
01:20:46,469 --> 01:20:50,658
least three of them that I want to do I

1408
01:20:48,029 --> 01:20:54,029
want to do the ground cover I want to do

1409
01:20:50,658 --> 01:20:56,488
the variant thing I want to do the

1410
01:20:54,029 --> 01:21:02,639
changing to not having entity pieces and

1411
01:20:56,488 --> 01:21:05,178
just entities and I'm just not not

1412
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:07,078
thinking of of what would happen there

1413
01:21:05,179 --> 01:21:12,538
maybe I'll just go play around with

1414
01:21:07,078 --> 01:21:16,590
something then so like what's going on

1415
01:21:12,538 --> 01:21:21,090
right now with our kind of punchy stupid

1416
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:23,010
punch thing I think I'm just gonna play

1417
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:24,900
around stuff oh also why don't we have

1418
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:26,699
any snakes

1419
01:21:24,899 --> 01:21:28,228
we don't ever place any snakes I guess I

1420
01:21:26,698 --> 01:21:36,319
don't know why we don't place a snakes

1421
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:36,320
but I'm just curious

1422
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:48,110
when we actually do a punch here

1423
01:22:09,789 --> 01:22:22,319
so it looks like there's a thing called

1424
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:24,700
angle attack swipe and it looks like

1425
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:33,549
maybe that punch speed is a bit high for

1426
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:36,329
our current purposes and how high is

1427
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:36,329
that glove

1428
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:07,380
tends to be lowered down possibly

1429
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:09,300
because it becomes disconnected so you

1430
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:11,810
can see it drops down to the floor and

1431
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:15,119
I'm not sure why it's doing that

1432
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:17,430
if you look at what happens when it's

1433
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:20,609
that angle offset here is the code for

1434
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:22,680
angle offset it's angle base and then

1435
01:23:20,609 --> 01:23:23,189
it's got like this nonsense going on in

1436
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:35,670
here

1437
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:37,289
and for whatever reason I guess so if

1438
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:42,380
you look this is a fall through case

1439
01:23:37,289 --> 01:23:47,479
right it's basically doing this updating

1440
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:54,380
but it's always hitting this and so I

1441
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:57,839
wonder why why would it have that

1442
01:23:54,380 --> 01:24:02,970
difference between you can see like the

1443
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:06,449
oh well floating I guess is what it

1444
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:14,670
normally is so I guess in any mode

1445
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:16,710
floating just doesn't do anything right

1446
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:18,630
you can see that it it kind of sets

1447
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:20,760
itself back here and it's got a Z

1448
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:27,029
displacement of 5 so this is just kind

1449
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:37,949
of garbage code right like this angle

1450
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:41,300
base I guess this is really the the only

1451
01:24:37,949 --> 01:24:41,300
difference probably

1452
01:24:44,029 --> 01:24:48,208
and we'll want to do like this code will

1453
01:24:46,889 --> 01:24:52,639
get completely rewritten once we

1454
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:52,639
actually you know are working on combat

1455
01:24:52,998 --> 01:24:58,260
but I figured you know since we have

1456
01:24:55,349 --> 01:25:00,389
nothing to do right now it's like so

1457
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:02,489
that should keep the fist stable you can

1458
01:25:00,389 --> 01:25:11,729
see now hunches at the same height just

1459
01:25:02,488 --> 01:25:21,089
make the room that it makes is also a

1460
01:25:11,729 --> 01:25:22,679
bit much I also think it should depend

1461
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:25,498
on the facing direction where it's

1462
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:27,449
hovering probably so we should probably

1463
01:25:25,498 --> 01:25:29,188
do that as well so you know if you look

1464
01:25:27,448 --> 01:25:30,988
at here it's get this angle based thing

1465
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:37,289
so this this hover this piece of hover

1466
01:25:30,988 --> 01:25:41,248
information we actually want to know the

1467
01:25:37,288 --> 01:25:44,819
body facing direction where it creates

1468
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:46,828
an arm - for that well I guess we're not

1469
01:25:44,819 --> 01:25:47,969
no one is but we want to take that body

1470
01:25:46,828 --> 01:25:49,948
facing direction and create a

1471
01:25:47,969 --> 01:25:51,239
displacement vector so the depending on

1472
01:25:49,948 --> 01:25:55,589
which way you're facing the glove should

1473
01:25:51,238 --> 01:25:57,359
look to that side so this is not what we

1474
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:59,489
want right what we actually want to do

1475
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:03,538
is say well there should be an arm to

1476
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:06,058
here which says whatever the body's

1477
01:26:03,538 --> 01:26:09,148
facing direction is we then go out a

1478
01:26:06,059 --> 01:26:12,300
certain you know proportion from that

1479
01:26:09,149 --> 01:26:14,099
along a facing direction and that is you

1480
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:18,360
know where we're actually going to place

1481
01:26:14,099 --> 01:26:22,708
the glove and so that way when we are

1482
01:26:18,359 --> 01:26:25,109
walking around you know it'll it'll pick

1483
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:26,878
a location now if you look at what

1484
01:26:25,109 --> 01:26:28,529
happens that puts the glove directly in

1485
01:26:26,878 --> 01:26:29,969
front of the hero but we probably want

1486
01:26:28,529 --> 01:26:32,728
it to the side of the hero so what we

1487
01:26:29,969 --> 01:26:35,368
probably want to do is add right we want

1488
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:38,280
to rotate the facing direction so that

1489
01:26:35,368 --> 01:26:41,158
we're actually back 90 degrees wound

1490
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:42,389
backwards from where we're actually four

1491
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:44,488
from what the face from where we're

1492
01:26:42,389 --> 01:26:46,590
facing so in other words we want it

1493
01:26:44,488 --> 01:26:48,538
pointing you know we our faces rector's

1494
01:26:46,590 --> 01:26:50,038
which are pointing the glove is to the

1495
01:26:48,538 --> 01:26:53,488
side of that so it's sort of like a

1496
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:55,529
perpendicular right so what I probably

1497
01:26:53,488 --> 01:26:55,998
want to here is just say look why don't

1498
01:26:55,529 --> 01:26:59,868
you take

1499
01:26:55,998 --> 01:27:07,448
a quarter towel off of that before you

1500
01:26:59,868 --> 01:27:10,038
do anything and that's to be an F and

1501
01:27:07,448 --> 01:27:25,279
that way it'll be rotated backwards from

1502
01:27:10,038 --> 01:27:27,590
there so performing that now it feels a

1503
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:30,018
lot more solid right now looking at

1504
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:31,489
where it's actually placed it's it seems

1505
01:27:30,019 --> 01:27:32,900
like it might be a little too high

1506
01:27:31,488 --> 01:27:34,908
though

1507
01:27:32,899 --> 01:27:36,408
just looking you know it's up by his

1508
01:27:34,908 --> 01:27:39,738
head it should maybe be down a little

1509
01:27:36,408 --> 01:27:42,078
bit more from there so like this this

1510
01:27:39,738 --> 01:27:46,399
offset this height offset I don't really

1511
01:27:42,078 --> 01:27:53,179
know you know what we want that to be

1512
01:27:46,399 --> 01:28:03,288
but like you know temporarily let's say

1513
01:27:53,179 --> 01:28:05,179
it's something like that uh so that

1514
01:28:03,288 --> 01:28:16,698
allows our glove to be maybe a little

1515
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:18,139
bit more fun and exciting right and at

1516
01:28:16,698 --> 01:28:19,969
this point we do have a little bit of an

1517
01:28:18,139 --> 01:28:21,618
issue we're like animation wise I'm not

1518
01:28:19,969 --> 01:28:24,649
sure how we want to do that eventually

1519
01:28:21,618 --> 01:28:26,738
look should it should you can see I kind

1520
01:28:24,649 --> 01:28:29,149
of whines a little bit differently where

1521
01:28:26,738 --> 01:28:30,738
should it go to the other side of the

1522
01:28:29,149 --> 01:28:32,658
hero like should we actually track that

1523
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:35,978
and interesting enough it looks like we

1524
01:28:32,658 --> 01:28:38,960
are tracking that for the animation um

1525
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:42,590
so you know so maybe we should so for

1526
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:50,059
example in here the way that's doing it

1527
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:51,529
is I I guess the glove angle current is

1528
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:56,059
what would tell us that piece of

1529
01:28:51,529 --> 01:28:57,800
information so I guess the angle current

1530
01:28:56,059 --> 01:29:01,099
is the thing that we'd need to come in

1531
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:03,559
here I don't know to what extent that

1532
01:29:01,099 --> 01:29:06,710
actually is just an exact angle we could

1533
01:29:03,559 --> 01:29:07,760
use so I'm gonna try throwing that in

1534
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:10,420
there because I don't remember what we

1535
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,420
set that to

1536
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:15,750
well I guess it is it's exactly it's

1537
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:20,800
exactly the amount of Tao rotated around

1538
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:24,279
so it's on the wrong side there so if we

1539
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:26,289
just add that angle current into where

1540
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:56,439
it's floating then I think it'll return

1541
01:29:26,289 --> 01:29:58,868
to the correct side as well so like all

1542
01:29:56,439 --> 01:30:01,359
right so yeah I mean there's there's the

1543
01:29:58,868 --> 01:30:03,069
glove now I don't know that I can

1544
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:04,779
actually punch people with this glove at

1545
01:30:03,069 --> 01:30:14,439
all but it won't be nice to be able to

1546
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:16,929
do so right like I'd like to be able to

1547
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:19,238
hit him I think that feels like about

1548
01:30:16,929 --> 01:30:22,239
the right speed for the glove but I'm

1549
01:30:19,238 --> 01:30:25,118
not 100% sure look maybe it should be a

1550
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:27,879
little bit slower at least at first you

1551
01:30:25,118 --> 01:30:30,578
know again that's hard to say

1552
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:34,090
so because the speed of the glove this

1553
01:30:30,578 --> 01:30:36,849
this part will have to be updated as

1554
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:39,520
well because we probably want the speed

1555
01:30:36,849 --> 01:30:41,590
of the glove to be a parameter of the

1556
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,909
glove you know that can be upgraded and

1557
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:44,170
depending on which glove you're using it

1558
01:30:42,908 --> 01:30:49,808
will change and all that sort of stuff

1559
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:51,639
so those will probably be that does feel

1560
01:30:49,809 --> 01:30:55,590
too small too slow though so I think

1561
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:59,319
five will probably be where that's at

1562
01:30:55,590 --> 01:31:02,800
now if we did want to have some way of

1563
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:05,738
having the glove attack the dude we

1564
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:09,250
would need that you know to to go start

1565
01:31:05,738 --> 01:31:10,359
on the collision detection stuff but we

1566
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:13,359
can probably hack something like that

1567
01:31:10,359 --> 01:31:17,529
I'm pretty pretty quickly just just for

1568
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:20,558
testing purposes so if we go we sort of

1569
01:31:17,529 --> 01:31:21,670
have this notion of hit points we don't

1570
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:22,269
really have a good way to draw them

1571
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:27,219
right now

1572
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:31,510
if we wanted to place the hit points on

1573
01:31:27,219 --> 01:31:35,859
the you know on on the characters that

1574
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:39,389
you're fighting i we had like you know

1575
01:31:35,859 --> 01:31:43,179
ways of doing that already so if we look

1576
01:31:39,389 --> 01:31:56,949
I don't really remember what kind of

1577
01:31:43,179 --> 01:32:07,538
monster we're using here let's see so I

1578
01:31:56,948 --> 01:32:08,979
think it's this ad snake and just

1579
01:32:07,538 --> 01:32:13,029
looking at it it doesn't look like it

1580
01:32:08,979 --> 01:32:18,578
has hit points right so it seems like it

1581
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:32,738
probably wants to do this on the add

1582
01:32:18,578 --> 01:32:34,328
snake just guessing so the snake has hit

1583
01:32:32,738 --> 01:32:35,888
points and then we need a way of drawing

1584
01:32:34,328 --> 01:32:38,859
the hit points which we had in there a

1585
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:40,659
long time ago so as a thing I should

1586
01:32:38,859 --> 01:32:42,158
probably also put a snake in a starting

1587
01:32:40,658 --> 01:32:50,198
room just so we don't have to go down

1588
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:52,359
there every time we want to do because

1589
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:56,198
it takes a while to hop along on the

1590
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:57,488
world for obvious reasons alright so

1591
01:32:56,198 --> 01:33:00,038
there's the hit point looks like we

1592
01:32:57,488 --> 01:33:01,629
still are German so that's good and we

1593
01:33:00,038 --> 01:33:05,729
probably don't want to draw them that

1594
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:08,529
way in you know a limit but you know

1595
01:33:05,729 --> 01:33:09,998
that's fine for now we can see them so

1596
01:33:08,529 --> 01:33:14,319
we would like to do is just be able to

1597
01:33:09,998 --> 01:33:17,859
hit that dude with the glove and have

1598
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:18,308
hip points go down so if we want to do

1599
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:24,238
that

1600
01:33:18,309 --> 01:33:29,349
I believe we don't currently have a

1601
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:33,448
collision volume set up for some of

1602
01:33:29,349 --> 01:33:33,449
these things we've got

1603
01:33:34,939 --> 01:33:43,949
this render volume code here which would

1604
01:33:39,539 --> 01:33:44,909
draw yeah like you can kind of see well

1605
01:33:43,949 --> 01:33:47,010
actually I don't know why I keep

1606
01:33:44,909 --> 01:33:49,139
rebooting so you can see here there's

1607
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:51,630
like one collision volume for like where

1608
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:55,140
the head the leader the leading of the

1609
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:56,069
head is it's totally wrong and not what

1610
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:58,500
we would want anymore

1611
01:33:56,069 --> 01:34:00,779
it's kind of old vestigial remains but

1612
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:03,449
we would need one for the glove because

1613
01:34:00,779 --> 01:34:06,509
in order for the glove to hit enemies

1614
01:34:03,449 --> 01:34:09,569
both the enemy and the glove have to

1615
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:15,600
have one so what we would want to do

1616
01:34:09,569 --> 01:34:28,679
there is again the glove is a separate

1617
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:31,020
entity I think is it so the glove is a

1618
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:32,880
separate entity and you can see that

1619
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:34,620
it's set to collides here but nobody

1620
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:37,409
ever gives it a collision volume so it

1621
01:34:34,619 --> 01:34:38,789
doesn't actually matter that it's set to

1622
01:34:37,409 --> 01:34:41,849
collide it won't help

1623
01:34:38,789 --> 01:34:43,260
right so in here we would need something

1624
01:34:41,850 --> 01:34:45,660
where we said like look the gloves

1625
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:51,619
collision volume is like some collision

1626
01:34:45,659 --> 01:34:54,029
volume you know I mean so you know I

1627
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:56,510
don't really want simple grounded

1628
01:34:54,029 --> 01:34:56,509
collision

1629
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:06,699
I really just want this so here we could

1630
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:09,769
just say here's a rectangle Center dim

1631
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:18,319
call I think we just want to say like

1632
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:21,680
the collision volume for the glove you

1633
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:23,269
know is whatever it is which I don't

1634
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:27,680
know what it is but let's say it's

1635
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:30,320
something like that okay that's nice

1636
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:33,579
blue glow so if we create a collision

1637
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:37,670
volume for the glove and assigned it

1638
01:35:33,579 --> 01:35:40,789
which is what we're doing here then in

1639
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:44,060
theory we should be able to see one

1640
01:35:40,789 --> 01:35:52,550
floating on the glove so if I leave this

1641
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:54,950
and restart like hey look right and that

1642
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:58,489
looks about right it looks like it's

1643
01:35:54,949 --> 01:36:00,800
floating too low maybe but I don't

1644
01:35:58,489 --> 01:36:04,069
really care at the moment too much about

1645
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:07,310
that so when I'm hopping around there if

1646
01:36:04,069 --> 01:36:10,460
I want to if I want to actually hit the

1647
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:15,250
enemy obviously the enemy has to have

1648
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:15,250
one as well so when we create the snake

1649
01:36:16,569 --> 01:36:22,880
which I believe was right here we need

1650
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:27,500
this to have a collision volume on it so

1651
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:29,000
it needs to actually have collision and

1652
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:34,460
that collision needs to be at least

1653
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:37,670
somewhat representative of the of the

1654
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:40,220
entity now looking at the way that works

1655
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:42,220
the offset Z here probably should be

1656
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:46,909
zero

1657
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:51,409
and these things I think were relatively

1658
01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:55,039
like normal size I don't really know

1659
01:36:51,409 --> 01:36:57,829
so if we go run the game and look at

1660
01:36:55,039 --> 01:37:00,619
that snake now it should have a

1661
01:36:57,829 --> 01:37:02,239
collision volume on it as well so we've

1662
01:37:00,619 --> 01:37:04,789
got one on the glove we'll have one on

1663
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:06,979
the snake and then we can do something

1664
01:37:04,789 --> 01:37:11,090
when they hit each other but that's code

1665
01:37:06,979 --> 01:37:13,339
that we wrote like you know Dave 20 or

1666
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:15,139
something of handmade here way back when

1667
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:19,069
that's gonna need to get polished up

1668
01:37:15,139 --> 01:37:21,770
certainly but let's take a look so there

1669
01:37:19,069 --> 01:37:30,380
you go you can see the collision volume

1670
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:32,119
there so now we know we will know when

1671
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:36,859
these two things hit each other but we

1672
01:37:32,118 --> 01:37:45,769
just won't we just don't do anything to

1673
01:37:36,859 --> 01:37:48,259
does this guy go upstairs ever I guess

1674
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:50,590
not but I don't know why did we tell him

1675
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:50,590
not to

1676
01:37:56,140 --> 01:38:02,890
hey man can you go upstairs see if I

1677
01:37:59,949 --> 01:38:09,809
push him towards it I'll just block him

1678
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:15,789
so he has to go up the stairs no yeah

1679
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:18,510
can you go upstairs yes go up there go

1680
01:38:15,789 --> 01:38:20,710
up there he doesn't want to go up there

1681
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:22,060
so I guess they don't go upstairs

1682
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:23,500
they'll go from room to room but they

1683
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:25,300
don't go upstairs I guess it must win it

1684
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:26,770
searches it must do a search that

1685
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:31,989
doesn't allow it to change the height

1686
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:33,580
very much I don't know all right so what

1687
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:36,670
we want to do is know when we hit this

1688
01:38:33,579 --> 01:38:40,739
thing and I think I could be wrong about

1689
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:40,739
this but there's still code in there

1690
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:52,739
that moves entities and looks for

1691
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:54,939
collisions right somewhere in here

1692
01:38:52,739 --> 01:39:04,739
there's like a move entity call here it

1693
01:38:54,939 --> 01:39:04,739
is this code is like totally garbage

1694
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:11,490
it's just kind of hanging around but it

1695
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:18,550
does still work and so I think

1696
01:39:11,489 --> 01:39:21,099
technically like you can see here we've

1697
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:23,640
got sort of these handle collision calls

1698
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,640
and

1699
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:35,029
I really don't know if they even do

1700
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:39,050
anything anymore but they probably are

1701
01:39:35,029 --> 01:39:41,719
still getting called no I'm saying so if

1702
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:43,190
we want something damage oriented if we

1703
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:45,340
go down and look at the move entity you

1704
01:39:43,189 --> 01:39:47,929
know move entity is gonna get called and

1705
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:52,119
when it does these tests and it looks at

1706
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:57,740
can collide what's gonna do is say

1707
01:39:52,119 --> 01:40:02,180
speculative collide here and then handle

1708
01:39:57,739 --> 01:40:06,439
collision here so handle collision does

1709
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:10,210
something it looks like basically no

1710
01:40:06,439 --> 01:40:13,969
actual thing takes place though so

1711
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:16,029
whatever we were gonna do on handle

1712
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:18,710
collision just doesn't happen anymore

1713
01:40:16,029 --> 01:40:29,750
so you know if we wanted to implement

1714
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:30,680
something where the glove if we wanted

1715
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:32,689
to implement something where the glove

1716
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:38,329
is that here's the other thing is move

1717
01:40:32,689 --> 01:40:39,710
entity is that actually every being

1718
01:40:38,329 --> 01:40:41,329
called on the glove because the glove

1719
01:40:39,710 --> 01:40:45,439
just gets placed this way so we really

1720
01:40:41,329 --> 01:40:51,920
just need to check for overlap with the

1721
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:55,849
glove for doing that hit testing but the

1722
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:58,899
actual movement does anyone actually

1723
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:58,900
ever call that

1724
01:41:13,329 --> 01:41:17,800
so I'm not really sure

1725
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:37,590
I'm not 100% certain if that actually

1726
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:39,869
ever happens in fact I'm pretty positive

1727
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:42,090
it doesn't because if you look at what's

1728
01:41:39,869 --> 01:41:47,099
going on here we fill out like the DP

1729
01:41:42,090 --> 01:41:48,869
and stuff but I'm sorry we fill out like

1730
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:51,660
the position but we don't fill out the

1731
01:41:48,869 --> 01:41:55,649
DP or anything so it's never gonna

1732
01:41:51,659 --> 01:41:59,430
actually think that it needs to to move

1733
01:41:55,649 --> 01:42:01,500
this entity in that way and in fact we

1734
01:41:59,430 --> 01:42:03,150
know that we really just don't move

1735
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:05,010
entities in that way anymore right

1736
01:42:03,149 --> 01:42:10,199
entities don't move that way

1737
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:12,690
so really all we need to do is rather

1738
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:17,369
than having the concept of entities move

1739
01:42:12,689 --> 01:42:21,000
is we really just need to do the overlap

1740
01:42:17,369 --> 01:42:26,279
test between the entities and see which

1741
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:28,050
one you know I'm saying so I think if

1742
01:42:26,279 --> 01:42:30,119
you just if zero this out and just said

1743
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:32,520
move entity is done it's not happening

1744
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:34,470
anymore I don't think anything changes

1745
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:40,970
right I don't think we actually get any

1746
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:40,970
issues do we maybe we I mean we might

1747
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:49,399
you can see that like nothing happens

1748
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:49,400
right everything's fine

1749
01:42:57,059 --> 01:43:03,670
so if we want to change this to being

1750
01:43:00,069 --> 01:43:06,189
overlapped testing and not based on new

1751
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:11,309
vanity there we can still use the same

1752
01:43:06,189 --> 01:43:13,839
code though to do the overlap testing

1753
01:43:11,309 --> 01:43:16,570
but we need to be able to see where the

1754
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,069
entity was and where the entity is you

1755
01:43:16,569 --> 01:43:20,319
know what I mean so we need to kind of

1756
01:43:18,069 --> 01:43:23,288
know those two things like where was it

1757
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:25,389
and where is it now so we need to know

1758
01:43:23,288 --> 01:43:30,130
like the difference in where the

1759
01:43:25,389 --> 01:43:33,998
position is of this thing and then where

1760
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:35,550
the position a you know where it started

1761
01:43:33,998 --> 01:43:38,559
the frame and where it ended the frame

1762
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:43,288
so we probably want to do something

1763
01:43:38,559 --> 01:43:43,288
where we just like look and see you know

1764
01:43:43,738 --> 01:43:57,328
the start P is going to be you know that

1765
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:59,949
and then the end P it's going to be back

1766
01:43:57,328 --> 01:44:03,969
and once we know those two things then

1767
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:06,158
we can actually do overlap testing but

1768
01:44:03,969 --> 01:44:08,429
the problem is you know again that's not

1769
01:44:06,158 --> 01:44:10,719
quite good enough because since each

1770
01:44:08,429 --> 01:44:13,649
since all the things are moving and we

1771
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:13,649
want to check pairwise

1772
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:26,189
we probably want to put the collision

1773
01:44:24,270 --> 01:44:27,450
detection there so we'll stop that now

1774
01:44:26,189 --> 01:44:30,379
because we're at the five-minute warning

1775
01:44:27,449 --> 01:44:33,479
and probably don't really want to do

1776
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:35,670
anything more with that but that's where

1777
01:44:33,479 --> 01:44:38,009
that's where we would go with that

1778
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:39,810
information right and we'd sort of

1779
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:42,690
change this move entity call into a

1780
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:44,550
thing that just takes all the movement

1781
01:44:42,689 --> 01:44:46,349
vectors does the collision detection on

1782
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:48,810
them and reports back to us which ones

1783
01:44:46,350 --> 01:44:50,910
hit so that we can do our collision

1784
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:53,719
handling there all right I'm going to go

1785
01:44:50,909 --> 01:44:53,719
ahead and go to the QA

1786
01:45:04,229 --> 01:45:09,119
we don't know where Molly went we've

1787
01:45:05,789 --> 01:45:11,300
lost we've lost the puss the puss is

1788
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:11,300
gone

1789
01:45:16,238 --> 01:45:21,250
oh cool someone if you were here on the

1790
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:23,980
pre stream someone asks a question about

1791
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:26,949
amiga Oz and I was explaining the fact

1792
01:45:23,979 --> 01:45:28,479
that it used to interrupt to do

1793
01:45:26,949 --> 01:45:30,069
scheduling but I didn't know which

1794
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:37,029
interrupt it was using I could remember

1795
01:45:30,069 --> 01:45:41,229
I and VT VT l MKS wrote back now that

1796
01:45:37,029 --> 01:45:46,029
it's the V blank interrupts so you know

1797
01:45:41,229 --> 01:45:47,709
how you had on the old CRTs you know the

1798
01:45:46,029 --> 01:45:49,300
the beam would trace left to right and

1799
01:45:47,710 --> 01:45:51,699
when it got to the bottom it would go

1800
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:53,260
back to the top that time where it

1801
01:45:51,699 --> 01:45:56,859
returns back to the top that was called

1802
01:45:53,260 --> 01:46:01,510
the vertical blank and so on the Amiga

1803
01:45:56,859 --> 01:46:05,829
there was a piece of hardware I want to

1804
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:08,020
say it was probably like hard like

1805
01:46:05,829 --> 01:46:10,269
hardwired into the copper chip I'm

1806
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:13,660
assuming the copper chip was the thing

1807
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:16,330
that did scanline based operations and

1808
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:17,889
so I'm assuming that the copper chip is

1809
01:46:16,329 --> 01:46:22,619
the thing that would trigger the V blank

1810
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:26,160
interrupts on the 6800

1811
01:46:22,619 --> 01:46:28,359
so you know the 6800 has interrupts and

1812
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:30,159
you know the way a CPU works right is

1813
01:46:28,359 --> 01:46:32,349
it's got like pins that come in the

1814
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:34,300
contribute interrupts and stuff I'm

1815
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:36,579
assuming the copper chip was connected

1816
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:38,140
to the 68k in such a way as to be able

1817
01:46:36,579 --> 01:46:40,238
to trigger that interrupts when it hit

1818
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:42,190
the V blank that's what I would assume I

1819
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:43,659
don't actually know I don't remember I

1820
01:46:42,189 --> 01:46:45,819
don't know that I ever knew the answer

1821
01:46:43,659 --> 01:46:48,880
that question really I know that both

1822
01:46:45,819 --> 01:46:51,639
the 68k and the copper knew about the

1823
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:53,380
vertical blank but I don't know how they

1824
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:55,539
would talk to each other necessarily but

1825
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:57,310
anyway so that was what the Amiga OS

1826
01:46:55,539 --> 01:46:58,869
used for scheduling for pre-emptive

1827
01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:59,950
scheduling I didn't know which interrupt

1828
01:46:58,869 --> 01:47:01,329
they were using I didn't know if there

1829
01:46:59,949 --> 01:47:03,880
was like a separate timer interrupt or

1830
01:47:01,329 --> 01:47:04,899
whatever I couldn't remember but it

1831
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:09,699
sounds like what they do is they use the

1832
01:47:04,899 --> 01:47:11,199
vertical blank the VTL MKS said default

1833
01:47:09,699 --> 01:47:14,439
quantum was 4 so I'm assuming what that

1834
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:18,059
means is you get 4 V blanks or four

1835
01:47:14,439 --> 01:47:22,960
sixtieths of a second and then it would

1836
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:24,039
consider swapping you is that is that

1837
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:28,539
what you mean is that what default

1838
01:47:24,039 --> 01:47:34,840
quantum was for for V blanks

1839
01:47:28,539 --> 01:47:39,199
which on the Amiga would be 62 ii in in

1840
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:41,630
mtsc so probably japan in the US but it

1841
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:44,630
would probably have been for 50th of a

1842
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:46,010
second on PAL because the display

1843
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:47,690
centers were different so the V blank

1844
01:47:46,010 --> 01:47:50,739
timing was different

1845
01:47:47,689 --> 01:47:54,460
NTSC with 60 fields a second pal was 50

1846
01:47:50,739 --> 01:47:54,460
again if I remember correctly

1847
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:10,589
yeah four frames

1848
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:10,590
four fields technically right probably

1849
01:48:11,579 --> 01:48:15,659
but those are sort of like frames

1850
01:48:23,748 --> 01:48:27,889
but that's pretty cool it's a little

1851
01:48:26,179 --> 01:48:32,809
weird it means you're multitasking runs

1852
01:48:27,889 --> 01:48:36,469
at different speeds depending on whether

1853
01:48:32,809 --> 01:48:39,110
it's pal or ntsc right the number of

1854
01:48:36,469 --> 01:48:45,439
instructions you can execute before

1855
01:48:39,109 --> 01:48:49,719
being swapped out is different so it it

1856
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:53,719
means that you get finer grained

1857
01:48:49,719 --> 01:48:57,019
multitasking but that's probably slower

1858
01:48:53,719 --> 01:48:59,328
overall because it's swapping more

1859
01:48:57,019 --> 01:49:03,229
frequently which takes more work on the

1860
01:48:59,328 --> 01:49:05,389
NTSC amigas and on the PAL amigas you

1861
01:49:03,229 --> 01:49:11,469
would get less fine-grained multitasking

1862
01:49:05,389 --> 01:49:11,469
but probably faster overall probably

1863
01:49:12,609 --> 01:49:16,939
what collisions be solved in a

1864
01:49:14,448 --> 01:49:21,348
physically based way or in a hacky way

1865
01:49:16,939 --> 01:49:23,960
well collisions are not physically based

1866
01:49:21,349 --> 01:49:27,110
or hacky in terms of detecting them

1867
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:29,719
right how you detect collisions can be

1868
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:32,210
hacky or cleaned totally separately of

1869
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:35,569
whether it has any of physics in terms

1870
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:40,460
of resolving the motion we don't really

1871
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:42,978
have any of that that I can think of we

1872
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:45,460
don't have any physically based movement

1873
01:49:42,979 --> 01:49:49,670
our movement is all programmatic so

1874
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:52,578
there there isn't like you know free

1875
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:56,139
flying bodies that like will bounce off

1876
01:49:52,578 --> 01:49:58,248
walls or something everything is more

1877
01:49:56,139 --> 01:49:59,449
specific about how it's supposed to move

1878
01:49:58,248 --> 01:50:03,529
like it's supposed to hop from here to

1879
01:49:59,448 --> 01:50:07,879
here or something and we don't it's like

1880
01:50:03,529 --> 01:50:10,759
hard hard coded gameplay wise that a hop

1881
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:12,650
is an exact thing we don't allow you to

1882
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:16,789
get like interrupted in the middle of a

1883
01:50:12,649 --> 01:50:20,179
hop for example and we do that because

1884
01:50:16,788 --> 01:50:22,340
we don't want any gameplay bugs which

1885
01:50:20,179 --> 01:50:25,158
would obviously occur if you allowed

1886
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:26,538
physics to happen in there because then

1887
01:50:25,158 --> 01:50:28,399
you could have like two people who are

1888
01:50:26,538 --> 01:50:30,828
both trying to hop to ask where the

1889
01:50:28,399 --> 01:50:32,779
squares there we're on get occupied and

1890
01:50:30,828 --> 01:50:34,158
now there's nowhere for them to go and

1891
01:50:32,779 --> 01:50:35,569
you're just in a bug there's no

1892
01:50:34,158 --> 01:50:37,329
resolution because now you've got two

1893
01:50:35,569 --> 01:50:41,170
people occupying one square which is not

1894
01:50:37,329 --> 01:50:44,109
in the game and all that's rough right

1895
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:46,510
so we don't allow that we have like a

1896
01:50:44,109 --> 01:50:48,369
rigorous logic for how things are

1897
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:50,050
allowed to move and physics is not

1898
01:50:48,369 --> 01:50:52,899
allowed to intercede because you would

1899
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:54,039
end up in buggy scenarios I mean all

1900
01:50:52,899 --> 01:50:56,409
games that are physically based have

1901
01:50:54,039 --> 01:50:59,500
bugs all over the place right and that's

1902
01:50:56,409 --> 01:51:00,880
fine if your priority is the physical

1903
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:02,170
movement because it's like look we don't

1904
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:04,359
care that we'll get into a bunch of

1905
01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:06,460
buggy gameplay scenarios because we're

1906
01:51:04,359 --> 01:51:07,599
trying to provide like physics based

1907
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:09,430
gameplay that's the point

1908
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:10,450
right but in our case we don't care

1909
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:11,560
about physics based gameplay like

1910
01:51:10,449 --> 01:51:14,159
physics doesn't have anything to this

1911
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:18,490
game it's not an interesting part of it

1912
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:20,229
so we have like specific logic things

1913
01:51:18,489 --> 01:51:22,149
that have to occur to that because we

1914
01:51:20,229 --> 01:51:23,799
want to prevent being able to get into

1915
01:51:22,149 --> 01:51:26,189
any of those gameplay bug scenarios

1916
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:35,140
where you've got things that impossible

1917
01:51:26,189 --> 01:51:39,339
configurations that then explode no NTSC

1918
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:41,410
is not 30 FPS it's 60 FPS but the F

1919
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:45,400
stands for fields not frames because it

1920
01:51:41,409 --> 01:51:47,529
renders the odd scan lines in 162 second

1921
01:51:45,399 --> 01:51:50,229
and then the even scan lines on the

1922
01:51:47,529 --> 01:51:55,630
other 62 second and the V blank happens

1923
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:59,679
both times at least that's my

1924
01:51:55,630 --> 01:52:06,699
recollection and then I want to say that

1925
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:08,710
pal was 25 and 50 right so it did every

1926
01:52:06,699 --> 01:52:11,349
50th of a second it would do even on

1927
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:13,750
fields even odd fields every 50 a second

1928
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:14,170
doing either/or so it was just a little

1929
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:20,079
slower

1930
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:21,069
I assume that has to do with power

1931
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:25,689
standards

1932
01:52:21,069 --> 01:52:30,389
I assume like European powers 100 based

1933
01:52:25,689 --> 01:52:30,389
and our power is 120 based or something

1934
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:34,119
I'm assuming this I'm gonna do that I

1935
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,470
don't know K that has nothing to do with

1936
01:52:34,119 --> 01:52:38,829
it

1937
01:52:34,470 --> 01:52:40,600
probably has nothing to do with it but

1938
01:52:38,829 --> 01:52:44,609
anyway there was probably a reason I

1939
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:44,610
just don't know what that reason was

1940
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:55,389
what was the reason why why wasn't ESC

1941
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:55,388
60 in PAL 50 does anyone know

1942
01:53:08,889 --> 01:53:16,779
Wow was I actually right that it was the

1943
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:18,340
power standard that means I've looked

1944
01:53:16,779 --> 01:53:21,630
this up before and it did lodge itself

1945
01:53:18,340 --> 01:53:21,630
in there and then I forgot

1946
01:53:59,010 --> 01:54:03,730
this is due to the fact that mtsc is

1947
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:06,309
journal using countries the utility

1948
01:54:03,729 --> 01:54:11,649
frequency of 60 Hertz and Palin

1949
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:15,610
countries with 50 Hertz so I think that

1950
01:54:11,649 --> 01:54:17,439
is actually what I was saying like the

1951
01:54:15,609 --> 01:54:28,059
power standard is actually more

1952
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:32,529
appropriate for one or the other so I

1953
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:35,970
guess I guess I was right

1954
01:54:32,529 --> 01:54:35,969
am I really I don't know

1955
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:48,980
also Anna informed us that this the Hat

1956
01:54:43,819 --> 01:54:50,299
flower is is supposed to go on the side

1957
01:54:48,979 --> 01:54:53,119
of the head that's why I thought this is

1958
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:56,949
it so this is actually our bad it was

1959
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:56,949
not a bug it was not an art

1960
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:07,859
all right and if we are no questions

1961
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:07,859
then I will call it a day

1962
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:32,119
alright let's wrap it up I should update

1963
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:34,250
to the new remedy as well there's

1964
01:55:32,119 --> 01:55:35,479
there's like two new versions of remedy

1965
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:38,409
past the one we're on I think we're on

1966
01:55:35,479 --> 01:55:42,079
like two four and they're on two five

1967
01:55:38,409 --> 01:55:45,559
yeah I'm sorry two six there George is

1968
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:47,059
on two six now all right thank you for

1969
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:48,530
joining me for an episode of a handmade

1970
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:51,440
hero it's been a pleasure coding with

1971
01:55:48,529 --> 01:55:52,789
you as always if you would like to

1972
01:55:51,439 --> 01:55:54,289
follow along series at home you can

1973
01:55:52,789 --> 01:55:56,180
always peer to the game on handmade hero

1974
01:55:54,289 --> 01:55:59,180
org it comes to the source code if you

1975
01:55:56,180 --> 01:56:02,450
want to play around with it tomorrow I'd

1976
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:03,560
like to do the variant stuff and that'll

1977
01:56:02,449 --> 01:56:05,389
probably take all day

1978
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:08,780
well not all day but you know you'll

1979
01:56:05,390 --> 01:56:10,490
take the time for the episode and get

1980
01:56:08,779 --> 01:56:11,859
that fixed in that way that's solid and

1981
01:56:10,489 --> 01:56:13,939
we don't have to worry about it anymore

1982
01:56:11,859 --> 01:56:14,809
so we'll probably do that we probably

1983
01:56:13,939 --> 01:56:17,119
have time for anything else

1984
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:19,460
if we do we'll move on to the cover

1985
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:20,809
ground cover because that's sort of the

1986
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:24,439
next big thing we should probably get

1987
01:56:20,810 --> 01:56:28,340
into the system that's about it for

1988
01:56:24,439 --> 01:56:30,739
today if you or shouldn't that come back

1989
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:31,940
tomorrow see you here for that until

1990
01:56:30,739 --> 01:56:33,109
then have fun programming I'll see

1991
01:56:31,939 --> 01:56:35,379
everyone on the Internet take it easy

1992
01:56:33,109 --> 01:56:35,380
everybody
