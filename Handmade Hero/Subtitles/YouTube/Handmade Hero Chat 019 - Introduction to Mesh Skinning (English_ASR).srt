00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,669
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:09,419
Hero the show recode a complete game

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:12,960
live on stream we have a off-topic

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:14,759
stream today by way of apology I

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,560
realized I did an off topic stream

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,100
yesterday because I wanted to talk a

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:23,939
little bit about broken shaders in unity

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,580
games and for pixel art and how you

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,259
would fix them if you were making unity

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,399
game for example and had access to the

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,250
shaders

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,469
we tried maybe to go actually fix them

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,500
ourselves but we found that Nvidia is n

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,329
site tool actually doesn't let us edit

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,950
compiled shaders so we aren't really

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,200
able to inject our shaders without doing

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,629
a little more craziness which we didn't

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,760
really want to get into so but that's

19
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,759
what we did yesterday and I realized

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,339
that that was pretty rude to do and I

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:58,378
apologize because we had had a standing

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,840
request for zr i zi on the chat about

23
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,179
doing an explanation of how skin

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,478
domesticating works they'd been asking

25
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:09,688
for that for a while and i was like when

26
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,688
we get a break we'll do it and then i

27
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:14,158
went and did something that i wanted to

28
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:17,758
talk about without even thinking about

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,229
that so I apologize I don't think 0zi is

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,469
with us today but I'm sure he'll watch

31
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:26,280
the vodkas he's been asking for this so

32
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:28,469
we will cover skin meshes today and then

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,030
we'll go back to regular or handmade

34
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:35,759
hero programming next time so first let

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,430
me say that this is kind of a nice

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,560
change which is to say that this is

37
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,259
actually a topic that I have a ton of

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,439
professional experience with you know

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,909
there's only so many things in in a game

40
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,938
programming career that you've really

41
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,299
spent like you know months of time

42
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:56,309
working on particular problems and other

43
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,159
things you maybe have experience with

44
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,469
but they're not necessarily a specialty

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,070
as far as skinned meshes are concerned I

46
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:08,299
mean I spent I guess four to five years

47
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:10,378
at rad game tools literally just doing

48
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,989
skinned mesh character animation

49
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,379
technology both the export side and the

50
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,439
run

51
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:20,129
side so it's something that I have a lot

52
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:23,310
of experience doing and so I am happy to

53
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,139
go into how it all works because I feel

54
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,550
like unlike some topics where I have to

55
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,799
give a disclaimer where I'm like I don't

56
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,719
really know that much about this we

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,410
should probably go take a look at an

58
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,180
expert's thing in this case I think I

59
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:39,629
can probably give you a pretty complete

60
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,280
explanation of at least the initial set

61
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,699
now one of the things that you have to

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,740
remember about 3d mesh getting is it's

63
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,969
kind of there's a set of core things

64
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,830
that you have to understand about it and

65
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:51,870
that's what we'll go over today and then

66
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,870
there's a lot of things on top of it

67
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,080
that you may or may not want to be aware

68
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,060
of depending on what your goals are and

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,370
what you're actually trying to

70
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,550
accomplish with it you know are you

71
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,830
Pixar are you trying to give character

72
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,820
or animators a lot of stuff to work with

73
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,320
that has to do with pose and new

74
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,579
traditional animation techniques that

75
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,739
sort of thing

76
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,030
do you have an infinite amount of time

77
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,620
well not infinite my time but do you

78
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,349
have a substantial amount of time to

79
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,140
render a given frame so you're thinking

80
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,639
about things beyond just you know the

81
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,949
the things that can happen at 60 frames

82
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,619
a second so we'll try to mention what

83
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:34,109
some of those technologies are with the

84
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,650
caveat that they are changing all the

85
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,830
time

86
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,849
so every year I mean this is what

87
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:46,200
SIGGRAPH and stuff and euro graphics

88
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:49,259
oftentimes are focused on in there you

89
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:52,589
know animation character animation mesh

90
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,719
getting papers they are new advances

91
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,479
trying to make better tools for doing

92
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,659
this sort of stuff and so we will cover

93
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:05,039
today thus all the core stuff that you

94
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:07,349
will need to know to get yourself

95
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,949
started on character animation with mesh

96
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:12,930
skinning and then you will have to

97
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,699
decide where you want to go from there

98
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,639
because there's no way to give a

99
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,108
complete description of all the rest of

100
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,069
it because not only is it changing all

101
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:23,250
the time but there are many different

102
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:25,019
paths you might go down so as you might

103
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,480
expect this is going to be a very

104
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,930
blackboard heavy

105
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,689
the episode so let's just dive in and

106
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:41,780
talk about it so here we are this is

107
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:43,819
introduction to mesh skinning and I'm

108
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:47,299
gonna talk primarily about 3d mesh

109
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:51,139
beginning but 3d mesh gaming is sort of

110
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,240
a superset of 2d sprite skinning and so

111
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:55,519
if you know how to do 3d mesh getting

112
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,710
you also know how to do 2d sprite

113
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,589
skinning so if you are someone who wants

114
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:03,259
to learn how to make like bone based

115
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:06,679
models for 2d graphics that allow them

116
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:07,879
to warp around you can also use all the

117
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,939
same things I'm talking about here for

118
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,860
that by just eliminating Z literally

119
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:15,350
there isn't really anything else to it

120
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,120
there are some specific things you care

121
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,220
about when you're doing 2d mesh skinning

122
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,490
but maybe you don't need to know as much

123
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,410
about for for 3d mesh getting that are

124
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,930
like specific to how things may be like

125
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,370
overlap in sprite space because you know

126
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,069
if you're not doing real 3d you might

127
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,720
not know some of those things but for

128
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:36,170
the most part all of the math is the

129
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,720
same alright so let's start with the

130
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,280
basis for 3d graphics that everyone has

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,760
learned or should have learned before

132
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:46,579
they come to this introduction because

133
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,629
I've got to start somewhere so if we're

134
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,879
talking about introduction in mesh

135
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:55,699
canang I'm assuming that you understand

136
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:57,920
a basic transform okay now a basic

137
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,899
transform is something that's like intro

138
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,340
in any 3d thing we've covered it on

139
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:03,139
handmade hero so you can go look at it

140
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:04,819
if you want to know about it by using

141
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,990
the search tools on handmade hero dot

142
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:11,599
org slash watch and so I expect you'll

143
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:17,590
know what I'm talking about when I draw

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:20,270
like a coordinate frame like this oops

145
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:22,189
so you going up there when I draw a

146
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:25,419
coordinate frame like this and say that

147
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:28,610
we can write a transform that takes a

148
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:32,120
basic coordinate system like this one

149
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:35,600
from some orientation that is considered

150
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,000
a like a rest pose or a neutral modeling

151
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,420
pose around which we build something

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,120
some kind of

153
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,160
aybe right built out of vertices and

154
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,899
triangles or really whatever you want as

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,400
long as there are points involved that

156
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:51,599
we can talk about in this space I expect

157
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,489
that you'll understand what I mean when

158
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,370
we say we have a transform that can go

159
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,400
from here this coordinate system to this

160
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,949
coordinate system right and so you

161
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,379
expect to be able to transform the

162
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:06,509
coordinate system and have all of the

163
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,009
points go with it and we've done this on

164
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,310
handmade here oh and again we typically

165
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,990
write these as matrices so you might see

166
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,540
me right oftentimes on handmade here oh

167
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,990
that like a new point right which is a

168
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,569
point in this face is equal to whatever

169
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,569
the point was in this space times some

170
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:29,099
matrix which is in the way right this

171
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:31,500
matrix T transforms these points in this

172
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,150
order to you know the new points that

173
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,910
you're going to use and you see us do

174
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:38,009
this on handmade here all the time and

175
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,540
again there's nothing magical about a

176
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,259
matrix and I just want to underscore

177
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,600
that again

178
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,339
they're not magical you don't have to

179
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,950
treat them like a black box in fact

180
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,119
there's an entire episode I'm sorry

181
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,550
there's a higher lecture on my website

182
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,319
how to open a black box that talks about

183
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,160
why you don't have to think of matrices

184
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,550
as a black box

185
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:01,439
but these matrices are just vector

186
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,079
components or you know they're numbers

187
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:07,529
we understand if you look at a matrix

188
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,930
right typically they're four by four and

189
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:12,329
if you look at a matrix you can read off

190
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,400
the components by breaking them into

191
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:16,740
some structured things the ones we

192
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:21,000
typically look at they typically look

193
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:23,810
like this and what you'll see is the

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,319
first three components going down right

195
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:31,920
in the first column of the matrix this

196
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:36,000
is the new x-axis so this vector here

197
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:38,610
goes here this vector here goes here and

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,039
this vector here goes here

199
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:46,740
okay the location of the origin so where

200
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,829
the vectors emanate from which is

201
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,620
normally 0 0 0 in the resting position

202
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,220
you know I will often refer to this as

203
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,049
the rest

204
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,879
position because we need something to

205
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:58,198
differentiate this origin from the one

206
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,120
that we're actually drawing so we have

207
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:02,188
the rest position and then sort of like

208
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,769
the drawing position sometimes this is

209
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:06,360
called like world's face right where I'm

210
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:08,730
trying to put the thing but it doesn't

211
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,068
have to be world space it could be

212
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,528
anything we're doing we have some sort

213
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:15,448
of source which is the rest and then we

214
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:18,208
have some destination which is whatever

215
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:21,628
we're actually generating anyway this

216
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:23,489
point in space goes here and then the

217
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:25,230
bottom is zero zero zero one now if you

218
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,899
don't understand why this is again it's

219
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,269
a very simple homogeneous transform the

220
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,669
ink I shouldn't put P there this is like

221
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:35,490
the the origin so let me just put like o

222
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:38,149
or something for origin high because I

223
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:41,370
was using P for the point so I apologize

224
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:47,149
I'm dad with math naming I I never

225
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:51,060
picked good letters and again a simple

226
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:53,159
just review of how matrices work if in

227
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,559
here we're talking about some kind of

228
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,958
transform and I have some source point

229
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:01,318
which I'm calling P here I have a px py

230
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:03,719
PZ and then a traditionally we put a one

231
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:06,058
in here that's for using what are called

232
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,439
homogeneous coordinates or 4x4 matrices

233
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:09,328
where you're encoding only three

234
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:11,039
dimensions that extra dimension is to

235
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:13,289
allow you to do that affine movement to

236
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,849
allow you to move things around again

237
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:16,049
outside the scope of this I just want to

238
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,870
make sure you understand all this if you

239
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:20,758
don't understand anything any particular

240
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,379
part of this doesn't ring a bell to you

241
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,399
you should go back to some of the

242
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:25,829
episodes in Hammond here where we talk

243
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,750
about it or go to look at your favorite

244
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:29,429
introductory 3d textbook they will cover

245
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,019
this this is just the basic stuff so

246
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,789
this is all stuff you need to or you be

247
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,339
familiar with but anyway point being

248
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:36,539
when points come in here the way they

249
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,009
multiply these out is very

250
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,129
straightforward if you do the matrix

251
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:43,139
math you will see that PX multiplies the

252
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:47,550
x coordinate so you end up with PX x

253
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:53,100
plus py multiplies the why do i PZ

254
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:54,838
multiplies the Z Z and the origin just

255
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,149
gets added on because it multiplies this

256
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,829
right so this is the I don't know

257
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:02,159
position of the origin I need to give it

258
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:04,379
some name that stands out I don't know

259
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,879
it's bad to say P uh I I don't know what

260
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:07,200
to tell you we'll figure out some better

261
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,659
names later you should

262
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,940
understand this basic transform it's

263
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:14,339
very very simple the elements of the

264
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,470
vector multiply the elements in the

265
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,860
matrix such that they pull through these

266
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:22,230
axes right XY and Z and you can see

267
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,560
exactly what this is doing I'm going px

268
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:28,950
along the x axis I'm doing py along the

269
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,919
y axis I'm doing PZ along the z axis and

270
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,680
so wherever I had worked myself out to

271
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,689
before in the rest position I am working

272
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,000
myself out to the same exact position

273
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,980
just in a new coordinate frame that's

274
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,690
been placed somewhere in the world very

275
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,220
very straightforward when you think

276
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,740
about it in terms of these components

277
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,019
get yourself comfortable with this by

278
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:53,009
either reading up on it or watching old

279
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:57,059
episodes of handmade hero because that

280
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:59,340
is the one major part of what we need to

281
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:00,839
talk about today so you need to be

282
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,580
comfortable with it get comfortable with

283
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,759
it now the other thing you need to be

284
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,129
comfortable with is the linear blend and

285
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,159
I said on the handmade hero I think I

286
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:13,620
said at some point go with the box there

287
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,509
I think I said it Hammond here at one

288
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:19,379
point they're sort of like this concept

289
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:21,269
of of desert island code like you know

290
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:23,700
they always say like you gonna stuck on

291
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:25,740
a desert island like which which three

292
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,509
albums do you take with you to listen to

293
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,509
because you got a pick like the three

294
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:33,179
you're gonna really rely on so if you

295
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:35,129
had to take three you know pieces of

296
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:36,000
code with you to a desert island or

297
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,659
something I don't know

298
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,580
these pieces of math let's say the

299
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:43,500
linear blend is kind of one that I think

300
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,960
should make the top three for any game

301
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,350
programmer because it's such a

302
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,990
cornerstone operation matrix transform

303
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,029
for points is probably another one so

304
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:57,299
you're talking about two of the big ones

305
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:59,610
here they are heavily leaned on to do

306
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:01,199
mesh Kinning so linear blend you've got

307
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,600
to be comfortable with it what is it

308
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,290
well a linear blend is just a way of

309
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,820
saying one of two ways of thinking about

310
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:11,459
it and I'll show you both of them

311
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,740
they're very simple the one we typically

312
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,920
encounter most often is the concept of a

313
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,649
ramp between two values essentially and

314
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,699
so for example I might have a T

315
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:25,169
parameter

316
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,720
right which is the blend amount and it

317
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:30,029
ranges from zero to one inclusive so it

318
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,350
can be zero it can be one or it can be

319
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:34,019
any floating-point number in between

320
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:40,080
those two and then we write the equation

321
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:43,379
1 minus T times some value plus T times

322
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,950
some other value equals the blended

323
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:48,659
version right and so you know this is

324
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,250
maybe a point or something whatever

325
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,169
we're blending I don't know what these

326
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,639
are they could be anything literally

327
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:57,689
anything that admits a linear

328
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:01,319
combination so points matrices pixels

329
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:05,370
whatever you want this equation is a

330
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,890
thing that goes from A to B as T goes

331
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,919
from 0 to 1 so if these were points in

332
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:14,639
space and this was a and this was B then

333
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:18,419
if T is equal to 0 you have 1 minus T

334
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,509
which is 1 times a so that's just a plus

335
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:23,969
0 times B which means I have no I've

336
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:26,129
gone nowhere I've just stayed at a if I

337
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,850
put one into the equation I have 1 minus

338
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:32,909
1 which is 0 right so no a plus 1 times

339
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,370
B which is just B so at at one I'm at B

340
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:37,709
and anywhere in between I am a

341
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,529
combination of the two so point five

342
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,269
point five you know if T is 0.5 I get

343
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:45,360
point five here and point five here I'm

344
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:46,949
right in the middle if T is 0.25 I get

345
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,860
point seven five here which means I'm

346
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:53,400
about that close to a 0.25 here right so

347
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:57,230
by setting T to some proportion I get a

348
00:14:53,399 --> 00:15:03,299
linear movement between these two points

349
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:09,180
or to anything colors doesn't matter all

350
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:12,349
right so these two fundamental concepts

351
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:16,919
to graphics programming in general the

352
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:19,950
basic transform of things in 3d space by

353
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,870
using 4x4 matrices or if you didn't want

354
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:25,080
to use matrices even just this equation

355
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,940
the idea that we have three axes x y&amp;z

356
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,200
that describe an orientation in space

357
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:33,120
and then some basis to put them around

358
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,290
like a point in space that forms the new

359
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,418
origin

360
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:38,129
and then we're taking input points in a

361
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:42,149
some source space and reinterpreting

362
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:44,369
them to move them this equation and this

363
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:47,009
equation are core now I said there's two

364
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:49,528
ways to think about this and this is by

365
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:52,139
by moving to the second way of thinking

366
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:54,778
of a linear blend that's how we'll sort

367
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,359
of start ourselves into our mesh canang

368
00:15:54,778 --> 00:16:00,389
topic ok

369
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:03,959
so another way to think of a linear

370
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:05,909
blend is to think of it as something

371
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,638
that doesn't just involve a single

372
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:12,058
scalar value that moves me between two

373
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:15,839
things ok so what I'd like to introduce

374
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:23,308
today is the notion of convex linear

375
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:25,859
blending now what I mean by convex

376
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:29,009
linear blending is I mean to say that

377
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:32,970
rather than thinking about a T value

378
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:35,759
that ranges from 0 to 1 and that gives

379
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:39,089
us a way of moving between two points a

380
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,298
and B I'd like to talk about the concept

381
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:46,350
that for any collection of things we can

382
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:50,788
create an equation that always gives us

383
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:56,089
something that that will result in a

384
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:59,879
answer a blend that is inside the set of

385
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:02,789
inputs we give it right so if you think

386
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:09,298
about that original linear blend 1 minus

387
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:10,740
T times a plus T times B and we think

388
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:12,028
about what these points are and maybe

389
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,349
you know let me start to write this a

390
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:16,048
little more formally so that we can kind

391
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:17,338
of get I can try to rectify my problem

392
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:19,288
from earlier so I'm at where I always

393
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:22,888
named things poorly let's say that we've

394
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:25,769
got p 0 1 minus T times B 0 and then I

395
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:27,448
want to add P 1 and then I want to get

396
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:28,980
my p prime which is the resulting point

397
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,210
let's actually start to talk about the

398
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,500
math try to be a little bit more

399
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,509
specific about it because this is

400
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,859
supposed to be giving you the

401
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:37,200
fundamental basis you can use to

402
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:39,028
understand these things this is the same

403
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,759
equation we wrote before if I drew it

404
00:17:39,028 --> 00:17:44,579
out I would have p 0 here right I would

405
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:48,029
have P 1 here and then this line between

406
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:51,899
them is everywhere that P Prime

407
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:58,470
could appear by setting T equal to

408
00:17:51,900 --> 00:18:00,690
something between zero and one right now

409
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,779
it's crucial to understand that this

410
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:06,330
already creates a convex linear blend we

411
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:08,730
have created a convex region we have

412
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:11,699
created an enclosed region it happens to

413
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,890
have no area but it is a line and no

414
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,650
matter what we do we will never move

415
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:19,200
outside of it T zero to one will always

416
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:22,259
four disappoint that's inside of it now

417
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,130
we can and oftentimes again we will call

418
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:28,890
this interpolation right you hear that

419
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,980
interpolated interpolation why because

420
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:34,110
we are inside the two sample points that

421
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:40,009
we're given we're given p 0 and P 1 we

422
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:45,389
are interpolating right now we could

423
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:49,190
extrapolate right this is totally

424
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:51,690
possible how would we do it like this

425
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,519
that's the worst infinity sign I've ever

426
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,640
drawn no it's not probably doing the

427
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,680
worst one by letting T range from

428
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,780
negative infinity to infinity right

429
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,019
giving it the entire range it can do

430
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:07,619
anything it wants we would start to move

431
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:10,619
beyond these two points but still along

432
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:13,289
the line so rather than a convex linear

433
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:14,639
blend or an interpolated linear blend we

434
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:17,730
are creating something that allows us to

435
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,900
go outside of our sample point right we

436
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,029
are creating something that is not

437
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,070
contained within the shape originally

438
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:26,970
implied in this case a line segment

439
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:29,819
between our points right so if for

440
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:32,160
example I set it to negative 1 I would

441
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:35,339
end up with something that was out here

442
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,950
at negative like whatever this vector is

443
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:40,559
that you want to call P 1 minus p 0 I

444
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,779
would end up with the negative version

445
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,480
of that vector taking me out to the

446
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:48,420
blend if I call it let's give this a

447
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,019
name let's call this our f of T right

448
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,970
our F of negative 1 is all the way out

449
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:57,839
here at the negative of that vector

450
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:59,819
because if one moves me to here negative

451
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,798
1 moves me to here because it is linear

452
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:04,528
motion so we expect it to

453
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:08,128
always move the same distance for any

454
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:11,159
size of T that is equal if I move it

455
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:14,459
plus two I expect it to move the same

456
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:17,129
distance as negative two right if I go

457
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,980
from 0.5 to one that should be the same

458
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:22,618
distance as 0 to 0.5 because as long as

459
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,558
I go the same distance in T I should go

460
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:28,769
the same distance in space and that is

461
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:31,230
why we say linear blending right that's

462
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:33,179
the linear in linear blending if this

463
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:37,288
were nonlinear if there were squared

464
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:40,859
terms in here if T appeared as a power

465
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:44,608
other than just linear right just to the

466
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:46,980
first then would be a nonlinear blend

467
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:50,099
right it would be a blend that does not

468
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,069
move the same amount for a linear change

469
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:55,589
in T linear changes in T produce linear

470
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:57,749
changes in space nonlinear changes in T

471
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:59,759
would produce nonlinear changes in space

472
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:01,319
but that we wouldn't call that nonlinear

473
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,989
blending really because again we're just

474
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:07,769
the blend is still linear we're non

475
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:09,629
linearly changing T right but just to

476
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:11,730
point out there is such a thing as

477
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:14,878
nonlinear blending and that is when

478
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,368
these values appear squared 4 cubed or

479
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:20,719
any other power in the blend equation

480
00:21:17,368 --> 00:21:23,730
itself because then a linear change in T

481
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,579
translates into a nonlinear change in

482
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:29,639
space hopefully that makes some clear

483
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:31,558
sense to you ok so what I'd like to do

484
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:34,378
is introduce the concept of the convex

485
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,898
linear blend as a more general form of

486
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:38,998
this equation and that will get us into

487
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:42,358
mesh skinning if I wanted to look at

488
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:47,368
this more broadly I could say well you

489
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:49,829
know what is this actually doing where

490
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:53,069
did I get this notion of 1 minus T plus

491
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:55,918
T and could I think of that more broadly

492
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:58,470
and the answer obviously is yes if I

493
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,859
just start to think of this as a sum of

494
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:05,028
terms where those terms have certain

495
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:07,439
constraints I can start to form a more

496
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:10,519
Universal way of thinking of a convex

497
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,169
linear blend where I can get more

498
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:15,180
interesting results more interest more

499
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:18,020
power out of the same I

500
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:21,630
gyah without doing any more work okay so

501
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:25,259
what is this actually amount to let me

502
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:28,260
rewrite this equation as c0 which is

503
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:30,599
going to be equal to one minus T and c1

504
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:32,129
which is going to be equal to T what

505
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,429
does that make this equation well one

506
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:39,900
minus T is just c0 so that's times p0

507
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:43,680
plus T is just c1 so I have P one here

508
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:46,170
and then I get my result right c0 p 0

509
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:50,100
plus C 1 P 1 equals P Prime

510
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:52,830
okay same exact equation all I have done

511
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,929
is replace these terms with different

512
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:58,710
names I just named them something else I

513
00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:01,500
said C 0 is 1 minus T C 1 is T same

514
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,259
equation does the same thing I input

515
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,690
some value T I produce these two results

516
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:07,410
and I get my blend now why would I want

517
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,820
to do that

518
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,460
well hopefully you can see the obvious

519
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:15,349
step coming next what if I just said

520
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:19,259
well forget this let's just talk about

521
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:22,709
arbitrary numbers I can multiply by p 0

522
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:27,240
and P 1 to equal P Prime suppose I

523
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:31,789
didn't know about 1 minus T and T in the

524
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:36,750
first place right suppose I didn't know

525
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:39,960
well if I said I wanted to produce some

526
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,960
kind of equation where C 0 and C 1

527
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,940
multiplied p 0 and P 1 in such a way

528
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,660
that they produced a point like I was

529
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,600
doing and I didn't know about 1 minus T

530
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,540
and T as being the magic way to set them

531
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:58,199
so that I always got things in between

532
00:23:54,539 --> 00:24:03,059
them right so P prime here's p 0 here's

533
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:05,640
P 1 right what would I have done to

534
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:07,769
figure that out right like how would I

535
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,170
have figured out that that's what I

536
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:13,680
wanted to do right what was it that was

537
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:15,960
guiding me to produce this T 1 minus T

538
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,660
thing in the first place and if we

539
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,009
understood that deeper idea would we be

540
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,960
able to produce something more powerful

541
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:25,769
than the simple version that just moves

542
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,460
us between the two points right and so

543
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:31,089
the answer is that

544
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:35,308
these these right here actually come

545
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:39,009
from a more systemic way of looking at

546
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:41,648
these components in a summed vector

547
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:44,230
equation like this it comes specifically

548
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:46,469
from a thing called norms which I've

549
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:49,538
talked about on handmade hero before and

550
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,360
what norms are is there a way of looking

551
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:55,869
at a series of parameters such that you

552
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:57,548
get certain results out of them when or

553
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:00,519
it's certain ways of measuring them and

554
00:24:57,548 --> 00:25:03,429
certain ways of unifying them with those

555
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:05,889
measurements right and so let's talk

556
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:07,538
about one you actually know probably

557
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,240
intuitively already and then one you

558
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:11,589
might not actually know you've probably

559
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,179
seen it before but maybe you haven't

560
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:14,230
thought about it on handmade hero if

561
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,309
you've watched the whole thing then you

562
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,919
do know about these because I've already

563
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:19,839
talked about them but we'll what kind of

564
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,330
ease into it because people probably

565
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:26,648
will watch this stream stand alone as

566
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:31,119
opposed to as part of the series okay so

567
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:33,849
let's talk about Euclidean norms so what

568
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,918
we've got when we talk about vectors in

569
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:39,459
space right in a standard coordinate

570
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,980
system that's Euclidean which is pretty

571
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,778
much all we use in basic graphics right

572
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,460
3d 2d when you're not talking about

573
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:46,630
solves or rotations and stuff like that

574
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,288
you're typically talking about Euclidean

575
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:53,710
spaces for points in 3d space what we

576
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:56,349
tend to do is we tend to always just

577
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,179
have known from when we started the

578
00:25:56,349 --> 00:26:00,459
concept that you know we've got some

579
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:03,190
vectors you know like I've got a vector

580
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:06,340
here and you know I've got some point or

581
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:09,100
something so I've got a vector say V and

582
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:10,209
that vector will actually you know what

583
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:12,788
let's just let's call something else

584
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,038
I've got a vector a and that vector in

585
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:17,349
space goes from the origin to some

586
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,298
location typically is what we think of

587
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:21,730
as a displacement or something but we

588
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:24,339
also can talk about the vector as itself

589
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:27,720
pretty simply by saying things like it

590
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:30,158
has a length right like my vector a

591
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,620
actually has a length which is typically

592
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,679
written like this and that length is the

593
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:37,808
distance along the line you would have

594
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,730
to go if you were walking in that

595
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:40,930
direction and you wanted to go from the

596
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,180
origin to the end point

597
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,430
right there's like a distance here right

598
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:49,660
and this length is equal to that

599
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,430
distance okay now we think of those as

600
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,700
distance the length of the vector that

601
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:56,320
sort of thing but it's really actually

602
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:00,809
computed you know obviously by the

603
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:05,500
Pythagorean theorem which you all know

604
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:08,710
which is ax squared plus ay Y squared

605
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,740
Square rooted right is going to be equal

606
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:14,350
to this distance right the D and why is

607
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,549
that the case well it's the Pythagorean

608
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:18,309
theorem right here

609
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:19,210
we know that ax is this we know that a Y

610
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:20,889
is this

611
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:25,420
we know the Pythagorean theorem says

612
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:28,240
that ax squared plus ay Y squared oops

613
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:32,050
equals what every one cost length of a

614
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,120
squared yeah so if I want to know my

615
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:36,339
length of a let me write that as length

616
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,949
of a if I want to know my length of a we

617
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:41,109
square root this term here and we get

618
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,170
the foot familiar equation that everyone

619
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:46,659
knows for the length of a vector but

620
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,580
this length of a vector even though I

621
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,019
don't know that Pythagoras probably knew

622
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:52,179
about it because he was sort of blazing

623
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:56,589
a trail so I feel like norms kind of got

624
00:27:52,180 --> 00:28:00,310
introduced afterward the Euclidean to

625
00:27:56,589 --> 00:28:02,709
norm is actually this this equation here

626
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:04,509
the ax squared plus ay Y squared Square

627
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:09,819
rooted it's actually something called

628
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:12,730
the Euclidean to norm to norm is what we

629
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:15,939
call it when we square each term and

630
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,339
then square root it the two is the

631
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:22,140
square and square root and I can write

632
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:30,009
the concept of a norm more directly as

633
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:35,410
saying that my norm of the power I don't

634
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:37,000
know I don't want to use P norm of it's

635
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:41,650
gonna be a theme I'm bad at naming them

636
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:45,009
norm of and let's say well that's even

637
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:49,630
worse god I hate naming things norm of

638
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:53,109
gee I don't know norm of G so the

639
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:54,269
Euclidean norm for some number is just

640
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:56,848
equal to the

641
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:59,098
some of all of your terms in the vector

642
00:28:56,848 --> 00:29:02,458
so however long it is right if I've

643
00:28:59,098 --> 00:29:06,658
2-dimensional it's - its equal to the

644
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:10,649
gia througt of each of those raised to

645
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:13,139
the g power and this goes on for however

646
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:17,548
many terms the vector you have if I have

647
00:29:13,138 --> 00:29:20,368
a x a y AZ aw blah blah blah blah blah

648
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:24,888
right these would all appear here to the

649
00:29:20,368 --> 00:29:27,509
G power summed G rooted okay

650
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:29,519
the two norm is the one we're most

651
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:31,828
familiar with intuitively because it is

652
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,969
the length of the vector and what the

653
00:29:31,828 --> 00:29:39,178
two norm does is it tells you how long

654
00:29:34,969 --> 00:29:41,269
the vector is if you went along it the

655
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:44,639
hypotenuse of this triangle

656
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:47,308
but there's another norm there's in fact

657
00:29:44,638 --> 00:29:53,189
an infinite number of norms anything you

658
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:59,628
plug in here so norm two is the length

659
00:29:53,190 --> 00:30:02,450
of the vector but norm one what is that

660
00:29:59,628 --> 00:30:05,968
well we know how to produce it right

661
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:08,338
norm one is a one throat which is

662
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:12,119
nothing right that just goes away and

663
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:15,749
then everything to the 1 power first

664
00:30:12,118 --> 00:30:19,138
power and that goes away so if I take ax

665
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:20,308
to the 1 plus ay Y to the 1 1 rooted

666
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:23,939
what do I get

667
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:30,298
well I just get ax plus ay Y right and

668
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:33,119
that's it now if you were a math pendant

669
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:35,368
which I'm not I wish I was it's handy to

670
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:36,418
know a lot of math you would probably

671
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:40,428
know whether or not these are

672
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:43,919
traditionally absolute valued or not I

673
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:45,329
want to say that they are so I want to

674
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,269
say that traditionally the norm is

675
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:51,088
written like this so the 1 power removes

676
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:53,278
the sign but I don't really know that

677
00:30:51,088 --> 00:30:55,200
that's true so I'm not gonna state that

678
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,078
strongly here one way or the other

679
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,639
that's for math people to know so I'm

680
00:30:58,078 --> 00:31:02,190
gonna say that they aren't right now

681
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:05,008
because the 1 power itself doesn't

682
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,349
necessarily imply that so let's just say

683
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:08,099
for now that the one norm doesn't do

684
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:11,009
that but

685
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:15,449
I would encourage you to talk to a more

686
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:16,650
math person I would talk to you I would

687
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,090
encourage you to go look up the math

688
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:20,700
there if you want to know the actual

689
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:22,288
real answer for our purposes it won't

690
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,029
matter because we want to just be able

691
00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:27,079
to understand both whichever one we want

692
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:30,690
that makes okay

693
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:34,649
so coming back to what we wanted to know

694
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:36,960
here well we've got ax plus ay Y is the

695
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:42,538
Euclidean 1 norm we know that the 2 norm

696
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:45,509
tells us this right the length of a what

697
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:49,259
does the 1 norm tell us well what is ax

698
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:53,339
plus ay why it's walking out this far

699
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:57,298
and then walking out this far it's the

700
00:31:53,339 --> 00:32:00,869
route along the outside of the triangle

701
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:04,319
formed right so the 2 norm gives us this

702
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:07,019
the 1 norm gives us this entire distance

703
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:17,009
it's the Manhattan distance as we

704
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:19,139
sometimes call it of the vector right so

705
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:22,879
you know we've got this is as the crow

706
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:29,038
flies you could say if I have to write

707
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:37,500
norm of 1 is the Manhattan distance norm

708
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:40,529
of 2 is the crow distance right so using

709
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:44,250
these two norms we can actually think in

710
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:46,500
a more systemic way about which of these

711
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,900
things we want to talk about we can

712
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,929
calculate the the crows 5 distance by

713
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,150
doing norm - we can do the Manhattan

714
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:58,380
distance by doing norm 1 which is the

715
00:32:54,150 --> 00:33:01,860
sum of the sides right if that makes

716
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,600
sense ok so why did I want to go down

717
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:06,209
that digression well it wasn't a

718
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:09,899
digression it was how we explained this

719
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:13,769
in order to produce the original 1 minus

720
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:18,390
TT blend equation what we were trying to

721
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:21,400
do here right is we were trying to make

722
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:25,840
it so that we always produced

723
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:30,009
values that lie between p0 and p1 and by

724
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:32,470
taking the Euclidean 1 norm of the

725
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:35,980
weights if you will of the of the

726
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:38,019
coefficients on p0 and p1 we were

727
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,690
essentially trying to say how do we

728
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:42,879
produce a coherent equation that allows

729
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:44,890
us to always produce a convex blood

730
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,870
between them and let me show you how

731
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:54,480
that works so if you want to make sure

732
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:56,769
that your Manhattan distance is 1 right

733
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,210
if I want to make sure that I've always

734
00:33:56,769 --> 00:34:03,069
got a distance of 1 when I go along the

735
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,880
length of my vector again we all have

736
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:10,630
learned how to do this from working on

737
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,360
our our 3d stuff we know that if we take

738
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:16,240
the crows fly's distance right if we

739
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,579
take the length of the vector we can

740
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:22,689
always divide the vector by that value

741
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:24,940
and get a unit vector right we know this

742
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:27,820
we do it all the time why does that work

743
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:31,470
because this has a length of whatever

744
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:34,899
the length is right this has a length of

745
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:37,059
the length of a this is the length of a

746
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:39,489
if I divide something with the length of

747
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:41,380
a by the length of a I get a length of 1

748
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:44,168
right it's because vector math

749
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,640
distributes to its components so if each

750
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:47,710
of the components get multiplied by

751
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,679
something that's exactly how much less

752
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:54,579
you get in the in the the squared sum

753
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:57,340
right so normalization to the two norm

754
00:34:54,579 --> 00:35:00,190
we know what will happen the two norm

755
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:02,620
dividing by the two norm produces a 2

756
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:04,900
norm of one because what a surprise you

757
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:07,269
divide the components by whatever the

758
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,670
two norm value is you get a two norm of

759
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:13,329
one out the other end the same is true

760
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:18,010
of dividing by the one norm a over the

761
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:22,000
two norm I'll write that like this norm

762
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:25,120
two of a so I can pass a n so norm 2 of

763
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:31,960
a ranked over a this equals a unit

764
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:35,889
vector but a over the one norm right

765
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,470
that equals a sum of one

766
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:41,710
it's just this before was Pythagorean

767
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:45,459
theorem some to one right it rooted

768
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:49,019
equals one this year is just the term

769
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,249
sum to one so this means ax plus ay Y

770
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:53,949
dot that dot however many you have I

771
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:55,929
guess equals one right

772
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:58,538
it allows me to make all of these things

773
00:35:55,929 --> 00:36:00,368
sum to one and how do I do that well

774
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:02,440
exactly the same way I did it here right

775
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:05,858
I compute the norm and then I divide the

776
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,048
components of a by that norm again super

777
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:10,420
simple it means I take a and divide it

778
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:13,389
by ax plus ay y plus however many of

779
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,278
that components it has right so this is

780
00:36:13,389 --> 00:36:17,348
just a long-winded mathematical way of

781
00:36:15,278 --> 00:36:18,818
introducing you to all of these concepts

782
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:21,190
that are helpful to kind of know where

783
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:23,889
they come from but it comes back down to

784
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:27,220
understanding where this basic idea came

785
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:30,038
from it was the one norm how did I get

786
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:34,058
this let's look at it now and start to

787
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:39,999
pull it apart okay so I am wondering how

788
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:42,700
one might arrive at these well if I was

789
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:46,028
to just say that I have a vector right

790
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:48,399
of these a vector C and its components

791
00:36:46,028 --> 00:36:50,108
are C 0 and C 1 so I'm talking about the

792
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:56,980
two weights I'm gonna use in the

793
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:59,498
equation here oops so I'm talking about

794
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:03,179
this where I've got you know Caesar and

795
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:07,498
C 1 and I want to know what would I do

796
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:10,629
you know if I wanted to produce a

797
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:13,598
version of this equation that's always

798
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,940
going to give me something in between p0

799
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,950
and p1 right so it should always lie

800
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:25,088
along this line okay well if I was to

801
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:26,828
take the 1 norm of C 0 and C 1 right if

802
00:37:25,088 --> 00:37:31,690
I was to take the 1 norm of this vector

803
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:35,559
so norm 1 of C what would I get right I

804
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:40,210
would get C 0 plus C 1 right that's the

805
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:43,119
winner so if I just had any two values

806
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,679
that I placed in here you know who knows

807
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,210
what they were there was something I

808
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,359
don't know what they were there were any

809
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,619
values you gave me for C 0 and C 1 and I

810
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,440
wanted to turn it into something that

811
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:56,650
fell into the comics one let's do a one

812
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,780
normalization on it right let's do the

813
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,960
one normalization on it that means I

814
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:07,570
divide C by the one norm this is the one

815
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:08,199
norm I'm dividing C by the one norm what

816
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:12,039
will I get

817
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:17,169
well I'll get C zero over C 0 plus C one

818
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:20,710
right and C one over C 0 plus C 1 I mean

819
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:22,750
that's the new vector right and what do

820
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,389
I know about this new vector I know that

821
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:27,670
it always has to sum to 1 you can see

822
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:30,309
this trivially by inspection if I add

823
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,769
these two terms together not knowing

824
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:34,480
what their components are or anything

825
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:36,369
else about them you can see that they

826
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,219
both have the same denominator so they

827
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:44,380
would add directly on top and C 0 plus C

828
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:49,419
1 over C 0 plus C 1 is 1 right so we

829
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:53,410
know that that actually happens ok so

830
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:56,500
now what we could say is look if we

831
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:59,199
wanted to simplify these equations down

832
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,989
a little bit and say how would we write

833
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,549
1 in terms of the other all right we've

834
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:05,799
got a we've got a post situation

835
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,230
Molly beam Molly no no we're right in

836
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,539
the middle we're right in the middle of

837
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:12,550
a of a blackboard session baby you got

838
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:14,170
to wait a little bit all right I think

839
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,310
the post wants to play but we're gonna

840
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:20,650
have to finish what we're doing here

841
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:23,949
first ok so if we know that these things

842
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:28,360
sum to 1 right and by the way if we look

843
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:29,559
at what what happens here if we look at

844
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,390
what we were talking about with our

845
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:34,750
original blend equation what's the 1

846
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:37,989
norm of these well 1 minus T plus T

847
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:41,710
right is just 1 minus T plus T the T is

848
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:44,699
cancel and you get 1 right so you can

849
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:47,619
see already that that 1 minus T and T

850
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:51,219
satisfy the 1 norm equation already

851
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:54,359
right they are a simplified version of

852
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:58,239
that but if we wanted to try and get

853
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:01,000
these values more simplified let's see

854
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:02,318
how we might do it and again I'm always

855
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,789
a little weak on the mass Oh

856
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:05,018
you'll have to forgive me if I if I felt

857
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:06,579
a little bit no matter how much I work

858
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:09,578
with this stuff I've it always falls out

859
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:13,269
a little bit but anyway so c0 over C 0

860
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:14,709
plus C 1 and C 1 plus C 0 over C so

861
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:16,478
let's say I wanted to create some new

862
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:23,440
equations here that are just based on

863
00:40:16,478 --> 00:40:28,538
B's c0 over c0 plus c1 c1 over C 0 plus

864
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:31,838
C 1 right so if we took a look at these

865
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:34,630
equations here right and we were to say

866
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:37,389
alright I'm trying to make some new

867
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,519
versions and what I want to do is I want

868
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:44,920
to rewrite this so that it's only in

869
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:47,528
terms of 1 you know one variable right I

870
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,680
want to create something that satisfies

871
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:54,369
these properties but such that I won't

872
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:55,989
ever actually have to put in two random

873
00:40:54,369 --> 00:41:01,390
values and then do the simplification

874
00:40:55,989 --> 00:41:04,958
right so if I was to do some

875
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:06,248
multiplication out on these guys here

876
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:07,778
actually I don't know if this is really

877
00:41:06,248 --> 00:41:09,488
gonna work I may skip that part because

878
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:11,409
I probably would have to think about how

879
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:13,199
to do the substitution and I don't want

880
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:16,598
to get bogged down in that yet so

881
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,979
suffice to say if I was more on top of

882
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,479
my math game right now I would probably

883
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:21,548
be able to show you how you easily do

884
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:24,009
the substitutions that reproduce the 1

885
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:25,119
minus TT here to get to here as opposed

886
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:28,059
to just pointing out the fact that

887
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,219
obviously this is the simplification of

888
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:32,199
these equations that produce one

889
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:34,838
variable which can all twich always

890
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:38,650
result in something pre set up for

891
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:41,349
normalizing to the 1 norm right but you

892
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:44,019
can see that behavior in the 1 minus TT

893
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:46,599
and that is the crucial property of

894
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:49,838
these equations that actually make it

895
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,809
always stay inside where it actually

896
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:57,338
started the p 0 p 1 it is specifically

897
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:59,349
the norm one of these C values it is the

898
00:41:57,338 --> 00:42:02,528
fact that they are normalized to the one

899
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:05,670
norm that keeps them inside between p0

900
00:42:02,528 --> 00:42:10,599
and p1 now why does that happen

901
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:13,209
like what is it that makes that what is

902
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:15,729
it makes the one norm special as far as

903
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:16,299
summing things together well if you

904
00:42:15,728 --> 00:42:19,029
think of

905
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,100
out a slight change of basis I can give

906
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:23,590
you a more intuitive understanding of

907
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:27,730
why that works let's suppose that the

908
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:29,800
origin was here right so p0 is that

909
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:33,010
vector and p1 is that vector and the

910
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:36,100
origin is right in the middle right well

911
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:38,700
what do I know about the space that I

912
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:42,969
can span using these two displacements

913
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:45,879
right well if I was to assign any

914
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:48,009
particular values to c0 and c1 what I

915
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,920
know is that they always have to sum to

916
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:53,830
1 right so I can never get a value

917
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,440
I could never get a vector larger than

918
00:42:53,829 --> 00:43:00,190
say this or this because I can never

919
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,710
make more than 1 multiplied by 0 p1

920
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:04,840
right so I have in this direction I can

921
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,519
only ever get out to p0 because I can't

922
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:10,600
set it greater to 1 or I'd violate the 1

923
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:12,070
norm just with p0 right and when I'm

924
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,349
heading out in this direction I can

925
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,460
never I could never set P ones

926
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:17,500
coefficient anything higher than 1

927
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,079
because I violated the one norm there as

928
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,519
well right and again I should say I'm

929
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,289
talking a little bit more about the

930
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,300
absolute value version of the one norm

931
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:27,369
because technically I could set the

932
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,320
weights on c0 to something negative

933
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:33,460
which would offset the amount of p1 and

934
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:35,289
so on right so let's you know I don't

935
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,320
really want to talk about weights that

936
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:40,000
are negative just yet so let's keep for

937
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,350
our intuition these are just positive

938
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,929
coefficients right now but we can talk

939
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:44,259
about negative ones a little bit later

940
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:45,969
all right

941
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,130
so I can't really ever get out of this

942
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:49,959
cage right from where I start because I

943
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:51,460
can never get further away now you may

944
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,220
ask well what if the origin was over

945
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:58,000
here right and so p0 was there like and

946
00:43:54,219 --> 00:44:01,480
p1 is here why can't I get you know why

947
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,670
can't I get somewhere that's that's you

948
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,309
know closer in why does it always stay

949
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:10,930
on this line right and the answer is

950
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:14,230
because every time I try to detract to

951
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:17,619
get backwards from p1 I have to add the

952
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:19,679
equivalent extra amount of p0 into some

953
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:22,839
to one which means that I'm always

954
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:24,699
gradually getting closer to p0 as I go

955
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,090
since I know this is a linear equation

956
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:29,818
it can't bow in because that would be a

957
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:32,099
curve so the only way

958
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:34,139
to go directly from p0 to p1 if the

959
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:37,920
weights can never dip below one as a sum

960
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:41,518
and I know that one puts me here for c0

961
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,680
and c1 of one puts me here right there's

962
00:44:41,518 --> 00:44:45,208
no other route it can take a linear

963
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,728
equation can't take another route

964
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:50,038
because it's linear so I can't curve and

965
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:52,228
so the only thing that makes me smoothly

966
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:55,579
go between those two if I force the

967
00:44:52,228 --> 00:44:58,889
weights to sum to one has to be a line

968
00:44:55,579 --> 00:45:01,289
so I know that I'm stuck between my two

969
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:03,989
points I can't get inside I can't get

970
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:05,789
outside specifically because I have

971
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:08,278
constrained these two values to always

972
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:09,930
sum to one and that is the constraint of

973
00:45:08,278 --> 00:45:12,028
the one norm this is the simplified

974
00:45:09,929 --> 00:45:14,788
version of the equation but I can just

975
00:45:12,028 --> 00:45:16,679
use this equation where I just do the

976
00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:18,660
I'm sorry this equation where I just put

977
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:24,989
in any two values I want and then I

978
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:28,978
normalize them by their sum okay all

979
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:30,809
right hopefully that made some sense I

980
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:32,218
never know what I'm talking if I'm

981
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:33,539
making any sense to anybody because

982
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:35,309
these are just the way I think about

983
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:38,729
things they may not be ways that make

984
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:41,009
sense to you so I apologize so now let's

985
00:45:38,728 --> 00:45:43,288
talk about the multi point blend this is

986
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:45,958
the foundation of Nets mesh jimang mesh

987
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:47,519
skinning so hopefully you will

988
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:48,958
understand why I had to motivate it by

989
00:45:47,518 --> 00:45:53,338
talking about all of these sort of one

990
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:56,068
norms blends blah blah right multi point

991
00:45:53,338 --> 00:46:01,139
blending is the idea that I may want a

992
00:45:56,068 --> 00:46:02,900
lot more points p0 p1 p2 p3 what am i

993
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:08,839
doing going clockwise who goes clockwise

994
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:12,410
let's go counterclockwise all right

995
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,360
if I was to set up some arbitrary number

996
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:16,339
of points in this case I've done a

997
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:21,440
Pentagon but it could be any number of

998
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:25,280
points if I want to create a multi-point

999
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,940
blend and I want to know that it is a

1000
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,790
convex multi-point blend meaning I stay

1001
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:36,019
within the boundaries that I am provided

1002
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:39,559
right I can apply the same thing we just

1003
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:41,750
did for two points to any number of

1004
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:46,670
points right and all the same thing

1005
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:51,500
applies so if I want to extend my notion

1006
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:55,519
of those coefficients out to five I just

1007
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:58,820
have five values in my coefficient

1008
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:03,829
vector for my five points right I have C

1009
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:10,039
0 p 0 plus C 1 P 1 thought the dot C 4 p

1010
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:13,549
4 right and all I have to do to ensure

1011
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:17,059
that I stay inside you know where I'm

1012
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:20,030
going here is to make sure that these

1013
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:22,880
values sum to 1 because the exact same

1014
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:27,170
thing applies no matter where the origin

1015
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:32,200
is if I equal 1 on any of these points

1016
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:34,550
I'm at the point right I know that

1017
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:37,399
because everybody else has to be 0

1018
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:46,490
that's the requirement of sum to 1 so if

1019
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:51,200
I'm if I'm doing this right if I've

1020
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:54,619
divided all of my weights by their sum

1021
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:56,599
by their 1 norm right if I've divided

1022
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:58,730
all the weights by the 1 norm I know

1023
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:01,009
that if any one of these values is 1 the

1024
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:03,429
rest have to be 0 so I'm gonna

1025
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:09,110
definitely be at one of my points and

1026
00:48:03,429 --> 00:48:11,480
any minut change has to increase my

1027
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:14,329
motion towards one of the other points

1028
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,760
because if I was to ever decrease my

1029
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:19,009
contribution to P Zero I must put that

1030
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,220
contribution towards some other point

1031
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,430
right it has to go towards it

1032
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:26,509
because I can't drop any of these values

1033
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:29,509
negative like I sing for him I'm

1034
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,890
enforcing absolute value here not

1035
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:32,599
absolute diamond I'm forcing greater

1036
00:48:30,889 --> 00:48:35,299
than zero here for purposes of our

1037
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:38,240
discussion so I have to move towards say

1038
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:41,269
p1 or I have to move towards p3 or a

1039
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:44,899
combination of P 3 and P 2 right but I

1040
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:47,269
can't ever regress away from the shape

1041
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:49,309
that I've created everything I do must

1042
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:51,079
stay inside it hopefully that makes some

1043
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:53,299
intuitive sense to you now after we've

1044
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:59,049
looked at it a little bit more so this

1045
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:04,099
means we can now form our general blend

1046
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:05,900
equation which is very simple very very

1047
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:09,250
simple now you've seen the underlying

1048
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:12,590
parts of it all we really have to do is

1049
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:14,840
say that we have some set of

1050
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:18,230
coefficients that we're gonna multiply

1051
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:22,789
some set of inputs by and that is pretty

1052
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:24,710
much the end of the story right so let's

1053
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:29,029
write this out in the way that we tend

1054
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:31,280
to do it in Mexican Aang and then I can

1055
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:33,619
show you the mesh getting equations so

1056
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,880
typically what we do is we say we have a

1057
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:39,769
weight vector now coefficient I think is

1058
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,200
better I would probably prefer to have

1059
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:43,849
you see for this like I did above I

1060
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:45,919
think it makes more sense with the math

1061
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:47,510
and it also unifies it a little bit more

1062
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,338
with b-spline blending and stuff like

1063
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:53,420
that where typically you think of the

1064
00:49:49,338 --> 00:49:54,710
knot weights as being a vector of C but

1065
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,940
just to give you some familiarity with

1066
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:57,470
how they're often written in the

1067
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,088
literature and how often we talk about

1068
00:49:57,469 --> 00:50:01,639
them game programming I will say that a

1069
00:49:59,088 --> 00:50:03,858
weight vector which is our C vector from

1070
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:07,069
before is oftentimes written as double

1071
00:50:03,858 --> 00:50:10,250
use and you saw me kind of introduced

1072
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:12,920
that briefly up above so I don't care

1073
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:16,010
which letter you use I'll start using W

1074
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,500
now we used C before I'm gonna use those

1075
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:20,990
interchangeably because you kind of want

1076
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,719
to know both us if you're in spline land

1077
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:27,409
and doing non linear interpolation you

1078
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:29,539
see this if you're in matrix multiply

1079
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:32,239
linear waiting land you tend to see W

1080
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:34,400
you need to just know both of them are

1081
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,568
used for weights there's not a lot of

1082
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,289
science to it

1083
00:50:35,568 --> 00:50:42,498
just what happens alright so you can

1084
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:45,440
either think of it oops as C equals C 0

1085
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:48,858
C 1 C 2 C 3 about the BA or you can

1086
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,420
think of it as W equals W 0 W 1 W 2 W 3

1087
00:50:48,858 --> 00:50:52,759
they're just two names for the same

1088
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:56,259
thing a vector of coefficients we're

1089
00:50:52,759 --> 00:51:00,130
going to use for a blend some kind right

1090
00:50:56,259 --> 00:51:05,358
so what we have in the basic

1091
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:09,259
introduction blending equations is just

1092
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:14,179
our final point is always equal to w0

1093
00:51:09,259 --> 00:51:18,889
times p0 plus w1 times P oops p1 plus

1094
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:25,368
dot dot plus W n times P n for any

1095
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:28,308
number of inputs that gives us a set of

1096
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:32,028
P's right so we have our set of points

1097
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:35,959
that's our P P n equals our set of

1098
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:39,949
points right and we have WN equals our

1099
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:43,788
set of weights these are the fundamental

1100
00:51:39,949 --> 00:51:48,338
concepts of blending extremely safe

1101
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:53,749
straightforward a set of scalar numbers

1102
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:56,958
0.5 0.2 0.2 whatever 0.1 and a set of

1103
00:51:53,748 --> 00:51:59,629
input points these input points can

1104
00:51:56,958 --> 00:52:04,308
represent anything linearly combine

1105
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:07,880
about they can be vectors points colors

1106
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:10,369
I don't care anything right anything

1107
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,680
that emits a linear combination as

1108
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:14,390
written here where I can multiply them

1109
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:18,440
by a value and then some

1110
00:52:14,389 --> 00:52:21,199
so F mad right a floating point multiply

1111
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:25,369
addition if you can do that with this

1112
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:28,099
thing then we're in business okay and

1113
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:29,869
this is the fundamental equation for

1114
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:31,609
blending you should always be familiar

1115
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:33,829
with and always mapping things back to

1116
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:35,268
in your head as we talked about mesh

1117
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:36,739
Kinning which is gonna be really

1118
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:38,268
anti-climatic now because we've

1119
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:40,909
basically covered the entire thing I

1120
00:52:38,268 --> 00:52:44,598
know it sounds a little bit weird that's

1121
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:46,219
actually it if you understand this and

1122
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:48,199
you understand the Euclidean 1 norm

1123
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:49,190
normalization that allows us to produce

1124
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:51,440
a

1125
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:53,539
UN that is always convex you pretty much

1126
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,470
know mesh canang and I'm not gonna have

1127
00:52:53,539 --> 00:53:00,759
to tell you very much

1128
00:52:54,469 --> 00:53:05,659
going forwards so what is mesh giving

1129
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:08,300
well mush skinning was an attempt to

1130
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:11,210
solve a problem and the problem is what

1131
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:14,119
do you do if you don't want your objects

1132
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:17,480
to be disjoint when you transform them

1133
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:21,050
all right so let's suppose I wanted to

1134
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:23,510
make an arm and I want an elbow and I

1135
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:26,420
want it to bend well in early computer

1136
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:28,460
graphics all we could do right and I'll

1137
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:32,409
draw this in 2d but it works the same 3d

1138
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,409
is something like this

1139
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:45,050
here's the upper arm here's the forearm

1140
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:49,150
and you know the hand would be out here

1141
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:52,190
somewhere and this is the elbow joint

1142
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:53,450
now it's 3d graphics I already sent the

1143
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:56,179
beginning should be comfortable the

1144
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:58,608
basic transform we know what these basic

1145
00:53:56,179 --> 00:54:01,009
transforms are right we can create a

1146
00:53:58,608 --> 00:54:02,809
bone structure and basically say hey

1147
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:05,329
there's a coordinate system right here

1148
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:08,889
there's another coordinate system right

1149
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:11,960
here and we just transform the upper arm

1150
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:14,299
geometry by this transform we'll call

1151
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,568
that T 0 and we multiply this one

1152
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:22,119
actually let's call it B for bone we'll

1153
00:54:17,568 --> 00:54:27,019
call this B 0 right and we'll call this

1154
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:28,940
no I'm gonna call T 0 we'll call this T

1155
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:31,670
0 right transform it and we'll call this

1156
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:35,559
t1 right well transform the forearm by

1157
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:39,349
that and that's our final shape right

1158
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:41,420
it's the non mesh skinning version it's

1159
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:44,269
the non Myshkin inversion and there's a

1160
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:47,260
big old gap that forms at the elbow

1161
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:50,780
because these are two disjoint shapes as

1162
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:53,150
they get transformed they separate even

1163
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:57,560
if at the beginning I modeled them

1164
00:54:53,150 --> 00:55:00,950
together right like this then when this

1165
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:03,440
rotates up you can see that a gap forms

1166
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:09,919
here and

1167
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:13,110
interpenetration forms here right so

1168
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,909
what I wanted to have happen back in the

1169
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:18,090
old days when this was a problem what

1170
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:20,119
you wanted to have happen was to have

1171
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:23,760
the mesh be continuous through that

1172
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:29,279
elbow joint right so what I wanted to do

1173
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:30,980
was when I was doing this what I wanted

1174
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,300
to do was just have this be one mesh

1175
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:35,730
right I didn't want there to be a

1176
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:42,120
separation here I wanted these vertices

1177
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:45,510
to be shared right so what I could do at

1178
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:47,400
the start is something a little bit

1179
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:51,680
simpler than mesh skinning what I could

1180
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:54,750
do is say well I don't really have to

1181
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:58,409
separate these geometrically I could

1182
00:55:54,750 --> 00:56:01,260
just assign these two vertices as part

1183
00:55:58,409 --> 00:56:03,809
of the upper arm and just reuse the

1184
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:07,860
vertices I'm sorry as part of the lower

1185
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:10,500
arm or upper arm my choice really but I

1186
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:13,530
could reuse them in both sides so when I

1187
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:17,039
draw the upper arm geometry and the

1188
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:19,410
lower arm geometry right I can just

1189
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:21,539
share these vertices and then what will

1190
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:23,460
happen is there's no gap when this

1191
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:25,440
starts to bend upward like this

1192
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:29,269
I just whichever one I assigned it to

1193
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,269
let's say I assigned it here right

1194
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:35,220
here's where they would have transformed

1195
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:38,219
under each transform let's say I picked

1196
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:41,159
this one right so these are both there

1197
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:49,009
and there I now just draw this as my

1198
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:52,739
mesh right easy peasy

1199
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:56,040
that prevents the gap from forming but

1200
00:56:52,739 --> 00:57:00,089
if you look at what happens here this as

1201
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:04,170
this arm straightens out collapses

1202
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:10,170
entirely right so my mesh now gets this

1203
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:11,909
super super collapsed arm right can you

1204
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:16,380
see what I'm talking about here because

1205
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:22,228
if we just map this to one or the other

1206
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:28,039
as I start here right let's look at the

1207
00:57:22,228 --> 00:57:29,248
two cases so one case is I get that

1208
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:34,528
right

1209
00:57:29,248 --> 00:57:36,629
so my mesh now becomes this right

1210
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:37,710
there's my elbow not a very good looking

1211
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:40,588
elbow right

1212
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:44,220
that's if I assigned them to the upper

1213
00:57:40,588 --> 00:57:45,900
arm or the lower arm rather sorry and if

1214
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:49,488
I do the opposite if I assign them this

1215
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,489
way then I get this

1216
00:57:59,539 --> 00:58:06,739
right still really really bad so I get

1217
00:58:03,889 --> 00:58:11,059
the same pinch I just decide where it

1218
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:15,229
goes not really acceptable for animation

1219
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:18,739
purposes right okay so there are two

1220
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:24,559
ways of addressing this problem and they

1221
00:58:18,739 --> 00:58:25,819
both are actually equivalent there's

1222
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,049
actually an infinite number of ways to

1223
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,910
address this problem but there are two

1224
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:33,760
core ways that end up addressing this

1225
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:38,299
problem from the basic set of equations

1226
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:40,880
okay what we want is some way of

1227
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:43,250
producing a more subtle blend between

1228
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,490
these two because if we were to look at

1229
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:47,809
the two super positions here or rather

1230
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:51,469
if we were to look at a superposition of

1231
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:53,179
these two sets right and let me try is

1232
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:57,799
gonna be a little bit difficult let me

1233
00:58:53,179 --> 00:59:00,469
try to draw the overlay for you of the

1234
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:05,210
two of these here is my coordinate

1235
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:09,619
system here is my bone structure here is

1236
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:14,630
one of my meshes that I could have here

1237
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:17,029
is the other one I could have right then

1238
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:20,809
if we were to look at what we have

1239
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:23,510
produced after our blend we know after

1240
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:27,320
our transforming of all of the points in

1241
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:28,760
all of the systems right we know we've

1242
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,809
got this part of the mesh covered we

1243
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,820
know we've got this part of the mesh

1244
00:59:29,809 --> 00:59:33,679
covered so the question is just how do

1245
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:38,480
we produce two points here that aren't

1246
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:41,739
awful this is not good and this is not

1247
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:45,170
good either but what about some

1248
00:59:41,739 --> 00:59:49,929
combination of these and the answer is

1249
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:51,829
if we were to maybe take this right

1250
00:59:49,929 --> 01:00:02,419
maybe we could produce something that

1251
00:59:51,829 --> 01:00:05,480
wasn't quite so bad right this ends up

1252
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:09,200
being a pretty reasonable elbow it blows

1253
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:11,539
in a little bit right more than we might

1254
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,509
want but so does your elbow who to a

1255
01:00:11,539 --> 01:00:15,420
certain extent

1256
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:18,990
um not really the the fat kind I usually

1257
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:24,090
built is out here but that is much

1258
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:27,269
better than that which was almost

1259
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:36,930
collapsed or equivalently the other

1260
01:00:27,269 --> 01:00:40,710
version which was at right

1261
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:43,769
I may have connected those wrong but

1262
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:45,630
point being this is a more preferable

1263
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:47,130
result it's still not perfect and we'll

1264
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:49,320
talk about what would be perfect later

1265
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:52,800
on when we talk about sort of the next

1266
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:56,940
steps after basic mesh skinning that

1267
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:59,760
would be nice right it would be

1268
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:03,630
acceptable and usable as opposed to the

1269
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:05,390
other one which is not can you see from

1270
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:09,650
the diagram where I'm going with this

1271
01:01:05,389 --> 01:01:12,900
what is this line here between these two

1272
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:14,460
right does it look familiar does it look

1273
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,970
like something we maybe just talked

1274
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,639
about

1275
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:22,439
it sure does right it looks a heck of a

1276
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:28,429
lot like this original equation doesn't

1277
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:31,289
it where these are constrained to be

1278
01:01:28,429 --> 01:01:35,399
normalized to the one norm right that's

1279
01:01:31,289 --> 01:01:36,630
that line right I mean you can see it

1280
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,849
you can see it coming out can't you

1281
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:41,930
before I even show you I mean you can

1282
01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:43,579
see that that's where we're going so

1283
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:45,419
let's do it

1284
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:48,480
what do we need to do to make that

1285
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:50,610
happen well previously right when we

1286
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,539
transform stuff in computer graphics I

1287
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:53,970
told you this at the beginning of the

1288
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:55,170
stream right we've got some transform

1289
01:01:53,969 --> 01:01:57,629
that we're gonna transfer on these

1290
01:01:55,170 --> 01:02:00,900
things by it's that's not a P one that's

1291
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:05,220
a P Prime to produce our point and we're

1292
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:08,130
inputting the point right so that's what

1293
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:10,199
we you know we normally do that's how we

1294
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:11,490
would have produced these positions and

1295
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:13,889
that's how we would have produced these

1296
01:02:11,489 --> 01:02:15,449
positions with just normal regular or

1297
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:17,039
old-school computer graphics where you

1298
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:19,949
just have one transform that moves all

1299
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:22,739
your points right and specifically in

1300
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:25,460
this case we have sort of two P Prime's

1301
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:27,049
we were talking about potentially having

1302
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,429
depending on where we assigned our

1303
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:30,650
points did we assign two points the

1304
01:02:28,429 --> 01:02:34,210
upper arm we sign the lower arm so we

1305
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:37,400
have a P Prime it's a P Prime

1306
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:40,039
let's say upper arm right and that's the

1307
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:42,559
transform of the upper arm times p0 but

1308
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:45,019
we could also do an equivalent transform

1309
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,849
for the lower arm P Prime lower and

1310
01:02:45,019 --> 01:02:52,280
that's just going to be the lower

1311
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:54,019
transform times p0 right not not

1312
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,460
particularly complicated I lower arm

1313
01:02:54,019 --> 01:02:56,838
probably bad let's call it forearm

1314
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:04,608
because you can't tell it was between 1

1315
01:02:56,838 --> 01:03:06,108
and L right so these two transforms and

1316
01:03:04,608 --> 01:03:08,539
transforms we already know we already

1317
01:03:06,108 --> 01:03:11,630
know how to transform some point let's

1318
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:13,099
say p0 in our example here you know was

1319
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:15,470
this point here right so we're talking

1320
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:16,010
about it transforming to either here or

1321
01:03:15,469 --> 01:03:17,389
here

1322
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:20,390
depending on which one we assign it to

1323
01:03:17,389 --> 01:03:22,699
if we assign it to the transform upper

1324
01:03:20,389 --> 01:03:25,338
arm it's gonna be here right so this is

1325
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:27,559
transform upper arm times p0 if we

1326
01:03:25,338 --> 01:03:30,108
assign it to the lower arm it's going to

1327
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:33,259
be here so this is transform lower our

1328
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:34,940
sorry forearm equal p0 right so you know

1329
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:37,190
we we know we can produce these two

1330
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:38,750
points there just the basic transforms

1331
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:46,010
we would have gotten if we treat

1332
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:49,519
everything as rigid right make sense so

1333
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:52,010
if you look at these two equations what

1334
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:54,500
do you think I'm gonna do right well I

1335
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:56,750
just said look at that line in between

1336
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:59,179
them doesn't it look like this and the

1337
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:02,750
answer is let's just use that equation

1338
01:03:59,179 --> 01:04:05,210
let's take our P R to transform points

1339
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:07,730
right which are here and here and let's

1340
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:11,869
just produce a blend between them let's

1341
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:18,800
just blend between them let's just do W

1342
01:04:11,869 --> 01:04:23,000
0 times P Prime you write plus W 1 times

1343
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:26,390
P prime F that's our new final P Prime

1344
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,329
this right here gives us two control

1345
01:04:26,389 --> 01:04:32,358
levers to dial to give us any point that

1346
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:36,199
we want and if we don't want it

1347
01:04:32,358 --> 01:04:37,909
wandering all around in here right so if

1348
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:39,068
I want to know if I don't want it out

1349
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:40,929
there or

1350
01:04:39,068 --> 01:04:43,298
here right I want it to be right there

1351
01:04:40,929 --> 01:04:46,298
let's say in the middle then I know I

1352
01:04:43,298 --> 01:04:50,619
can just enforce the Euclidian 1 norm on

1353
01:04:46,298 --> 01:04:54,009
these two and I will get something on

1354
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:55,869
this line if I literally use point five

1355
01:04:54,009 --> 01:04:57,789
that it would be 0.5 and 0.5 because

1356
01:04:55,869 --> 01:04:59,559
that's what sums to 1 and I will

1357
01:04:57,789 --> 01:05:02,130
literally get that center point that I

1358
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:05,170
drew that is what I wanted

1359
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:08,680
that's mesh skinning end of story

1360
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:10,900
actually that's pretty much all there is

1361
01:05:08,679 --> 01:05:14,018
to it to be completely honest with you

1362
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:16,019
it really doesn't get much more

1363
01:05:14,018 --> 01:05:18,458
complicated than that

1364
01:05:16,018 --> 01:05:20,348
now there's a ton of advanced topics we

1365
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:22,748
can go into which we will in a second I

1366
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:26,979
just want to cement this home but this

1367
01:05:22,748 --> 01:05:29,919
is my skinning that's all it is all it

1368
01:05:26,978 --> 01:05:32,379
is is weights that multiply transforms

1369
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,900
of things that get transformed in the

1370
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,640
space of more than one transform so

1371
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:39,759
you're taking the same point in your

1372
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:42,389
input you're transforming it by more

1373
01:05:39,759 --> 01:05:44,769
than one of your bones inside the

1374
01:05:42,389 --> 01:05:47,440
character and then you're just

1375
01:05:44,768 --> 01:05:48,608
performing a weighted convex blend and

1376
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,958
we're gonna talk about non convex lenss

1377
01:05:48,608 --> 01:05:55,478
in a second but a weighted convex blend

1378
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:57,068
between the two let's make this a little

1379
01:05:55,478 --> 01:06:00,038
bit more concrete by talking about the

1380
01:05:57,068 --> 01:06:03,518
entire process as it traditionally

1381
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:09,329
occurs traditionally what happens is you

1382
01:06:03,518 --> 01:06:09,328
you know create some humanoid shape

1383
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:28,250
some kind of gingerbread man right we

1384
01:06:22,969 --> 01:06:31,608
call this the rest pose somebody models

1385
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:34,969
this in like 3d studio or Maya or

1386
01:06:31,608 --> 01:06:42,199
something right and they then create a

1387
01:06:34,969 --> 01:06:44,858
skeleton we call it and that is nothing

1388
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:47,809
more than a series of transforms that

1389
01:06:44,858 --> 01:06:51,500
line up with where you would typically

1390
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:57,279
put you know the bones or the joints of

1391
01:06:51,500 --> 01:07:04,309
a human right guy should have some

1392
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:08,269
longer legs probably right this skeleton

1393
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:11,779
is a set of transforms right each one of

1394
01:07:08,269 --> 01:07:13,818
these is a transform and we compute what

1395
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:16,339
those transforms are the way we would

1396
01:07:13,818 --> 01:07:18,318
compute any other transforms in 3d

1397
01:07:16,338 --> 01:07:21,440
graphics they are not they have nothing

1398
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:26,029
to do with mesh Kinning right so they

1399
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:31,460
are just a series of T 0 T 1 T 2 dot the

1400
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:35,690
top T n each of these T 0 T 1 T 2

1401
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:37,579
whatever right we have a skeleton which

1402
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:42,260
is a series of transforms and then we

1403
01:07:37,579 --> 01:07:45,650
have a mesh and that's this sole thing

1404
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:48,910
right and that's how we model a

1405
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:52,400
character actually this is the input

1406
01:07:48,909 --> 01:07:56,239
it's the rest pose of both the bones and

1407
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:59,180
the mesh and then what we assign in

1408
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:02,719
addition to the vertices so obviously

1409
01:07:59,179 --> 01:08:05,929
all through here all the p0 p1 p2 dot

1410
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:09,489
the dot right so all the vertices all

1411
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:15,348
over the place here those are our points

1412
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:19,849
so then what we want to do is we want to

1413
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:22,819
produce a new version of this for run

1414
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:25,880
time animation that we you know in our

1415
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:27,339
game that we want to draw the character

1416
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,430
dancing around or doing whatever

1417
01:08:27,338 --> 01:08:32,710
what we want to be able to do is change

1418
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:34,359
these transforms exactly the way we

1419
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:37,210
would if it were just like a robotic

1420
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:40,210
skeleton so they're you know no mesh

1421
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:42,159
canang we just wanted to produce say a

1422
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:45,670
rotation of this thing so it can rotate

1423
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:47,170
upwards you know like this right so it

1424
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:50,680
can bend the elbow like I was doing up

1425
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:53,460
there and what we want is this mesh to

1426
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:57,670
come with it right that's what we want

1427
01:08:53,460 --> 01:09:02,020
now the equation is actually just this

1428
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:04,720
at its base but there's an extra element

1429
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:06,310
that has to come in and this may be why

1430
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,020
people sometimes get confused I know

1431
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:09,970
back in the day when we were first

1432
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:11,680
working out this math I often

1433
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:13,600
encountered people who didn't understand

1434
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:16,270
this step and there are some really

1435
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,800
crazy things that they used to do to get

1436
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:19,450
around it but you you just if you

1437
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:22,319
understand this step you don't have to

1438
01:09:19,449 --> 01:09:27,399
do anything crazy it's very simplistic

1439
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:32,830
all you have to do now is you just have

1440
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:35,920
to understand that you need to put

1441
01:09:32,829 --> 01:09:38,318
things into the space of the skeleton

1442
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,970
first before you take them out of the

1443
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:43,390
space of the skeleton I know that sounds

1444
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:45,100
weird but I'll explain what I mean and

1445
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:47,789
we'll use our elbow example so it's

1446
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:54,579
something you're familiar with right

1447
01:09:47,789 --> 01:09:59,140
okay let me say one more thing first

1448
01:09:54,579 --> 01:10:02,380
before I swing that so this is the rest

1449
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:07,420
pose this is the input to the system the

1450
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:11,289
output right in the game is an actual

1451
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:14,440
pose right it's something that we want

1452
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:17,130
to render in our game the character

1453
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:20,139
animating the doing something right and

1454
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:22,840
so what we want is we wanted to go from

1455
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:27,789
our rest pose to some other pose you

1456
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:32,350
know of the dude you know running or

1457
01:10:27,789 --> 01:10:35,369
something right and we want this whole

1458
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:35,370
mesh to go with it

1459
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:46,069
right so though as this guy's skeleton

1460
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:47,900
runs through the world which is a

1461
01:10:46,069 --> 01:10:49,698
separate problem that's like animation

1462
01:10:47,899 --> 01:10:52,129
that's a totally different topic right

1463
01:10:49,698 --> 01:10:54,289
but as this skeleton animates through

1464
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:56,630
the world mesh skinning is the problem

1465
01:10:54,289 --> 01:11:00,889
of how do we make the geometry for the

1466
01:10:56,630 --> 01:11:03,230
guy follow the skeleton right that's

1467
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:05,139
what we're doing and so what we want to

1468
01:11:03,229 --> 01:11:08,089
do is figure out how do we go from

1469
01:11:05,139 --> 01:11:11,420
understanding that this allows us to do

1470
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:14,150
this sort of blended smoother version of

1471
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:16,550
the deformation that occurs if we just

1472
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:21,828
were to assign points directly to bones

1473
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:24,320
right how do we go from that to doing

1474
01:11:21,828 --> 01:11:28,908
this exact operation that's what we want

1475
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:31,729
right and so there's only one trick

1476
01:11:28,908 --> 01:11:33,799
there's only one thing but you would

1477
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:34,308
have that you have to do to make this

1478
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,929
work

1479
01:11:34,309 --> 01:11:38,599
that's not obvious from what I just

1480
01:11:35,929 --> 01:11:43,789
wrote because otherwise you just do this

1481
01:11:38,599 --> 01:11:47,239
literally you just do this right okay so

1482
01:11:43,789 --> 01:11:51,889
what's the non obvious part well I said

1483
01:11:47,238 --> 01:11:54,019
before we start with the understanding

1484
01:11:51,889 --> 01:11:57,230
that let's suppose we just assign

1485
01:11:54,020 --> 01:12:00,739
everybody to one particular bone right

1486
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:02,689
that's the non skinned mesh case and if

1487
01:12:00,738 --> 01:12:05,779
we assigned every vertex to a particular

1488
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:09,169
bone what do we know about how we would

1489
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:14,059
store that vertex right what do we know

1490
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:17,420
about that well what we know is what I

1491
01:12:14,059 --> 01:12:20,599
wrote before this is our fundamental

1492
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:31,059
equation what does it do well it starts

1493
01:12:20,599 --> 01:12:33,739
in a rest space right and it transforms

1494
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:36,050
this is the rest face here so maybe at

1495
01:12:33,738 --> 01:12:38,959
this point right it transforms one of

1496
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:44,949
our points by whatever the transform

1497
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:47,719
implies right that's this transform

1498
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:50,509
whatever the transfer implies I get the

1499
01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:52,819
new point in whatever space

1500
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:56,719
is now in so if I want to take a

1501
01:12:52,819 --> 01:12:59,599
skeleton for example if I want to take a

1502
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,578
transform that is in rest space in the

1503
01:12:59,599 --> 01:13:02,779
pose face of the guy what everyone to

1504
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:04,788
call up the rest space is what I'm gonna

1505
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:07,340
use the rest face that was modeled in

1506
01:13:04,788 --> 01:13:09,559
and I want to transform it

1507
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:11,779
I want transform that point out to the

1508
01:13:09,559 --> 01:13:14,538
game to the world's face right where I'm

1509
01:13:11,779 --> 01:13:18,469
gonna actually draw it well what I know

1510
01:13:14,538 --> 01:13:25,309
is that T times peak gives me that if

1511
01:13:18,469 --> 01:13:31,340
and only if he was already stored local

1512
01:13:25,309 --> 01:13:35,119
to this transform right cuz that's how

1513
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:38,300
we normally did it in graphics we made

1514
01:13:35,118 --> 01:13:41,000
our cube or whatever it is centered

1515
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:43,309
around that original transforms point

1516
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,500
that original you know zero zero zero

1517
01:13:43,309 --> 01:13:49,309
this was zero zero zero this was just

1518
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:52,429
the x y&amp;z world axes right and then when

1519
01:13:49,309 --> 01:13:55,010
we applied this T transform we can move

1520
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:57,050
it out from being around the origin of

1521
01:13:55,010 --> 01:14:02,329
the world to being somewhere else in the

1522
01:13:57,050 --> 01:14:04,940
world and spun right and so if we

1523
01:14:02,328 --> 01:14:08,988
assigned every point in our original

1524
01:14:04,939 --> 01:14:11,629
mesh to one of these bones what we could

1525
01:14:08,988 --> 01:14:14,299
have done what we could have done is

1526
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:16,788
when we wrote this skeleton out when we

1527
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:20,420
took it from the 3d art package and put

1528
01:14:16,788 --> 01:14:24,529
it into our data file format is we could

1529
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:26,359
take the inverse of the rest pose right

1530
01:14:24,529 --> 01:14:29,000
because remember now we've got a

1531
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:37,639
slightly more complex case here is the

1532
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:43,059
actual origin of our guy it's down here

1533
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:47,269
right here is a point p0 here is a bone

1534
01:14:43,059 --> 01:14:50,510
t0 it's transform looks like that in

1535
01:14:47,269 --> 01:14:53,719
rest space what can you see immediately

1536
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:58,070
when you look at this diagram it isn't

1537
01:14:53,719 --> 01:15:01,639
this equation because P is not stored

1538
01:14:58,069 --> 01:15:04,309
relative to this transform P is we want

1539
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:06,890
P to be relative to t0 Eady

1540
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:08,900
it's relative to the rest space the

1541
01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:13,520
whatever the space is the modeling space

1542
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:16,519
of this of this mesh right but if we

1543
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:18,710
assigned P zero to one and only one

1544
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:23,150
transform as we used to in the early

1545
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:27,710
days right we can fix this what do we do

1546
01:15:23,149 --> 01:15:32,599
we take the inverse of T zero multiply P

1547
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:36,079
Zero by that and store that as our new P

1548
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:40,400
Zero right so what we actually have is

1549
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:43,039
like a PA in T zero space okay this is a

1550
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:46,129
trivial process we can do it on export

1551
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:49,460
we take each individual point in our

1552
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:51,289
mesh we say which of the transforms

1553
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:53,659
which of our bones in the skeleton did

1554
01:15:51,289 --> 01:15:56,050
the artist wanted assigned to and we

1555
01:15:53,659 --> 01:15:59,899
just do the inverse transform to produce

1556
01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:03,500
PT zero once we have that then this

1557
01:15:59,899 --> 01:16:08,239
works now at runtime we just do the

1558
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:10,760
actual current T zero times our PT 0

1559
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:12,829
that does give us the correct point and

1560
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:15,110
that does do this operation right

1561
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:18,350
because now we're using a point that is

1562
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:20,029
stored in the original space hopefully

1563
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:22,400
that makes sense again that's nothing

1564
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:25,159
new that's just what you do during

1565
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:27,229
exporting some character if you weren't

1566
01:16:25,159 --> 01:16:29,869
doing mesh skinning so forget character

1567
01:16:27,229 --> 01:16:32,029
it's just the wheel of a car let's say

1568
01:16:29,869 --> 01:16:34,069
right no character involved it's rigid

1569
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:36,679
we don't do any mesh skinning here's the

1570
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:38,659
axis system we need to rotate the wheel

1571
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,340
of the car what would we do well we'd

1572
01:16:38,659 --> 01:16:43,760
make all of the points of the wheel be

1573
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:45,710
relative to wherever this center of the

1574
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,420
wheel is there'd be some transform there

1575
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:49,279
and then we'd spin the transform and the

1576
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:51,079
wheel would spin you all know this if

1577
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,609
you know none

1578
01:16:51,079 --> 01:16:57,800
skinned meshes right so this is what we

1579
01:16:55,609 --> 01:17:01,189
would do for non skinned meshes and we'd

1580
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:03,110
just store everything relative to the

1581
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:05,710
transform that it up that it was

1582
01:17:03,109 --> 01:17:08,869
controlled by it's controlling transform

1583
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:12,640
but the problem we get with mesh getting

1584
01:17:08,869 --> 01:17:17,149
and the only subtlety the only one is

1585
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,480
that we don't have just one bone because

1586
01:17:17,149 --> 01:17:20,569
what's

1587
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:23,238
to happen here inside the art tool the

1588
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:26,929
artist is going to sort of paint or

1589
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:30,849
adjust or use envelopes which are sort

1590
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:35,690
of ways of assigning using fields

1591
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:40,670
they're going to generate these right

1592
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:43,699
w0w one right they're gonna generate

1593
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:48,020
these and the problem is if they're

1594
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:50,929
generating these weights w0 w1 we now

1595
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:53,210
need to play those back at run time okay

1596
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:55,520
and what does that look like at run time

1597
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:57,020
we're not gonna be doing that we're not

1598
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:09,080
going to doing that we're gonna be doing

1599
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:12,050
this right we're gonna be doing that

1600
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:14,930
base equation as many times as there are

1601
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:17,360
bones for a particular vertex so if a

1602
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:21,200
vertex was assigned to some weight on

1603
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:24,009
the bone to 0 and some weight on bone t1

1604
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:29,420
we have to do both of these transforms

1605
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:32,270
right well this creates a really nasty

1606
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:35,750
storage problem for us it means that for

1607
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:38,239
every bone we wanted to use and for some

1608
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:41,000
things in like this area of this area or

1609
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:45,319
the face especially there might be two

1610
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:50,539
three four five six even bones blended

1611
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:53,029
together to get a final result it starts

1612
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:56,539
to get a little ugly four bones is not

1613
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:59,449
in a typical number to use as your max

1614
01:18:56,539 --> 01:19:03,710
number for example in Mexican Aang even

1615
01:18:59,449 --> 01:19:07,729
back in my day in 1999 when we were

1616
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:11,409
doing this stuff it was already four

1617
01:19:07,729 --> 01:19:14,869
wasn't not a typical number to use right

1618
01:19:11,409 --> 01:19:18,109
so this massively explodes our mesh

1619
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:21,199
storage right because now for every

1620
01:19:18,109 --> 01:19:23,750
point we restoring for our mesh before

1621
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:26,300
we have to store four points which is

1622
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:29,329
the transform of that point in the

1623
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:31,310
inverse space of each bone so this thing

1624
01:19:29,329 --> 01:19:34,399
we were doing before we do for each

1625
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:36,830
phone if this was T 0 T 1 T 2 and T 3

1626
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:38,210
waited right so we know this point is

1627
01:19:36,829 --> 01:19:40,340
weighted to four different bones because

1628
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:43,159
that's what the artist painted then we

1629
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:45,860
have to store inverse of each of these

1630
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:49,250
matrices times the point in question

1631
01:19:45,859 --> 01:19:52,789
right we have to store four things for

1632
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:55,520
one input and that's exactly what people

1633
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:58,789
used to do because they didn't think of

1634
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:00,590
anything better right but that's not the

1635
01:19:58,789 --> 01:20:02,979
way to do it and you wouldn't do it that

1636
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:06,260
way today cuz you know we know better

1637
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:08,359
and and I knew better at the time too so

1638
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:09,949
I never did that but you know there were

1639
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:11,630
a bunch of people skinning systems that

1640
01:20:09,949 --> 01:20:13,099
worked that way in the early days

1641
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:15,770
because they just didn't think of

1642
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,390
something better so what's the better

1643
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:19,190
solution there's a much much better

1644
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:21,350
solution much better solution to this

1645
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:24,679
problem and the much better solution is

1646
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:26,270
to not store P transformed at all just

1647
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:28,579
store the points the way they're

1648
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:30,860
originally modeled don't transform them

1649
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:33,229
so don't do the thing we would have done

1650
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:34,369
with the wheel just don't do that

1651
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:37,069
anymore forget it

1652
01:20:34,369 --> 01:20:39,529
peas are always stored in the rest post

1653
01:20:37,069 --> 01:20:42,049
space completely so it's stored like

1654
01:20:39,529 --> 01:20:44,899
this not relative to T zero but relative

1655
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:47,900
to the total origin relative to the same

1656
01:20:44,899 --> 01:20:51,500
space in which T zero was was modeled

1657
01:20:47,899 --> 01:20:54,019
right so the skeleton and the mesh are

1658
01:20:51,500 --> 01:21:00,069
modeled in the same space and stored in

1659
01:20:54,020 --> 01:21:03,530
the same space no pre transforms okay

1660
01:21:00,069 --> 01:21:06,229
then what we do is we compute the

1661
01:21:03,529 --> 01:21:08,719
rebasing at runtime and we can do this

1662
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:10,849
almost for free why can we do it almost

1663
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:14,030
for free well look at what this equation

1664
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:17,660
is actually computing PT zero

1665
01:21:14,029 --> 01:21:21,229
what was it well it was W 0 times T zero

1666
01:21:17,659 --> 01:21:22,880
the new T zero right and I need to start

1667
01:21:21,229 --> 01:21:24,109
differentiating these if I wrote this

1668
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,819
out a little bit you know let me let me

1669
01:21:24,109 --> 01:21:27,349
just write it out in the full form first

1670
01:21:25,819 --> 01:21:29,539
so you can see exactly what I'm talking

1671
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:31,730
about we need to specify our different

1672
01:21:29,539 --> 01:21:33,229
things so we need different spaces for

1673
01:21:31,729 --> 01:21:35,629
these guys so I'm going to get a gets

1674
01:21:33,229 --> 01:21:37,279
nominate or heavy or poor notation heavy

1675
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:39,079
but it's simple in code you just have

1676
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:41,809
different arrays for them right it's not

1677
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:45,479
math gets ugly but code stays simple in

1678
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:48,780
that sense all right so I have

1679
01:21:45,479 --> 01:21:55,259
zero in the rest pose okay what is that

1680
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:58,679
that's here is the origin of my

1681
01:21:55,260 --> 01:22:03,270
coordinate system here is T zero in the

1682
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:13,890
rest pose okay so that's T zero R I need

1683
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:18,720
to produce a different T 0 T 0 in world

1684
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:20,789
space right and that's just whatever it

1685
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:22,829
has to be if I'm rotating my shoulder if

1686
01:22:20,789 --> 01:22:24,390
this was coming up right then T 0 has

1687
01:22:22,829 --> 01:22:26,159
rotated upwards but it stayed in one

1688
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:28,140
place if the shoulder is sliding out a

1689
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:30,238
little bit right then it's gonna do that

1690
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:32,730
if it's moving because the guy is moving

1691
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:35,429
then it's gonna do that so I have a rest

1692
01:22:32,729 --> 01:22:37,589
pose T art this is what the modeler made

1693
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:41,100
this is what the art staff this is what

1694
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:43,289
the art staff made okay exactly what

1695
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:47,000
they made and this is what's in the game

1696
01:22:43,289 --> 01:22:50,630
that we're trying to produce okay and

1697
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:54,390
what I was saying before is the old way

1698
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:59,310
we were doing this right was to say if I

1699
01:22:54,390 --> 01:23:02,910
need to store a p0 p0 in our right and I

1700
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:04,620
need to produce p0 in world okay so I'm

1701
01:23:02,909 --> 01:23:06,809
gonna start talking about p0 in world

1702
01:23:04,619 --> 01:23:08,819
and p0 in our as well

1703
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:12,360
then what I did is I stored an

1704
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:15,869
intermediate value right I store it ap

1705
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:18,119
let's call that P intermediate of 0 and

1706
01:23:15,869 --> 01:23:23,039
what I did is I stored the inverse of

1707
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:27,149
the rest matrix this guy times that

1708
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:30,720
input P right so p p0 and the rest pose

1709
01:23:27,149 --> 01:23:37,309
times T zeroes in the rest poses inverse

1710
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:39,690
gives me this interim value pti right

1711
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:43,890
and there's we called other things maybe

1712
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:46,679
you could call it PT local I don't know

1713
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:48,119
but I'm gonna call PT I basically PT

1714
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:50,430
interim because we don't actually care

1715
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:51,840
about it and then I was saying well what

1716
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:55,079
we were doing at run time to reproduce

1717
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:57,270
it is saying let's take the T 0 in world

1718
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:58,899
space right and we want to multiply that

1719
01:23:57,270 --> 01:24:00,760
by our interim and

1720
01:23:58,899 --> 01:24:04,089
that's what's gonna get our p0 in world

1721
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:06,340
space right and this was the equation we

1722
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:08,319
used well what you actually want to do

1723
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:10,360
instead of storing a bunch of these once

1724
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:11,889
you need to do multiple of them is just

1725
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:15,189
look at what this actually computed

1726
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:18,579
right what this actually computed was t0

1727
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:22,719
W sub in this term it equals that we

1728
01:24:18,579 --> 01:24:26,769
just said so right it's T rest pose

1729
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:29,530
inverse times p0 are okay now look what

1730
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:31,780
happens when we do the full sub okay we

1731
01:24:29,529 --> 01:24:35,829
said before what I wanted to do was

1732
01:24:31,779 --> 01:24:40,239
extend to this value so p0 in world

1733
01:24:35,829 --> 01:24:44,979
space is going to equal a weight right

1734
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:50,349
some wait times t0 in world space times

1735
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:53,319
p0 internal plus some other thing right

1736
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:56,289
some other weight times some other bone

1737
01:24:53,319 --> 01:24:59,979
in world space times its internal

1738
01:24:56,289 --> 01:25:03,489
storage right dot doc and what we would

1739
01:24:59,979 --> 01:25:06,039
see if we transfer if we substituted all

1740
01:25:03,489 --> 01:25:07,689
of the pies with what they actually were

1741
01:25:06,039 --> 01:25:11,319
equal to that we just said they were

1742
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:13,059
equal to right is actually whatever the

1743
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:15,429
particular bone you were talking about

1744
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:18,340
whatever its inverse was times the

1745
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:22,800
original PR in rest space same thing

1746
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:22,800
will happen here when I substitute in

1747
01:25:26,069 --> 01:25:33,909
now what do you see right you see that

1748
01:25:30,189 --> 01:25:36,669
my p0 r is the same P in the whole

1749
01:25:33,909 --> 01:25:40,539
equation this eliminates the multi

1750
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:42,250
storage problem right we just stored w's

1751
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:44,800
which is what we would have stored

1752
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:48,489
anyway to say what the weight is we

1753
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:51,220
store the p0 r once not four times four

1754
01:25:48,489 --> 01:25:54,789
four bones and then at runtime what we

1755
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:57,670
do is we look at this internal term that

1756
01:25:54,789 --> 01:26:03,010
internal term is the T in world space of

1757
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:05,739
any of our of our bones right doesn't

1758
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:10,060
matter which one times the inverse rest

1759
01:26:05,739 --> 01:26:12,489
pose of any of our bones this right here

1760
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:13,930
is what I call the composite

1761
01:26:12,489 --> 01:26:22,449
a tricks I don't know if it has a real

1762
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:25,000
name right or a composite transform that

1763
01:26:22,449 --> 01:26:28,869
right there is the fundamental transform

1764
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:32,319
of any mesh getting operation okay and

1765
01:26:28,869 --> 01:26:35,319
what it is it's just the transform that

1766
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:37,179
takes the rest posed location of

1767
01:26:35,319 --> 01:26:40,239
something and puts it into the world

1768
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:44,409
posed location of something relative to

1769
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:47,139
a specific bone and I can pick any bone

1770
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:51,039
I want and I never have to store any

1771
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:53,320
additional information right so what we

1772
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:55,029
typically do in a mesh getting pipeline

1773
01:26:53,319 --> 01:27:01,359
and this is absolutely crucial to

1774
01:26:55,029 --> 01:27:05,829
understand is we prepare the TW set so

1775
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:08,769
this is like an array we do key world

1776
01:27:05,829 --> 01:27:12,789
space of 0 T world space 1 T world space

1777
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:15,880
to dot that the dot right we prepare

1778
01:27:12,789 --> 01:27:17,710
that as the output from the character

1779
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:19,630
animation system or the skeletal

1780
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:22,420
animation system so this is our skeletal

1781
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:24,069
animation system a topic we're not

1782
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:26,159
covering because that's animation

1783
01:27:24,069 --> 01:27:29,259
nothing to do with mesh getting our

1784
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:31,720
skeletal animation system outputs this

1785
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:33,699
array it is the world space location of

1786
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:42,090
the skeleton that's where the skeleton

1787
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:46,869
needs to go right our our asset pipeline

1788
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:49,630
when we exported the model right outputs

1789
01:27:46,869 --> 01:27:53,949
a separate array this is just constant

1790
01:27:49,630 --> 01:28:01,630
never changes this is the inverse rest

1791
01:27:53,949 --> 01:28:04,449
pose of all of the bones right so we

1792
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:06,279
know this because it's in our file we

1793
01:28:04,449 --> 01:28:09,010
load it up and we just have it because

1794
01:28:06,279 --> 01:28:12,039
it's the inverse precomputed of these

1795
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:13,420
values we know this value because we

1796
01:28:12,039 --> 01:28:19,119
just generated from our skeleton

1797
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:25,060
animation system this times this is the

1798
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:26,079
transform right t0w times TR negative TR

1799
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:28,690
0 inverse

1800
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:30,850
right is the final transform or a

1801
01:28:28,689 --> 01:28:34,359
composite transform as I call it

1802
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:42,130
oops put it there of any bone so we end

1803
01:28:34,359 --> 01:28:50,170
up with our rendering array and that is

1804
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:54,819
t0 W times T 0 R 1 T 1 W times T 1 R

1805
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:58,329
inverse a little block right this is the

1806
01:28:54,819 --> 01:29:00,789
final goal of a mesh skinning skeleton

1807
01:28:58,329 --> 01:29:03,039
pipeline it is the output of the

1808
01:29:00,789 --> 01:29:06,489
skeletal animation system times the

1809
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:10,390
asset pipelines inverse rest pose stored

1810
01:29:06,489 --> 01:29:12,010
array that produces a final transform

1811
01:29:10,390 --> 01:29:13,690
that is just 2 matrices times each other

1812
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:16,510
for each slot that is our rendering

1813
01:29:13,689 --> 01:29:19,960
array once we have this rendering array

1814
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:22,360
we arrive at the final operation of a

1815
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:28,149
mesh gating system and that is the skin

1816
01:29:22,359 --> 01:29:30,579
output and it is trivial if we call this

1817
01:29:28,149 --> 01:29:33,699
again we just say it's t 0 see the like

1818
01:29:30,579 --> 01:29:38,050
composite transform all it is is just a

1819
01:29:33,699 --> 01:29:40,210
straight readout of the points P 0 for

1820
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:42,820
any transform we want I sorry for any

1821
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:45,939
point we want is no more than the weight

1822
01:29:42,819 --> 01:29:48,159
of matrix 0 times matrix zeroes

1823
01:29:45,939 --> 01:29:52,929
composite times the original point in

1824
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:55,510
arrests both rest pose right we sum as

1825
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:57,820
many terms of these as we want we can

1826
01:29:55,510 --> 01:30:01,030
support as many bones as we want and do

1827
01:29:57,819 --> 01:30:03,929
no more work other than the 1 term right

1828
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:07,269
and we just go out as far as we want

1829
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:11,140
this is mesh skinning this right here is

1830
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:16,930
literally the points that you draw and

1831
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:18,250
that's the end of it so before our even

1832
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:22,480
our 2 hours is up

1833
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:25,210
we're done that's it that's the system

1834
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:28,239
you don't even have to know where these

1835
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:30,909
w0 and w1 s come from honestly because

1836
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:33,369
they come from the art tool the art tool

1837
01:30:30,909 --> 01:30:34,930
tells you the weights so the Euclidian

1838
01:30:33,369 --> 01:30:37,659
one-arm stuff that I explained before is

1839
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:39,710
just so you understand how this equation

1840
01:30:37,659 --> 01:30:41,840
works but you don't even have to know

1841
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:44,239
how to make it because the art too tells

1842
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:48,350
you the W's they tell you the weights

1843
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:50,179
those are the vertex weights of each

1844
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:54,110
vertex now there's a slight complication

1845
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:56,270
in here that's a purely practical we

1846
01:30:54,109 --> 01:30:59,420
don't want all cuz I mean there could be

1847
01:30:56,270 --> 01:31:02,660
200 bones easily there could easily be

1848
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:04,460
200 bones in a modern game character no

1849
01:31:02,659 --> 01:31:07,010
one would bat an eyelash at that we have

1850
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:09,739
the horsepower for it you do not want to

1851
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:11,180
some 200 of these terms in a vertex

1852
01:31:09,738 --> 01:31:13,699
shader which is where this is typically

1853
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:15,650
going on for a text assembly typically

1854
01:31:13,699 --> 01:31:17,210
goes in a virgin shader why because you

1855
01:31:15,649 --> 01:31:18,920
typically want to send the mesh down to

1856
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:20,449
the card and store it local to the card

1857
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:22,310
you don't want to send the points down

1858
01:31:20,449 --> 01:31:25,099
each time so you send down the points

1859
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:28,870
with their weights and you then just

1860
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:33,920
send down the bones each frame right

1861
01:31:28,869 --> 01:31:37,130
okay so what does this look like well we

1862
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,480
don't want to actually do 200 of these

1863
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:42,829
matrix multiplies because what's this

1864
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:46,159
going to be it's a W times the t times

1865
01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:49,449
the P right this is an entire matrix

1866
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:52,880
transform that's an entire 4x4 transform

1867
01:31:49,449 --> 01:31:55,819
times an actual scaler a lot of F mats

1868
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:58,369
we want to minimize it so typically what

1869
01:31:55,819 --> 01:31:59,779
we do is we say look we know that any

1870
01:31:58,369 --> 01:32:02,180
given vertex is only going to be

1871
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:03,889
affected by a few bones at most so we

1872
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:05,719
typically say let's give the artist some

1873
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:10,100
fixed number of bones let's say for

1874
01:32:05,719 --> 01:32:15,640
right we then store the indices with the

1875
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:21,920
vertex so a vertex typically consists of

1876
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:24,160
its position right its rest position you

1877
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:26,569
know a normal or a tangent frame

1878
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:29,930
whatever we don't care about these color

1879
01:32:26,569 --> 01:32:34,819
no throw out those and then finally we

1880
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:36,050
have like something like a u8 or a u 16

1881
01:32:34,819 --> 01:32:38,929
depending on how many bones you have

1882
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:41,900
right let's say we have a u 8 which is

1883
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:45,380
just you know an 8-bit value that is the

1884
01:32:41,899 --> 01:32:46,460
index and we have four of those and then

1885
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:48,890
typically we'd also have like a you

1886
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:52,250
eight or something very small that is

1887
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:53,090
the weight for right and so then what we

1888
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:54,800
do is we

1889
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:57,650
use these four weights and these four

1890
01:32:54,800 --> 01:33:00,560
indices to pull out which bones we want

1891
01:32:57,649 --> 01:33:05,408
so we have a constant store in our

1892
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:06,679
vertex shader that has the T C's in it

1893
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:15,500
right

1894
01:33:06,679 --> 01:33:17,630
I keep written it wrong right and we

1895
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:20,300
just use these vertex indices we say

1896
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:21,969
take the first index grab whatever

1897
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:24,170
location that says maybe it's this one

1898
01:33:21,969 --> 01:33:26,480
multiply it by the first weight we

1899
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:28,940
probably encoded it as like a u8 that's

1900
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:32,149
just like whatever this weight is over

1901
01:33:28,939 --> 01:33:33,710
to 55 right and that produces our 0 to 1

1902
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:35,448
value or something right you know who

1903
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:36,380
knows we probably don't need to store

1904
01:33:35,448 --> 01:33:38,089
them all because we probably know they

1905
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:39,079
sum to 1 if we want to we can just or

1906
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:39,980
three of them blah blah blah right

1907
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:44,090
there's all kind of stuff you could do

1908
01:33:39,979 --> 01:33:47,000
here that's that's minutia ok and that's

1909
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:49,460
all we do we just compute some number of

1910
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,260
terms here let's say for we use an index

1911
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:53,389
to say which transforms we want that's

1912
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:54,980
which bones it picks out we use the

1913
01:33:53,389 --> 01:33:57,529
weights that the artist specified for

1914
01:33:54,979 --> 01:33:59,269
those bones and off we go if the artist

1915
01:33:57,529 --> 01:34:02,630
specified more than four bones and we

1916
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:05,420
want to truncate what do we do we get

1917
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:06,949
rid of the lowest weight bones because

1918
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:08,658
they're the ones the artist will notice

1919
01:34:06,948 --> 01:34:10,809
missing the least because there's the

1920
01:34:08,658 --> 01:34:13,158
least effect on the vertex and then we

1921
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:15,860
renormalize using the Euclidean 1 norm

1922
01:34:13,158 --> 01:34:17,629
why that prevents us from ever getting

1923
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:21,109
things that fall outside of the

1924
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:28,099
transform of those points individually

1925
01:34:21,109 --> 01:34:30,920
as we saw right everyone cool with that

1926
01:34:28,099 --> 01:34:34,550
hopefully hopefully that's all clear

1927
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:44,109
there that is fundamentally how much

1928
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:44,110
skating works that's the end of it right

1929
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:50,720
so I don't think there's really anything

1930
01:34:48,109 --> 01:34:54,439
else you need to know to implement mesh

1931
01:34:50,720 --> 01:35:03,440
skinning that's it right that's the end

1932
01:34:54,439 --> 01:35:05,059
of the story for misgiving but as we

1933
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:08,059
know it's never really the end of the

1934
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:10,730
story right it's never quite the end of

1935
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:12,800
story now why isn't it quite the end of

1936
01:35:10,729 --> 01:35:15,019
the story well the reason it's not quite

1937
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:18,440
the end of story is because for all of

1938
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:25,960
the for all of the games that this

1939
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:28,359
concept enabled right it still sucks

1940
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:31,730
[Laughter]

1941
01:35:28,359 --> 01:35:33,439
go back to my original diagram I picked

1942
01:35:31,729 --> 01:35:40,369
elbows for a reason it's because they

1943
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:44,359
always look crappy as I said Myshkin

1944
01:35:40,369 --> 01:35:45,409
gives us something that is better than

1945
01:35:44,359 --> 01:35:50,960
we would have had otherwise

1946
01:35:45,409 --> 01:35:53,750
it gives us this point oops sorry and

1947
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:59,390
this point which is better than any of

1948
01:35:53,750 --> 01:36:03,949
these points okay so it's better but is

1949
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:05,289
it good I mean it's better a lot of game

1950
01:36:03,949 --> 01:36:07,729
shift on it

1951
01:36:05,289 --> 01:36:12,760
90% of all 3d games probably shift on it

1952
01:36:07,729 --> 01:36:17,059
right it's better but is it good okay

1953
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:21,230
and the answer is no it's not very good

1954
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:25,190
right that's not what an elbow looks

1955
01:36:21,229 --> 01:36:27,529
like when it bends at all so let's talk

1956
01:36:25,189 --> 01:36:31,699
a little bit about what I guess I would

1957
01:36:27,529 --> 01:36:33,529
call exercise for the reader which is to

1958
01:36:31,699 --> 01:36:35,689
say if you understood everything that I

1959
01:36:33,529 --> 01:36:37,429
said so far you're in a good position to

1960
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:40,579
go implement your first mesh skinning

1961
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:42,829
system congratulations do it it's a very

1962
01:36:40,579 --> 01:36:44,359
good learning experience and you should

1963
01:36:42,829 --> 01:36:46,189
be able to do something where you can

1964
01:36:44,359 --> 01:36:48,289
maybe look at an existing file format to

1965
01:36:46,189 --> 01:36:50,479
get you started I think likes there's

1966
01:36:48,289 --> 01:36:52,609
some file formats that are somewhat open

1967
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:55,159
that have skinning data I think maybe

1968
01:36:52,609 --> 01:36:57,109
the film box format that Autodesk pushes

1969
01:36:55,159 --> 01:36:57,380
might be kind of open and there's like

1970
01:36:57,109 --> 01:36:59,509
an

1971
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:00,829
okay for reading it or something there's

1972
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:05,810
probably other ones out there I don't

1973
01:37:00,829 --> 01:37:07,850
know so you know you can go take a look

1974
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:09,039
at that right you can go take a look at

1975
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:14,449
that

1976
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:17,810
but understanding where these techniques

1977
01:37:14,448 --> 01:37:20,119
fall short and what we have developed as

1978
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:22,010
more advanced techniques it's very

1979
01:37:20,119 --> 01:37:23,479
important because that's the only way

1980
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:26,360
you can really take the next steps

1981
01:37:23,479 --> 01:37:28,009
towards really high quality character

1982
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:31,039
animation which games have already done

1983
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:33,199
for certain circumstances in certain

1984
01:37:31,039 --> 01:37:38,658
engines and which film definitely does

1985
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:40,369
always alright what we need to recognize

1986
01:37:38,658 --> 01:37:43,369
here is that fundamentally speaking

1987
01:37:40,369 --> 01:37:45,948
giving the artist control over where

1988
01:37:43,369 --> 01:37:47,479
this point lies in between two points

1989
01:37:45,948 --> 01:37:50,539
that are transformed as part of the

1990
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:53,209
skeleton is fundamentally just an

1991
01:37:50,539 --> 01:37:55,670
approximate artistic process for what

1992
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:58,399
they would actually like to do and what

1993
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:59,600
would they actually like to do well what

1994
01:37:58,399 --> 01:38:01,670
are they gonna do when you give them

1995
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,530
this what the artist is gonna do is

1996
01:38:01,670 --> 01:38:05,329
they're gonna bend the arm around and

1997
01:38:03,529 --> 01:38:07,579
they're gonna try and paint the weight

1998
01:38:05,329 --> 01:38:09,198
value which again only really gives them

1999
01:38:07,579 --> 01:38:11,569
the ability to go between these two

2000
01:38:09,198 --> 01:38:13,219
things they're gonna try and adjust the

2001
01:38:11,569 --> 01:38:19,819
weight value so that it looks the least

2002
01:38:13,219 --> 01:38:22,189
bad as they're gonna do right but they

2003
01:38:19,819 --> 01:38:24,738
can never get something that they

2004
01:38:22,189 --> 01:38:26,509
actually want which is an arbitrary

2005
01:38:24,738 --> 01:38:29,209
placement what they'd like to do is just

2006
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:30,980
move the elbow and then move the point

2007
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:33,079
somewhere where should it go well it

2008
01:38:30,979 --> 01:38:34,669
should go there right and this is

2009
01:38:33,079 --> 01:38:37,279
especially true with things like you

2010
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:39,109
know ZBrush or Mudbox or whatever

2011
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:42,259
sculpting tools people use today where

2012
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:44,479
you can just paint like sculpt vertices

2013
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:46,760
into position what I'd rather do is just

2014
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:50,319
bend the arm sculpt it and then know

2015
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:52,880
that as I move the arm joint around

2016
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:56,750
you'll just play back the sculpts that I

2017
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:59,239
did right I mean that's what the artist

2018
01:38:56,750 --> 01:39:01,010
wants they don't want they don't want to

2019
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:02,149
have to just pick a point on that line I

2020
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:04,010
mean what does that have to do with

2021
01:39:02,149 --> 01:39:07,219
anything and furthermore it doesn't

2022
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:10,699
model the problem at all either skin is

2023
01:39:07,219 --> 01:39:11,179
wrapped around it first of all skin is

2024
01:39:10,698 --> 01:39:13,788
it

2025
01:39:11,179 --> 01:39:17,109
self somewhat elastic but it's wrapped

2026
01:39:13,788 --> 01:39:21,078
around fat which you know slides and

2027
01:39:17,109 --> 01:39:22,938
deforms muscle which grows larger

2028
01:39:21,078 --> 01:39:27,139
actually right if you tense a muscle it

2029
01:39:22,939 --> 01:39:31,789
will expand and then only that internal

2030
01:39:27,139 --> 01:39:35,239
bone itself the actual physical bone you

2031
01:39:31,788 --> 01:39:37,399
have really stays for our purposes rigid

2032
01:39:35,238 --> 01:39:39,288
everything else is very deformable and

2033
01:39:37,399 --> 01:39:41,748
so it doesn't make a lot of sense to

2034
01:39:39,288 --> 01:39:43,929
tell the artist pick some rigid line

2035
01:39:41,748 --> 01:39:47,238
that's going to transform in between

2036
01:39:43,929 --> 01:39:49,819
these two effective transforms that

2037
01:39:47,238 --> 01:39:53,089
would only really correctly model a

2038
01:39:49,819 --> 01:39:55,308
literal skeleton like a literal series

2039
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:56,719
of bones it would work just fine but it

2040
01:39:55,309 --> 01:40:01,699
would not work at all

2041
01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:06,078
for the fat the skin and so on and so

2042
01:40:01,698 --> 01:40:09,259
there are two camps two fundamental

2043
01:40:06,078 --> 01:40:12,618
camps that these fall into and one is

2044
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:17,689
just I'll guess I'll call this double

2045
01:40:12,618 --> 01:40:21,558
down right there's the double down camp

2046
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:23,449
and there's the simulation camp and I

2047
01:40:21,559 --> 01:40:25,340
should say that they're not much like

2048
01:40:23,448 --> 01:40:26,958
all of the linear blending they're not

2049
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:29,360
mutually exclusive you can be somewhere

2050
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:30,738
in the middle I'll tell you what both of

2051
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:33,228
them are we to take simulation first

2052
01:40:30,738 --> 01:40:35,299
because it's the least interesting from

2053
01:40:33,229 --> 01:40:36,979
a game perspective because you really

2054
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:40,029
just don't do it very much the

2055
01:40:36,979 --> 01:40:43,119
simulation perspective is oh well

2056
01:40:40,029 --> 01:40:46,518
instead of doing mesh healing at all

2057
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:49,969
let's actually have some really complex

2058
01:40:46,519 --> 01:40:52,929
set of things that model surfaces and

2059
01:40:49,969 --> 01:40:55,880
we'll attach the points to those right

2060
01:40:52,929 --> 01:40:57,800
so the simulation approach says alright

2061
01:40:55,880 --> 01:41:01,880
I'm gonna actually pretend there's a

2062
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:04,820
real bone it's like for reals made of

2063
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:08,150
like marrow and stuff right

2064
01:41:04,819 --> 01:41:11,029
and and then I'm going to actually say

2065
01:41:08,149 --> 01:41:14,379
that there's like muscle fiber like

2066
01:41:11,029 --> 01:41:17,809
wrapped around it like for realsies

2067
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:20,828
right and then I'm gonna say that

2068
01:41:17,809 --> 01:41:20,829
there's a fat layer

2069
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:28,639
and then I'm gonna say there's actual

2070
01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:33,560
skin like I'm literally going to do all

2071
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:37,430
of that crap right and then when I move

2072
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:42,320
this joint I'm gonna actually do finite

2073
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:43,869
element solves you know or something to

2074
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:46,130
figure out how this skin will

2075
01:41:43,869 --> 01:41:47,899
interpenetrate how the fat will bulge

2076
01:41:46,130 --> 01:41:50,239
together how the muscles will contract

2077
01:41:47,899 --> 01:41:53,059
I'm going to simulate if I pull it this

2078
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:56,979
way that the bicep is gonna bulge here

2079
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:56,980
right blah blah blah blah blah

2080
01:41:57,489 --> 01:42:01,880
fundamentally speaking this is the route

2081
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:04,250
you want to take if what you're trying

2082
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:04,760
to do is put as much programming in as

2083
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:07,609
possible

2084
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:09,650
and the least art right what you may

2085
01:42:07,609 --> 01:42:11,179
want to do depending on your goals you

2086
01:42:09,649 --> 01:42:14,029
may want to go a programming or heavy

2087
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:16,340
route and that is simulation just like

2088
01:42:14,029 --> 01:42:18,769
everything else the more simulation you

2089
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:20,659
do the less art you need kind of like

2090
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:22,430
how physics remove some of the need for

2091
01:42:20,659 --> 01:42:24,800
animation because you can just simulate

2092
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:27,409
what you're trying to do right but it

2093
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,360
removes the art from the process it's

2094
01:42:27,409 --> 01:42:31,279
not very artistic it's not very

2095
01:42:29,359 --> 01:42:33,799
controllable because it's a simulation

2096
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:35,960
under the hood just like physics makes

2097
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,850
it pretty hard to produce animations you

2098
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:39,500
actually want you have to sit there and

2099
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:41,240
fuss with them a lot and we spend a lot

2100
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:43,130
of time figuring out how to move them

2101
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:45,349
more towards the artistic side of things

2102
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:47,930
right so it has some drawbacks but it

2103
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:49,400
has some strengths and the biggest

2104
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:51,829
strength it has is maybe it can produce

2105
01:42:49,399 --> 01:42:53,420
use once you do it once maybe it can

2106
01:42:51,829 --> 01:42:55,010
produce a lot of useful animation

2107
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:57,260
results for you without an artist having

2108
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:59,000
to be there to adjust them now the

2109
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:01,220
double down camp is to say let's go the

2110
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,930
artist route they were already modeling

2111
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:04,400
everything using tools they already

2112
01:43:02,930 --> 01:43:07,220
built the skeleton themselves using

2113
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:12,469
tools so let's just give them tools to

2114
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:14,150
do more work here and so what they do in

2115
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:18,970
the DoubleDown camp is exactly what I

2116
01:43:14,149 --> 01:43:18,969
just said let's have the artist sculpt

2117
01:43:19,479 --> 01:43:26,659
more right artists sculpt more you know

2118
01:43:24,649 --> 01:43:29,389
I'm saying so basically what we do there

2119
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:32,359
is we say all right the artist is going

2120
01:43:29,390 --> 01:43:34,160
to give us a rest pose yes that's like

2121
01:43:32,359 --> 01:43:35,630
whatever the arm looks like what it's

2122
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:36,300
just out but then you know what else

2123
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:38,460
they're going to do

2124
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:40,829
they're gonna pose the arm in like an

2125
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:43,170
arm up position and they're gonna model

2126
01:43:40,829 --> 01:43:45,359
the bicep bulge right and then they're

2127
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:51,289
gonna rotate the arm over and they're

2128
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:56,369
gonna model that okay and so what these

2129
01:43:51,289 --> 01:43:59,519
what these with this camp what doubling

2130
01:43:56,369 --> 01:44:01,710
down on art input does is it said let's

2131
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:04,650
have the artist give us lots of examples

2132
01:44:01,710 --> 01:44:07,680
and then what our jobs gonna do going to

2133
01:44:04,649 --> 01:44:10,679
be is to change those blending equations

2134
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:13,560
to be able to reproduce as closely as

2135
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:17,130
possible all of the examples that our

2136
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:19,560
artist gave us by driving which samples

2137
01:44:17,130 --> 01:44:21,810
we use off of the position of the

2138
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:23,910
underlying skeleton and any other

2139
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:26,850
parameters they want to give us for

2140
01:44:23,909 --> 01:44:29,880
example we could have a stress parameter

2141
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:33,570
that you specify for each bone that is

2142
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:35,489
how taut the muscle is right and so the

2143
01:44:33,569 --> 01:44:37,590
artist can crank up the stress is the is

2144
01:44:35,489 --> 01:44:40,949
the dude like really you know flexing

2145
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:43,199
his arm or is he the slack right because

2146
01:44:40,949 --> 01:44:44,789
I can I can do that with my arm or I can

2147
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:47,760
do that with my arm right and you can

2148
01:44:44,789 --> 01:44:49,260
see that the bicep you know totally

2149
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,940
changes its shape even though the

2150
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:52,440
skeleton hasn't changed right and that's

2151
01:44:50,939 --> 01:44:55,259
how much stress you know it's being put

2152
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:58,019
through there so we extend the parameter

2153
01:44:55,260 --> 01:45:02,579
space of the skeleton to include both

2154
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:06,870
bone positions and rotations as before

2155
01:45:02,579 --> 01:45:11,460
but we also include in that set we also

2156
01:45:06,869 --> 01:45:14,869
include sort of scaler or I shouldn't

2157
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:19,319
say scaler but oh there are parameters

2158
01:45:14,869 --> 01:45:22,260
right they could be anything the artist

2159
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:24,659
wants and what we do when we look at

2160
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:27,750
these systems is we take an input mesh

2161
01:45:24,659 --> 01:45:29,489
plus the set of bone positions and

2162
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:32,489
parameters that the artist said it

2163
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:35,579
correlated to and we typically use what

2164
01:45:32,489 --> 01:45:38,849
is known well and this is maybe my term

2165
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:42,390
but we use a reduction process or a

2166
01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:45,180
fitting process to take a large number

2167
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:47,789
of examples and produce smaller blending

2168
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:49,860
equations that still look almost exactly

2169
01:45:47,789 --> 01:45:52,979
like the ones I already

2170
01:45:49,859 --> 01:45:56,158
just with more terms that we can compute

2171
01:45:52,979 --> 01:46:00,599
at runtime given a set of these to

2172
01:45:56,158 --> 01:46:02,488
produce an output set okay reading more

2173
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:08,039
about this I would highly recommend the

2174
01:46:02,488 --> 01:46:12,479
paper pose space deformation by

2175
01:46:08,039 --> 01:46:14,010
industrial light magic it is probably

2176
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:17,279
the easiest one to understand and it was

2177
01:46:14,010 --> 01:46:20,250
an early one in the field so it's pretty

2178
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:23,189
basic and obviously we've done way more

2179
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:27,319
complicated stuff since then but I would

2180
01:46:23,189 --> 01:46:27,319
recommend that one to give you a link

2181
01:46:32,359 --> 01:46:40,738
this is it maybe isn't it all right

2182
01:46:39,329 --> 01:46:44,510
maybe it wasn't by Industrial Light and

2183
01:46:40,738 --> 01:46:44,509
Magic I don't know what's entropolis is

2184
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:53,239
why did I think this was pose

2185
01:47:00,869 --> 01:47:13,840
um all right well I have no idea what's

2186
01:47:11,409 --> 01:47:17,460
entropolis is so nevermind I thought it

2187
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,460
was Industrial Light man I'm wrong I

2188
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:29,410
guess it's this alright I apologize and

2189
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:32,010
trap list or misattribution anyway I

2190
01:47:29,409 --> 01:47:34,599
think that's probably the easiest paper

2191
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:36,789
it does involve some matrix fitting

2192
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:38,710
which we haven't covered here and is

2193
01:47:36,789 --> 01:47:43,210
kind of a topic for a different time

2194
01:47:38,710 --> 01:47:46,239
it's its own topic and so I'm gonna end

2195
01:47:43,210 --> 01:47:48,130
it here where we perfectly fit this into

2196
01:47:46,238 --> 01:47:52,899
our into our window which is pretty

2197
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:55,029
crazy but I think I've covered pretty

2198
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:56,589
much everything you need to know to get

2199
01:47:55,029 --> 01:47:58,539
started on my skinning if there's

2200
01:47:56,590 --> 01:48:01,659
anything I left out I'm sure we can

2201
01:47:58,539 --> 01:48:06,250
cover it here in the Q&amp;A so hopefully

2202
01:48:01,659 --> 01:48:08,229
that pretty much is that I'm gonna pop

2203
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:11,859
the Q&amp;A here and see if anyone has any

2204
01:48:08,229 --> 01:48:13,948
questions on topic to this please let me

2205
01:48:11,859 --> 01:48:13,948
know

2206
01:48:18,569 --> 01:48:26,559
for what version of grainy had I worked

2207
01:48:21,219 --> 01:48:36,480
I did all of the versions up through 2.7

2208
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:36,480
maybe 2.5 pausing

2209
01:48:53,828 --> 01:49:04,198
okay so I did all of the versions prior

2210
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:04,199
to 2.4 it's where what I did

2211
01:49:11,689 --> 01:49:17,729
yeah so I think all of the versions so

2212
01:49:14,489 --> 01:49:21,359
2.3 was my last full version I did and

2213
01:49:17,729 --> 01:49:24,000
somewhere in between 2.3 and 2.4 I think

2214
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:27,229
was when I handed it off to Tom and I

2215
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,229
did all of the previous versions

2216
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:34,100
starting from Oh 7b which was the first

2217
01:49:29,699 --> 01:49:34,099
release all the way through

2218
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:47,879
are the bone transform inverses stored

2219
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:51,448
relative to the mesh Center yes

2220
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:54,659
generally speaking the idea is that you

2221
01:49:51,448 --> 01:49:57,539
want to pick a single space in which you

2222
01:49:54,658 --> 01:50:00,359
store all of your source data so you

2223
01:49:57,539 --> 01:50:02,840
store the entire mesh and all of the

2224
01:50:00,359 --> 01:50:09,529
inverse transforms you store those all

2225
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:09,529
relative to the original single model Oh

2226
01:50:13,488 --> 01:50:18,089
Molly's asleep right now but I'll let

2227
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:19,500
her look out the window later sorry what

2228
01:50:18,090 --> 01:50:21,480
file format would you recommend for

2229
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:33,149
beginners and for someone not willing to

2230
01:50:21,479 --> 01:50:34,829
use a Lib so obj files are the easiest

2231
01:50:33,149 --> 01:50:40,369
files because they're just a text file

2232
01:50:34,829 --> 01:50:43,260
that's obvious what the stuff is but my

2233
01:50:40,369 --> 01:50:46,649
my problem with them is I don't know if

2234
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:50,070
if most art tools will export a weight

2235
01:50:46,649 --> 01:50:52,829
section for you or not so if you can get

2236
01:50:50,069 --> 01:50:55,139
a art tool to output an obj file that

2237
01:50:52,829 --> 01:50:58,529
has vertex weights that would be a good

2238
01:50:55,139 --> 01:51:00,529
way to start but I just don't know so my

2239
01:50:58,529 --> 01:51:05,340
problem is I'm not sure what file format

2240
01:51:00,529 --> 01:51:09,179
would be best to start in because I

2241
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:11,279
don't know which ones have weights when

2242
01:51:09,179 --> 01:51:13,949
I started granny there were no exports

2243
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:16,079
with weights granny has its own exporter

2244
01:51:13,948 --> 01:51:19,829
that you run inside the art tool to

2245
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:24,689
extract the information it doesn't use

2246
01:51:19,829 --> 01:51:26,519
an existing file format would busy a

2247
01:51:24,689 --> 01:51:31,649
curve work for the fatty part of the arm

2248
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:35,610
probably be terrible um busy curves

2249
01:51:31,649 --> 01:51:41,629
don't work well but they have been tried

2250
01:51:35,609 --> 01:51:41,630
there was a package called

2251
01:51:47,198 --> 01:52:05,828
I think it was called characters this so

2252
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:09,368
there is a there is a plugin for the

2253
01:52:05,828 --> 01:52:11,319
original 3d studio max at the very first

2254
01:52:09,368 --> 01:52:13,359
version of 3d studio max which isn't the

2255
01:52:11,319 --> 01:52:14,880
first thread in the 3d studio because 3d

2256
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:18,939
studio actually went up through version

2257
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:20,739
for at least possibly 5 in Dass so when

2258
01:52:18,939 --> 01:52:23,348
they ported it from das to Windows and

2259
01:52:20,738 --> 01:52:25,779
made 3d studio max there was a thing

2260
01:52:23,349 --> 01:52:29,770
called character studio which was done

2261
01:52:25,779 --> 01:52:35,408
by like mmm was I don't know who did it

2262
01:52:29,770 --> 01:52:37,389
originally I don't remember but

2263
01:52:35,408 --> 01:52:39,578
character studio featured a thing called

2264
01:52:37,389 --> 01:52:41,050
biped which is a little like intelligent

2265
01:52:39,578 --> 01:52:42,939
skeleton that did some things

2266
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:44,380
automatically for you kind of crappy but

2267
01:52:42,939 --> 01:52:47,979
it was better than most things at the

2268
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:50,139
time and then physique which was a mesh

2269
01:52:47,979 --> 01:52:53,259
skinning tool and the way that physique

2270
01:52:50,139 --> 01:52:58,179
worked was it actually threaded up as a

2271
01:52:53,260 --> 01:53:04,020
a curve through the bones it doesn't

2272
01:52:58,179 --> 01:53:04,020
really help much it's not great but it's

2273
01:53:04,529 --> 01:53:08,439
it's something you can look to if you

2274
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:14,739
want to know how that works I wouldn't

2275
01:53:08,439 --> 01:53:16,868
recommend it how often would composite

2276
01:53:14,738 --> 01:53:17,618
bone matrices usually be updated per

2277
01:53:16,868 --> 01:53:21,399
frame

2278
01:53:17,618 --> 01:53:23,738
yes per frame so every frame what you do

2279
01:53:21,399 --> 01:53:28,210
is you compute the results of your

2280
01:53:23,738 --> 01:53:30,569
animation that gives you a new world

2281
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:35,020
space transform for each of your bones

2282
01:53:30,569 --> 01:53:37,539
you multiply in the inverse that you

2283
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:40,179
store it in the file and every frame you

2284
01:53:37,539 --> 01:53:43,769
do that combination to give you your

2285
01:53:40,179 --> 01:53:43,770
final world transform

2286
01:53:45,158 --> 01:53:51,429
how do quaternions fit into this they

2287
01:53:47,829 --> 01:53:52,988
don't so quaternions really have nothing

2288
01:53:51,429 --> 01:53:58,060
to do with any of the stuff that I've

2289
01:53:52,988 --> 01:53:59,979
talked about they're quatrain Ian's are

2290
01:53:58,060 --> 01:54:02,260
traditionally used in animation to

2291
01:53:59,979 --> 01:54:05,229
represent the rotations of bones but

2292
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:06,520
that's purely a storage format or it's

2293
01:54:05,229 --> 01:54:08,919
not many stories right a manipulation

2294
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:25,389
format they can get you some benefits

2295
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:30,029
right there are things called there is a

2296
01:54:25,389 --> 01:54:30,029
thing called dual quaternion skinning

2297
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:38,920
and that is basically a sort of a

2298
01:54:34,929 --> 01:54:44,079
separate technique for skinning that you

2299
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:47,020
know I haven't implemented this

2300
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:49,119
personally it came out much much well

2301
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:52,810
after I was done with with working on

2302
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:56,710
granny at all you can take a look at

2303
01:54:52,810 --> 01:54:59,590
this if you're interested but it it's

2304
01:54:56,710 --> 01:55:00,819
really I don't know how I don't have a

2305
01:54:59,590 --> 01:55:02,560
strong opinion about it because I've

2306
01:55:00,819 --> 01:55:05,109
never myself I don't know how much you

2307
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,429
would really care I think it's kind of

2308
01:55:05,109 --> 01:55:07,929
something that's not probably

2309
01:55:06,429 --> 01:55:09,369
particularly necessary because you want

2310
01:55:07,929 --> 01:55:10,600
sculpted results

2311
01:55:09,369 --> 01:55:12,429
you're really not trying to fix

2312
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:14,560
artifacts like this in the real world

2313
01:55:12,429 --> 01:55:17,350
you tend to just add more artistic

2314
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:19,300
sculpting to the process but that's one

2315
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:22,000
place you can have quaternions involved

2316
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:24,310
directly in the skinning process but

2317
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,649
that's a special case and isn't really

2318
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:29,760
necessarily a general idea about mesh

2319
01:55:26,649 --> 01:55:29,759
getting that makes sense

2320
01:55:39,979 --> 01:55:43,759
what kind of skinning to be used for

2321
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:49,250
handmade here oh we don't really do

2322
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:51,110
skinning in handmade here oh we covered

2323
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:54,319
this just because I wanted to cover

2324
01:55:51,109 --> 01:55:55,579
because people had asked how do you

2325
01:55:54,319 --> 01:55:57,439
recommend to go about learning a new

2326
01:55:55,579 --> 01:55:58,609
language or technology that's not a

2327
01:55:57,439 --> 01:56:01,669
little off topic for this stream you

2328
01:55:58,609 --> 01:56:03,559
probably asked on different one if you

2329
01:56:01,670 --> 01:56:05,720
miss live chartreuse no Roman you did

2330
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:07,090
not I have not played Chrono Trigger yet

2331
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:09,860
I'm kind of waiting for it to be on sale

2332
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:13,190
and my chartreuse is almost still almost

2333
01:56:09,859 --> 01:56:14,509
full maybe this week we'll do some

2334
01:56:13,189 --> 01:56:16,519
chartreuse gaming it might not be Chrono

2335
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:19,190
Trigger cuz I said I was kind of waiting

2336
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:26,600
for it to go on sale I have a wish list

2337
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:27,619
but if you send a lot of data to the GPU

2338
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:28,789
it doesn't have that much memory is

2339
01:56:27,619 --> 01:56:31,180
there some sort of virtual memory that

2340
01:56:28,789 --> 01:56:35,479
it will be used or will it crash

2341
01:56:31,180 --> 01:56:39,110
so typically speaking that depends a lot

2342
01:56:35,479 --> 01:56:41,959
on what APR you're using and also the

2343
01:56:39,109 --> 01:56:43,670
answer is generally yes nowadays there

2344
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:45,529
is some sorts of virtual memory

2345
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:47,000
happening there but even in the old days

2346
01:56:45,529 --> 01:56:48,859
there was not kind of some virtual

2347
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:51,380
memory in the sense that the driver

2348
01:56:48,859 --> 01:56:53,179
would actually manage it for you so you

2349
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:56,420
kind of didn't know but behind your back

2350
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:57,560
it was swapping memory out so that's a

2351
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:58,670
topic I don't really want to cover on

2352
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:00,380
this because it doesn't really have

2353
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:02,600
anything to do with mesh skinning but

2354
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:04,250
the answer is to certain extent yes to a

2355
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:05,630
certain scent no and that it depends on

2356
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:07,750
which card which driver you're talking

2357
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:07,750
about

2358
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:26,799
so the lerp versus slurp is in the

2359
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:29,199
animation system and not on the skinning

2360
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:32,139
system that is correct the skinning

2361
01:57:29,198 --> 01:57:35,759
system does not fundamentally care how

2362
01:57:32,139 --> 01:57:38,650
you are producing the points

2363
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:40,570
it's the skinning system is just that

2364
01:57:38,649 --> 01:57:43,118
inverse transform and then a weighted

2365
01:57:40,569 --> 01:57:45,299
blend how you're producing the actual

2366
01:57:43,118 --> 01:57:47,979
transforms forward in space is

2367
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:50,560
completely up to you so the skeletal

2368
01:57:47,979 --> 01:57:54,399
animation system is the part that cares

2369
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:57,159
about looping versus slurping the

2370
01:57:54,399 --> 01:58:00,009
skinned mesh getting never needs to do

2371
01:57:57,158 --> 01:58:03,549
anything with slurping that's just

2372
01:58:00,010 --> 01:58:04,929
unnecessary as far as I'm concerned not

2373
01:58:03,550 --> 01:58:06,699
to say you couldn't engineer one that

2374
01:58:04,929 --> 01:58:08,590
did it and that dual quaternions

2375
01:58:06,698 --> 01:58:10,928
skinning is kind of an example of

2376
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:17,170
someone saying maybe we should be doing

2377
01:58:10,929 --> 01:58:20,050
more rotational things inside our inside

2378
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:21,340
our skinning system but the basic

2379
01:58:20,050 --> 01:58:24,400
skinning systems that form the

2380
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:29,550
foundation of most games even today just

2381
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:35,229
fundamentally don't do they don't use

2382
01:58:29,550 --> 01:58:37,389
things like quaternions to produce the

2383
01:58:35,229 --> 01:58:39,698
final blend weights to produce the final

2384
01:58:37,389 --> 01:58:41,800
blend points typically you're using

2385
01:58:39,698 --> 01:58:45,368
quaternions to produce the interim

2386
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:50,500
transforms that you use to then do the

2387
01:58:45,368 --> 01:58:52,118
blend equation and again with the caveat

2388
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:55,630
that things like dual quaternions

2389
01:58:52,118 --> 01:58:56,859
getting to exist so some people do go

2390
01:58:55,630 --> 01:59:00,359
kind of a different direction with it

2391
01:58:56,859 --> 01:59:00,359
there's not like a right answer

2392
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:14,530
you

2393
01:59:23,550 --> 01:59:27,519
all right I think we've pretty much got

2394
01:59:26,408 --> 01:59:29,828
all the questions I don't see any more

2395
01:59:27,519 --> 01:59:32,619
in there I think we could say if they

2396
01:59:29,828 --> 01:59:37,658
wrap it up quick quick check does anyone

2397
01:59:32,618 --> 01:59:40,768
have any questions that are about mesh

2398
01:59:37,658 --> 01:59:40,768
getting before we close up

2399
02:00:00,498 --> 02:00:08,448
roman asks coordinates you've drawn

2400
02:00:02,689 --> 02:00:10,550
Xia's up while opengl is deep so this is

2401
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:13,569
kind of an interesting i'll quickly say

2402
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:16,279
this briefly since we don't have any

2403
02:00:13,569 --> 02:00:19,368
questions that are totally on topic and

2404
02:00:16,279 --> 02:00:23,958
this is somewhat on topic i will just go

2405
02:00:19,368 --> 02:00:27,498
ahead and do this so it's worth noting

2406
02:00:23,958 --> 02:00:32,569
that saying that opengl has z is up

2407
02:00:27,498 --> 02:00:44,148
while opengl z is deep is kind of a

2408
02:00:32,569 --> 02:00:45,679
misnomer and let me tell you why i think

2409
02:00:44,149 --> 02:00:47,389
if this is similar to the mirror in

2410
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:49,550
algae a lot of people are like why do

2411
02:00:47,389 --> 02:00:51,139
mirrors reverse things left to right

2412
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:54,050
instead of up and down and the answer is

2413
02:00:51,139 --> 02:00:55,939
they don't they reverse them period and

2414
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:58,038
whether you think of it as reversing

2415
02:00:55,939 --> 02:00:59,418
them upside up and down or whether you

2416
02:00:58,038 --> 02:01:01,550
think of them as reversing it left to

2417
02:00:59,418 --> 02:01:04,338
right is really because of how it's

2418
02:01:01,550 --> 02:01:06,019
happening in your head not because of

2419
02:01:04,338 --> 02:01:15,109
how it's happening in the world the same

2420
02:01:06,019 --> 02:01:19,838
is true here so in your head what you're

2421
02:01:15,109 --> 02:01:25,359
thinking is well my computer monitor is

2422
02:01:19,838 --> 02:01:28,248
obviously situated like this I hung it

2423
02:01:25,359 --> 02:01:32,479
you know on a monitor stand or something

2424
02:01:28,248 --> 02:01:33,608
and I am a human who looks forward at

2425
02:01:32,479 --> 02:01:37,519
this monitor

2426
02:01:33,609 --> 02:01:39,979
therefore when I'm using OpenGL because

2427
02:01:37,519 --> 02:01:44,570
it's coordinate system aligns this way

2428
02:01:39,979 --> 02:01:50,539
that's that's the Z right and that's the

2429
02:01:44,569 --> 02:01:54,078
X and that's the Y we go in OpenGL Z is

2430
02:01:50,538 --> 02:01:55,488
this is it's it's looking backwards

2431
02:01:54,078 --> 02:01:57,728
basically not quite forwards it's

2432
02:01:55,488 --> 02:02:02,208
actually the backwards vector right and

2433
02:01:57,729 --> 02:02:06,619
that's because you applied a whole bunch

2434
02:02:02,208 --> 02:02:09,529
of human specific stuff to your thinking

2435
02:02:06,618 --> 02:02:12,529
about it right how you tend to put a

2436
02:02:09,529 --> 02:02:12,948
monitor up right what you expect that

2437
02:02:12,529 --> 02:02:16,340
monitor

2438
02:02:12,948 --> 02:02:20,269
to show how you expect to sit in front

2439
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:23,150
of the monitor but in reality I could

2440
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:26,000
put the monitor anywhere I could put the

2441
02:02:23,149 --> 02:02:28,819
monitor like this and I could have a

2442
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,100
chair with the sling in it and I'm

2443
02:02:28,819 --> 02:02:33,349
hanging over the monitor like this with

2444
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:39,320
my arms out like Superman looking down

2445
02:02:33,350 --> 02:02:42,800
at the monitor right and the monitor is

2446
02:02:39,319 --> 02:02:45,229
sitting on the floor at that point what

2447
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:48,380
is open jails coordinate system I asked

2448
02:02:45,229 --> 02:02:54,789
you right well let me try 100 percent

2449
02:02:48,380 --> 02:03:01,279
correctly to the diagram it's that and

2450
02:02:54,789 --> 02:03:05,750
that is ease up right Z is up it points

2451
02:03:01,279 --> 02:03:11,170
upwards so really all you have to do if

2452
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:14,750
you want Z to be up and x and y to be

2453
02:03:11,170 --> 02:03:16,760
the world plane but you can if you want

2454
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:18,469
to it's up to you you know who knows if

2455
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:22,760
you want Y is up Z is up to your choice

2456
02:03:18,469 --> 02:03:24,380
it's just say what when I start out what

2457
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:27,020
am I looking at am I looking at

2458
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:32,329
something you know do I expect my

2459
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:34,640
startup to be an FPS or an RTS if it's

2460
02:03:32,329 --> 02:03:38,539
an RTS I start out looking down at the

2461
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:40,670
world that is Z is up right if it's an

2462
02:03:38,539 --> 02:03:44,529
FPS then I started out looking out at

2463
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:47,630
the world and that is why is up right in

2464
02:03:44,529 --> 02:03:50,179
OpenGL native coordinates you know I'm

2465
02:03:47,630 --> 02:03:54,109
saying so I just choose the arts yes

2466
02:03:50,179 --> 02:03:55,819
paradigm I choose when I turn on my

2467
02:03:54,109 --> 02:04:00,469
monitor that I'm looking down at the

2468
02:03:55,819 --> 02:04:03,170
world right like an RTS instead of

2469
02:04:00,469 --> 02:04:06,079
looking up at the world we're looking

2470
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:09,250
out at the world like an FPS does that

2471
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:09,250
help all Roman

2472
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:30,359
else faceless says the ligament seems to

2473
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:32,850
have a bearing on the arm movement also

2474
02:04:30,359 --> 02:04:34,589
the pivot of the arm knee shoulder seem

2475
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:35,670
to be on the outside and not the center

2476
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:38,340
which makes me think we are thinking

2477
02:04:35,670 --> 02:04:40,529
about the problem naively who knows no

2478
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:43,050
you're correct in your observations and

2479
02:04:40,529 --> 02:04:45,479
a lot of times artists will do that so

2480
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:47,969
if you look at where they you know place

2481
02:04:45,479 --> 02:04:50,729
the bone even in a naive mesh skinning

2482
02:04:47,969 --> 02:04:53,159
system they will often put it like up

2483
02:04:50,729 --> 02:04:55,529
towards the outside so that when it

2484
02:04:53,159 --> 02:04:57,510
bends it produces a better result so

2485
02:04:55,529 --> 02:05:00,179
you're not wrong and artists will do

2486
02:04:57,510 --> 02:05:01,890
that for sure

2487
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:03,750
and that's just about getting a better

2488
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:10,500
base result before you ever sculpt

2489
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:12,779
anything the Roman says he said Redmond

2490
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:15,270
if you want to use that chartreuse turn

2491
02:05:12,779 --> 02:05:17,189
the chartreuse is for me trying to play

2492
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:21,090
Chrono Trigger well I'm a little bit

2493
02:05:17,189 --> 02:05:22,079
tipsy Brian Griese I've been going

2494
02:05:21,090 --> 02:05:23,159
through the multi-threaded code memory

2495
02:05:22,079 --> 02:05:25,769
what up so you're talking about loading

2496
02:05:23,159 --> 02:05:27,119
the asset files and chunks okay that's

2497
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:29,010
kind of off topic so let's let's do that

2498
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:36,149
for what scream that that's that let's

2499
02:05:29,010 --> 02:05:37,500
do that on a regular stream following on

2500
02:05:36,149 --> 02:05:38,909
from what you've explained about

2501
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:40,649
coordinate systems in OpenGL and how we

2502
02:05:38,909 --> 02:05:43,680
choose it what do we need to do to set

2503
02:05:40,649 --> 02:05:47,250
up Z up instead again trying to just

2504
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:50,489
underscore this it already is it's just

2505
02:05:47,250 --> 02:05:53,039
what you it's just what your mind thinks

2506
02:05:50,488 --> 02:05:55,799
of the default camera position right if

2507
02:05:53,039 --> 02:06:00,090
you want Z to be up all you have to do

2508
02:05:55,800 --> 02:06:03,390
is think that in a non rotated camera

2509
02:06:00,090 --> 02:06:04,770
points down that's it now Z is up it's

2510
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:07,310
just a change in thinking there's you

2511
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:12,780
don't do anything else

2512
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:13,710
you have to do anything it's just how

2513
02:06:12,779 --> 02:06:16,609
are you thinking about your camera

2514
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:16,609
that's it

2515
02:06:17,810 --> 02:06:23,000
your electrodes from that yesterday made

2516
02:06:19,909 --> 02:06:27,109
national headlines yeah it did alright

2517
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:30,189
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it up

2518
02:06:27,109 --> 02:06:32,119
because we're done with our stream today

2519
02:06:30,189 --> 02:06:33,229
thank you everyone for joining me for

2520
02:06:32,119 --> 02:06:33,739
the upside of handmade heroes with a

2521
02:06:33,229 --> 02:06:35,989
pleasure

2522
02:06:33,739 --> 02:06:37,670
black boarding with you as always I hope

2523
02:06:35,989 --> 02:06:39,199
that gave you a pretty intuitive

2524
02:06:37,670 --> 02:06:41,690
understanding of all of the components

2525
02:06:39,199 --> 02:06:42,889
of the mesh skinning pipeline if it

2526
02:06:41,689 --> 02:06:45,169
didn't

2527
02:06:42,890 --> 02:06:47,630
I apologize hopefully you can look to

2528
02:06:45,170 --> 02:06:50,000
some secondary resources or drop by

2529
02:06:47,630 --> 02:06:52,279
handmade hero sometime handmade hero or

2530
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:54,770
you can always go to the watch page and

2531
02:06:52,279 --> 02:06:56,599
when it's not live it will have a

2532
02:06:54,770 --> 02:06:59,060
schedule on there saying when it is live

2533
02:06:56,600 --> 02:07:01,850
so you can always stop by and ask

2534
02:06:59,060 --> 02:07:03,770
questions and we can cover anything that

2535
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:06,289
you might not have understood about this

2536
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:08,810
introduction to mesh getting I always

2537
02:07:06,289 --> 02:07:11,269
take questions during both the pre

2538
02:07:08,810 --> 02:07:13,370
stream before we start and also the post

2539
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:15,530
stream Q&amp;A so you can come by and ask

2540
02:07:13,369 --> 02:07:17,599
those questions that's it for today I'll

2541
02:07:15,529 --> 02:07:20,269
be back here either sometime this week

2542
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:22,730
if I'm feeling saucy or next weekend

2543
02:07:20,270 --> 02:07:24,770
with more handmade hero where we will be

2544
02:07:22,729 --> 02:07:28,579
putting our new lighting sampling

2545
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:30,440
spheres into effect that hopefully

2546
02:07:28,579 --> 02:07:32,000
you'll join me for until then have fun

2547
02:07:30,439 --> 02:07:32,569
