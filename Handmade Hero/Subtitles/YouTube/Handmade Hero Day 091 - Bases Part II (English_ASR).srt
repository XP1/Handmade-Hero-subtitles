1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,210
there we go okay sure we are on day 1991

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,219
that's 91 hours of programming

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,990
I guess that's that's what--that's this

4
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:14,339
is our second week we're a third week

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,429
we're sort of somewhere in our third

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,710
week of programming which is kind of

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,969
exciting we we accidentally started

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,130
working on the renderer I don't know how

9
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,079
it happened it just kind of happened so

10
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,939
here we are on handmade Hiro working on

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,618
the renderer and I was trying to talk

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,000
about bases but I completely ran out of

13
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,368
time yesterday so it'll kind of have to

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,920
do a little bit of a reboot Ruby reboot

15
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,179
here and talk about bases today so that

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,129
hopefully we can get through them have

17
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,238
enough time to get through them if you

18
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,500
would like to follow along at home

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:45,718
definitely be sure to download de 90s

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,659
source code if you preorder the game on

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,489
handmade Hirota or Ronde 91 so unzipped

22
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,209
a 90s source code that's what we're

23
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:53,609
starting with here

24
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,489
and that way you will line up with me

25
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:59,460
alright so Basie's I have one thing to

26
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:02,070
mention I don't know if pseudonyms 73

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,769
already mentioned this potentially but I

28
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,010
realized kind of after I I sort of was

29
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,659
sleepily explaining this stuff that when

30
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,939
I was talking about linear independence

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,820
yesterday I realized I did have a reason

32
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:18,149
why I could legitimately say that linear

33
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:20,548
independence was good and it was I had

34
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,350
said minimal up here but really minimal

35
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,540
was just a way of saying linear

36
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,009
independence right because what minimal

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,560
meant in my case was I saying

38
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,489
you know I said if we have a 2d

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,228
coordinate system that means we have two

40
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,000
basis vectors and I said that was

41
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:35,368
minimal but that's that's what linear

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,200
independence actually sort of means in a

43
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:43,769
2d space you can only have two bases

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,060
without becoming redundant like you will

45
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:47,399
no longer be linear dependent if you go

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,570
up to three so in some sense you could

47
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,710
say that this was being able so if you

48
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:51,059
do happen to want to learn linear

49
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,688
algebra and you'll learn what this is

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,868
really these were sort of the same thing

51
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:59,519
you know minimal is sort of a way of

52
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:03,149
saying linearly independent and spans

53
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,859
the space right so again not important

54
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,019
really for the discussion but if you

55
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,360
should be doing some linear algebra

56
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,669
education on your own time it's probably

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
worth saying that that was sort of I

58
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,979
just I don't know kind of walked right

59
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,180
by it

60
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:16,530
today when I was talking about it I was

61
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,519
like I guess I can't really fit linear

62
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,580
independence there but we sort of

63
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,709
actually did all right so let's go let's

64
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,230
go to our little basis discussion here

65
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,430
day 91 let's talk about Basie's I'm

66
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,848
gonna work backwards from what I

67
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,780
actually want in the effort in order to

68
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:32,280
try and give sort of a better

69
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,299
explanation yesterday I was very sleepy

70
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,969
and I felt that my explanation just

71
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:39,510
wasn't very good so here we go all right

72
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:42,359
so I'm on a screen right and we sort of

73
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:43,919
already decided that you know we had

74
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,780
this this is what a screen looked like

75
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,798
but doesn't really matter necessarily

76
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,628
what a screen looked like we talked

77
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,400
about it yesterday which is that the

78
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:51,689
y-axis goes down and the x-axis goes

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
across which is to say that if the

80
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:55,530
coordinate that you're using for Y used

81
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,469
to increase you will move down the

82
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,969
screen right and so what I was trying to

83
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,829
get across yesterday is really you can

84
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:04,949
think of there as being these basis

85
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:07,290
vectors for screen space which is that

86
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,449
the X vector and the Y vector that you

87
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:14,098
would say where your base vectors are

88
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:19,018
essentially 0 1 and 1 0 in this case

89
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:22,469
right where one pixel you know is is one

90
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:25,259
unit right so this is like a pixel and

91
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:28,769
we keep going out in pixels right and

92
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:31,500
the you know screen itself is as wide as

93
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,969
there are pixels on it and the origin

94
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,019
right the place where a coordinate

95
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:40,560
system starts the origin is at that 0 0

96
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,329
pixel the upper left corner right 0 0 is

97
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,859
always the the origin of any coordinate

98
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,329
system I should say obviously the 0

99
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:46,409
chord is always the origin but where it

100
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:50,189
is it happens to be the upper-left

101
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:52,168
corner right and so right here we have

102
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:54,299
our two basis vectors right our basis

103
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:56,730
vector Y and our base effects X and then

104
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,680
we have an origin which is that point

105
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:00,509
right there and together we can say that

106
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,209
this sort of forms right a coordinate

107
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:06,598
system it's a way that we can say where

108
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,250
stuff is and we can pick any pixel on

109
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,979
the screen right we could pick any pixel

110
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,539
on the screen by saying what the x and y

111
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,768
coordinates were we can even pick things

112
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,298
that are off the screen by using

113
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,098
negative X or Y coordinates or ones that

114
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,739
are too large and we can even pick

115
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:22,978
fractional ones I could pick the center

116
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,538
of this pixel potentially depending on

117
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:25,709
how I wanted to find like I could define

118
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:27,748
the origin being at the center of the

119
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,430
pixel I could say that it was up at the

120
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:31,289
you know I have a number of options for

121
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,870
that but let's say it's in the corner of

122
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:35,908
the actual pixel that upper left-hand

123
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,069
corner pixel this right here could be

124
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:40,918
0.5 point 5 so I could talk about that

125
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,569
center of the pixel as well similarly I

126
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,348
could define a different coordinate

127
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:48,718
system if I wanted to for my world for

128
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:50,639
I'm sorry for my pixels where the origin

129
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:53,550
was actually in in a slightly different

130
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,749
place right if I imagine the pixels that

131
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,728
are on the screen and these are the

132
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:59,580
actual let's say LCD pixels that we're

133
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:01,288
talking about here right I could make my

134
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,769
coordinate system origin be right there

135
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:06,658
right I could say that the center of a

136
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:09,870
pixel essentially is you know

137
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:12,959
conceptually speaking was 0 0 and then

138
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,389
like each Center of each pixel is that

139
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,459
you know this is 0 1 this is 1 0 and so

140
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,098
on right and here's that x-axis that

141
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:21,899
y-axis right and I can do all sorts of

142
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:23,550
things I could also say that I wanted Y

143
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:25,109
to go up right I could say that that's

144
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,728
what the coordinate system look like so

145
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,288
if I wanted to I could have a different

146
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:29,639
notion of it where we sort of had

147
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:32,668
something that looked kind of like this

148
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:35,098
you know where this is the the bottom

149
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:38,038
left corner of the screen right I could

150
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:39,870
do that and all that so there's very

151
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,180
many ways I can define coordinate

152
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,759
systems and the only important thing is

153
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,379
that we have some notion of those three

154
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,879
things we have to have the origin we

155
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,259
need to know where that is right and

156
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,819
that's a point right that's basically

157
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,960
saying where that is somewhere in space

158
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:57,060
and it's the point 0 0 where will if if

159
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,299
someone specifies the coordinates 0 0

160
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,968
where will that be and then we need the

161
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,370
basis right we need the X basis and we

162
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:07,800
need the Y basis vector right and that

163
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,949
basically tells us what you know what is

164
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,810
going on that's the that's you know 1 0

165
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:17,310
this is the vector 1 0 and this is the

166
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,709
vector 0 1 where do they point right and

167
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,209
so it's hard to think about this

168
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:23,878
sometimes a little confusing if you're

169
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:26,848
not used to it because these are all

170
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:30,180
sort of implicit right your if you if I

171
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:33,658
ask you where is the origin well it's at

172
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,668
0 0 that answer is always trip the

173
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:37,079
origin of a course it is always 0 0 so

174
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:40,539
what does it mean to say we have an

175
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,519
origin right and the answer is that that

176
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,040
origin is always defined in some other

177
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,529
space right and that space may be actual

178
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,800
they may be physical in the real world

179
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:53,229
like in our case the origin of the

180
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,430
screen is the actual origin like of the

181
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,710
monitor that's what we're talking about

182
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,019
when we say where it is we're talking

183
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:01,629
about where the actual pixel is you know

184
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:03,370
in in real world space that's what we're

185
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,050
trying to draw to but there may be

186
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,850
fictional spaces as well like the world

187
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,689
space of the game is a purely fictional

188
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:13,330
space we have created to contain our

189
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:15,100
fictional world where is that origin who

190
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,259
knows all we know is that it is the

191
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,180
origin of our world and it has no real

192
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:25,060
definition of where it is right it's

193
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:26,500
purely virtual and so sometimes it can

194
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,600
be very confusing to talk about these

195
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,730
because that stuff is all very implicit

196
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,710
what's the X basis vector well it's it's

197
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,509
the vector that defines what 1 0 is but

198
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:35,739
it you know what direction does it point

199
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:37,899
in I don't even know how to define it

200
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,180
again in the real world

201
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:42,429
the screens X basis vector for purposes

202
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,379
of our discussion is what is the the you

203
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:48,220
know the line going across the top of my

204
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:49,209
monitor right so the reason that you

205
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,250
want to start thinking about these

206
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:53,669
though is because that's not always the

207
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,600
case once we start to get into

208
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,770
transforms and doing things which is

209
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,870
what we're trying to do now with our

210
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:01,870
graphics we will start to describe

211
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,449
origins and basis vectors in terms of

212
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,329
other origins and basis vectors because

213
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:10,209
once you have one of these you can

214
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:12,609
describe other ones in terms of it and

215
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:15,609
do computations on it right so for

216
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,160
example if I was to define a world

217
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,319
coordinate system we're okay we know

218
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,450
there's a zero zero we know there's a 1

219
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,279
zero vector that's the X vector we know

220
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,519
this is zero one vector it's a Y vector

221
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:30,609
right we've got the basis we've got the

222
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,799
origin right once I have one of those

223
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,050
and I just say that it means something

224
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,129
like the world space I'm just purely

225
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,918
defining a fictional space

226
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:40,870
well once I define that fictional space

227
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,490
in my head and say that's what you know

228
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:46,419
I have some notion of what it is just

229
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:49,029
mentally right then anything I choose to

230
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:51,870
define that's inside that space can be

231
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:53,829
given an actual specific meaning

232
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,840
numerically in turn

233
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,730
of that fictitious space that I've

234
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,259
created essentially right because again

235
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,360
we're creating a fictional world it

236
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:03,340
doesn't have meaning it's just it's a

237
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,649
fictional world of handmade hero where

238
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:09,129
is the origin I don't know right it's in

239
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:10,629
handmade hero land somewhere but once I

240
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:12,490
have this I can start to talk about

241
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:14,500
these things right let's say that's you

242
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,470
know that's the zero one that's the the

243
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,000
zero one there right so if I want to

244
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,769
make another coordinate system I could

245
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
make another coordinate system right I

246
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:25,029
can make another coordinate system here

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,940
if I want to and I can say that this is

248
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:29,829
what it looks like it has an origin but

249
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,460
that origin can now be described in

250
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:35,830
terms of this other origin this other x

251
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,980
axis and this other Y axis right so I

252
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:42,040
can say definitively that if you wanted

253
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,800
to get to this new origin you would go a

254
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,480
certain distance along the x axis from

255
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,509
the origin of the world coordinate

256
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,789
system you would then go up right so I

257
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:53,620
go over you would then go up the y axis

258
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:56,949
a certain distance and you would now be

259
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:01,179
at the origin of this other coordinate

260
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:04,540
system right similarly once I was there

261
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:07,120
I could then define points in terms of

262
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:10,449
that new origin and I can define the

263
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,320
axes in terms of the existing axes right

264
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:16,420
so what would I do to define you know to

265
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,250
define these axes here right well I just

266
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:20,979
have to think about them in terms of

267
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,169
these existing axes in the other basis

268
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,350
right here's that x axis here's that Y

269
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:28,990
axis well what is the definition of my

270
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,970
new Y axis this is my new fancy Y axis

271
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,460
I'm defining well same thing I just

272
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,950
measure it in the other coordinate space

273
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:39,009
right I just say well I know I could

274
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:41,320
define it in terms of this X this x axis

275
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,330
and this Y axis and so all I have to do

276
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,770
is just create the definition for that

277
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,960
and I don't know what that definition

278
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,279
actually is I guess you know we're

279
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,900
assuming that we want it to be unit

280
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,209
length so it kind of looks like it's

281
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:55,929
roughly at a 45 degree angle you know so

282
00:10:52,210 --> 00:11:00,879
it's it's gonna be something like you

283
00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:02,289
know 1 1 over the length of of 1 1 right

284
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,750
it's gonna be it's gonna be something

285
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:05,058
like that so let's let's actually I can

286
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,778
action

287
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:11,838
tell you what it probably would be right

288
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:15,078
so 1 plus 1 square rooted where's

289
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:21,109
where's the square root thing square

290
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:22,178
root there it is yeah what what just

291
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:25,639
happened

292
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:27,048
1.4 okay that is this is I feel like I

293
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,168
did it there it is square root of 2

294
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:33,858
that's what I wanted 1.4 so now I just

295
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:35,359
want one over that 0.707

296
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,769
okay so that's what I did you think I'd

297
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:39,679
remember that number by now so let's say

298
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:42,859
0.7 so this is something like Oh point

299
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:44,688
seven point seven right that would be my

300
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:49,069
new y-axis so that is like the

301
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:53,058
definition of the y-axis in this other

302
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:57,228
coordinate system right now you may ask

303
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:58,519
yourself why do I care about this at all

304
00:11:57,229 --> 00:12:01,038
why are you even bothering to tell me

305
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,188
this well this is what we want to do to

306
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:08,178
start supporting rotation right and

307
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:10,938
scaling and I'll explain to you why we

308
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:14,088
care about these when it comes to

309
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:18,048
rotation and scaling so let's suppose I

310
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:20,119
want to define a shape right so I define

311
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:23,208
some axis system that is purely

312
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:25,849
imaginary like I was saying right and I

313
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:28,488
start defining some shape in there and I

314
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:31,099
define my little shape it's a triangle

315
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:32,959
let's say right and I know what the

316
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:35,028
coordinates are of this triangle in my

317
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,278
imaginary coordinate system because like

318
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:38,808
I said I defined it so I can say

319
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,399
whatever it is here's let's say this is

320
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:41,988
one unit along that axis is one unit

321
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,298
along here so I know where each of these

322
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:46,548
things is and I've now got a definition

323
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:49,759
for this shape right I could literally

324
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:50,989
encode I could encode this shape by

325
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,668
saying where each of these are here's

326
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:54,199
point zero is point 1 here's point 2

327
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:57,769
right I guess I'll use letters for them

328
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:59,628
let's say a b c right i can define these

329
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,818
where they are i can say what their

330
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:03,619
coordinates are and now anytime I want I

331
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:05,448
can sort of say well in this imaginary

332
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:10,668
coordinate system here's where they are

333
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:13,608
right well if I think about these

334
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:18,259
coordinates as a way of interpreting

335
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:20,119
them as though as a way of moving along

336
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:23,149
the coordinate system that I defined

337
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:25,999
here right it has an origin all right

338
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:33,438
and it has an x and y axis and I have a

339
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:36,139
X right a y bx b y CX CY these are the

340
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:39,379
coordinates of those points in my system

341
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:41,239
right I can always think of that

342
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,319
construction that I drew before I drew

343
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:45,499
that construction before where I'm

344
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:48,978
saying move along X for however big your

345
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:50,600
x coordinate is move along Y by however

346
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:52,339
long your Y is you know start at the

347
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,668
origin and do those two things you will

348
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:58,939
get to the point right well that

349
00:13:55,668 --> 00:14:01,009
construction allows us to do any kind of

350
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:04,188
rotation and scaling of this shape that

351
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:08,298
we want to do because all we have to do

352
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:10,639
is rotate and scale the bases and by

353
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:13,068
doing that rotation and scaling we will

354
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,428
then be able to read off how our points

355
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:18,469
go right let's say that we wanted to do

356
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:23,238
a rotation of this right

357
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:25,369
so I rotate the bases like so right

358
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:28,579
there's a why there's an X there's my

359
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:31,278
origin and now I want to do the exact

360
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:34,188
same stuff the AXA y you know B X V Y

361
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:37,129
well I do the same thing I go a certain

362
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:39,618
distance along therefore ax I do a

363
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:41,089
certain distance up for a Y and that's

364
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:43,730
my new point right start at the origin

365
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:47,179
go like this I do the same thing here

366
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,709
for for that well for B I guess I go

367
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,899
this way there's my B I go all the way

368
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:53,088
out there go up for my C I go to the

369
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:56,168
middle and go up a long ways right and

370
00:14:53,089 --> 00:15:01,279
so if I reconstruct those exact motions

371
00:14:56,168 --> 00:15:03,139
right I produce the shape you see that

372
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,999
it's the exact same shape

373
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:08,288
well modulo my allows our drawing it's

374
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:11,359
the exact same shape constructed rotated

375
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:13,639
what would happen if I scaled it right

376
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,439
what would happen if I scaled it well

377
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,499
let's say I scaled the y axis to be

378
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:22,158
really long so instead of here where the

379
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:24,109
length of the y axis was 1 I am going to

380
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:27,048
take the length of the y axis to be 2

381
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:27,819
twice as large right but the x axis will

382
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:31,399
stay the same

383
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:32,149
well now I get exactly the same results

384
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,850
along X

385
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:37,789
right so my shape looks exactly the same

386
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,820
when when viewed on that but when I go

387
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:43,039
to up to sort of go up the y-axis I go

388
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,320
much longer and so my shape elongates

389
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:51,139
dramatically right see what I'm saying

390
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,960
so by doing that by changing the basis

391
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:57,699
we can change any shape encoded in those

392
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:01,220
faces into the equivalent shape bent

393
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,910
warped done whatever we want to that we

394
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,350
did to the bases right so what does that

395
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:08,509
look like in code right

396
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,940
well this operation we know how to do in

397
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,740
code right what's the operation in code

398
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,410
of starting somewhere moving along one

399
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,389
axis and moving along another right well

400
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:20,929
it's really trivial we just take the

401
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:22,460
origin right whatever the origin is and

402
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,169
I'll just maybe I should write that with

403
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,670
something else I don't know well I'll

404
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:27,439
just write it origin we start at the

405
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:29,599
origin right if we're trying to get to a

406
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,370
new point right so let's say we have one

407
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,159
of these points here in fact I'll use

408
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,399
since we're using letters before if I

409
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:41,179
want the new a the new a prime right I

410
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:44,899
just start at the origin right I take a

411
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:48,309
X and I move along that x axis I take a

412
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:52,278
Y and I move along the y axis right and

413
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:54,919
there's and I'm at my location right so

414
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:57,409
I have two coordinates a X a Y that

415
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:01,338
encode the point and all I need to know

416
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:03,169
is where is the origin where is the X

417
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:05,209
and y at what are the directions that

418
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,678
X&amp;Y point in and how long they are

419
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:10,220
because this is baked in right this has

420
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:13,069
a length it's a vector right and I can

421
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:16,519
produce the new point very very simple

422
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:18,649
and so what we find is just with this

423
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:21,230
you know very simple equation right

424
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,480
which is like the offset plus the

425
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,000
coordinate times the x axis the

426
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,799
coordinate times the y axis we can do

427
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,390
any kind of transform that we want that

428
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,250
looks like you know a rotation in a

429
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,330
scale of some kind and the scale doesn't

430
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,839
have a uniform it can be non-uniform

431
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:34,839
right

432
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:42,619
that in its most basic form is a way to

433
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,788
transform points it's a way to do any

434
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:46,788
kind of rotation that's going that we

435
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:48,648
want to do on points so if we just want

436
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:51,200
to move points around this is all we

437
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:53,359
really need to know right and this is

438
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,730
where defining those bases comes in so

439
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:59,388
you can imagine if we wanted to define a

440
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,579
basis write explicitly in code it's

441
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:09,819
something that just looks like you know

442
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:12,288
in origin write an x-axis and a y-axis

443
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:14,960
now again what are these defined in

444
00:18:12,288 --> 00:18:17,269
terms of it doesn't matter right the

445
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,808
basis is just something that describes a

446
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:22,249
space in terms of another space so

447
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:24,048
depending on how you decided to use it

448
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:27,769
in the code it's whatever

449
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:31,608
this definition happens to be if I took

450
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:34,099
world space and wanted to define you

451
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:35,928
know some some little like you know I

452
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:38,388
don't know like a house I wanted some

453
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:39,889
house space defined like the space that

454
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:41,269
was you know a house that was rotated

455
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:44,839
and scaled in the world somewhere right

456
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:47,329
well I would just define this basis to

457
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,839
be the origin of this house space in the

458
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:50,388
world

459
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,638
so in world coordinates the x axis would

460
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:55,099
be whatever the house is x axis was

461
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:56,808
defined in the world and the y axis

462
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:58,579
would be whatever the wax just was

463
00:18:56,808 --> 00:19:00,408
defined in the world right so if the

464
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:02,689
world space looked like this you know

465
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:05,119
and the house is this tiny thing out

466
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,889
here or whatever then that's what I

467
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:08,868
would encode I didn't code that as the

468
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:12,858
origin I'd encode those as the x and y

469
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:15,199
axes right and I'd be done and then any

470
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:17,778
point that was defined in this house

471
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,629
space will automatically be at the

472
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:23,509
correct placement rotation and scaling

473
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:27,288
that I want it to be just by performing

474
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:28,759
this transform on it right and so we've

475
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:30,138
already done a little bit of this right

476
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:31,669
we've definitely done the displacement

477
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:34,069
all we haven't really done is the

478
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:36,049
scaling and rotating of those things so

479
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:37,548
we've already been doing this part right

480
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:39,769
we've already been offsetting things all

481
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:41,569
the time the only thing we didn't do was

482
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:43,548
actually start taking into account the

483
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:47,559
axes which would have allowed us to do

484
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:50,029
that rotation and scaling right

485
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:52,609
so this is what we'd like to introduce

486
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:54,289
into our renderer now even though we

487
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:57,559
don't really have much of a way to draw

488
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:59,389
it yet what we can do for example is we

489
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,679
could draw some points that would

490
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,970
basically give us took the origin

491
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,710
because we could draw like a little

492
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,180
tripod right because we have the ability

493
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,759
to draw a rectangle we could do

494
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,730
something where we drew like this sort

495
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,470
of a thing you know you know the X point

496
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,870
the Y point and the origin point we

497
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,049
could we could sort of draw that right

498
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:20,199
those those things so we could see that

499
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:23,119
we were you know computing it correctly

500
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,250
so you know what how do we actually

501
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,619
define those right how do we actually

502
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,910
define the X and the y-axis origins easy

503
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:30,079
it's just a point we all know how to

504
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,360
move points around we've done that a

505
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,669
bunch right but how do we find these two

506
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,379
well here we come back to our unit

507
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,259
circle right and that's a really easy

508
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:42,710
way for us to be able to do that if we

509
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:46,220
have our unit circle and we sort of draw

510
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:48,259
in the world wow that's wow that was a

511
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,600
really bad circle let's be try to do a

512
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:52,730
slightly better circle I don't know if I

513
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,889
can drawing a circle on one of these

514
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:59,180
it's a little tricky I'm gonna be honest

515
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:02,900
with you okay forget it the circle this

516
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:06,320
oh my oh oh my god it's awful oh it's

517
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:13,660
just the worst oh it's like lumpy all

518
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:20,659
right well anyway point being pretend

519
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:22,610
this is the unit circle and when I say

520
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:30,290
unit circle I just mean a circle whose

521
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:34,099
radius is 1 right 1 unit sorry if I have

522
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:38,720
a unit circle and I want to take the

523
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:42,559
cosine right and the sine of that right

524
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,329
two values cosine sine as my angle

525
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,579
changes right so the angle kind of

526
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:49,009
sweeps around like this right as the

527
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:52,269
angle changes essentially what I will

528
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:56,660
get is the cosine value is the

529
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:58,549
x-coordinate of the point that would you

530
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,980
know that I would trace on the circle if

531
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:03,200
I went out one unit

532
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,750
along that angle whatever that angle is

533
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,230
the cosine is the x-coordinate and the

534
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:12,769
sine is the y-coordinate right so

535
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:16,509
basically this here is cosine theta and

536
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:22,789
this here is sine theta right

537
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:24,829
does that make some sense hopefully

538
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:27,259
you've all had this in your grade school

539
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:30,769
geometry class or trigonometry class all

540
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:33,140
right right make some sense so what that

541
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:36,259
would mean is well if I was to plug in

542
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,259
zero for the angle right so if my angle

543
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:41,269
was to equal zero well that would just

544
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:43,609
be this point right here and what is

545
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:45,500
that point if this length is one right

546
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:48,019
that means the cosine theta was one the

547
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,349
sine theta is zero right so at theta

548
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:55,250
equals zero that would give me a point

549
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:58,279
of 1 comma zero right that gives me the

550
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:01,970
x axis that's what that is right one

551
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:05,990
zero similarly if I was to plug in you

552
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:08,750
know 90 up here 90 degrees well my

553
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:13,160
cosine has now become zero right so if

554
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:17,930
my theta is 90 degrees then my cosine is

555
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:21,650
now zero and my sine is 1 right and hey

556
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:24,049
guess what that's the y-axis so if just

557
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,840
without knowing anything else if we

558
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:30,319
wanted to create a rotated coordinate

559
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:34,669
system right you can imagine using this

560
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:38,179
just directly my x axis is just cosine

561
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,650
theta sine theta because if it was zero

562
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,090
it'll give me the x axis and if it's

563
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,550
anything above zero

564
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:45,049
it'll just slowly rotate up the circle

565
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:46,519
just like what I want right it'll just

566
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:49,909
keep rotating rotating rotating around

567
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:52,670
right and to bridge the y axis all I

568
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,560
would have to do is add 90 to it because

569
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,880
90 degrees off the x axis is gonna be

570
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,909
the y axis and that's just gonna slowly

571
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,590
rotate around this way too right so you

572
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:07,810
know cosine of this plus 90 sine of

573
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:10,519
theta plus 90 right that's the y axis so

574
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:12,529
pretty trivial to generate rotated

575
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:14,329
things all you have to do is just use

576
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:14,769
the cosine and sine to pluck them off

577
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,559
the unit

578
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:20,079
Circle for you furthermore if I want to

579
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,549
scale either of these all I have to do

580
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,769
is just multiply it by some number

581
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:26,019
that's my scale write whatever I want my

582
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,759
scale to be after these come out I can

583
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:30,400
just multiply by scale on the outside

584
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,140
right scale times either of these if I

585
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,940
multiply them both by the same scale I

586
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,650
get uniform scaling if I multiply one by

587
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,240
one scale one by the other I get

588
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:40,240
non-uniform scaling like I squash it

589
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,279
right or whatever so really really

590
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,559
trivial now we can take this a step

591
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,619
further and realize that actually it cuz

592
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:51,069
we're in 2d our situation for y-axis is

593
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:52,959
really pretty basic right because if you

594
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:55,210
look at what actually happens here let's

595
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,529
say we've got that theta well check out

596
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:02,559
what happens when I draw on my right

597
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:04,359
angle here right oops that's no good so

598
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,619
what I was saying is well you know

599
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:10,929
really if you if you wanted to get this

600
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:13,119
you just do theta plus 90 and hey

601
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,410
there's that theta plus 90 so that gives

602
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,199
you that point and that's what I was

603
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:19,480
saying down here that's all good right

604
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,360
but if you take a look at what this

605
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:25,569
vector actually is this is really just

606
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:30,399
the same vector that we just produced

607
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:32,589
only starting with the y axis instead of

608
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,540
the x axis right imagine taking this

609
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:37,089
whole diagram and just rotating the

610
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:39,399
diagram 90 degrees this way right this

611
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:42,879
is exactly this is theta right here it's

612
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:45,759
the same angle right so it seems kind of

613
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,650
stupid to recompute exactly the same

614
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,859
vector effectively just to get it

615
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:53,500
rotated 90 degrees and so what you can

616
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:55,689
see by you know looking at that kind of

617
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,099
triangle relation right you can kind of

618
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,680
see there like take a look at how this

619
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:04,419
looks right this here these are the same

620
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:06,610
so this right is that right there if you

621
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,920
look at what happens here you can even

622
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:10,539
just reading off the diagram realize

623
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,580
what a smarter algorithm is for

624
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:15,549
producing that coordinate system right

625
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:17,349
if this length is going to be the same

626
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:19,899
as this length because they're the exact

627
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:22,449
same triangle right and this length is

628
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:26,890
going to be the same as this length then

629
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:28,930
we already know the length of of

630
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:32,200
these two because we've already computed

631
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:35,380
them up here right we've already done it

632
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,150
we know that sine theta right is going

633
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,520
to be this length up here right sine

634
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,990
theta sine theta I should use the

635
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:45,220
standard notation and actually double

636
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:47,529
notch those right so if this is sine

637
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,630
theta and this is sine theta then really

638
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:51,220
all I'm talking about is using the X you

639
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,630
know which coordinate goes into it was

640
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,789
going into the y coordinate here it's

641
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,470
going the x coordinate now right because

642
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:59,259
of that 90-degree rotation right

643
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,930
so basically sine theta is my x

644
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:06,009
coordinate for the y axis right and then

645
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:07,630
the same thing happens for the x axis

646
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:10,329
becomes the y axis over here right

647
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:13,300
this was the x axis before it's now on

648
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:14,980
the y axis right so what I want to do is

649
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:17,529
take that cosine and I want to put it in

650
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,450
here right and so you can see

651
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:21,970
essentially to create the y axis all we

652
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:24,340
have to do is rearrange just flip which

653
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:27,180
two we're doing there's one more little

654
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:29,319
rub to it though right they're going

655
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,960
potentially the wrong direction right

656
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:34,689
because cosine theta was positive going

657
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,890
out this way right and it's positive

658
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,650
going up here

659
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,270
so the cosine theta term will give us

660
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,980
the correct answer for the length of

661
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:43,059
this right as we come you know it's we

662
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,849
want it to be positive it's positive

663
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:48,099
here that's all good right so this looks

664
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:51,490
correct right that looks good

665
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:54,369
but sine theta was positive here it's

666
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:56,470
not positive here right do you see where

667
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:58,659
this point is this point is negative x

668
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:01,839
right that's positive x metrics and this

669
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,790
is negative x so we have to negate that

670
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,879
one to put this point in the right place

671
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:09,220
as it goes around right so we end up

672
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,320
with the y axis is actually just the

673
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,029
same computation as the x axis we can

674
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:20,409
just flip the terms and negate one of

675
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:22,930
them that's it right really simple now

676
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:26,330
here's the thing

677
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:28,430
you can also directly plug and chug this

678
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:30,799
I never remember them I always have to

679
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:33,710
look them up but if you plug in your

680
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,289
trig identities if you remember these

681
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,840
from grade school your trig identities

682
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:41,420
should tell you that cosine of theta

683
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:44,689
plus 90 is negative sign and that sine

684
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,460
theta plus 90 is cosine theta right that

685
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,170
those are actually trig identities you

686
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,309
probably would have learned and if you

687
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,660
happen to remember them you wouldn't

688
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:53,480
have even had to look at the diagram you

689
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:55,970
could just say up algebraically I could

690
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,730
just substitute in I know that becomes

691
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:02,230
this and I know that becomes this right

692
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:04,849
so that's another way to attack it last

693
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:09,009
piece of interest here because we're in

694
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:11,240
2d I want to talk about one more thing

695
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:13,970
so there's the concept of the perp

696
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,420
operator right and no that does not mean

697
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:20,180
perpetrator the perpendicular operator

698
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,620
is the operator which takes a 2d vector

699
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:25,009
and produces a vector that's

700
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:27,589
perpendicular to it right what we have

701
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:31,670
essentially done here is done the perp

702
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:33,919
operator to the x axis because the perp

703
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:39,230
operator is just an operator that says

704
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:43,279
okay if I have some X Y right I am just

705
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:47,000
going to output the y coordinate negated

706
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,980
and the x coordinate the same but

707
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,049
flipped order right the exact same thing

708
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:54,380
we did here right swap the components

709
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:56,450
negate the X right and what this does is

710
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,510
this actually creates the perpendicular

711
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,740
for any vector in the space because no

712
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:05,059
matter what vector

713
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:07,069
I draw right I can always say oh I know

714
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:11,539
that it has a why I know that it has an

715
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:18,319
X let me just interpret it's X off the

716
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:21,759
the the let me just interpret sorry why

717
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,899
am i I got so far today without doing it

718
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,279
remember yesterday I was drawing my X's

719
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,100
and Y's in the in different paces all

720
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,639
the time I just did it again it has an x

721
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:34,309
and a y there we go I can interpret its

722
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,778
y coordinate in the negative x-direction

723
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:37,878
right

724
00:30:35,778 --> 00:30:40,009
I can interpret its x-coordinate in the

725
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:44,718
y-direction right this way

726
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:47,989
and produce a 90 degree angled vector

727
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:49,429
that's the same length as the previous

728
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:51,288
vector right the lengths are the same

729
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:53,298
but that's pointing in exactly the

730
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:55,729
perpendicular direction and this is very

731
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:57,739
handy right that allows us to quickly

732
00:30:55,729 --> 00:31:00,019
generate perpendicular vectors to any

733
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:03,139
vector that we have in the plane and it

734
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:04,489
just works right it's super nice and so

735
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:06,138
that's what we actually did there but

736
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:08,028
you could see how we kind of constructed

737
00:31:06,138 --> 00:31:09,618
it and you can also see how it works

738
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:12,259
over the signs of cosine so that means

739
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:14,118
that essentially all we have to do when

740
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:17,239
we want to create a rotated basis right

741
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:20,509
if we want to create a rotation a

742
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:21,469
rotated basis of theta right it is very

743
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:25,298
straightforward

744
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:29,929
all we have to do is our x axis becomes

745
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:34,878
cosine theta sine theta and our Y axis

746
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:37,669
is just the perp of the x axis right

747
00:31:34,878 --> 00:31:41,269
that's it we already know this is length

748
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:46,129
one because well cosine squared theta

749
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:48,919
plus sine squared theta right Square

750
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:52,939
rooted equals one so we know that that's

751
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:53,629
true that's sort of a separate thing so

752
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,739
we don't have to worry about their

753
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:56,478
lengths we know their likes will already

754
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:58,190
be one and that is a trivial way to

755
00:31:56,479 --> 00:32:00,348
produce a rotated basis if we want to

756
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:02,899
scale that basis we just multiply our

757
00:32:00,348 --> 00:32:08,838
axes by whatever we wanted to multiply

758
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:11,928
them by right all good all right let's

759
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:15,710
see where we're at five forty five so we

760
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:18,259
got time to actually just do this now

761
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:21,369
that we've sort of basically done the

762
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:24,649
the lesson that's know don't open that

763
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:29,648
thing the wrong command prompt all right

764
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:29,648
there we go so let's go into the code

765
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:39,829
let's suppose that we want to create one

766
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:41,750
of these little rotating doodads here

767
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:42,409
right and we want to see it work

768
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,650
properly

769
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:47,600
all we have to do let's introduce just a

770
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,400
totally synthetic render function that

771
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:54,379
literally will have no use in our game

772
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:56,450
but just something maybe a club tripod I

773
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,850
don't know it's not really a 5 - yes -

774
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,370
so let's see axis marker I don't know

775
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:02,779
coordinate system something I don't know

776
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:04,669
I'm not sure what to call it I have no

777
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:06,559
idea but let's do exactly what we just

778
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:08,060
said we're gonna have an origin we're

779
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,159
gonna have an x-axis and we're gonna

780
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:12,409
have a y-axis right and we just want to

781
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,110
draw them okay that's all we want to do

782
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,790
we just want to draw them so if I wanted

783
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:18,769
to do that right I need to just add a

784
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:23,779
little thing here to you know add in

785
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:25,789
coordinate system like so and then I can

786
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:28,940
add something to my render group that

787
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:32,269
will allow me to push one of those onto

788
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:35,840
you know onto my um my render stack

789
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:37,910
right so here we go I'm gonna push one

790
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,490
of these coordinate systems render entry

791
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:45,920
coordinate system and assuming that it

792
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:50,859
came back okay so I can assign its

793
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:54,980
origin to something right its x-axis

794
00:33:50,859 --> 00:34:00,399
something Y access to something Y axis x

795
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:03,349
axis oops that's not good x-axis and v3

796
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:06,590
x axis you know what might as well stick

797
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:07,669
a color in there why not right that way

798
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:08,719
we can have a couple of different ones

799
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:14,380
on the screen and know which one we're

800
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:15,589
looking at again so origin x axis y axis

801
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,470
okay

802
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,780
should work fine now hopefully if we run

803
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:22,639
this well actually I guess we've gotta

804
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,019
make one first we should get an

805
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,460
assertion because we haven't handled

806
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:28,070
putting anything to handle drawing it

807
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,139
but let's go ahead and actually put one

808
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:32,899
in there first I'm gonna in our game

809
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:34,279
state structure right I'm gonna add just

810
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:36,469
for the time being a little thing that

811
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,080
we can play with which is sort of our

812
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:41,779
you know our angle or whatever and maybe

813
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:43,610
I'll put in our scale as well you know

814
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,820
what I could do I could just do time

815
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,860
let's do that for fun profit all right

816
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,500
so in here down at the very end before

817
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:54,170
we before we render everything I'm gonna

818
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,199
say that our game state time is going to

819
00:34:54,170 --> 00:35:00,470
be equal to our it's going to increment

820
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,389
by our D DT for frame right so we can do

821
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:04,789
stuff at that for now I won't actually

822
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:06,619
do anything with it I'll just say that

823
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:08,329
we've got an origin oh you know what I

824
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:11,089
just forgot to I don't know why I've got

825
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:13,069
this we're not actually in 3d right now

826
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:17,150
we're in 2d here we go

827
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:19,820
it's not gonna be able to draw a

828
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:23,030
three-dimensional stuff yet that's

829
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:28,059
that's a bit of a problem alright so yes

830
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:32,840
if I have my origin right I have my

831
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:36,920
x-axis and I am just hung up on on three

832
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:42,670
dimensions today and there we go and

833
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:49,760
y-axis P - yeah and so if I now do that

834
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:54,710
coordinate system system call and I push

835
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,870
my origin x-axis y-axis and whatever the

836
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:03,530
color happens to be let's go ahead and

837
00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:05,809
make a nice yellow there that should set

838
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,880
us up for success now it should again

839
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:09,139
hopefully our renderer will stop on this

840
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,519
and say hey wait a minute I don't know

841
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:12,829
how to draw that that's the hope and

842
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,590
since we've never tested that let's

843
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:22,509
let's actually verify that that's true

844
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:22,510
one would hope what what is happening

845
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:28,150
what what is what has happened people

846
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:37,830
why is our code why is our code hosed

847
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:41,039
what have we done we are in the middle

848
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:42,449
of rendering groups of what what is

849
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:47,880
happen I have no idea what's happening

850
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:50,129
right now I'm gonna set thing to find

851
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,320
out we've totally broken it so that's

852
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:56,670
good you know sometimes you have to

853
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:04,740
break everything what did I did I do odd

854
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:05,880
there there's the clear we should get to

855
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:10,349
when we don't know and then we should

856
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:12,450
hit our invalid default case now but

857
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:18,239
apparently not I guess are invalid

858
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:22,500
default case is not working which is a

859
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:26,119
bit odd to say the least let me see what

860
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:30,150
our invalid default case says and made

861
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:38,809
dot H all right probably a platformer

862
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:38,809
huh valid default case thought code path

863
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:45,840
that kind of looks right should not have

864
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:51,710
a semicolon after it but that's not

865
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:56,010
really an issue yeah that should stop us

866
00:37:51,710 --> 00:38:01,139
hmm well I can't say I know why that's

867
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:03,420
happening but what I would like to do to

868
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:05,489
debug that is let it hit that guy sooner

869
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,220
let's put the coordinate system so that

870
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:11,279
it happens immediately upon startup that

871
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:13,349
way we will see what happens when we

872
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,580
immediately step into it if that makes

873
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:16,980
sense so I don't have to kind of loop

874
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:22,369
through everything else so it should why

875
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:24,990
does it not hit it's clear so clear

876
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:27,750
should not have have been the first

877
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:30,269
thing in the in the render state am i

878
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:32,489
right like we should have had a thing

879
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:35,219
where it was where it was pushing the

880
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:36,449
coordinate system so I'm gonna go ahead

881
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:39,869
and take a look at that buffer and see

882
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:42,089
why that's not happening let's go into

883
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:42,719
handmade render group just make sure

884
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,220
because

885
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,759
pushing it render entry coordinate

886
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:49,919
system right so the type of that should

887
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,160
not be clear it should be coordinate

888
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,829
system so the first thing in on our on

889
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:57,389
our stack should be one of these

890
00:38:55,829 --> 00:39:02,159
coordinate systems so let's see why it's

891
00:38:57,389 --> 00:39:05,509
not alright come in here let's take a

892
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,769
look at our render group render group

893
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,980
the render groups got the push buffer

894
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:13,349
base address right in the the first

895
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,539
thing in it is a 0 that doesn't make any

896
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:23,869
sense to me oh because we're gonna feel

897
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:26,909
ground chunk alright forgot about that

898
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:28,619
so yeah I guess we have to actually run

899
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:33,750
into here let's try that one more time

900
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:37,500
alright now I can see what it is so how

901
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:39,719
is our push buffer base still showing

902
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,440
that it's that the first thing in it is

903
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:45,750
it clear someone explain that to me

904
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,460
somebody explain that to me

905
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,829
alright well I guess we'll just have to

906
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,250
see where our push isn't working

907
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:54,900
probably a bug that I made so here we go

908
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:59,789
we'll make the render group there we go

909
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:03,358
and look at the push buffer base step in

910
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:04,500
to coordinate system right this is gonna

911
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,319
make it

912
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,900
Oh although don't actually need this

913
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:15,599
quite step into that but thank you

914
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:21,740
alright why is this not why am I not

915
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,740
able to step into this coordinate system

916
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:30,240
all right so it thinks it pushed a

917
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:33,839
render element on there right it

918
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:37,319
certainly appears to believe that it did

919
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:39,570
that and the push buffer base has

920
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,970
actually done exactly what it should

921
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:45,980
have done which is set it to three

922
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:51,959
it sets the ah yeah there we go

923
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:54,389
asleep at the switch oh it's been a long

924
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,829
day people it has been a long day

925
00:40:54,389 --> 00:41:01,440
I forgot to put my little header in here

926
00:40:55,829 --> 00:41:02,759
there we go so that's the problem yeah

927
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,050
at all these guys have to have a header

928
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,970
for now because we don't really have

929
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,500
anything in particular I should probably

930
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:09,869
get rid of that because that's not

931
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,690
actually necessary and it's just prone

932
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:14,359
to error as you just saw me make when

933
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:17,490
you forget about what you're doing

934
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:21,840
because really we don't need this header

935
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:25,589
value to be there I'm just gonna say go

936
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:27,840
ahead and remove that so I don't make

937
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:29,340
that mistake again remove the header

938
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,860
because we don't actually need the

939
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,329
header to be listed in these guys that

940
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:36,000
was just kind of a short-term thing

941
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:36,989
that's just kind of sloppy I don't want

942
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,300
to remove it right now because I'd like

943
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:42,539
to finish what we were doing but suffice

944
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,570
to say yeah totally not necessary and I

945
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:48,360
would prefer to not have that be a

946
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:50,580
potential source of books it's just it's

947
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,530
just there's no need for it basically

948
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:54,750
I'll split that way so yeah we'll fix

949
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:57,570
that tomorrow but because I'd rather not

950
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:59,010
go through it right now so let's go

951
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,930
ahead and put our coordinate system back

952
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:04,770
in there so now hopefully we will get a

953
00:42:00,929 --> 00:42:06,509
thing that stops us and says that that

954
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:11,009
it doesn't recognize the thing that it

955
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:13,260
was doing now why of course there we go

956
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,240
it's because we haven't put in a case

957
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:17,250
for our coordinate system so all we

958
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:20,669
should have to do now is put in a case

959
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:23,250
for our coordinate system and yeah and

960
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:26,789
then we should see it show up so in here

961
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:29,940
I'll say all right we've got oops we've

962
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:32,309
got under entry coordinate system and

963
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,550
all I want to do here is is grab that

964
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:38,960
coordinate system out

965
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:42,289
and I guess you know well this is in

966
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,880
pixels right so whatever that coordinate

967
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:46,969
system is it's actually going to be in

968
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:54,410
pixels I don't know if we want to try

969
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:58,339
translating it out let's let's I guess

970
00:42:54,409 --> 00:43:00,139
leave it let's do a little bit of

971
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,490
translating it out what do you what do

972
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:04,549
you think about that you think that's

973
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:07,549
okay I'm thinking that that maybe that

974
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,930
we just do just the screen Center amount

975
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,280
well you know what no all right we'll

976
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:12,109
just do it in pixels so that we can see

977
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,180
it directly because that seems I guess

978
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:17,769
like more in the spirit of things all

979
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:21,859
right so if I do draw a rectangle I

980
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:23,480
basically need to draw some little

981
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:28,700
rectangles so that we can see this stuff

982
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:31,369
and so entry color our entry color G

983
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:34,909
entry color B right so there's my color

984
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:37,730
values I then need to have some kind of

985
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:40,159
a dimension let's say that our dimension

986
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:43,789
is going to be you know a four by four

987
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,379
pixel square or whatever or I guess in

988
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:49,909
this case it would be a five by five

989
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:52,579
pixels and then I will create the

990
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:54,679
p-value by taking the origin right and

991
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:56,299
now we should I think that actually

992
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:57,710
should show up although we need to

993
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,930
actually define it to be something that

994
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:01,490
will actually be visible in pixels so

995
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:04,639
the origin let's let's put it right at

996
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:07,399
the screen Center now and we'll say that

997
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:10,639
our X x-axis is maybe like a hundred

998
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,220
pixels a hundred pixels even though

999
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,920
we're not using those yet right so let's

1000
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:17,599
see if we should be able to see a little

1001
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,829
pixel for this and there it is right

1002
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,690
there you can kind of see it it's

1003
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:23,059
underneath me although the colors value

1004
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:26,200
seems wrong which I'm not exactly sure

1005
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:29,199
why that is

1006
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:29,199
yeah

1007
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:35,838
mmm draw a rectangle color our G and B I

1008
00:44:33,998 --> 00:44:37,248
feel like that should have been right

1009
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:40,208
but it looked like the color was wrong

1010
00:44:37,248 --> 00:44:42,618
to me not the end of the world we'll

1011
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:44,868
deal with that in a second but alright

1012
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:47,389
so if I was to take this and then draw

1013
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:50,419
the rest of those guys as well like the

1014
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:53,599
X in the other two axes right all I need

1015
00:44:50,418 --> 00:44:55,638
to do is create the other points the way

1016
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:00,469
that I said I was start at the origin

1017
00:44:55,639 --> 00:45:04,459
and go out along the x axis so here we

1018
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:05,929
go x axis in this particular case I

1019
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:07,908
don't actually need a scale for it so

1020
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:10,338
that's fine and then similarly if I go

1021
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:13,608
out along the y axis that'll be a point

1022
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:17,328
that's one unit along that axis as well

1023
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:19,969
that should give me basically that sort

1024
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:22,009
of tripod of points that are 100 pixels

1025
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:23,809
apart you can see them there I just

1026
00:45:22,009 --> 00:45:28,668
don't understand why their colors are

1027
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:32,259
that way that's kind of bizarre don't

1028
00:45:28,668 --> 00:45:37,009
you think super weird

1029
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:40,369
yeah very strange so let me check out

1030
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:44,269
what Y the colors are what they are the

1031
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:45,439
entry color are G and bees getting

1032
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:46,608
pasture I'm gonna I'm just gonna set a

1033
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:49,338
breakpoint there and see what those

1034
00:45:46,608 --> 00:45:53,438
colors are actually doing set to let's

1035
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:53,438
take a look so what's our entry color

1036
00:45:55,088 --> 00:46:02,778
entry color is all zeros all right

1037
00:46:00,648 --> 00:46:05,778
that doesn't seem good well that would

1038
00:46:02,778 --> 00:46:09,309
do it about two asleep sat the switches

1039
00:46:05,778 --> 00:46:09,309
today there we go

1040
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:17,920
okay there's our little coordinate

1041
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,570
system right pretty straightforward so

1042
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,610
if we want to do exactly what I said on

1043
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,769
the blackboard now it's it's really

1044
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:25,539
pretty trivial right I said what I

1045
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:26,920
wanted to do let's let's let's make the

1046
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:28,420
length of this be something that we pull

1047
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,670
out on the side so there's our scaling

1048
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:38,710
right of the axis let's make this be a

1049
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:43,110
cosine sign and we'll make this y-axis

1050
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:45,900
we'll just make that be the exact perp

1051
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:49,870
the the perp that I said before if we

1052
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:52,630
perpendicular to the y-axis oops right

1053
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:57,279
now I don't actually know if we ever put

1054
00:46:52,630 --> 00:47:01,660
in sine and cosine did we I think we did

1055
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,010
that we didn't so we have some some math

1056
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:04,719
to do oh well you know what we might

1057
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:07,870
have it in our in lines did we have it

1058
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:10,480
our in lines no where where's our square

1059
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:13,119
root for example right we have a

1060
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,329
intrinsics square root do we have a

1061
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:20,289
cosine we do have a cosine okay so if I

1062
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:21,789
do a cosine of some angle right then all

1063
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:23,769
I have to do is just say well okay let

1064
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:26,259
me base that angle off of the time value

1065
00:47:23,769 --> 00:47:29,320
that's going up there and then we can

1066
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,270
sort of have you know a rotating basis

1067
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,580
vector or at least we should have a

1068
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:35,829
rotating basis vector right and there

1069
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:38,650
you can see it rotating around exactly

1070
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:41,049
like we said it would on the blackboard

1071
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:43,240
now let me go ahead and and sort of do

1072
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,769
this live so you can kind of see what

1073
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:49,599
happens as you play around with it right

1074
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:54,429
there's that rotation so if I wanted to

1075
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:56,049
write I can change the the size of this

1076
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:58,719
coordinate system right by changing

1077
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:01,420
whatever that scale value is there right

1078
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,889
you can kind of see I can make it much

1079
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,659
smaller and then I guess smaller

1080
00:48:02,889 --> 00:48:07,059
rotating one I can also make it much

1081
00:48:04,659 --> 00:48:09,190
larger than it was before and then I'll

1082
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:11,380
get a much larger rotating axis system

1083
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:13,059
right and again any now anything I

1084
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,640
encode in this axis system that gets

1085
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:17,489
pulled out using that formula that I was

1086
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:20,889
talking about before will will still be

1087
00:48:17,489 --> 00:48:23,259
encoded properly right and so that's

1088
00:48:20,889 --> 00:48:25,529
really all there is to it yeah I can

1089
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:28,260
also introduce non-uniform scaling by

1090
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:30,750
scaling up you know whatever the the

1091
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,910
y-axis is so now there's one well that's

1092
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:35,010
actually me too large isn't it well be

1093
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:37,049
off the screen now we have like a you

1094
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:40,200
know one that's more elongated right and

1095
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:42,510
you can imagine us taking any sort of

1096
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:45,029
points that are in here and having those

1097
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:47,550
be rotated and scaled as well again just

1098
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:49,170
by taking them and interpreting them in

1099
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:52,080
that coordinate system and so just a

1100
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:55,860
show kind of an example of what I mean

1101
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,750
by that right you can see let's say that

1102
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,730
in the render group right we just had

1103
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,769
some points that were encoded in that

1104
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:04,500
axis right this is purely synthetic just

1105
00:49:01,769 --> 00:49:06,150
again as a thing to show for educational

1106
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,460
purposes let's say there were some

1107
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:10,619
points right let's say there were maybe

1108
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,929
I don't know let's say there's 16 points

1109
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,460
or something like that right and I'm

1110
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:16,980
gonna go ahead and say that we'll just

1111
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,559
render those points using that formula

1112
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:23,570
that I said previously right so if I

1113
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:26,730
come in here to my render group and

1114
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:30,990
inside here I just render those points

1115
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:34,230
directly right so I say all right for

1116
00:49:30,989 --> 00:49:36,659
you know P and X equal 0 P and X is less

1117
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:40,170
than that a ray count of whatever the

1118
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:43,889
entry points array has in it I then say

1119
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:49,860
all right the entry points whatever it

1120
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:53,519
is that's the new P coordinates that I'm

1121
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:55,860
that I'm using there right so if I want

1122
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,380
to generate P here I do exactly that

1123
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:01,260
formula that we wrote on the whiteboard

1124
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:04,680
I do I'm sorry the blackboard I do P dot

1125
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:08,640
X times the x axis plus P dot y times

1126
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:10,649
the y axis so start at the origin walk

1127
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,509
out the x coordinate along the x axis

1128
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:14,579
walk out the y coordinate along the y

1129
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,800
axis and that's my new point right and

1130
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:19,429
then I'll draw a rectangle there so that

1131
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,660
we can see it right make sense

1132
00:50:19,429 --> 00:50:23,549
pretty straightforward so all I need to

1133
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:24,989
do is actually initialize some points in

1134
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:28,380
there and what I'll do here is I'll just

1135
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:32,179
do a really simple grid for us to to use

1136
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:36,900
there so let's say I take you know an X

1137
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:38,849
of 0 I'll do X is less than 1.0 I'll do

1138
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:42,059
X plus equals 0

1139
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:44,730
point two five right I guess I should

1140
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:50,159
say less than or equal to and I'll do

1141
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:52,500
one here as well so we can have a lie as

1142
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:55,259
well and then I'll just say you know all

1143
00:50:52,500 --> 00:51:00,360
right we've got P and X equals zero and

1144
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:03,900
we'll say that our coordinate system I

1145
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:07,039
will need to actually be able to get one

1146
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:09,780
of these what is it render and

1147
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:13,650
coordinate system there it is crying

1148
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:16,160
system we'll just grab that out and

1149
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:19,650
we'll say okay points P and X plus plus

1150
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:21,119
equals V 2 X Y right so now we're

1151
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:24,360
literally just making a grid like we're

1152
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:27,359
making the X's go along quarters and the

1153
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:29,130
Y's go along quarters right now I

1154
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,750
introduce the notion here that I would

1155
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:33,240
return that coordinate system so I got

1156
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:35,039
to kind of actually do that right so

1157
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:40,589
that it can get filled out by the

1158
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:43,039
calling code return entry so and if I do

1159
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:49,620
that now I should get that little grid

1160
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:51,269
right or not I should get that little

1161
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:54,029
grid apparently I don't get that little

1162
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:57,780
grid V 2 points am I actually properly

1163
00:51:54,030 --> 00:52:00,269
initializing that yes p + x + plus y

1164
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,350
equals zero y lesson that's yeah just

1165
00:52:00,269 --> 00:52:03,329
trying to race the clock here I got it

1166
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:05,569
only only about five minutes left before

1167
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:09,779
I got to stop so sorry for the

1168
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:12,000
abbreviated miss of it all that looks

1169
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:15,180
correct so then whereas my rendering

1170
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:20,210
p.m. next weekend points B twos P or P

1171
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:24,659
dot x times entry x-axis P dot y that

1172
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:28,070
should've done it why did that not do it

1173
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:31,399
let's let's take a look so let's go oh

1174
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:36,500
wow it'd be nice if I actually used

1175
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,500
index there we go so

1176
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:48,649
get rid of that that is not what I would

1177
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:51,150
have expected at all to say the least

1178
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:55,230
what did I I must have initialized my

1179
00:52:51,150 --> 00:53:02,180
point slightly wrong as well hold on one

1180
00:52:55,230 --> 00:53:05,068
second there we go

1181
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:09,149
we're almost there just got a debug a

1182
00:53:05,068 --> 00:53:11,518
few more things my X and my Y let me

1183
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:13,318
take a break point there this is kind of

1184
00:53:11,518 --> 00:53:16,469
a sloppy way to do this I had to do it

1185
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:21,929
kind of quickly so let's see two five

1186
00:53:16,469 --> 00:53:27,568
five seven five one right initializing

1187
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:30,358
all the points properly there we go oh

1188
00:53:27,568 --> 00:53:33,199
but that's too many that's the problem

1189
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:37,440
right that's one too many

1190
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:39,868
yeah my bad that's more than what would

1191
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,358
fit right because you can't actually

1192
00:53:39,869 --> 00:53:46,769
yeah so I'll have to do it basically

1193
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:49,710
just in in the first portion I'm only

1194
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:51,209
allowed 16 points I was I don't know why

1195
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:54,929
but that's what that's the amount I did

1196
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:57,720
so there now we can actually see sort of

1197
00:53:54,929 --> 00:53:59,460
a more a more accurate version of sort

1198
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:03,268
of what the space looks like right and

1199
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:05,699
you can kind of see essentially whatever

1200
00:54:03,268 --> 00:54:07,919
I do and you know what I'm gonna I'm

1201
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:10,980
going to turn off the the recomputation

1202
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:14,309
of ground buffers as well so you know we

1203
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,630
had this executable reloaded thing we

1204
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:17,970
don't actually need to do that for what

1205
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:20,400
we're doing now so I'm gonna leave this

1206
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:22,469
running and I'm just gonna go ahead and

1207
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,940
play around with those those axes so

1208
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:25,738
remember the only thing that we're doing

1209
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,499
in here is we're just interpreting those

1210
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:29,670
points based on the coordinate system

1211
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:32,488
we're starting at the origin we're

1212
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,838
walking out along the x-axis by whatever

1213
00:54:32,489 --> 00:54:36,869
the x-coordinate is and we're walking

1214
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:38,909
out along the y-axis by whatever the

1215
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:41,489
y-coordinate is right so now I'm just

1216
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:44,129
gonna change the two axes that's all I'm

1217
00:54:41,489 --> 00:54:45,420
gonna do and I'm not going to touch what

1218
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,539
the point definition is the point

1219
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:50,608
definitions gonna stay the same right so

1220
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:52,920
let's say that I was two

1221
00:54:50,608 --> 00:54:54,929
we shrink the y-axis so that it's like

1222
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,400
the same scale is the x-axis right you

1223
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:58,980
can see that now I get back to a square

1224
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,989
right or I could sort of blow it out

1225
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,778
significantly more and you see that it

1226
00:55:00,989 --> 00:55:07,858
stretches out more right another thing

1227
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:08,639
that I could do is I could and and also

1228
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:11,278
you'll notice that they're always

1229
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,318
rotating around properly right another

1230
00:55:11,278 --> 00:55:14,849
thing that I could do is just get

1231
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:16,440
totally wild with it and say you know

1232
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:17,609
what I'm not gonna make these be

1233
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,528
perpendicular

1234
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:23,369
instead I'm actually going to make these

1235
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:27,150
be skew right so I'm gonna take the

1236
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:29,970
angle and I'm gonna add you know some

1237
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:32,009
some amount do we have pie yet no if we

1238
00:55:29,969 --> 00:55:33,358
have pie let's just find out here I

1239
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:37,289
don't think we've ever covered this on

1240
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:41,848
handmade here do we have pie yes we do

1241
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:44,278
have a pie I guess I'm not sure I'm not

1242
00:55:41,849 --> 00:55:50,999
sure if we have pie or not well I'll

1243
00:55:44,278 --> 00:55:52,009
just say 1.5 1/2 how's that is that

1244
00:55:50,998 --> 00:55:58,828
better

1245
00:55:52,009 --> 00:56:00,778
hopefully that's better why am i not why

1246
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:05,640
am i collapsing why is that producing

1247
00:56:00,778 --> 00:56:08,940
the same value is that odd to you oh

1248
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:11,278
because it's a hundred there we go all

1249
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:13,139
right so if I was to make this be just

1250
00:56:11,278 --> 00:56:14,548
some offset angle so I'm producing

1251
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:16,409
another angle and I just make it be

1252
00:56:14,548 --> 00:56:19,440
something that's not 90 degrees anymore

1253
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:21,690
right you can see that I can actually

1254
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,999
skew all of the points that are defined

1255
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:26,269
in that system as well right I can be as

1256
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:28,588
ridiculous as I want to be and by

1257
00:56:26,268 --> 00:56:30,058
morphing those axes right I'm gonna

1258
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:32,099
morph all the points that are inside

1259
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:35,670
them and similarly I can make something

1260
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:38,249
that's you know sort of smooshed up in

1261
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:41,608
addition to right and so that's really

1262
00:56:38,248 --> 00:56:42,929
all there is to understanding the

1263
00:56:41,608 --> 00:56:44,848
rotation and the scaling transforms it's

1264
00:56:42,929 --> 00:56:46,409
just taking those axes and bending them

1265
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:48,119
and all the points because you're

1266
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:50,219
constructing the points by moving along

1267
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:52,079
those axes there you go

1268
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:54,709
similarly the origin is the same you

1269
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:58,559
know if I introduce some amount of

1270
00:56:54,710 --> 00:57:00,389
wiggle to that right all the points

1271
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,599
obviously we know they will get

1272
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:03,960
displaced in in much that same way right

1273
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,690
so

1274
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,970
I can adjust their position as well so

1275
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:10,858
with origin X Y axis it allows me to

1276
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:13,439
have a tremendous amount of flexibility

1277
00:57:10,858 --> 00:57:14,369
with how I'm placing my points we

1278
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,200
haven't actually talked about how we're

1279
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:18,000
gonna render stuff yet in that space but

1280
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:21,269
we at least we now know kind of or can

1281
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,608
see very simply how those bases come

1282
00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:24,960
together right so I'm gonna leave it

1283
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:25,829
there because I'm just about out of time

1284
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,559
here

1285
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:31,619
so I'm gonna go ahead and say let's go

1286
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,329
to the Q&amp;A so we can cover any questions

1287
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:35,849
that we might have and then tomorrow we

1288
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:37,730
can sort of clean this stuff up and you

1289
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:43,769
know I'll put it to doing here to do KC

1290
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:46,460
let's add a a perk operator right and

1291
00:57:43,769 --> 00:57:46,460
off we go

1292
00:57:52,869 --> 00:58:07,150
ah any questions any questions this is

1293
00:58:04,539 --> 00:58:08,619
kind of a weird thing here sorry I'd say

1294
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,150
I'm in these weird points this is this

1295
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:12,400
is completely ridiculous right here but

1296
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:15,160
I just needed something quickly so we

1297
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,700
could show how things were interpreted

1298
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:17,699
in that space

1299
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,599
so if you have questions please prefix

1300
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:32,409
them with Q :

1301
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:37,049
so I can read them but yeah chat is a

1302
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:39,549
long time behind the video really okay I

1303
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:41,830
don't know why that is was there some

1304
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:45,750
kind of a drop frames no I guess it's

1305
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:45,750
just twitch twitch is a little laggy

1306
00:58:54,579 --> 00:59:02,619
if there are no questions then you know

1307
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:04,090
we'll be done early well of course I

1308
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:08,069
took ten minutes of extra time but

1309
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:08,070
because I started like 10 minutes late

1310
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:30,970
do you usually worry a lot about naming

1311
00:59:28,809 --> 00:59:33,849
schemes you always seem to choose a good

1312
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:35,230
enough name and move on no III don't

1313
00:59:33,849 --> 00:59:37,210
worry about naming schemes hardly at all

1314
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:38,380
as long as something seems reasonable

1315
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,880
enough I think that's fine you can

1316
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:52,269
always change it later so it's no big

1317
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:54,340
deal right John I don't know how many

1318
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:56,710
times I have to tell you this but that

1319
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:58,630
can't possibly be the variable how could

1320
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:01,480
it be the variable no one has ever seen

1321
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:03,039
a variable I mean like it's not even

1322
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,780
remotely plausible that that could be

1323
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:12,400
the variable it's just a spinning little

1324
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:14,230
diamond thing how can you draw so fast

1325
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,358
to use the draw pad and pen yeah I have

1326
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:19,889
like a little Wacom graphite like the

1327
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:19,889
little or graphite or whatever it is

1328
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:27,189
Carl and Oh bloom I only partly followed

1329
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:28,509
but it seemed fairly easy to get the

1330
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,010
basic rotation up and running I'm

1331
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:31,690
wondering how much more work it will be

1332
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:35,490
to start rendering textures by sampling

1333
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:43,630
them across the plane it's not much work

1334
01:00:35,489 --> 01:00:45,639
we can do it pretty pretty well so also

1335
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:49,809
John I feel like if the variable did

1336
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:51,489
exist it probably exists in between the

1337
01:00:49,809 --> 01:00:53,019
points that are rotating here somewhere

1338
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:54,608
like like the variable could be in there

1339
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:57,358
and we just can't see it you know what I

1340
01:00:54,608 --> 01:00:57,358
mean because it's invisible

1341
01:01:01,889 --> 01:01:08,400
I do filter on cue colons when there are

1342
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:11,489
enough questions but there aren't that

1343
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,480
many so I I flip back to the chat and

1344
01:01:11,489 --> 01:01:13,799
just see what's going on when there

1345
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:22,320
aren't a lot of questions when there are

1346
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:25,050
a lot of queue : questions Nick stop is

1347
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,500
it possible to do realloc with memory

1348
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:31,830
arena

1349
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:40,710
um it like it depends what you mean by

1350
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:44,969
that right so I guess what I would say

1351
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:47,639
is realloc by definition is allowed to

1352
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:49,319
return you a different memory block so

1353
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:52,250
technically you could easily implement

1354
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:54,510
that with memory arena by just

1355
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,889
allocating a new space at the end of the

1356
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:59,130
arena and returning that as the pointer

1357
01:01:55,889 --> 01:02:02,059
right but if you're talking about

1358
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:04,440
realloc as in allowing memory to grow

1359
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:05,849
then no because the arena is always

1360
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:09,269
tightly packed that's kind of the point

1361
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:10,889
of it so in that sense you'd never grow

1362
01:02:09,269 --> 01:02:17,940
a memory block in the arena unless it

1363
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:20,069
was the one at the end right our

1364
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:24,570
parametric's and polar functions going

1365
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:27,050
to be used later on well you know origin

1366
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:29,610
systems like this are basically like I

1367
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:31,140
mean that's that's sort of what they are

1368
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:32,849
they're like uber versions of polar

1369
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:35,069
functions right

1370
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:36,539
so you basically defined stuff and then

1371
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:38,760
you can rotate it however you want

1372
01:02:36,539 --> 01:02:40,469
polar functions themselves are not

1373
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,580
typically that useful unless you're

1374
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:43,619
trying to construct a basis because

1375
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:44,969
usually you're trying to do like we

1376
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:47,069
constructed our bases with polar

1377
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:48,419
coordinates right I mean that's that's

1378
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:52,800
polar coordinates right there folks

1379
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:54,360
right so you know you don't usually

1380
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,980
think in terms of polar coordinates in

1381
01:02:54,360 --> 01:03:00,750
that sense they're parametric's I mean

1382
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:04,440
again everything we've done so far is in

1383
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:05,099
parametric right so so I guess it

1384
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,760
depends if you're talking about

1385
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:07,589
something specific

1386
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,030
well sub-pixel positioning and

1387
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:11,160
anti-aliasing be part of the software

1388
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:12,540
render in the exploration phase actually

1389
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:13,649
we're not really doing the exploration

1390
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,920
phase for the render right now we're

1391
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:16,630
actually just doing the renderer so

1392
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:20,970
gonna do anti-aliasing and positioning

1393
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:20,970
and we'll just do it so it'll be done

1394
01:03:38,739 --> 01:03:42,098
see here

1395
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:57,670
it's like there's no more questions

1396
01:03:49,269 --> 01:04:00,579
probably not seeing any more questions

1397
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:04,269
on programming or on the programming

1398
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:05,710
we're doing I should say this could be

1399
01:04:04,269 --> 01:04:09,789
part of the lag as you were saying

1400
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:11,260
though maybe people are just about to

1401
01:04:09,789 --> 01:04:14,529
ask a bunch of questions and I just

1402
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:18,490
can't see them this thing's kind of

1403
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:22,120
funny sitting there like that I feel

1404
01:04:18,489 --> 01:04:25,149
like we should make the the size of it

1405
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:27,400
proportional as well so it's like you

1406
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:30,880
know oh it's like a hundred but it's

1407
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:35,349
plus twenty five point zero times you

1408
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:36,450
know cosine angle 0.1 F times angle or

1409
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:40,299
something right

1410
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:48,969
so that you know it kind of shrinks and

1411
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:52,050
grows like so right I mean that's really

1412
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:52,049
the way you want to go right

1413
01:04:56,619 --> 01:05:01,779
I do like it I like the the description

1414
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:04,200
of a Christmas tree Triforce that's

1415
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,200
pretty funny

1416
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:24,739
people think that's trippy you can keep

1417
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:44,719
going right I mean you can just go nuts

1418
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:46,368
with that if you want to right I think

1419
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:49,338
we ran out of questions too but we have

1420
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:57,470
yeah like basically vector bobs is what

1421
01:05:49,338 --> 01:06:01,460
we're doing right here time-dependent

1422
01:05:57,469 --> 01:06:04,879
color oh man all right well you know if

1423
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:15,670
you want it you got it I'm here I'm here

1424
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:15,670
for your amusement right off we go

1425
01:06:26,059 --> 01:06:29,059
better

1426
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,348
I mean basically like when we add

1427
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:48,239
particle systems if you guys think this

1428
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:50,039
is fun like particle systems I guess

1429
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:52,409
people are gonna go nuts because that's

1430
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:56,130
like that's what particle systems are

1431
01:06:52,409 --> 01:07:00,809
it's all this ridiculousness right so

1432
01:06:56,130 --> 01:07:02,970
yeah yeah and hand-made 4k demo I'm not

1433
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:04,920
qualified to do I just don't know the 4k

1434
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:06,569
tricks Fabien could could help out with

1435
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,039
that that's where Fabien comes in he

1436
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:15,480
should he should show us how to do a 4k

1437
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:17,909
demo so he needs more dots all right

1438
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:20,369
look we're not gonna yeah let's not this

1439
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:22,199
is just as meant for demo purposes we're

1440
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:24,539
not gonna rathole from that when we get

1441
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:26,009
to particle systems we can rattle on

1442
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:27,509
particle systems for a little while but

1443
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:30,630
that's that's probably not the best

1444
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:33,480
thing to be doing at the moment so let's

1445
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:36,750
leave that be for now all right all

1446
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:38,369
right I am going to oh you got that's

1447
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:41,159
the variable hit is now quit the

1448
01:07:38,369 --> 01:07:44,280
variable all right all right

1449
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:46,139
let's let's call it done for the day I

1450
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:49,369
think that's good enough I think that's

1451
01:07:46,139 --> 01:07:53,150
roughly where we want to be for that

1452
01:07:49,369 --> 01:08:00,420
kind of ridiculous why is that happening

1453
01:07:53,150 --> 01:08:02,010
all right all right well anyway if you

1454
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:04,349

ridiculous episode of handmade hero that

1462
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:22,649
little weird pulsating thing was pretty

1463
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:25,489

play around with it yourself you can

1472
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:46,889

I hope to see you guys all tomorrow same

1484
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:08,460
time same place

1485
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:11,039
5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time here on

1486
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:13,020
twitch when we will actually start

1487
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:14,840
implementing I guess we might we might

1488
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:17,820
just go for it and start implementing

1489
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,960
rotated and scaled textures just so we

1490
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:20,369
can kind of see how that's starting to

1491
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,720
work but there's probably a lot of

1492
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:23,159
Blackboard work we got to do so we

1493
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:25,610
probably won't probably take a couple

1494
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:28,500
days so we'll see how it goes but anyway

1495
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:29,939
hopefully you will come back tomorrow

1496
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:32,640
