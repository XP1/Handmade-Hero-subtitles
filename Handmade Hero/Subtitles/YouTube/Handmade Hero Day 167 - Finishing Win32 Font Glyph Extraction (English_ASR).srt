1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:06,240
start recording hello everyone and

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,609
welcome to handmade hero the show recode

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,888
a complete game live on stream on Twitch

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:14,070
no engines no libraries it's just us

5
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:16,759
here and in our own little typing

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,679
fingers now we have a little bit of

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,929
residual stuff from the Q&amp;A yesterday

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,089
that I kind of want to finish up that we

9
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,849
didn't really take close enough look at

10
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,230
but other than that I think we are kind

11
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,699
of done playing around with the asset

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,489
system we had a couple bug things we

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,530
wanted to look at so today we're

14
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,879
probably going to get back to

15
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,770
implementing some font stuff we already

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,100
did the stuff where we got font glyphs

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,600
but we haven't done the work of actually

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,210
figuring out what the metrics are the

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,250
fonts are so like how we measure letters

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,570
and line them up and stuff like that we

21
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,850
haven't started any of that so that's

22
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,929
what I would like to do today but first

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,399
I just want to clean up some loose ends

24
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,808
from the QA yesterday because we kind of

25
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,109
slammed some coding and really looked at

26
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,909
it so I want to make sure it's all okay

27
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:01,379
today is day 1 67 so if you're trying to

28
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,798
follow along at home you want to grab

29
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:06,509
day 166 of source code unzip that into a

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,590
directory and that's what I'm doing

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,689
today so if you pre-order the game on

32
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,920
handmade here or look in that current to

33
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:17,849
file for a day 166 a source and unzip it

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:22,049
all right so what we kind of randomly

35
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:26,368
through in at the end yesterday was i

36
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:29,610
think we had like a some kind of a state

37
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:36,739
spinlock that we were doing there where

38
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:38,938
we did something like you know this yeah

39
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:40,228
so what we were doing is we were playing

40
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:42,569
around this in the QA and we were

41
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:44,099
basically saying like okay if you tried

42
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,618
to do something if you're trying to load

43
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,059
something and it turns out you we're not

44
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:49,500
the first person to try and load it if

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,549
it was supposed to be immediate you're

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,840
supposed to spin lock now there's a

47
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,600
couple of problems with this piece of

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,009
code as written and this is why I want

49
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,408
to come take a look at it again first of

50
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,000
all I neglected to actually use this

51
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,090
volatile version there which is what I

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,609
had wanted right so that's a little bit

53
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,680
of a mistake say the least but the other

54
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:09,239
thing that's more important is this spin

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
lock should only happen if you're trying

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,209
to be immediate if we weren't trying to

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,620
be immediate we don't want to wait for

58
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,269
the asset right we have

59
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,340
so that that was not at all our

60
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:19,530
intention so I want to get rid of that

61
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,030
as well and I think that's mostly all

62
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,400
that there was we kind of played around

63
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,199
that in the Q&amp;A we never really finished

64
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,849
it properly so i think that's a little

65
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,500
bit more proper way to leave that code

66
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:34,169
yeah from where we have it so let's

67
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,610
let's go back to our font thing as you

68
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:37,318
can see we kind of left in a state where

69
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,750
we were debugging it that's why we had

70
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,199
that black background on the font glyphs

71
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,250
there instead of doing them sort of more

72
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,768
more cleanly where they didn't have the

73
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,989
background obviously so if we wanted to

74
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,730
get back to that what I want to do is

75
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,109
bring up that the test asset builder

76
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:53,939
thing which is the thing where we're

77
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:56,879
kind of been doing our asset file spec

78
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,739
stuff and as you remember we had a pound

79
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,389
of finding here so you could choose if

80
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,250
you wanted to use no libraries at all

81
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,078
even in the asset builder you could set

82
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,669
that to one if you wanted to use stb

83
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,170
truetype instead I showed how to use

84
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:13,108
that and you could set this to zero and

85
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:15,839
compile that in but with use fonts from

86
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:19,280
windows we never quite finished doing

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,509
our good see here doing our

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,280
anti-aliasing so if you look at that

89
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,659
closely it was not anti alias and we

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,180
kind of that's where we stopped on the

91
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,918
stream and so it might be worth just

92
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,599
taking a second to fix the anti-aliasing

93
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,280
in the Windows version just for now

94
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,848
because I don't know that that be that

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,449
hard to do right so if we're using fonts

96
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:40,858
from windows were in this path right and

97
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:43,709
the way that this works is when we

98
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:45,209
actually created a device context we do

99
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,098
like great compatible be seeing all this

100
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,750
stuff someone was hypothesizing on the

101
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:50,039
Forbes that perhaps the reason that we

102
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,628
were getting anti-icing is because we

103
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,780
had some kind of a monochrome bitmap

104
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:57,060
potentially because create compatible

105
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,919
dc0 might not be the same as using

106
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,049
Create compatible DC get DC 0 and I

107
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,030
don't know if that's true or not get DC

108
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,949
0 gives you back the screen DC maybe

109
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,719
create compatible DC 0 just does some

110
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:12,269
kind of a default behavior so it's

111
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,699
possible that that was creating a sort

112
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,649
of a monochrome backing bitmap and sorry

113
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,970
not having it didn't basically didn't

114
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,668
have any color to work with so it

115
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,140
literally couldn't anti-alias I'm not

116
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:23,939
sure if that's true so if you take a

117
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,879
look here this is what it was looking

118
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,339
like

119
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,199
I mean not know if you can see that too

120
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:31,449
well but it's definitely not anti

121
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,509
aliased on there that's the way that we

122
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:35,949
had it and so if we rebuild our art

123
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:39,339
assets here I'll just go ahead and

124
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,920
recompile go into the handmade data

125
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:44,649
directory and then run the test asset

126
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,120
builder again that'll go through and do

127
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:47,799
it's a little thing extract the thoughts

128
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,730
again and we can see if that actually

129
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,040
changed anything I don't know if it did

130
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,890
it looks pretty much exactly the same to

131
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,600
me I don't I don't see any any change in

132
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,860
the in the degree of anti-aliasing there

133
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,170
that's just my it's just my recollection

134
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,939
so yes I'm not sure so in general I

135
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,439
don't know if we wanted to actually make

136
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,719
sure that all this stuff worked right I

137
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,610
feel like we would have to do a little

138
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,790
bit of work here to actually set up a

139
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:20,080
bit map that was somewhat reasonable and

140
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:21,850
I'm not sure exactly how we would do

141
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,839
that so I'm going to go ahead and look

142
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:28,689
at doing something that will create an

143
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,639
actual bitmap you know that I have more

144
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:33,639
control over so so we can start by just

145
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,919
trying to verify you know that we have

146
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,459
some kind of a bitmap that's you know

147
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,920
that's going to meet our our criteria

148
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:43,479
right maybe I'll do a create di bitmap

149
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,230
as well something we could read out of

150
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:51,160
directly right so here's a create di

151
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:53,950
bitmap so what that would what that

152
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,490
would do right is that would allow us to

153
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:59,740
pass a bitmap info structure and the

154
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,569
bitmap info structure would be the same

155
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,870
sort of thing that we've been using for

156
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:07,949
loading bitmaps right like exactly the

157
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,949
same thing so

158
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,639
all that same stuff right that we had

159
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:19,579
before like the bitmap info header stuff

160
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,650
all that same stuff we could just set it

161
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,449
now instead of reading it out of a file

162
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,978
like we were doing we would just set

163
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,780
that stuff so we could set all of the

164
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:28,668
things that we wanted to set here in

165
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:30,500
terms of how we want it you know what

166
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:32,299
the width the height was how many bits

167
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,550
there were you know all that kind of

168
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,500
stuff we could set that stuff and then

169
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:40,699
we would at least know that we had

170
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,129
correctly selected into the device you

171
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,110
know a bitmap that was going to be to

172
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:47,149
our to our liking so we could take that

173
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,970
part out of the equation make sure that

174
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:52,848
there isn't a problem so if you look at

175
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,229
create a DI bitmap we would take it a

176
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:56,120
handle to the device context that would

177
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:59,629
of course be the compatible DC that we

178
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,870
created here we would pass that header

179
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:05,240
which is going to be one of these things

180
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:09,800
we would probably just set this to

181
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,870
nothing to I guess we would just pass

182
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,949
the init to clear everything out I don't

183
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,819
know how I don't know what we want to do

184
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,819
there we might want to clear ourselves

185
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:25,939
looks like the tricks of shreds of

186
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:27,800
dimensions if you usage and pointer to

187
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,968
the rabbit in the initial bitmapdata the

188
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,680
format of the day it depends on the beer

189
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:33,430
boot camp that's not really what I

190
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,699
wanted I actually want to create a

191
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:39,680
bitmap that I can actually read out of

192
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,210
so I think I probably want more of like

193
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,490
a dip section like we were creating

194
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:46,310
before right like I want to actually

195
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,400
know that that I can access the bits

196
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,228
myself because if I can access the bit

197
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,579
to myself I could also get get out of

198
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:55,008
the business of doing this get pixel

199
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,689
nonsense because get pixels super slow

200
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,280
it's an OS call every time we want to

201
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:59,779
read this and so even though this is the

202
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,189
asset Packer we don't really care too

203
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:04,489
much up so it is I mean there's no sense

204
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:06,620
in being unnecessarily slow that's my

205
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:13,519
feeling on it right so what I would say

206
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:15,800
is let's go ahead and try to create one

207
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,049
of these dip sections something like

208
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,050
that and I feel like that would maybe

209
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,088
get us a little closer to our goal of

210
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,389
having anti-alias fonts and also we

211
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:25,610
could

212
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,899
we could at the same time fix some of

213
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:32,029
that nastiness with the end with the

214
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:34,579
readout with the with the get pixel call

215
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,259
which is not fabulous so if i was going

216
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:41,330
to create one of these dips sections i

217
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:44,629
need to have a bitmap info right and i

218
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:53,389
need to pass that in here this I you

219
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:59,659
suggesting we definitely want it to be a

220
00:08:53,389 --> 00:09:02,330
RGB right although type of data

221
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:04,129
contained the BMI colors so to be honest

222
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,230
this doesn't really matter because we're

223
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:08,840
not going to even pass a BMI colors

224
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,399
thing so I think we really actually

225
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,810
doesn't matter that's that's like if you

226
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,039
want it so that's if I like palletized

227
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:14,419
stuff or something so I don't think we

228
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,909
even really care about that but doesn't

229
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:20,329
matter the location of the D did bit

230
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:22,789
value so this this thing here ppb bits

231
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,370
is going to give us a pointer to the

232
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:26,480
actual bits that we can then read out of

233
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,860
right and that's the sort of thing that

234
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,300
I wanted so this is basically like that

235
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,340
you know the bits or something I don't

236
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:39,079
know we want to call that but we could

237
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:41,030
just pass that like so all right so

238
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,129
let's see eight section handle a file

239
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:46,100
mapping object okay that that we don't

240
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:48,679
need it all right we don't we don't want

241
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,360
any of this stuff we just want you know

242
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,919
a standard in memory thing we're not

243
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,470
trying to do any kind of weird like out

244
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,509
of memory stuff okay so that's that's

245
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,340
not a problem and same thing with offset

246
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:01,610
so that's that's all totally fine right

247
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,800
so all that is pretty easy right we can

248
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,779
create that and that would give us our

249
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:07,729
bitmap back and then we could of course

250
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:10,069
selected in now the problem is this

251
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,409
bitmap info thing here we have to

252
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,120
actually initialize that to set that

253
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:15,230
bitmap info to stuff that that would

254
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,539
actually be meaningful right because

255
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,480
it's going to use we're passing this in

256
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:24,079
its going to use this bitmap info to

257
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,300
actually create the Dib section and so

258
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,270
you know we've got to fill it out

259
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:32,449
meaningfully right so if i click on

260
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:34,730
bitmap info header here what i can do is

261
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,129
i can start to set these values right i

262
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:44,180
can just go ahead and grab them all

263
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:48,259
thank you and set them there we go just

264
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:53,419
kind of get this going here there we go

265
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:55,340
and some here you know I mean if you're

266
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:58,069
feeling kind of feisty if you've got a

267
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:01,040
little bit of you know zest if you've

268
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,320
got some some life in you this evening

269
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,449
you could even go ahead and do rectangle

270
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,610
kill they're always always a big

271
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:11,060
favorite it was a big crowd favorite a

272
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,669
rectangular kill so we got to set these

273
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:15,500
guys up and so you know the number of

274
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:16,849
bytes required by the structure well we

275
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,159
know what the number of bytes acquired

276
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:23,269
by the structure is presumably it's just

277
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:27,289
the size of we know the width and the

278
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:29,299
height oh wait but this is just a header

279
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:31,219
part right so it's BMI header these are

280
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:33,919
actually all these are actually a part

281
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,620
of the header so presumably I can just

282
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,029
do that although I you'll notice they

283
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,710
didn't actually quite to say whether

284
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:43,870
that size was supposed to refer to the

285
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:47,240
whole thing or just my part of the thing

286
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:51,740
so I don't know that's a good question

287
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,850
which one did you want for bi size the

288
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,680
number of bytes required by the

289
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:59,980
structure would suggest it's just this

290
00:11:54,679 --> 00:12:03,399
but we'll see anyway okay so the width

291
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,370
we should already have access to

292
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,539
somewhere in here we should know that

293
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,730
like we should have some kind of notion

294
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:15,469
of how big the thing was that we were

295
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:19,700
drawing in with where are you yeah I

296
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:22,850
guess we don't know slide 6 so we just

297
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,200
do yeah we don't really do anything so

298
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,330
we just need something here that would

299
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,730
tell us the maximum with that we might

300
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,220
ever want right so this would be like

301
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,320
Max dim or something right a max

302
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,759
dimension so we're just going to have to

303
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,830
do something like okay you know it's

304
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,740
1024 is the biggest character we'd ever

305
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:43,310
have or something like that all right so

306
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,350
let's see bi planes the number of planes

307
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:47,750
for the target device it must be set to

308
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:51,058
1 all right well that's easy the bit

309
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:54,778
count is going to be 32 presumably

310
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:55,889
yep we could also do 24 but either way

311
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:57,899
it doesn't really matter we want

312
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,359
probably 32 so it's you at 32 aligned

313
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,918
would be easiest for us bi compress it

314
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:03,269
and we don't want any compression we

315
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:05,938
want to be able just read this out as it

316
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:09,119
is so that's all good the size of the

317
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:13,528
image for bi RGB can be set to 0 so I

318
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:17,579
guess we can set it to 0 like so pels

319
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:20,879
per meter let's see because you just

320
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:23,188
five sec device I don't know that we

321
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,869
care about that at all I don't know if

322
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:26,548
it's an error to set it to zero but we

323
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:29,668
don't really want it we're not going to

324
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:32,218
use any colors so we don't want any of

325
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:33,468
these we don't want a color table for

326
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:37,079
this bitmap or anything like that so

327
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:38,519
we've set some stuff there it is we

328
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,878
don't know whether it's going to work or

329
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,918
not we'll see we can certainly run it

330
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,168
but we don't have any idea if it's going

331
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:49,369
to be correct so let's go ahead and see

332
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:49,369
what we ended up with there

333
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,370
you know I think that may have done it

334
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:59,799
though

335
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:02,860
that is looking anti-alias to me sure is

336
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,959
people so I think that that was the what

337
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,350
the doctor ordered there we just needed

338
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,990
to create an actual bitmap that windows

339
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:14,259
new is going to be a reasonable number

340
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:18,190
of bits per pixel apparently because now

341
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:21,879
it's not all janky so that's nice all

342
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,410
right so if that's the case then we kind

343
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:26,320
of have another nice thing we could do

344
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:29,769
right because if we did that we could

345
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,810
put this void bits thing right as sort

346
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:36,579
of an outside a little outside guy right

347
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:38,528
and that would mean that now the bits

348
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,450
could be accessed directly so instead of

349
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:41,559
having to do this kind of nonsense we

350
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,440
could just get the bits out ourselves

351
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:46,179
right now the problem with that is i

352
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,070
don't know what the actual stride is

353
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:50,079
going to be but my understanding is the

354
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,910
stride is actually knock is it's always

355
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,278
going to be as long as we're 32 bits per

356
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:55,719
pixel I think the way it allocates them

357
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:58,088
is always the same because you notice

358
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,680
there's no stride in here so I think it

359
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,060
always just does like one of those

360
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,278
things where kind of rounds up to the

361
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:06,099
nearest D word so I think we're probably

362
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,480
fine to just assume that that's true and

363
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,159
what that would mean is that we could

364
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,870
literally read out the bits sort of

365
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:16,120
directly along the line without too much

366
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,009
trouble right without without really too

367
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:24,100
much trouble so let's take a look here

368
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:26,950
at how this is going so really we've got

369
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,129
a little bit of work to do here this

370
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:33,730
kind of runs through that bitmap width

371
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:36,159
and height yeah so what we would want to

372
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,110
do is our standard row thing right we'd

373
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:42,039
want to do okay let's start with the

374
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:47,019
bits at the top there we'd kind of come

375
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:54,819
through each individual row and do you

376
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:58,990
32 pixel I guess that's really only need

377
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:03,390
equals Rho and and at the end of it we

378
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,389
would just do the row equals the sort of

379
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:08,839
bitmap width

380
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:10,700
like that right or I don't know we want

381
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,800
to call it this is the like total width

382
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:16,610
or the the width of the sort of

383
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,799
extraction area maybe max with something

384
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:23,060
like that we would want to do the max

385
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:25,879
with you know to advance to the next row

386
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:28,369
that's really about it right and so that

387
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,649
in here to read these guys off any

388
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,560
getting to give vidual pixel at this

389
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:35,659
point is just star right to look at it

390
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:38,059
and then we would kind of go further

391
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:40,699
like so so I think that's all we would

392
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:43,789
really need to do we just now need to

393
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,950
actually store that max width so we want

394
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:48,529
something that's like max width equals

395
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,540
that 1024 max height equals 1024

396
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,949
something like that and then in here we

397
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:59,389
can just actually put those in there max

398
00:16:51,950 --> 00:17:02,870
whip right max height right so i think

399
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:05,900
that's that's reasonable i think let's

400
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:10,009
see if that works at all of course it

401
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:12,680
does not release does not appear to so

402
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:15,019
let's see assuming we got the bits back

403
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:18,078
which we wouldn't hear and it's a static

404
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:19,910
so it will be preserved then what we

405
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,309
need to figure out is what did I mess up

406
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,579
in here when we were actually getting

407
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:27,529
that ex back I feel like this would have

408
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:31,519
been correct we'd start at zero we'd

409
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:34,549
kind of go forwards with that and that

410
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,379
should have done it right because this

411
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:38,210
is still using get pixel but that's fine

412
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,030
right there's nothing foo there's

413
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:47,769
nothing weird about that that's totally

414
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:47,769
fine although

415
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:58,789
no I think that should be totally fine

416
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:05,210
right so what did I do oddly here if

417
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:08,539
this is set to bits we set the road to

418
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,430
the beginning of bits we then increment

419
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:15,920
the row every time through the while

420
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:19,460
loop by incrementing ah well no that's

421
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,660
fine just using just the size CX since I

422
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,730
see why you really shouldn't be a

423
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,740
problem right it seems like that should

424
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,180
be totally fine so we only increment

425
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:33,380
height times we only increment with

426
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:38,480
times that seems totally fine to me that

427
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:41,810
seems totally fine to me so I guess what

428
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:46,880
I might say is we could put this guy

429
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:49,099
back in right there's the get the get

430
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,560
pixel right so this is like our

431
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:56,359
reference pixel and I we could then say

432
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,700
step through this and see if they don't

433
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,159
agree right we could we could actually

434
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,880
go through here and see what actually

435
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,350
happens I believe we are able to step

436
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,450
through our asset processor pretty

437
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:11,269
trivially just by switching to this

438
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,250
other sln right I've got the two slms

439
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:15,619
there the one for the handmade and one

440
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,140
for the asset builder so I can kind of

441
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:20,059
switch freely between them and so when

442
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,740
we do our load glyph bitmap I should be

443
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,329
able to just you know let me make sure

444
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,109
we're running this in the data directory

445
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:30,349
I don't want to spew HHA files all over

446
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:32,179
the place okay yes it is so yeah so if I

447
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:35,269
wanted to I can run this and I can step

448
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,880
into it so I can see what's going on so

449
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:42,940
I can come in here and go all right you

450
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,940
know let's run to hear there's the row

451
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:51,410
take a look at what that looks like it's

452
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:54,129
zero not super surprising but if I come

453
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:58,509
in here now I can I should be able to

454
00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:02,179
compare what's happening with ref pixel

455
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:05,778
write and star pixel

456
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:07,730
right so I should be able to see if they

457
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:10,460
differ in fact I guess I could just put

458
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:13,730
in an assert to that would fire at the

459
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:24,798
right time right so assert ref pixel

460
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:30,769
equals star pixel something like this so

461
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:32,210
there you go our star pixel is not

462
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:45,669
getting back the same thing and where

463
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:45,669
are we at X 11 y 26 right mm-hmm I say

464
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:56,378
very interesting

465
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:08,720
presumably we are just getting a whole

466
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:11,840
lot of zero from this even though we are

467
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,789
stepping through some semblance of some

468
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:18,589
bits that presumably should have been

469
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:24,829
corresponding to the bitmap that's been

470
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:29,990
selected into that device context and I

471
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:36,799
don't really know why that's the case I

472
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:44,808
am interested I would like to see this

473
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:50,678
pixel pointer I'm just curious is it

474
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:58,428
just all zeros oh no now I've done it no

475
00:21:50,679 --> 00:22:00,170
I am mildly clearest is it all zeros so

476
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:02,840
it's just zeros as far as the eye can

477
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:08,410
see this is just it's just all nothing

478
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:13,699
right so somehow our bit bits pointer is

479
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:17,900
not is not really actually showing us

480
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,670
anything here so I guess the other

481
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,500
question is is it just upside down or

482
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:26,860
something so another thing I might want

483
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:29,960
to do is assert a star pixel equals 0 is

484
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:33,619
star pixel ever set to anything even

485
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,890
after we go through all these know so

486
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:42,649
basically like we're just getting back

487
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:46,960
total zeros everywhere I which got to be

488
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:50,300
honest don't know why don't know why I

489
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,600
feel like creative section must be doing

490
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:55,669
something I'm not expecting but I don't

491
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,889
know what it would be we're definitely

492
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,050
selecting it into the device context

493
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,910
which means that the Vice context should

494
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:06,710
be rendering to it would be my

495
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:11,050
expectation and then I feel like we

496
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:14,870
should be able to grab out those bits

497
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:15,379
after having done the text out but that

498
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:16,819
doesn't

499
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,550
not actually appeared to be what

500
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:24,129
actually happened right it appears like

501
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:26,419
it's doing some other thing where where

502
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,520
it's not actually running into the same

503
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:40,120
bits that's giving us if that makes

504
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:42,349
sense and I am not sure how we fix that

505
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:45,109
this is one of those things where this

506
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:46,459
is why programming with closed in a

507
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:47,779
closed system is so frustrating look

508
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,240
normally you just step in there and you

509
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:51,680
just see right but of course we can't

510
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,390
step in there because we aren't allowed

511
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,070
to like see any of the window source

512
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,850
code so we have no idea right like we

513
00:23:55,069 --> 00:24:00,649
have no idea what's going on it's

514
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:04,159
probably something really simple and

515
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:07,250
stupid that we just made a slight error

516
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,500
on right not knowing like what we should

517
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,829
have set up here or something or we're

518
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,779
stepping through slightly wrong you know

519
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:17,059
but there's no way for us to like do

520
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:18,589
easy debugging of it because we can't

521
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:19,970
access any of the code that would

522
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:26,439
actually have been relevant to help us

523
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:26,440
right which is kind of annoying so I

524
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:31,129
guess let's take a look at the

525
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:33,470
documentation for create dip section and

526
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:36,410
see if there's anything that would give

527
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:41,569
us a hint as to why it would be doing

528
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:43,460
what it's doing right look maybe there's

529
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:45,279
some sample code we can look at that

530
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:49,670
would show us something that we had

531
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:52,759
forgot to do right or something like

532
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:58,400
this what does dip suction the actual

533
00:24:52,759 --> 00:25:03,470
value there created by calling create

534
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:06,019
dip sites from function yeah that's just

535
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:11,000
info it doesn't really matter i don't

536
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:15,680
think so well we could look good look at

537
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,799
bitmaps overview in here and see if

538
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,799
maybe there is something using bitmaps

539
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:33,890
unfortunately yeah well create dibs

540
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:38,860
section example that's not what I want I

541
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:41,419
just want you know I just want a create

542
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:42,949
dip section well that's what I want to

543
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:45,070
create dip section instead of get pixels

544
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:49,069
that's exactly what I was looking for

545
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:53,808
right oh this is somebody who's like

546
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:56,928
changelog right so hey they did pretty

547
00:25:53,808 --> 00:26:00,440
much exactly the same thing we did wow

548
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:04,460
that's kind of eerily this close they

549
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:08,620
even did that that same thing ha ha ha

550
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:13,610
yeah so they do create dip section there

551
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:15,439
they do a get DC of 0 as well this is

552
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:21,849
like literally exactly the same code

553
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:25,880
right I mean that looks crazy clothes so

554
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:28,548
let's see they select the bitmap in they

555
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:32,000
look like they're sort of clearing or 10

556
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:38,750
they're copying I guess from one DC to

557
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:46,669
the other let's see and then they long

558
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:48,380
and pixels p RG b PB bitmap so yeah I

559
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:54,350
mean they're doing exact the same thing

560
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:56,850
right there walking through there looks

561
00:26:54,349 --> 00:27:01,139
exactly the same

562
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:07,169
I do not know why we are having no luck

563
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:09,090
there when that seems like everything's

564
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,820
wrecked and we know it's drawing fonts

565
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:23,399
because if we use get pixel it actually

566
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:25,169
works so hmm I say so am i doing

567
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,720
something stupid in the loop like that I

568
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:29,660
just make a typo right here's the bits

569
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,569
pointer it's pointing to the top

570
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,890
presumably I mean I guess it could be

571
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:37,079
pointing backwards thing if it wasn't

572
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,610
then we just crash right because we're

573
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:39,960
pointing into some memory that they gave

574
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:41,250
us so if we were walking the wrong

575
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,470
direction you'd think we just crash

576
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,329
right away so presumably we are going in

577
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:50,400
the correct direction we're pointing to

578
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:53,639
the bits pointer we go through each line

579
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,790
we start at the row pointer which we

580
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,320
have here we go for however many pixels

581
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:00,899
we believe we're supposed to go by

582
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,669
advancing one pixel at a time and each

583
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:09,240
pixel's 32 bits so it should just be one

584
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:14,970
u32 is worth right sure feels like it

585
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:17,910
would work unless there's something no I

586
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,549
don't think so and then at the end of

587
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:24,390
every row of these we advance the row

588
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:26,159
pointer by however much the maximum

589
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,560
width was which is how far it should be

590
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:32,820
to get to the next row right which is

591
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:37,799
going to be 1024 x 4 so 4096 which again

592
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:41,990
seems totally totally reasonable so I

593
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,990
don't know I do not know

594
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:57,200
anyone on the stream got any ideas

595
00:28:49,028 --> 00:29:01,359
anyone anyone I kind of want to want to

596
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:12,080
know why that's broken I want to know

597
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:19,839
why that's broken there's got to be a

598
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:25,819
secret there has to be some fancy secret

599
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:36,879
that we're not thinking of and what is

600
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:36,879
it what would it be what would it be I

601
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:45,158
feel like we could do something where we

602
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:49,069
would shrink down the size of the bitmap

603
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:53,770
to something easier to see that would be

604
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:53,769
one thing and certainly

605
00:29:56,739 --> 00:30:02,389
by the way to anyone on the stream who

606
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:06,069
says stop wasting time get pixel works

607
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:10,579
fine for the asset builder that is not

608
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:13,638
not a handmade hero a way to think about

609
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:16,668
things you're supposed to understand

610
00:30:13,638 --> 00:30:20,118
what is going on in your code you are

611
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:22,038
not supposed to go Oh something randomly

612
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:24,558
works here and some other thing doesn't

613
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:28,598
randomly work well okay I'll just ignore

614
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:32,719
it right that is not at all the point

615
00:30:28,598 --> 00:30:33,798
bad we always want if we have something

616
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:36,288
we don't understand we should try to

617
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,908
understand it right and in this case it

618
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:40,278
should be relatively straightforward for

619
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:43,580
us to figure out what's going on because

620
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:45,229
I feel like we're not far we know we're

621
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:46,519
using create dip section in a proper way

622
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:49,249
because we're actually getting glyphs

623
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:52,159
out the other side right so if i want to

624
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:54,528
write i can use ref pixel and we know

625
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,719
that ref pixel actually worked right so

626
00:30:54,528 --> 00:30:59,450
when we extract the pixels out of there

627
00:30:56,719 --> 00:31:02,570
we know that that works but for some

628
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:05,330
reason when we use the actual memory

629
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:07,608
pointer that create Dib section returns

630
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:09,888
to us we don't seem to be able to see

631
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:13,158
anything in there and I feel like we

632
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:16,038
want to know what's going on there so

633
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:19,669
the first thing that I would say is if

634
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:22,838
we actually took let's say we let's what

635
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:26,028
would happen if we just straight-up

636
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:28,729
obliterated what was in there right like

637
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:31,338
what would happen if at the outset we

638
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:35,569
did something like you know a mem set of

639
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:40,190
max width x max height times the size of

640
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:42,499
you and 32 so the whole that map right

641
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:45,588
what if we did a thing where we just set

642
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:47,778
that to white right I'm interested to

643
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:50,329
know what would actually happen so must

644
00:31:47,778 --> 00:31:52,308
get a full on set it to white I'm going

645
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:54,228
to take that bits pointer that we had so

646
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:57,108
I'm just windows gives me something back

647
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:59,028
I'm wiping it with ffs so I know that

648
00:31:57,108 --> 00:32:00,829
when I run it we're gonna get we're

649
00:31:59,028 --> 00:32:06,079
going to start out with a bitmap that

650
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:07,220
has all white in it and hey let's see

651
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:14,549
here

652
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:17,549
fits here we go there's all my FS so now

653
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:21,079
we're going to watch windows draw it

654
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:24,690
just did not even touch this thing right

655
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:27,379
like there was no like no touching

656
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:35,220
occurred there was no touching it all

657
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:39,270
right so when we come in here and we

658
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:42,950
look at star pixel and ref pixel it's

659
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:48,720
just so this this this bitmap is a lie

660
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:53,580
right this bitmap is a total is a total

661
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,410
lie right because if it were actually

662
00:32:53,579 --> 00:33:03,240
drawing that glyph we would have seen it

663
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:05,670
in here right so let's do something now

664
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,750
where we kind of constrict things a

665
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:12,390
little bit as well right let's do

666
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:15,390
something in here where we say okay if

667
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:19,320
the width is greater than the max with

668
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:23,430
will clamp it right and if the height is

669
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:27,929
greater than the max height will clamp

670
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:29,789
it so now we know we can maybe do a

671
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:31,350
little bit more playing around coming

672
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:35,250
here and say you know what now this

673
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:36,599
thing is just 32 by 32 it's tiny so

674
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:40,140
we'll be able to look at like the whole

675
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:44,189
thing you know in a more you know in a

676
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:45,870
more direct fashion right so now if I

677
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:50,009
come in here I can kind of get a little

678
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:52,079
bit more of the bitmap on there so

679
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:55,619
here's our bits pointer I'm going to

680
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,359
copy it in there there's all our ffs and

681
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:59,279
there we can see we can now see the

682
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,169
whole thing right and I want to be able

683
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,629
to see the whole thing so I know that

684
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:05,789
we're not missing some of it so when we

685
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:11,099
come through here and we do our text out

686
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:14,070
right Hey look it actually drew some

687
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:16,440
stuff so I think what's happening is

688
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:18,860
we're in some kind of a top-up but like

689
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,970
bottom up top down situation or

690
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,070
something

691
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:28,378
where they gave us back a bitmap pointer

692
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:33,590
that was in the wrong place right uh so

693
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:35,909
i think i think if i had to guess uh

694
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,099
what we basically have here is a

695
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,409
situation where it's drawing the wrong

696
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:44,250
orientation from what we would like it

697
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:49,108
to be doing right and we could probably

698
00:34:44,250 --> 00:35:03,409
fix that by saying this right that'd be

699
00:34:49,108 --> 00:35:09,090
my guess where where are we there we go

700
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:10,829
although wait well you know what now

701
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:17,369
that I think about it if it is going

702
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:20,029
from the bottom up if it is going from

703
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:20,030
the bottom up

704
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:29,519
and it's giving us back a pointer to the

705
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:31,289
top all right I'm going to leave it like

706
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,000
this for a second and I just want to see

707
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:35,400
if that's what's actually happening but

708
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,579
I should be able to do essentially what

709
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:43,110
it wants for me right I should be able

710
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:46,199
to emulate what it's doing right I can

711
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:48,240
do minus equals max with their and and

712
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:51,000
do something like this where it's max

713
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:54,569
aight minus 1 times max with like so

714
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:00,090
right i should be able do something like

715
00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:03,030
that right so hey it does the fill then

716
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,460
it does the text out and then let's see

717
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:08,850
what the ref pixel is the ref pixel is

718
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:14,610
zero the pixel is zero those match let's

719
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:24,449
keep going here and pixels not syrup

720
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:31,880
perfect ok there we go Hey look we solve

721
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:31,879
the problem so let's run this back out

722
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:51,920
lovely wouldn't you say so if we want to

723
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:59,940
do this right we would do something like

724
00:36:51,920 --> 00:37:05,730
yeah start the row pointer their source

725
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:11,130
row kind of a thing put the source in

726
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:12,630
here like that source Rose stepping

727
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,950
backwards question how we could step

728
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:17,519
them forwards because they're both going

729
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:22,250
the same direction let's not mention it

730
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:27,480
you know no need to you know no need to

731
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:30,179
bring that whole thing up assert pixel

732
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:38,940
equals source

733
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:42,690
+ + source can I get a nope can't quite

734
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:49,650
get uh what I do there so max aight

735
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:59,400
minus one that's starting at the bottom

736
00:37:49,650 --> 00:38:03,090
right then as we go in why we want to

737
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:13,800
step backwards which one are we on here

738
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:16,829
x equals negative what ah that's not

739
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:20,030
good see we already found a bug in our

740
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:23,429
actual code before so when we have our

741
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:27,360
thing there to kind of pull an apron out

742
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:28,500
around these guys that's I wonder how

743
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,670
we're going to deal with that I'm gonna

744
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:36,210
we're gonna have to put a little thing

745
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:38,519
around here do apron leave that out for

746
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:48,179
a second alright let's go back to what I

747
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:53,789
was doing okay so why is 26 x is 6 what

748
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:54,989
does our bitmap actually look like well

749
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,519
i guess going to be hard to see because

750
00:38:54,989 --> 00:39:02,489
we're looking at their well you know I

751
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:05,639
could do I can look at source row is

752
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:08,699
bits max assist at the bottom then

753
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:12,900
whatever min Y is it's going to have to

754
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:18,149
go up from there that many right which

755
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:20,490
seems totally fine x max with then ah

756
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:22,680
right we're not pre stepping min x

757
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:25,469
that's all since we're starting at min

758
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:30,710
acts we just have to pre step min x in

759
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:34,409
right there big deal there alright

760
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:39,750
hopefully getting a little closer x and

761
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:41,759
y right because whatever the row is we

762
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,980
would need to go forward by that many

763
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,320
pixels to line up with this

764
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:51,590
I all right so whatever the pixel is the

765
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,450
source is those are not even close so I

766
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,800
feel like we've got one other thing I

767
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:57,639
think we were started at ten minutes

768
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:02,420
left on the clock I don't remember

769
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:04,699
something like that so yeah so now we're

770
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:07,490
pre stepping min why we're p stepping

771
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:10,118
minacs and we're doing our reads that

772
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:10,118
all seems good

773
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:27,190
am I missing anything important here I

774
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:37,119
don't think so but you never do know oh

775
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:44,568
man that's no good yeah sorry i meant to

776
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:47,000
pre step the the source not the dust so

777
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:50,389
there we go now we're running nicely

778
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,568
there right and so with those assertions

779
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:59,150
in place you know i can get rid of these

780
00:40:52,568 --> 00:41:01,480
right and instead just do something like

781
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:11,858
you could to pixel equal star source

782
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:17,539
right so now just get rid of those and

783
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:19,818
off we go lovely so now I think we have

784
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:23,930
successfully converted over to using

785
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:26,989
win32 properly to get a large data out

786
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:29,449
there so that's all nice and let's see

787
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:30,979
let's see oh I guess we should do one

788
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:33,679
more thing but let's just double check

789
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:36,349
here if I go back to handmade and run it

790
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,509
we should see nice letters we do have

791
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:43,010
nice letters but let's just double check

792
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:46,789
here for a second if we go in and do

793
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:48,230
this remember we we were sort of we

794
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:50,270
would do it we were doing the alpha sec

795
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:52,369
separately so that we can put a black

796
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:53,659
background on it we probably don't want

797
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:56,568
to do that anymore because now we're

798
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:58,098
actually doing them slightly more

799
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:59,900
correct so you can see it's kind of got

800
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:02,210
that black background if we actually

801
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:07,700
rebuild the art assets now with the one

802
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:10,440
that uses the the alpha level we should

803
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:15,118
have nice nicely alpha

804
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,409
so there we go so that's good but we

805
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,818
still need to be able to put an apron on

806
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:21,328
them which we don't have the ability to

807
00:42:17,818 --> 00:42:23,400
do at the moment because remember the

808
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:25,950
way we wrote our bitmap stuff is we

809
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,440
expect a 1 pixel transparent border

810
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:31,108
around things in order for everything to

811
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,179
sample properly so that's something that

812
00:42:31,108 --> 00:42:35,039
we still want to have to do so we've got

813
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:37,440
about 8 minutes left maybe we should

814
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:40,050
figure out how we want to do that I

815
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,019
think probably what we'd want to do here

816
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:48,420
is inside sort of this width and height

817
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:50,309
copy we would want to account for that

818
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,260
I'm wondering if I can merge these two

819
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:53,639
code paths because they should be

820
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,960
roughly the same in fact you look at

821
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:57,809
them in there they're very very similar

822
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,059
right so it would be kind of cool if we

823
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:01,650
could go ahead and merge those and

824
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:03,000
that's something that maybe maybe it's a

825
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,010
little premature to do today but maybe

826
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
tomorrow when we have a little more time

827
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,950
at the beginning we could go ahead and

828
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,380
merge those two code paths and make that

829
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:13,049
a little simpler so in here if I was to

830
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:16,200
do it right it wouldn't be very

831
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:20,130
difficult I don't expect because I could

832
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:22,889
very simply just say whatever the thing

833
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:26,910
is we're actually making here right put

834
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:30,059
the result width and height and all that

835
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:33,409
right if I do this I could just say hey

836
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:38,969
we add an apron one pixel white apron

837
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:42,358
around the whole thing and then when I

838
00:43:38,969 --> 00:43:44,368
copy it in here I could I could first of

839
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:49,549
all just clear it right I could say hey

840
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:53,940
I want to clear this whole thing right

841
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:57,450
20 I could clear it and then when I

842
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:59,789
actually do my rights in here we could

843
00:43:57,449 --> 00:44:03,059
always make sure that we we leave space

844
00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:09,630
for one thing right so we actually pre

845
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:16,049
step in one and we in our desk we pre

846
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:19,039
step 1 pixel in right and think you can

847
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:20,810
see you can kind of see right the little

848
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,400
like O's

849
00:44:20,809 --> 00:44:24,829
they've got that kind of truncated at

850
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,050
the end there right and so I feel like

851
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:29,239
if we did things this way or we could

852
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:32,930
just crash that's also another good

853
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:34,339
option which you know people should you

854
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:41,859
know should be interested in all the

855
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:45,559
time uh let's see here why did we crash

856
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:52,660
result touch memory result High Times

857
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:59,929
pitch that seems fine result up memory

858
00:44:52,659 --> 00:45:09,319
moving back by one destro plus one that

859
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:11,089
seems fine just rule pretty step by what

860
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:16,730
I suppose in the case where height is

861
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:18,590
zero that might be a problem but I'm

862
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:20,389
going to go ahead and oh but it can't

863
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,400
because presumably you always have some

864
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:25,190
so I'm going to go ahead and just see

865
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:34,480
what the actual crash was let's take a

866
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:36,980
look run it brick wall stock up in free

867
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,000
wow that doesn't really tell us it just

868
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:44,269
tells us that we did have something that

869
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,570
went off but that doesn't really help us

870
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:49,730
too much so let's see I'm allocating two

871
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:51,559
extra bytes around the whole thing i'm

872
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:55,460
doing a mem set of whatever the height

873
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:58,250
is times the pitch which is what i would

874
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:00,050
expect because that's the malloc size so

875
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:02,929
i should be able to memset that size

876
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:05,360
certainly to say the very least right

877
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:08,629
the only things i changed here was that

878
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:13,010
and this right that's it I didn't do

879
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:15,200
anything else so it's got to be

880
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:19,460
something in just that pre stepping if I

881
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:23,750
pre step 1 pixel in right I should have

882
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:26,059
plenty of you know of leeway there right

883
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:28,670
that should not result in anything so it

884
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:32,179
has to be the fact that i did this

885
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:34,280
incorrectly so the fact that we're doing

886
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:37,129
we're starting with the result memory

887
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,430
and then we're pre stepping you know

888
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:45,140
skipping that first row is apparently

889
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:48,019
the problem right whatever that doing

890
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:52,039
that was not okay right because

891
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:54,650
everything else was totally fine so for

892
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:58,190
some reason if we go the height far down

893
00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:01,160
and then step to back that is apparently

894
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:04,610
not acceptable right that's like not

895
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:11,539
enough i and i'm not sure why because it

896
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:16,730
seems like ah because we are using the

897
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:25,699
wrong height there we go all good so

898
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:30,590
that should do it okay so now if I come

899
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:34,879
back here I'm hoping that we will get a

900
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:37,519
rounder oh and looks like we do have one

901
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,349
although I'm not sure if that G it we

902
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:40,519
probably should take a look at what the

903
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:42,710
glyphs actually are supposed to look

904
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:44,329
like as I don't really know whether

905
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:46,550
we're actually still truncating them a

906
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:47,960
little bit or not but I believe you can

907
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:51,260
see that o is much smoother now

908
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,599
certainly but I don't know if we might

909
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:55,840
still not quite be lining everything up

910
00:47:53,599 --> 00:48:01,009
properly but that's enough for today

911
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:04,190
that's fine and of course i would think

912
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:08,510
i'm not totally certain but i would

913
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:12,380
think that yeah we could sort of take a

914
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:14,570
look if this is ariel right we could

915
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:19,010
also take a look at like word pad or

916
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:21,140
something and just see what the oh and

917
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,500
the G are supposed to look like when

918
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:26,929
scaled up quite a bit you know in one of

919
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:30,219
these in one of these fonts right so

920
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:35,210
where is the area lat there's an aerial

921
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:38,329
so if I scale that up quite a bit that

922
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,740
doesn't look like the same font I wonder

923
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:42,110
if we're not actually getting the font

924
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:43,849
that we asked for oh that's because we

925
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:45,829
switched to Times New Roman or something

926
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:48,630
didn't we

927
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:50,849
think we actually did I'll do a double

928
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,500
check that but we weren't doing aerial

929
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:54,118
anymore something didn't we wouldn't we

930
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,050
do some weird thing where we switch to a

931
00:48:54,119 --> 00:49:00,720
different remember which one it was

932
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:07,850
rover still doing aerial courrier new is

933
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:11,009
what we did courier new so courrier new

934
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:14,789
so so that is actually the G actually

935
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:16,920
just is flat apparently so that's not

936
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:18,840
such a big deal i guess but yeah

937
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,840
eventually we should probably check that

938
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:24,930
a little more closely but that seems

939
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:30,260
that seems fine alright so let's go

940
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:33,690
ahead and go to the Q &amp; A there we go

941
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:37,340
and then tomorrow we can should be able

942
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:42,929
to extract metrics seems reasonable

943
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:45,840
seems like a reasonable thing to do if

944
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:49,339
you have questions please prefix them

945
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,340
with Q colon so I can see them

946
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:18,109
you should have passed get to c 0 to

947
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:20,599
create compatible bitmap not create

948
00:50:18,108 --> 00:50:21,798
compatible bc but that's fine you would

949
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:23,568
still have to use a different method

950
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:25,519
access quit my updated efficiently oh

951
00:50:23,568 --> 00:50:29,929
okay you're saying if we just if we

952
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:32,199
didn't care about get pixel we could

953
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:37,149
avoid having to be the creative section

954
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:40,548
oops is what you're talking about

955
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:42,318
because you just get in here if you do

956
00:50:40,548 --> 00:50:52,670
create compatible bitmap and then pass

957
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:54,170
kept TC 0 mr. muffles 869 hi there I'm

958
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:55,700
rather new to hand me hero do you ever

959
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:58,250
talk about your key bindings that help

960
00:50:55,699 --> 00:51:02,629
you navigate more easily yes you can get

961
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:04,548
that so the easiest way is probably to

962
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:06,079
go to the forums page so on handmade our

963
00:51:04,548 --> 00:51:07,730
Lord can go to the forums page and

964
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,500
that's got a bunch of stuff like this so

965
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:11,599
coding resources is where you want a

966
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:14,179
head and I'm sorry not coding her sis

967
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,278
episode guide and it's the first one

968
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:19,759
here optional editor intro basic Emacs

969
00:51:16,278 --> 00:51:22,548
tutorial this one's got a bunch of stuff

970
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:26,710
you can watch and you can watch me do it

971
00:51:22,548 --> 00:51:26,710
that sort of talks about my key bindings

972
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,389
water lineman why is arbitrary padding

973
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:39,430
required for the glyph bitmap is the

974
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:43,659
correct method used for retrieving the

975
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:46,210
actual glyphs size define arbitrary

976
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:53,949
padding what do you mean by arbitrary

977
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:57,159
padding garland Oh bloom tell us your

978
00:51:53,949 --> 00:52:02,109
NASA secrets so I don't actually know

979
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:03,849
any NASA secrets Abner cumbre actually

980
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:06,940
the moderator here knows all the NASA

981
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:11,110
secrets actually he keeps them in a

982
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:14,590
briefcase that is that is handcuffed to

983
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:16,599
his wrist and he knows martial arts so

984
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:19,240
basically the NASA secrets are

985
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:20,769
extraordinarily well safeguarded and

986
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:22,839
you're really not going to get any of

987
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:27,630
them people have tried and they have all

988
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:30,130
failed and so yeah so for as long as

989
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:31,869
Abner continues to safeguard them in

990
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:35,050
that fashion they're totally safe now if

991
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:36,969
Abner quits someday just rage quits NASA

992
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,650
and leaves the briefcase lying around

993
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:40,299
then you know the secrets will be

994
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:47,280
exposed and we'll know where the aliens

995
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:47,280
are stored at you know until then

996
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,970
water lineman arbitrary equals two extra

997
00:52:55,809 --> 00:53:00,969
for width height know so that's not

998
00:52:57,969 --> 00:53:05,049
arbitrary just to be clear that's that's

999
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:09,879
by spec so again if you go back to the

1000
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:11,589
episode guide you can look at our

1001
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,650
rendering work when we wrote the

1002
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:17,858
renderer and when we wrote the renderer

1003
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:20,829
we did some stuff in here where we were

1004
00:53:17,858 --> 00:53:23,920
talking about getting things to sample

1005
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:28,470
by linearly correctly and if you take a

1006
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:38,639
look at how we did that we did that

1007
00:53:28,469 --> 00:53:38,639
let's see here we did that somewhere

1008
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:46,030
here seamless bilinear tiling so in here

1009
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:49,750
we talked about this exact thing of

1010
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:52,150
wanting the apron and so you can see us

1011
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:55,780
talking about out here getraer and

1012
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:58,180
actually apron is very specifically to

1013
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:59,800
so have it so that we can do our

1014
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:01,960
bilinear sampling efficiently and not

1015
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:05,339
have to have a separate if statement

1016
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,338
that looks to see if we're on the border

1017
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:15,568
Amy 95 do you think that this stream got

1018
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:19,230
wasted no definitely not definitely not

1019
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:24,219
basically anytime you investigate code

1020
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:28,300
it is not wasted right because like for

1021
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:30,219
example you saw how i went about

1022
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,589
figuring out what was going on with that

1023
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:35,559
bitmap right by clearing it to a known

1024
00:54:32,588 --> 00:54:37,269
value first and then shrinking it down

1025
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:39,369
to a size where i could see what was

1026
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:41,650
happening to it that was what allowed me

1027
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:46,838
to figure out what was going on under

1028
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:49,510
the hood so I really can't stress this

1029
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:51,849
enough if you think that that is wasted

1030
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:56,050
time this is not the kind of programming

1031
00:54:51,849 --> 00:54:57,960
for you right you want to be just using

1032
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:00,970
an engine or doing something else right

1033
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,250
that is exactly the kind of coding that

1034
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:04,839
you should be very comfortable doing

1035
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:07,510
should have a lot of attack skills for

1036
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,130
it and you should be able to think of

1037
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:11,800
those things like what I did to debug

1038
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:13,360
that problem we in a black box scenario

1039
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,430
you should be able to do those things

1040
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:18,070
that's what i would want from an engine

1041
00:55:15,429 --> 00:55:19,960
programmer on my team right i don't want

1042
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:21,220
somebody who just goes oh get pixel was

1043
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,690
working in this other thing wasn't in

1044
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:24,609
them just fine to move on because that's

1045
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:26,559
how you end up not having any idea what

1046
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,700
your code is doing and you have bugs and

1047
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,529
you have people who can investigate

1048
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,179
those bugs and you have people who just

1049
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:32,860
throw minus signs into the code until it

1050
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:34,419
starts working and like that's all awful

1051
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,970
you always want to know that you

1052
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:40,920
actually knew what the problem was and

1053
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:43,929
that you're sure you actually solved it

1054
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,490
that's very important so no that's this

1055
00:55:43,929 --> 00:55:46,869
this is exactly the kind of thing that I

1056
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:49,719
want people to learn from handmade hero

1057
00:55:46,869 --> 00:55:52,539
right that is the whole point in doing

1058
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:54,750
it is for people to learn that kind of

1059
00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:54,750
skill

1060
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:32,539
no more questions if you ask me no

1061
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:44,809
questions i will tell you no lies as the

1062
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:46,250
nursery rhyme goes a better debugger

1063
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:50,480
would have led you to the solution much

1064
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:51,980
faster yes no question about that like I

1065
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,260
was just saying on the pre stream a

1066
00:56:51,980 --> 00:57:06,440
better debugger would have let me find

1067
00:56:54,260 --> 00:57:08,990
that quickly soon in 73 just to clarify

1068
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,610
it's okay to delete code that you don't

1069
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:12,349
understand and replace it with code that

1070
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:14,300
you do understand as an alternative to

1071
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:28,159
trying to understand code that you don't

1072
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:32,660
understand yeah I think so um yeah I

1073
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:35,149
mean I I guess what I would say is I

1074
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:37,519
suppose it depends on the situation but

1075
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:39,769
yes in general that sounds correct to me

1076
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:41,980
because for example like when you're

1077
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:45,320
programming the windows api it's a giant

1078
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:48,889
messy black box thing right and there's

1079
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:50,630
no real bonus to understanding parts of

1080
00:57:48,889 --> 00:57:54,949
it just to understand it because it's

1081
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:56,720
just somebody's bad code right so if you

1082
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:57,799
delete if you have some windows code

1083
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:58,789
that's doing something you have no idea

1084
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,220
what it's doing and you're like I want

1085
00:57:58,789 --> 00:58:03,170
to fix this and you want to just delete

1086
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:05,089
that code and then write some new code

1087
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:05,990
that does it in a way that you do want

1088
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,340
to make sure you get right and

1089
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:09,049
understand and then you go to plug that

1090
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:10,700
and get it working that seems totally

1091
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:13,430
fine to me right i do that kind of thing

1092
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:14,839
all the time because there's no sense

1093
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:16,339
spending a ton of time debugging code

1094
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,550
that you literally don't care about and

1095
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:21,710
don't want to run right that does seem

1096
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,120
like a waste of time but if you have

1097
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,740
code that you actually want to run

1098
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,109
that's the code you actually wanted

1099
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:28,789
that's the time when you have to go say

1100
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:31,880
let's make this work correctly and make

1101
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:33,619
sure we know what it's doing right so I

1102
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,519
feel like your statement sounds correct

1103
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:36,519
to me

1104
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:42,690
the up 511 did you turn down a twitch

1105
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:45,690
partnership yes we did turn down a

1106
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:48,030
twitch partnership because there's a

1107
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:51,150
restriction in their contract about you

1108
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:53,760
can't upload stuff to youtube for 24

1109
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:54,900
hours something like this and so I just

1110
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,960
wanted to be able to upload the things

1111
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:01,800
to you to immediately and and that was

1112
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:03,269
it so so yeah there was no hard feelings

1113
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,910
or anything twitches been really nice to

1114
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:08,250
us and you know there was not like there

1115
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:09,389
was no kind of acrimony I just looking

1116
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,949
at the contract was like yeah we did

1117
00:59:09,389 --> 00:59:13,440
this isn't really appropriate contract

1118
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:17,099
for handmade hero so we didn't sign it

1119
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:19,679
that that was it so so yeah so we love

1120
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:21,599
twitch and actually twitch does a lot of

1121
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,449
nice things for us and has been very

1122
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,589
supportive of our stream and the

1123
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:27,210
partnership isn't really a big deal for

1124
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:29,820
us anyway they're like I don't want to

1125
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:31,170
show ads on the channel anyway you know

1126
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,780
partnerships let you do stuff like that

1127
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:37,200
or whatever and so I don't have really

1128
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:42,170
you know it hasn't created a problem

1129
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:44,519
neither us nor twitch really is is is

1130
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:47,309
losing something because we didn't do it

1131
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:48,840
so it seems totally fine if that changed

1132
00:59:47,309 --> 00:59:51,029
in the future you know we'll try to fix

1133
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,559
it but but at the moment I feel like

1134
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:54,000
twitch is happy with us and we're happy

1135
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:56,969
with twitch so there really wasn't any

1136
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,559
reason to start arguing with each other

1137
00:59:56,969 --> 01:00:01,669
about some contract that neither was

1138
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,670
cared if it got signed

1139
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:11,778
have you thought about making a handmade

1140
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:14,059
asset viewer no I haven't but that

1141
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:16,548
sounds like the kind of thing that would

1142
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:20,420
be perfect homework for people on the

1143
01:00:16,548 --> 01:00:22,728
stream Carl and abloom Abner always lies

1144
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:27,528
and I always tell the truth you may ask

1145
01:00:22,728 --> 01:00:31,068
one question what I don't think that's

1146
01:00:27,528 --> 01:00:33,489
how that riddles supposed to go does the

1147
01:00:31,068 --> 01:00:39,139
better debugger exist not that I know of

1148
01:00:33,489 --> 01:00:40,249
sadly pseudonym 73 the reason why I ask

1149
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:41,958
is that I've written code that I

1150
01:00:40,248 --> 01:00:45,018
subsequently really had to write off

1151
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:47,748
yeah I mean sometimes you just go all

1152
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:49,488
right look this code is so awful I just

1153
01:00:47,748 --> 01:00:51,468
need to delete it it's not going to get

1154
01:00:49,489 --> 01:00:53,329
any better I'm never going to understand

1155
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:58,009
it it's a disaster let's start over

1156
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:59,239
that's totally fine what's important is

1157
01:00:58,009 --> 01:01:01,818
that the code you're actually going to

1158
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:11,568
keep you should understand right so

1159
01:01:01,818 --> 01:01:14,838
that's that's all soy sauce the kid I

1160
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:15,949
need my case emotes though okay so that

1161
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,088
there's some kind of thing where it

1162
01:01:15,949 --> 01:01:20,420
would have little Casey heads or

1163
01:01:17,088 --> 01:01:22,068
something um you know when the next time

1164
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:25,999
I talk to the guys at which I'll ask him

1165
01:01:22,068 --> 01:01:28,038
again you know I feel like if it was up

1166
01:01:25,998 --> 01:01:29,629
to the people who I actually talked to

1167
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:30,799
they would just get rid of that part of

1168
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:32,838
the contract and I'm a problem with it

1169
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:34,849
but you know the reality of large

1170
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:37,608
companies like twitch which is like

1171
01:01:34,849 --> 01:01:39,679
Amazon now or whatever right is that you

1172
01:01:37,608 --> 01:01:41,869
you know I mean you don't even want to

1173
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:42,949
know what the twitch rep guys would

1174
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:44,479
probably have to go through to get that

1175
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:46,459
contract range right like they probably

1176
01:01:44,478 --> 01:01:48,498
have to go through like 20 layers of

1177
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:50,928
legal people and like have lawyers site

1178
01:01:48,498 --> 01:01:52,278
right so you know I feel like if it was

1179
01:01:50,929 --> 01:01:54,139
just up to them they just feel like yeah

1180
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:55,338
no problem you can upload the thing and

1181
01:01:54,139 --> 01:01:57,318
we'll change that part of the contract

1182
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:59,119
it's great right but that's not the

1183
01:01:57,318 --> 01:02:00,978
reality at a big company and you know if

1184
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:04,189
I were them would I want to do that no

1185
01:02:00,978 --> 01:02:05,509
because just this huge big thing you

1186
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:09,618
gotta go deal with and you got enough to

1187
01:02:05,509 --> 01:02:10,880
worry about already so you know like i

1188
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:14,630
said i'd like to sign the church

1189
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,369
partnership thing so that people could

1190
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,568
have whatever it is that that gives you

1191
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:19,050
i don't know what it gives people on the

1192
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:21,389
stream but whatever it gives you you can

1193
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:22,650
it uh but I just it's just not worth it

1194
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:25,529
it's not gonna be worth it for them to

1195
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:27,119
fix it I don't think either and and for

1196
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:28,590
us where we're doing an educational

1197
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,809
stream being able to upload a YouTube

1198
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:33,769
immediately is is really important so I

1199
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:33,769
felt like that was the priority

1200
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:43,469
adner coin Bray question were out of

1201
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:47,220
questions but you made my life difficult

1202
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:51,209
tonight XD you know I'm under NDA's like

1203
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:53,609
you you know how it is bro yes I'm sorry

1204
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:56,250
I I didn't mean to create problems for

1205
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:58,620
you Abner I was just teasing I was

1206
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:01,230
trying to sort of mock the people who

1207
01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:03,210
are asking you NASA questions as if you

1208
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:07,920
can just tell them NASA secrets that no

1209
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:10,889
one can know I guess maybe my sarcasm

1210
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,980
was a little bit too much I think it

1211
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:15,629
hopefully should go without saying that

1212
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:18,150
Abner is happy to talk about NASA with

1213
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:20,430
people as far as it's possible for him

1214
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:23,490
to talk about NASA with people but if

1215
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:25,500
nASA has something that's classified he

1216
01:03:23,489 --> 01:03:28,679
can't talk about it he'd get fired or

1217
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:34,199
worse so don't try to make him talk

1218
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:36,029
about stuff did he can't talk about yeah

1219
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:39,589
NDA's are awful but that's just how they

1220
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:47,070
work right and that's how business goes

1221
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:48,780
everyone does it the chat wants you to

1222
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:55,260
play the Vista video again all right

1223
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:56,910
we'll do that when I sign off DGM TV

1224
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,120
should I stop using templates for my

1225
01:03:56,909 --> 01:04:03,000
containers and adopt void star forever

1226
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,829
so I talked about this a little bit on

1227
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,289
previous streams but I'll just you know

1228
01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:10,259
full disclosure at Molly rocket for our

1229
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:12,719
engine oil containers are meta meta

1230
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:14,160
generated so we have our own is

1231
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:15,599
essentially our own programming language

1232
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:18,149
and all containers go through that

1233
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,589
programming language there's there's no

1234
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:23,670
void star there's no templates or some

1235
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:25,140
of that so if you want my real answer

1236
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:26,970
you got a meta program if you want

1237
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:28,710
containers you met a program don't waste

1238
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:30,289
time with templates their garbage don't

1239
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:34,050
waste time with void star it's garbage

1240
01:04:30,289 --> 01:04:36,599
meta program for something like handmade

1241
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:38,670
hero where I'm kind of trying to show

1242
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:40,289
old-school techniques when I have to

1243
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,090
choose between one of the other I would

1244
01:04:40,289 --> 01:04:43,440
definitely go void star but most the

1245
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:44,820
time I handmade here as you can see we

1246
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,349
can get away without really having to do

1247
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:48,269
it we can get away by just writing

1248
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:50,519
something that's purpose-built for that

1249
01:04:48,269 --> 01:04:51,869
area and by keeping the number of moving

1250
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,650
parts like that relatively low we don't

1251
01:04:51,869 --> 01:04:56,818
have to

1252
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:58,769
on a container thing too hard but yeah

1253
01:04:56,818 --> 01:05:00,420
that's definitely like the next level

1254
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:02,068
after handmade hero which is like

1255
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:04,980
handmade heroes your core competency you

1256
01:05:02,068 --> 01:05:06,808
should be able to program like this add

1257
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:09,630
a drop of a hat you should be able to do

1258
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:10,980
it right level up from that core

1259
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:12,568
competency as metaprogramming so

1260
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:16,528
everything after that all of the things

1261
01:05:12,568 --> 01:05:18,719
that are problematic right that you're

1262
01:05:16,528 --> 01:05:22,318
you're doing coding by hand c++ won't

1263
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:25,199
help you C++ is always bad so you don't

1264
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:27,538
go C++ you go am in a programming or

1265
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:29,009
maybe like John global save you with j

1266
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:32,339
ai and you won't have to ever go

1267
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:35,819
metaprogramming I don't know but at

1268
01:05:32,338 --> 01:05:38,639
least until ji is released you got to go

1269
01:05:35,818 --> 01:05:40,969
metaprogramming that's just that's just

1270
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:40,969
my opinion

1271
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:07,019
all good all right maybe it's time time

1272
01:06:04,889 --> 01:06:12,409
for some Microsoft Vista videos all

1273
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:12,409

source code and you can play around with

1282
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:36,989
