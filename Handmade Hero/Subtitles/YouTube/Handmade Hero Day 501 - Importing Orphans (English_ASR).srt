1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,448
hello everyone and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,080
here oh sure we code a complete game

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:09,599
live on stream we are going to continue

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,280
playing around with what we've got now

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,370
there's just a it's kind of a wide-open

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,289
field there's tons of things to do and

7
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:20,038
so we're gonna do them I mean that's

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,410
just how it goes right so at the end of

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,840
the previous stream I if you were here

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,050
for that this morning we actually were

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,929
fixing some camera stuff and so in here

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,719
you can kind of see that we've now got

13
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:36,960
it so that the camera is nice and smooth

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,340
but we've got you know we we had a list

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,350
of camera bugs do you want to solve and

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,940
that was just one of them so you see

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,489
another one is correctly computing the

18
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,079
lighting area because we kind of we I

19
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,269
guess had some kind of hack in there

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,460
beforehand so that if you change like

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,520
the camera angles and stuff it will no

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,469
longer compute the correct area for that

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,090
and so we want to do something clean for

24
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,320
that and then we had a whole bunch of

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,149
other things too like we wanted the

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,189
rooms bigger rooms we want them to

27
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,650
scroll so like a room like this we

28
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:06,780
wanted to like scroll along with the

29
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,150
player so that's why it doesn't zoom out

30
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,030
as far as it probably should in that

31
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,549
case so because we wanted to scroll back

32
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,780
and forth and so if we're just looking

33
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,130
at these are things I'd like to get

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,228
those in there the other thing that I

35
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:23,519
would like to do is I'd like to get our

36
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:25,590
hero back in here like we've got our

37
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,908
little cats in there now and they're

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,700
using the correct art and I'd like to

39
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:34,740
get the hero in there as well and so I I

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:42,810
do want to think about that problem a

41
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:45,839
little bit more and so if if it's sort

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,939
of toss-up I'd like to put the hero back

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,350
in and so I'm thinking maybe that's what

44
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,139
we'll do like maybe we'll throw the hero

45
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:55,739
back in there first and get sort of that

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,090
stuff going because we really haven't we

47
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,509
haven't done the work to make to make

48
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,368
that happen uh so yeah let's do that and

49
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:07,319
the camera let's just focus on that and

50
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:10,409
get in it getting it going what I did

51
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,789
was I asked Anna to change the way that

52
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,479
the files were laid out for us just like

53
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:18,459
I said

54
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:21,310
and so if you go now to where's the

55
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,420
desktop there's if you go to your if

56
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,539
you're someone who pre-ordered the game

57
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:28,030
and you are on the you have your send

58
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:30,429
I'll download there's a new art pack art

59
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,769
pack too and you can see that like in

60
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,810
here there's bodies and heads now so now

61
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:37,150
like just like we said we wanted to now

62
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,330
there's just bodies and there's heads

63
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,959
and those are separate right so there's

64
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,069
now like no you know you you're gonna

65
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,459
think of those with totally different

66
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:47,530
things

67
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,329
and I know it's a little bit weird in

68
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,640
the human world because like if you look

69
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:54,549
there's like even different skin tones

70
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,018
on these now so you know like some

71
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,280
people have dark darker skins some

72
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:00,159
people have lighter skins feel have it

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,469
in between one of these is a baby

74
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,389
whatever but I mean it's a multicultural

75
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:06,189
world at this point so as far as I'm

76
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:07,869
concerned on handmade here you can put

77
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:10,479
any head on anybody that's just how it's

78
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,519
gonna go so like you know it doesn't

79
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,399
matter I'm not gonna say that you have

80
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,319
to have the right head on the right body

81
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,930
you can just have the head as the

82
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:21,339
character and the body is just whichever

83
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,950
one you happen to be in at the time it's

84
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,329
fine right so that's the way I wanted to

85
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:29,709
do it because I wanted those to be more

86
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:34,239
mix-and-match and and so that's what

87
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:37,120
we're gonna do so on here we we can

88
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,450
replace those ones that were welded

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,480
right the ones from before we can

90
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:44,589
replace those with the new files and so

91
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:47,048
they don't have to be sitting here in

92
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,590
pending anymore right so we can just

93
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:53,439
delete all these and take these ones

94
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:58,209
from the new art pack and we can drop

95
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:00,280
those directly in here right before I do

96
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:05,409
that though I kind of want to look at

97
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,789
these tags and just try to name them up

98
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:09,759
because you know how we've got these

99
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:11,469
like different tags that we're using

100
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,729
identify these things I want to be able

101
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:20,319
to identify all of these like orphans

102
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:23,589
and stuff by their traits the bodies

103
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,839
anyway the heads can just be arbitrary

104
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:26,949
right the heads are just like characters

105
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,859
so it's like you know

106
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,699
that's Ralph and that's you know Lisa or

107
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,610
something right

108
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:36,939
we'll have specific characters that go

109
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:39,370
with the head but the body is always

110
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:42,519
just you know kind of whatever the body

111
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,079
is and that's I don't know don't ask me

112
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,049
why that's just how we do it I mean

113
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,339
they're limbless orphans right it's a

114
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,770
that's maybe that's just how they are in

115
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:52,539
this fantasy world they don't have arms

116
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:55,299
and legs but they do have the ability to

117
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,280
have any body on any head that they want

118
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,870
because I mean that's how the world

119
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:04,019
works it's fine don't overthink it

120
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,610
someday in the real world with science

121
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:08,109
you'll be able to do that too you'll be

122
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,879
able to have your head moved on to a

123
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,770
different body and you it will be

124
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,209
arbitrary it won't have to look anything

125
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:16,149
like your head it doesn't have to look

126
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:18,009
the same like it has the same genetics

127
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,929
it can just be like yep we took this

128
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,670
head off of here and we stuck it on this

129
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,199
other body and now you have the other

130
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,819
body right who knows it could happen um

131
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,800
so I want to go ahead and label at least

132
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:32,829
the body parts I'm not sure how we want

133
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,629
to label the head parts per se because

134
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:36,909
you know I think we may just want to tag

135
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:39,100
them with their actual names you know

136
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:44,800
what I mean so we'll have to name each

137
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:46,750
of these each of these characters some

138
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:52,720
you know we'll have to name them

139
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:53,949
something right so we'll do that after

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,150
we do this because this one's a little

141
00:05:53,949 --> 00:06:01,659
more straightforward so this one here is

142
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:04,839
the the standard hero body and so it's

143
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,689
gonna be like maybe just the the default

144
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:10,239
I guess is what I'd say like it it maybe

145
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:14,139
doesn't have a some watch tell me why I

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,040
can't hit the f2 key what's going on

147
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,759
with that Oh cuz I've been the zip file

148
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,450
sorry about that

149
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,969
I didn't mean to be in the zip file I

150
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:27,969
was supposed to unpack that I got

151
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,820
carried away I'm sorry I didn't mean to

152
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,260
get carried away like that so and I

153
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,939
didn't I started talking about what

154
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:39,610
we're gonna do and I didn't unpack it

155
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:44,079
let's unpack it into there there we go

156
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:45,389
and now we're good okay so I'm gonna go

157
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,438
ahead and turn on the preview here

158
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,590
there's like some kind of preview pane

159
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:54,280
nonsense right usually sometimes

160
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:56,829
possibly there it is preview pane and so

161
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:00,179
if we drag this over so we can kind of

162
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:02,378
see roughly here we're talking about

163
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,050
each of these kind of has some

164
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,669
properties associated with it

165
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,370
potentially right and so I'm gonna name

166
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:12,218
them like along with you know the the

167
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,168
properties that they have so the idea

168
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:15,819
behind this character originally was she

169
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:18,490
was going to be a little bit of like a

170
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:21,039
green thumb so she has like gardening

171
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:24,329
you know experience so this is this is

172
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,740
like an extra earth bonus in a sense

173
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:28,930
when you're playing this character and

174
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,829
so this would be like a like a earth

175
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,418
body I guess is what I'd call it the

176
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:36,459
Cure was sort of like it's the default

177
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:41,528
body I mean there isn't really anything

178
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:44,318
specific about it but I suppose like you

179
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:45,459
know body hero I don't know if I want to

180
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,778
leave the hero one in there because

181
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:49,658
maybe there is something special about

182
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:52,389
that I'm not entirely sure how we want

183
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:56,829
to look at that so we'll leave that up

184
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:59,680
so this character was like a tailor like

185
00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:02,109
so this one has the ability like for

186
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,699
crafting you know what I mean would get

187
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:09,669
a bonus or anything that was along those

188
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:12,158
lines so you'd have like bonus for Earth

189
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:18,639
a bonus for crafting there this one

190
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:20,800
would is cooking bonus for cooking and I

191
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,978
guess I don't know about crafting suited

192
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,139
cuz its clothes clothing specifically so

193
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:30,818
it's like it's like tailoring you know I

194
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,120
don't know what you would really call

195
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:33,120
that

196
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:47,750
maybe like that yeah something like that

197
00:08:47,759 --> 00:09:01,740
this one was like good with animals I

198
00:08:50,759 --> 00:09:05,539
think this one was trying to remember

199
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:11,250
what these all worst that was sports

200
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:17,039
this one might be wintry the baby so

201
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:21,149
yeah I think this one was like this one

202
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:25,909
was sort of like more gothy like so a

203
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:25,909
little bit more so what I'm looking for

204
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,159
had like more like necromancy like sort

205
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,438
of sort of vibes you know what I mean

206
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:39,059
like a little bit more able to deal with

207
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:43,129
like nature I'm an undead stuff and so I

208
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:43,128
don't know what we would call that but

209
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,860
something like that

210
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:58,739
this was sports and trying to remember

211
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:03,448
like just in terms of the naming here so

212
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:10,019
I think it would be more like maybe more

213
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:12,179
like strength this one would be like

214
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:17,009
warmth right so this one is like

215
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:23,159
suitable for for cold climates so

216
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:25,860
insulated I guess I don't remember if

217
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,519
there's anything specific about this one

218
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,720
[Music]

219
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,720
don't really have a plan for that one

220
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:42,090
maybe I'll call these maybe I'll call

221
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:44,879
these ones like instead of insulated

222
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:48,870
I'll call them the season so we'll say

223
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:52,590
like winter there's like the winter one

224
00:10:48,870 --> 00:11:01,110
there's the there's kind of a fall

225
00:10:52,590 --> 00:11:11,280
looking one will call that fall do we

226
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:20,220
have a spring that seems spring-like to

227
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:26,669
me so I don't know what any of these

228
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:28,680
would have had specifically so maybe

229
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:33,839
since this one was generally a little

230
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:36,389
larger we'll call that like you know

231
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,860
resistance like it can it's it's not

232
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:42,299
really I guess it's not strength it's

233
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:53,639
more like taking more damage so it's

234
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:55,559
it's kind of like tanky you know and I

235
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,990
guess it's hard to say you know is that

236
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,979
the more wintery one or is that I think

237
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,750
that is in a sense and maybe that's

238
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,220
maybe that's more like spring and summer

239
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,379
kinds of stuff I don't know

240
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:14,970
let me see so what was the fall one

241
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:21,289
maybe we'll call that spring well so

242
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:26,720
this will be summer this will be spring

243
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:26,719
and this will be fall

244
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:48,400
so this one is the baby bottom and I'm

245
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:51,309
not sure what to make of the baby other

246
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,059
things of the babies awesome so you know

247
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:56,559
the baby we could have kept the baby as

248
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:58,269
two pieces but I think it would be even

249
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:03,879
funnier for some reason the baby can

250
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:06,759
have different bodies I think that it's

251
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:07,929
ridiculous but it's still probably good

252
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:13,539
ridiculous

253
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:15,489
I'm guessing and so yeah I don't know so

254
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:18,399
I guess what I would say is we need some

255
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,470
for these and these are kind of just

256
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,959
like generic like these two just look

257
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:30,430
like any any person to me right they

258
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:34,030
don't have any clear they don't have any

259
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:36,129
clear like suggestion of something that

260
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,250
they would be different you know in some

261
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:41,049
way and the baby unfortunately I would

262
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,950
say the same thing I mean it's a baby

263
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:48,069
but it's just generic baby so it's not

264
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:57,730
like it would really have any particular

265
00:13:48,070 --> 00:14:01,200
thing about it otherwise so I'm not sure

266
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,340
so I might just call this one baby and

267
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,190
we'll think about what we do with it

268
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:08,830
later and then for these two I'm gonna

269
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:11,320
say like maybe them and the hero

270
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,780
maybe these are sort of just a couple

271
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,890
default bodies you can use and they

272
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:22,350
don't have any particular thing

273
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:22,350
associated with them you know tags wise

274
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,930
I guess that's what I could say so

275
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:46,860
that's one way I could do it the other

276
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:49,229
way I could do it is now I think that's

277
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,500
the way I want to do it I think that's

278
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:55,649
the way I want to do it and so with

279
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,509
these ones and the Kiro the problem is

280
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:02,159
they're just like I said kind of generic

281
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:08,250
like they don't they don't look like

282
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:09,659
they suggest anything and so in terms of

283
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,909
what the difference between them is

284
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:16,379
they're kind of just variants on the

285
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:20,159
same on just like it's a body right and

286
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:23,419
it could be anybody's and so I don't

287
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:27,480
know what to do to differentiate those

288
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:31,379
you know default0 default one and

289
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:35,029
default two seems like a bad idea but

290
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:40,759
that's kind of what they look like to me

291
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:40,759
and so maybe we'll just call those like

292
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,750
what are some things I would want to

293
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:56,750
have that are just like

294
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:11,578
look maybe one of them's like has more

295
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:12,928
health and one of them has like more

296
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:14,548
speed or something like so we'll just

297
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:16,678
say that that's how they work and they

298
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:19,108
don't necessarily you know line up with

299
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:20,850
that visually in some specific way

300
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:23,910
because who knows why you wouldn't

301
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,220
necessarily have that I mean people

302
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:30,208
don't look different when they have more

303
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:33,119
stamina in any particular way so who

304
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:41,599
knows so you know maybe this is just

305
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:44,040
like I'm just kind of making that up and

306
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,798
it's probably not great to have those

307
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:48,688
being things that are just like

308
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:51,119
arbitrary because you'd like the visuals

309
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:53,068
to like back that up but maybe we can

310
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:54,899
like redraw these slightly so that it's

311
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:57,659
like like maybe there's a lightning bolt

312
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:02,009
on it or something right and maybe like

313
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:05,220
for for the hero there's some difference

314
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,720
here like yeah I don't know and for the

315
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,519
health when maybe there's some reason

316
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,139
why this would be good maybe it's like a

317
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,778
medic kind of a looking thing or I don't

318
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:14,668
know right so we could like update some

319
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:16,288
of these a little bit in the future to

320
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:19,380
make them go better with whatever that

321
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:21,449
is and then we're just really left with

322
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:29,880
the hero who it's like I don't know you

323
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:31,679
know like I'm not sure I'm not sure what

324
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,919
there is about that it's just default

325
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,919
really

326
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,210
yeah so we already had a thing here

327
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:04,329
which was dark so I think maybe that

328
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:08,710
would go on here

329
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:11,710
as well so that's going to unify these

330
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,029
tags a little it for once we don't have

331
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:17,620
very many tags yet so I'm just gonna

332
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:19,029
kind of like get those in there if

333
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:21,489
there's anything actually lined up but

334
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:24,609
there really aren't because there aren't

335
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:27,250
very many right but just to the extent

336
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:29,399
that there would be um so in addition

337
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:33,880
here since these are all bodies of

338
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:37,660
humans you know I'm also gonna put in an

339
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,360
orphan tag they're probably just so we

340
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:44,519
can select specifically orphans versus

341
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,519
monsters versus whatever you know

342
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,819
and this may be dumb what I'm doing

343
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,370
because you know we have a lot more

344
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:06,089
editing features now and so it may be

345
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:12,000
that doing this stuff doing this markup

346
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:14,069
in in like the in the files is stupid

347
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,950
now and we could just do it inside an

348
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:24,119
editor in the game oops didn't want to

349
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:27,569
do that and I you know I'm just gonna

350
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:35,669
plow forward with how we're doing it for

351
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:39,000
the time being but we can always we can

352
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:46,230
always change that later right so if

353
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,420
those are all the bodies right then what

354
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:53,940
we need is like heads for orphans and so

355
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:55,140
like all of these here again we have

356
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,230
kind of have the problem of the hero

357
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:01,440
which is not really a label I'm I don't

358
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:06,240
know what the I guess we'll leave it as

359
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:09,600
hero for now but now we can label these

360
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,339
in some other way I suppose where like

361
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,000
they just have names because the heads I

362
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:18,709
guess will be specific so like whatever

363
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,710
you see that head it is that character

364
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,029
in a sense we don't really need the

365
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:28,009
orphan tag on it at all because the

366
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:28,009
character would uniquely identify it but

367
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:37,859
you know we'll see so I don't know what

368
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:41,690
I want to name these characters but I'm

369
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:41,689
just gonna make it up as I go along so

370
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:54,390
I'm gonna go with lease on that one I'm

371
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:57,860
just say that that's gonna be like maybe

372
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,860
that's like Brad

373
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:07,069
um I can't really see these very well

374
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:10,189
because they're little too tiny I get

375
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:13,069
there um I'm gonna

376
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:26,840
how about Carla I like Carla for that

377
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:35,359
maybe and maybe I could see that being

378
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:36,798
like a Jenni that's gonna be you know

379
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,418
some of these names I'm kind of just

380
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:42,129
picking generic names here I wonder if

381
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:42,130
that's too boring

382
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:17,379
is so cute is I feel like Drew might be

383
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:17,378
good

384
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:52,849
maybe

385
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:05,890
I'd like to put a Lambert in here just

386
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:10,389
not sure who the Lambert should be and

387
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:17,890
I'm saying to you maybe maybe that's

388
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:21,190
actually amber so I do think these were

389
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:25,800
a little bit too maybe maybe that's

390
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:30,450
actually like that's actually like

391
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:30,450
Cassidy is that a name

392
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:45,259
that's funny

393
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:49,850
it's this is actually someone's stage

394
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:51,259
name I guess or something like and it's

395
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:52,519
telling me their actual name it's the

396
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:59,319
hip hop artist that is funny

397
00:23:52,519 --> 00:24:02,629
no I wanted this yeah curly-haired well

398
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:06,099
I don't know the hair's not that curly

399
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,100
but oh well

400
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:22,788
so let's see we're back to this this

401
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:22,788
saucy gentleman here

402
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:34,048
maybe that's wrong

403
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:45,329
maybe that's like weird

404
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:56,069
I could see like is Laird a good name

405
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,839
these baby-naming sites are kind of

406
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,839
crazy

407
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:24,260
this is not helpful Lord of the land

408
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,750
seems fine to me

409
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,340
none of these are orphans so technically

410
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,470
none of them is the Lord of the land but

411
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:39,929
I mean this one doesn't have curly hair

412
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:49,289
either so you know the naming can't

413
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:54,480
always be so accurate I think that one

414
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:56,430
was like the Christian Slater orphan so

415
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,559
I think maybe we'll we'll have to call

416
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,950
him something related like let's call

417
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,950
him Slade

418
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:20,610
I feel like that's like a Rhoda is it

419
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:23,490
that way is that a name I don't really

420
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:24,750
love boring names so I kind of like was

421
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:31,890
trying to give them generic names and it

422
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:34,019
just didn't work so yeah I mean well you

423
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,550
know there's a TV series with someone

424
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:40,230
named Anna which you know I've never

425
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:42,990
seen but it's seems plausible that it's

426
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:46,460
a name they thought it was because they

427
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,460
named a character that so why can't I

428
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:57,889
that's the baby

429
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:33,379
that's that's gonna be that's gonna be

430
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:52,220
Giles that's gonna be these two are

431
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:54,880
gonna be the hardest how about her I'm

432
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,880
not sure

433
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:24,970
you know I could see the speaking of

434
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:29,179
Dylan actually maybe this is so I know

435
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:38,809
Aviva is a name but is Viva

436
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:46,759
a name yeah so I think that's Viva and

437
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:52,450
this is gonna be like it's gonna be Tony

438
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:59,629
I think honestly it might be Tony well

439
00:28:52,450 --> 00:29:03,279
it could be Anthony so we're down the

440
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,280
last one here it's a tough call

441
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:14,769
I'm sorry I don't know I really don't

442
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:14,769
know

443
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:31,769
Gordon Tony I'm just not getting a lot

444
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,769
of great name vibes from this guy

445
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:42,580
how about Klein so the only problem

446
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,049
we've got now I'm pretty happy with the

447
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:49,149
rest of those names those are all pretty

448
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:51,129
good Lisa's not doing it for me though

449
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:56,019
at this point so I'm thinking maybe we

450
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:58,660
need something a little fancier here she

451
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:00,609
have there her hair maybe Asian styled

452
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:04,300
like you know she's got like a pulled

453
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:08,819
back into a tight bun so maybe we could

454
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:08,819
give her more like an Asian name like

455
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:24,940
right yeah maybe maybe you like sunny

456
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:30,570
yeah maybe something like that I could

457
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:30,570
give her an actual mitt Asian first name

458
00:30:35,778 --> 00:30:39,769
I probably wouldn't be able to say it

459
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:41,599
right though I guess I could say it

460
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:42,919
right if it was Japanese I wouldn't be

461
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:47,089
able to say right who's Chinese or

462
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:50,330
Korean I don't not a pronounced most

463
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:52,668
other Asian languages or Vietnamese or

464
00:30:50,329 --> 00:31:01,519
any anything really pretty much only

465
00:30:52,669 --> 00:31:02,528
know how to pronounce Japanese yeah I'm

466
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,000
gonna stick with sunny

467
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:07,548
alright so I think that's all our

468
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,200
orphans for now you can always add more

469
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:15,079
orphans that's and that's true of any

470
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:16,970
game or any work of any kind really so I

471
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:18,230
want to go ahead and import those in and

472
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,778
they're they're pretty straightforward

473
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:25,639
because we already have the tags set up

474
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:28,128
for importing these just in general so I

475
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:30,619
should be able to like copy the body and

476
00:31:28,128 --> 00:31:32,449
head stuff I should be able to use the

477
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:35,028
top half of character in the bottom half

478
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:38,120
of character as the import rules for

479
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:41,509
those so we really shouldn't have to do

480
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:43,250
anything special there right so what I

481
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:46,308
should be able to do is I should be able

482
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,259
to go edit the tags and just add in the

483
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:51,168
tags in this case that we need that are

484
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:53,839
new so the ones that come from you know

485
00:31:51,169 --> 00:32:00,649
the rest of this stuff so we would have

486
00:31:53,839 --> 00:32:11,319
a tag baby a tag cook a tag dark where

487
00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:15,038
it exists earth tag fall tag health hero

488
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:15,038
it's already attack here

489
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:27,700
I'm major tech speed and you know nature

490
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:49,259
might be the wrong way to do it so let's

491
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:57,460
call it fauna tag spring spring summer

492
00:32:49,259 --> 00:33:01,869
Taylor tank and winter and we also need

493
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:05,650
tag orphan that's just a separate thing

494
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:07,539
that's gonna get shoved in there now you

495
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,560
can already kind of see like we're so

496
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:10,420
one of the things we're gonna have to do

497
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,429
soon as we pull all this stuff in the

498
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,650
game we'll have to finally go really do

499
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:16,120
a final tag matcher because you don't

500
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,100
want to be doing these the way that we

501
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:20,469
were doing them anymore because you can

502
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:22,809
kind of see how huge these vectors would

503
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:24,009
be if we were doing them non sparse so

504
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:25,929
it's just dumb the way they're being

505
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:27,579
done currently but you know again

506
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:30,250
computers are so fast these days that

507
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:32,139
sometimes it takes up you have to get

508
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,329
pretty far down the line before it

509
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,430
actually starts getting slow and so just

510
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:42,220
take my word for it it will be slow it's

511
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:43,600
just hasn't quite hit there yet right so

512
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,450
in here too

513
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:51,369
we've got like the I think we've already

514
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:54,009
got in the assets themselves we already

515
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:55,089
have like bodies and heads right so we

516
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:57,000
don't actually need to make that

517
00:33:55,089 --> 00:34:01,569
distinction that's already in there so

518
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,480
in here we have the heads so we just

519
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:06,519
need all these we've got tagged baby

520
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,280
and so tagged baby and tagged hero

521
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:11,530
should really probably be specific

522
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,750
because they're actual characters and

523
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:16,470
then we just go through this we've got

524
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,469
you know Brom

525
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:29,149
we've got Carla we've got Cassidy we've

526
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:39,969
got through Dylan

527
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:55,429
Giles hero put it there Clym Baird

528
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:58,808
Lambert rota suede it's actually I think

529
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,809
supposed to be sunny with a you right

530
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:22,400
yeah and so we've got our you know we've

531
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,380
got our named characters in here so

532
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,048
that's all good and then we need inside

533
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,220
of our tag sets to be able to get all

534
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:32,869
these in there right cuz they're all new

535
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:44,988
here's where macros would be helpful

536
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:46,278
Allen now it's probably busy this is

537
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:49,970
where you would want a keyboard macro

538
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:52,190
cuz this hold you know well what you

539
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:54,108
want is not a keyboard macro obviously

540
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,659
what you want is a programming language

541
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:57,798
with introspection because then you

542
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,518
don't have to do this typing in the

543
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:04,838
first place

544
00:35:58,518 --> 00:36:04,838
but hey beggars can't be choosers right

545
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:36,088
all right and last set and the reason

546
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:37,828
you want to inspect adjust case anyone

547
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:39,509
couldn't already tell is that you want

548
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:43,170
to be able to talk about things in code

549
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:47,400
very easily and things that come from

550
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:49,079
outside the code itself have to have

551
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,729
ways of corresponding to things that

552
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,410
happen inside the code and the only way

553
00:36:50,728 --> 00:36:55,048
to usually do that is with some kind of

554
00:36:52,409 --> 00:37:00,688
string and so if you want to get some

555
00:36:55,048 --> 00:37:03,929
some type checking you know you need to

556
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:05,548
define those somewhere and otherwise you

557
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:09,208
won't get any type checking you know

558
00:37:05,548 --> 00:37:11,969
what I mean and so doing that in C is

559
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:15,659
just and C++ is horrible because they

560
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:17,909
never added any compile time code

561
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:20,428
execution they never added meta

562
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:22,558
programming of any real kind they never

563
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:24,568
added introspection and it's just a

564
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,039
disaster and I think they've got a

565
00:37:24,568 --> 00:37:28,349
working group working on it now but

566
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:29,880
thirty years is too late it's just too

567
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:31,949
late that should have been in their day

568
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,028
too I mean it's a basic feature of

569
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:37,979
programming languages in my opinion and

570
00:37:36,028 --> 00:37:40,219
I just I have no idea why it was not in

571
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:40,218
there

572
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:55,079
so now we just have that set of tags

573
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:58,679
available and we can import the bodies

574
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:02,220
and the heads in there so I'm gonna go

575
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:05,578
ahead and set that up you can see here

576
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:09,029
we've got you know the import stuff

577
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:11,250
that's going to come in here and one of

578
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:14,220
the things that we've got is an import

579
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,170
type that says like you know are you

580
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:22,919
what are you loading like a body a head

581
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:27,300
or whatever right and so where that ends

582
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:31,730
up being there it is so in here you can

583
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:36,200
see like we have the character sheet and

584
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:39,240
we want to have two ways of doing that

585
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:41,460
we want one to be if you're actually

586
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,259
processing the whole character and then

587
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:47,880
we also want you to be able to put in a

588
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:50,430
head or a body separately right so we

589
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:57,079
want you to be able to do both of these

590
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:57,078
and this is still the correct iteration

591
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:08,579
but you know it's we it's it's the

592
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:10,799
correct inner peace but the outer peace

593
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:13,220
we only want to do like directly one of

594
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:21,599
you know what I mean

595
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:24,899
so this we want to share and you know

596
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:29,910
the Y index mod for part here like just

597
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:34,680
kind of still works in either case so I

598
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:38,129
believe what we want to do is just in

599
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:40,879
this part here say like this is a head

600
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,880
and you know

601
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:56,199
you know what I mean now actually this

602
00:39:53,858 --> 00:40:01,170
is backwards that's how that actually

603
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:06,369
goes and so then in these we want to do

604
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:11,259
the same and so now we just have to like

605
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:25,449
extract this piece out of you know of

606
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:28,920
the the import grid I think that's

607
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:28,920
basically what we do

608
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:34,150
[Music]

609
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:53,050
something like that I mean another way

610
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:55,469
to do that would be since the tag stuff

611
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:58,269
is never really discussed anywhere else

612
00:40:55,469 --> 00:41:05,639
you probably actually do it more like

613
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:05,639
this right

614
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:27,030
I think that just works so if I was

615
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:30,650
going to pull that out then all I really

616
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:37,860
need to do is copy this stuff

617
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:48,150
this becomes import body what's that

618
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:54,360
called again a tag court grid tag so in

619
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:57,000
here we just say import body and we need

620
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:00,780
all the things that we have here so we

621
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:08,070
would need game assets we need the X

622
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:11,120
index and the why index we need file

623
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,120
name and errors

624
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:31,818
and I'm not sure we really need anything

625
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:34,088
else I'm pretty sure that's all done at

626
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:34,088
that point

627
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:50,079
so I'm gonna say that just works and

628
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,789
then here this can just do an import

629
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,219
body or an import head depending on

630
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:56,230
which one you actually we're in and then

631
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:58,839
up here we'll say that there's another

632
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:05,260
one of those that is internal report

633
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:10,090
grid tag for the head like so and we say

634
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:10,990
import head game assets asset I'm get

635
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:16,019
the file name

636
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:25,899
there's mix index and the wine index

637
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:29,849
right I'm not gonna think too hard about

638
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,849
that I'm just gonna say that's fine

639
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:39,910
there's other ways we could do that that

640
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:46,869
may be better or clever or but I'm not

641
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:49,139
gonna care about that and in here I'm

642
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:51,940
gonna take the liberty of subtracting

643
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:56,409
3/4 or rather away from this so that

644
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:58,570
those actually start at 0 it will matter

645
00:43:56,409 --> 00:44:01,750
because this code actually mods by for

646
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:04,000
anyway so but just in case we start

647
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:09,369
looking at the value directly that way

648
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,650
these will always have the same X&amp;Y

649
00:44:09,369 --> 00:44:13,690
indexes regardless of whether they came

650
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:17,590
from a head only body only or combined

651
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:19,329
file they'll still work right and so

652
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:21,100
then I also now want to trigger the

653
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:23,049
import so I want to say here look it's

654
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:25,329
you know it's a multi tile import in

655
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:28,840
either of these cases whether it's head

656
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:32,139
or body or anything else and I think

657
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:34,740
that's it so now those should like pull

658
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:39,339
in you know I

659
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:41,729
who knows if they will or not we haven't

660
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:45,460
really pounded on this code path much

661
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:50,349
but basically that's the long short of

662
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:53,829
it um so in here I'm gonna say let's go

663
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:57,219
ahead and do the results that we you

664
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:57,699
know will generate it here that brings

665
00:44:57,219 --> 00:45:02,319
gives us

666
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:03,939
back to the import grid tag thing and we

667
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:09,390
should be I guess I gotta do the same

668
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:09,389
here we should be good to go with that

669
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:26,519
and then hopefully that'll get pulled

670
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:33,150
into the HHA so that now we'll have

671
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:35,820
those available and you know who knows

672
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:39,269
if it'll work

673
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:41,640
but in theory it should so you know we

674
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:45,300
got the game here and we say like okay

675
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:47,190
why don't you do an import and we'll let

676
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,730
that go we don't have a progress bar yet

677
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:53,099
sadly but you know now it's just gonna

678
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:56,539
go through and glued all that junk in

679
00:45:53,099 --> 00:46:01,849
and parse all those things so now it has

680
00:45:56,539 --> 00:46:05,460
theoretically it has so now our HHH HHH

681
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:07,110
have that which means that if we want to

682
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:11,070
now we should be able to actually access

683
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:13,710
those things and again don't know if

684
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:15,990
that's actually true because we have

685
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:21,690
really not played with this kind of code

686
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:25,108
much yet but we can certainly try so if

687
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:28,710
we now go to like where we create like a

688
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:30,869
hero or something and we want to see if

689
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:34,139
we can actually get you know a body in

690
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:36,660
there I don't want a shadow at the

691
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:39,629
moment so I'm not gonna put that in

692
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:46,039
there and we're kind of look mostly at

693
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:52,490
this there's not gonna be a cape anymore

694
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:54,719
there's just gonna be the hero and I

695
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:58,169
don't I mean I think I'll leave it like

696
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,118
that temporarily I don't know I'm not

697
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,329
you know what I'm really not gonna do

698
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:04,950
that

699
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:06,989
I'm just gonna do this for now and say

700
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:08,509
that's what the size of the hero is and

701
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:11,429
we'll play with that a little bit later

702
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:13,490
and Indies I'm not gonna specify

703
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:16,169
anything yet

704
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:20,579
although the glove will probably need to

705
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:23,519
put in a in a different place as far as

706
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:27,239
peace moving is concerned I don't know

707
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:29,099
why this isn't set to being Bob bass

708
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:32,089
because I thought it was supposed to

709
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:32,089
like hop and stuff

710
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:36,929
so I'm I don't really know maybe that

711
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:40,590
gets set in here with these controllers

712
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:43,319
and so maybe that's why that's happening

713
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,090
there I'm not sure what they look but

714
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,120
anyway you know in here when we add

715
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:50,579
these pieces we now need to do the

716
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:53,489
connections on those so much like how we

717
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:56,819
added you know the cat I don't know if

718
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:58,139
you remember that but now that we

719
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,330
actually have sort of skeletons

720
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:03,690
happening here whenever we add new

721
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:05,460
things we have to connect them up so if

722
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:08,579
you look at here how that's working we

723
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:12,269
need to do essentially this it's exactly

724
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:15,690
the same thing and for the glove

725
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:17,400
I don't really know like that the glove

726
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:19,200
is a little depressing because the glove

727
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,110
kind of wants to be its own entity so

728
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:27,889
I'm not sure like I might say that

729
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:27,890
really shouldn't be there honestly

730
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:48,130
Oh oh never mind okay I take it all back

731
00:48:45,219 --> 00:48:51,159
there's a there is a separate entity for

732
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:54,360
the glove so that's actually fine so

733
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:58,059
these actually are good like I have no

734
00:48:54,360 --> 00:49:00,460
qualms with that like the glove and the

735
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:02,019
body yeah okay that's good

736
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,460
and so really all we need to do here is

737
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:05,559
make sure the body is connected to the

738
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:10,380
head and so that's fine actually okay

739
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:15,340
that's all good so we have the the body

740
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:17,320
here and the head here and I guess

741
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:20,579
what's happening there is like yeah the

742
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:26,590
the head was moving separate from the

743
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:28,869
body cuz of dodging there whatever huh

744
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:31,809
I mean I'll be honest I could leave it

745
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:32,859
that way for now maybe I will but we

746
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:35,409
should think about how we want to

747
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:41,769
animate that a little bit more in the

748
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:43,359
future all right so if I didn't want to

749
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:44,920
do anything there that also explains why

750
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,829
this thing didn't have to get set to any

751
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:51,730
kind of animation parameter there um so

752
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:54,009
if I want to keep it that way then

753
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:55,690
really what happens is we don't connect

754
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,920
these up at all they're all separate

755
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,570
things floating in the world getting

756
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:03,630
animated separately as completely

757
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:03,630
separate pieces and that's fine

758
00:50:15,858 --> 00:50:25,239
Oh what is the complaint here let's see

759
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:31,999
and these need to get tagged out as well

760
00:50:28,909 --> 00:50:37,399
which we haven't done yet but those are

761
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:47,748
all entities body had in glove oh and

762
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:50,749
right my mistake sorry cannot convert

763
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:53,318
from any visible piece to entity that's

764
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:53,318
a good point

765
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:10,590
so connect peace to world it's inside

766
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:12,960
entity can I assume and probably just

767
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:20,309
needs to get expose so that other people

768
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:23,519
can call it so we need to tag these out

769
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:30,409
somehow so much like in the entity gen

770
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:35,099
when we do the cat we need some way of

771
00:51:30,409 --> 00:51:38,159
tagging this entity with tags that mark

772
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:43,110
who it is you know what I mean so when

773
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:46,589
we do an ad player I guess you know we

774
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:50,280
were we weren't calling these directly

775
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:53,820
because we create little ad specs and

776
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:56,880
then add them in but in here we are

777
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:58,200
creating the player directly so we kind

778
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,170
of want to just be able to do this

779
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:02,549
directly here what I mean

780
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:07,230
and so we know this is a budding is

781
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:10,080
ahead we want to add to these things we

782
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:15,269
want to be able to set the tag so we

783
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:20,159
know this is like an orphan and we know

784
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:21,599
that this is the hero for now right and

785
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,920
that's going to be true on the head as

786
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:29,460
well on the glove we know this is a

787
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,180
glove I'm not sure we know that it's

788
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,179
anything else

789
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:42,889
it's got fingers other than that I'm

790
00:52:40,469 --> 00:52:42,889
really not sure

791
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,338
okay so inside and again this ad tag

792
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:58,429
probably also has to get exposed there

793
00:52:52,338 --> 00:53:05,679
so the people can be calling it I think

794
00:52:58,429 --> 00:53:10,399
that's it um okay so now in theory like

795
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:13,368
looks like we have our orientations

796
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,619
backwards there you can't tell that

797
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:17,749
that's true because you can't see me

798
00:53:15,619 --> 00:53:23,150
clicking it but you're just gonna have

799
00:53:17,748 --> 00:53:25,068
to trust me it is so we have some tag

800
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:27,980
issues and we'll have to kind of figure

801
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:29,298
out what's going on with those we can

802
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,099
add some editing features to help us

803
00:53:29,298 --> 00:53:34,670
with that as well

804
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:37,730
but but all that's fine for now so you

805
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:40,789
know we looks kind of fine here I don't

806
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:44,179
really want to change these but for the

807
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:47,420
most part you know these these are

808
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:53,149
selecting the correct things to a

809
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:55,278
certain extent and so you kind of see

810
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:57,730
like the scale is bad and all that but

811
00:53:55,278 --> 00:54:05,719
otherwise you know we're not too far off

812
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:08,989
so I want to know did I accidentally did

813
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:12,588
I specify the wrong height there some

814
00:54:08,989 --> 00:54:15,289
hat like the wrong selection let's see

815
00:54:12,588 --> 00:54:21,139
what happens with the Berman's they're

816
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:24,799
like right up left down right up left

817
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:27,650
down so don't know if I screwed

818
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:35,210
something up there in terms of facing

819
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:40,249
direction but I may have either way I

820
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:41,838
think if we just go in here and set this

821
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:44,318
down to a more reasonable size we should

822
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:44,318
be in better shape

823
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:51,829
all right

824
00:55:00,989 --> 00:55:08,449
I might want to make the debug light not

825
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:11,400
so big giant cube over my head as well I

826
00:55:08,449 --> 00:55:13,649
still don't know if there's a reason why

827
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:22,650
we actually put lights in four cubes

828
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:23,910
when we put cube lights on because we

829
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:26,280
want the ability to light things

830
00:55:23,909 --> 00:55:38,039
probably without doing that

831
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:41,010
that makes sense so when we do this push

832
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:44,550
cube here and we put in a mission in

833
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:46,650
there you know I wonder if it should

834
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,060
really be like this of course I don't

835
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:56,840
know if that'll affect the emitter but

836
00:55:48,059 --> 00:56:01,980
see so that way the lights are just not

837
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:03,660
so gonna risk their right um so yeah so

838
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,949
basically what I want to do now is go

839
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:07,049
figure out why we're getting that

840
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:12,210
reflection problem there if I were

841
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:14,940
getting those things split up and then

842
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:20,280
we're also picking the lean left lean

843
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:23,490
right version of that of the body which

844
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,260
I suppose I can temporarily not do by

845
00:56:23,489 --> 00:56:31,229
just picking one of the different bodies

846
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:33,720
but I'm not sure that's that's not its

847
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:35,369
immediate the most pressing concern like

848
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:39,029
the most pressing concern is why does

849
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:40,950
the head not pick the right angle I do

850
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:46,790
like the fact that the default head now

851
00:56:40,949 --> 00:56:46,789
is the baby that's pretty awesome

852
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,800
all right sorry I got a little carried

853
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:05,818
away there it's fun to hop around in

854
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:12,539
this thing which is a good sign I

855
00:57:05,818 --> 00:57:14,969
suppose so yeah I kind of want to to

856
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:17,460
figure out what's going on there so you

857
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:20,399
know I don't know if this is a good time

858
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:23,699
to maybe focus on the debug stuff a

859
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:30,139
little bit there where in addition to

860
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:32,460
looking at things like the HHA editing I

861
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:34,759
wonder if I want to be able to say look

862
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:37,980
show me what this entity is currently

863
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,690
doing in terms of picking like what are

864
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,630
the tags on it and stuff like that

865
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:44,190
so that I can see them and similarly

866
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:46,289
like when I pick one of these things

867
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:50,280
like what are the tags on that because

868
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:54,389
you know I don't know and so like in

869
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:56,579
when we're when we're assigning these

870
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:58,348
things and and I also don't know like

871
00:57:56,579 --> 00:58:00,930
for the cat like so let's say you made

872
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:02,220
it what if you made a cat instead so

873
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:06,118
instead of this you just said that's not

874
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:09,679
an orphan it's a cat right would it also

875
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:16,048
be facing wrong direction or is it only

876
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:18,568
you know ma only the the split heads and

877
00:58:16,048 --> 00:58:20,309
bodies that are picking the wrong facing

878
00:58:18,568 --> 00:58:22,318
directions because that's like a

879
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:27,480
relevant piece of debugging information

880
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:36,869
there right so if I said the body in the

881
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:37,199
head we're actually cats you know what I

882
00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:41,760
mean

883
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:43,969
said of orphans what would I get in this

884
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:49,369
case right

885
00:58:43,969 --> 00:58:49,368
so yeah like those are correct

886
00:59:00,929 --> 00:59:06,578
so that's not fabulous so it means that

887
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:09,399
there's something wrong with the import

888
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:13,239
when I did it and I don't know what did

889
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:19,838
I screw up so that's unfortunate I I

890
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:22,019
made a I made a boo-boo and I don't know

891
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:22,018
why

892
00:59:39,389 --> 00:59:45,099
so in both of these cases I'm iterating

893
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:48,730
over all of these things and then I'm

894
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:50,889
asking it to do an import and we've got

895
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:54,690
import body and import head right and

896
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:54,690
then I'm sitting the tags back this way

897
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:06,109
you know this routine if I screwed it up

898
01:00:04,338 --> 01:00:07,880
that's not really relevant because we

899
01:00:06,108 --> 01:00:11,199
didn't use this routine this routine

900
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:18,250
never got called only using these two

901
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:18,250
that's it so when we do like import head

902
01:00:20,858 --> 01:00:29,029
or import body there's got to be some

903
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:32,599
reason why it's screwed up so in here we

904
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:37,670
take the Y index mod for that should

905
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:40,510
just be 0 1 that should be and I pass in

906
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,510
the wrong thing now

907
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:14,349
so I don't know what did I do wrong

908
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:22,940
there the X index is not really relevant

909
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:25,369
the Y index looks totally fine and as

910
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:31,159
far as the head is concerned so you know

911
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:36,980
it's 0 1 2 3 and it would be 0 again 1 2

912
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:45,049
3 I guess are we going the wrong

913
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:46,820
direction there though but if we were

914
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:51,220
going the wrong direction it should have

915
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:51,220
been wrong in the other one as well

916
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,670
well

917
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:42,548
I can't guess so I'm just gonna have to

918
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:43,679
debug there's really not much more to it

919
01:02:42,548 --> 01:02:46,568
than that

920
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:50,169
so for some reason when we got in here

921
01:02:46,568 --> 01:02:54,548
and we were doing an import head I guess

922
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:55,450
I also don't know am I am I let slip

923
01:02:54,548 --> 01:02:56,530
straight to another one of those

924
01:02:55,449 --> 01:02:58,179
characters make sure it's wrong

925
01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:02,319
everywhere and not just on the hero and

926
01:02:58,179 --> 01:03:08,009
for some reason but yeah so assuming

927
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:08,009
that we assuming that we add player here

928
01:03:10,739 --> 01:03:15,669
instead of the hero maybe I can say that

929
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:18,460
the body type is going to be we had like

930
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:21,789
the strength body for example and then

931
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:25,650
at the top of its gonna be I don't know

932
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:25,650
maybe it's maybe it's layered

933
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:43,760
so like it's literally just the hero

934
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:47,889
that has the problem like Laird is

935
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:56,180
totally right how about somebody else

936
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:58,069
like I wonder if that's cuz we had like

937
01:03:56,179 --> 01:03:59,750
old data in there that it's that's like

938
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:02,390
conflicting with it or something I don't

939
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:04,179
know so you know if we said what about

940
01:04:02,389 --> 01:04:07,179
the baby like what if it's the baby

941
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:07,179
instead

942
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:28,639
I gotta turn those particles off or at

943
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:28,639
least get some real particles in there

944
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:36,300
so essentially everybody works except

945
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:39,989
for the hero and it's just wonder if

946
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:46,590
that that does kind of seem a little

947
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:48,569
suggestive at this point and I do wonder

948
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:49,789
if that has something to do with yeah

949
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:52,320
all right

950
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:57,469
I'm gonna turn those particles off

951
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:57,470
temporarily where we spawn them

952
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:22,380
but anyway at least we got sort of what

953
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:24,809
I wanted now it looks like we've got a

954
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,340
bug in there now would be a good time to

955
01:05:24,809 --> 01:05:28,309
start working on the camera game look at

956
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:30,690
debug can write like you can kind of see

957
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:32,639
there's some garbage there at the top of

958
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:36,300
the head that I don't think should be

959
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:39,690
there and that may also be an import

960
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:43,140
problem like it's not just an import

961
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:48,450
prob it may be a art source art problem

962
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:58,909
it's hard to say if I open it up let me

963
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:58,909
see here open it in

964
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:22,309
so looking at the baby's head if I load

965
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:26,059
in the template and I just put it over

966
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:28,009
here I just want to make sure that it's

967
01:06:26,059 --> 01:06:29,809
actually correctly aligned it looks like

968
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:42,560
it is though so it looks like some kind

969
01:06:29,809 --> 01:06:48,309
of a asset problem I can't get to move

970
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:48,309
this there we go

971
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:59,170
so that looks like it was fine I mean

972
01:06:57,849 --> 01:07:01,570
there's plenty of clearance around there

973
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:03,789
so I'm not sure what was going on there

974
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:07,690
with the baby head but it does look like

975
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:18,909
we've got a import bug on the baby head

976
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:21,159
I do think also we're a little tinier

977
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:26,759
than we should be so well three was too

978
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:26,759
big I think maybe one is too small that

979
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:37,349
seems like probably more the size it

980
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:37,349
should be

981
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:46,689
and so now also we're gonna have to have

982
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:50,130
some some code in there for you know the

983
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:53,639
head now is gonna be controlled by the

984
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:56,190
by the art a little bit more probably

985
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:59,190
you know it's a little bit hard to say

986
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:59,190
but

987
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:16,289
so that mean what's that actually just a

988
01:08:14,608 --> 01:08:19,099
texture transfer issue because you can

989
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:21,658
if you notice it's not there now

990
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:23,190
interesting so I wonder if we have a

991
01:08:21,658 --> 01:08:27,118
texture transfer issue there where we

992
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:29,250
were properly clearing out ooh some like

993
01:08:27,118 --> 01:08:30,210
we were transferring a little bit larger

994
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,798
than we should have been or something

995
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:41,039
because you can see we're not actually

996
01:08:31,798 --> 01:08:44,338
getting that bug interesting well

997
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:46,380
alright so let's go from here and see

998
01:08:44,338 --> 01:08:49,039
what's happening if I actually look at

999
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:52,079
the alignment points for this thing and

1000
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:57,000
I want to align it with the ground it's

1001
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:58,979
gonna be more like there and I kind of

1002
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,960
want this thing to have a base of neck

1003
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:03,689
and I want the head to attach to it

1004
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:13,230
probably like that's probably what we

1005
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:15,388
want to do but in order to do that I

1006
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:18,269
have to reduce some of the dependence on

1007
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:21,239
the head code which I don't know to what

1008
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:26,069
extent that's okay you know maybe it's

1009
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:29,039
fine and you know we could test it out

1010
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:32,509
now by just saying all right look the

1011
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:37,130
head is actually now on the body and

1012
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:37,130
we're gonna connect the head to the body

1013
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:51,118
like so so the head piece is actually

1014
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:55,860
its body piece base of neck head piece

1015
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:58,019
default okay so now there are no pieces

1016
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:59,908
on the head so even though the brain

1017
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:04,500
will still move the head around it won't

1018
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:06,649
actually do anything with it and so you

1019
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,649
know

1020
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:15,589
you will allow us to see what this is

1021
01:10:13,698 --> 01:10:17,419
gonna look like before we pull the head

1022
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:19,630
controller code out because we don't

1023
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:24,408
really know what's gonna happen there

1024
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:26,389
it's a little bit Squinkie see we got a

1025
01:10:24,408 --> 01:10:28,698
transfer issue there right there's like

1026
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:30,409
a texture transfer issue there we

1027
01:10:28,698 --> 01:10:33,408
probably have some kind of a load race

1028
01:10:30,408 --> 01:10:34,670
condition when we or it's the other

1029
01:10:33,408 --> 01:10:35,719
thing we could be doing is running out

1030
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:40,760
two extra handles but I think we should

1031
01:10:35,719 --> 01:10:43,489
assert in that case right so we'll see

1032
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,929
but anyway let's suppose I actually you

1033
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:47,419
know again one thing at a time we have a

1034
01:10:44,929 --> 01:10:49,550
ton of stuff to work on now so let's

1035
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:51,529
suppose I actually align this thing with

1036
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:55,039
the world which would be like something

1037
01:10:51,529 --> 01:10:58,279
like that right and then I add the base

1038
01:10:55,039 --> 01:11:00,139
of neck thing and I don't know exactly

1039
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:05,630
where that should be but like probably

1040
01:11:00,139 --> 01:11:09,679
probably like maybe there something like

1041
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:12,109
that and then the head needs to be

1042
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:15,230
aligned like basically like that I guess

1043
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:21,948
and that I think is roughly how the baby

1044
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:23,750
looks right and so just want to look at

1045
01:11:21,948 --> 01:11:29,379
how the hopping looks it actually looks

1046
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:31,880
great yeah that actually looks great and

1047
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:33,859
the head does need a little bit of a Z

1048
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,510
offset to avoid the Z freighting

1049
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:41,529
obviously but otherwise that just looks

1050
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:44,920
fabulous so let me do the other ones too

1051
01:11:41,529 --> 01:11:44,920
right like

1052
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:53,819
so I don't really know and you know I

1053
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:59,868
can kind of like swap this all around

1054
01:11:53,819 --> 01:11:59,868
right it looks about right

1055
01:12:16,619 --> 01:12:28,670
I'm not out for such yeah I don't really

1056
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,670
know but something like this

1057
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:45,460
looks about right you can see why I

1058
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:47,409
wanted an editor for these because can

1059
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:50,829
you imagine not having one like there's

1060
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:53,439
so much art even when you just do a

1061
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:56,409
little bit of importing work there's so

1062
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:58,210
much stuff that just if you couldn't do

1063
01:12:56,409 --> 01:13:01,019
it with an editor you would you would go

1064
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:01,020
mad right

1065
01:13:23,609 --> 01:13:25,670
you

1066
01:13:34,899 --> 01:13:37,619
all right

1067
01:13:44,789 --> 01:13:49,310
I think that's probably great

1068
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,510
all right

1069
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:17,590
so that's pretty fun I mean that is just

1070
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:19,579
a fun that is just fun um sooo pretty

1071
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:21,949
happy with how that all is coming

1072
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:24,800
together like I said we want to probably

1073
01:14:21,949 --> 01:14:26,689
put a little bit of a Z in there for the

1074
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:30,230
head just to give it an offset so that

1075
01:14:26,689 --> 01:14:34,609
it floats above the body a little bit I

1076
01:14:30,229 --> 01:14:36,289
don't know how much it should be but we

1077
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:39,769
got to find out what that bug is right

1078
01:14:36,289 --> 01:14:48,979
there to that transfer bug like what's

1079
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:54,460
happening there but anyway that may be a

1080
01:14:48,979 --> 01:14:54,459
little much I think that's what I wanted

1081
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:12,789
all right so I'm pretty happy exploring

1082
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:16,539
around with that little baby it's very

1083
01:15:12,789 --> 01:15:22,449
satisfying for some reason I get some

1084
01:15:16,539 --> 01:15:26,109
pass through on see that Z clipping

1085
01:15:22,449 --> 01:15:27,250
there so I think our yeah we still

1086
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:28,630
probably have a lot of work to do with

1087
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:30,850
our legacy by a stuff it looks like our

1088
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:32,199
Z bias is actually doing the opposite

1089
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:34,660
thing it should be doing there something

1090
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:37,689
like that we've got a lot of work to do

1091
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:40,859
to polish up our graphics here but it's

1092
01:15:37,689 --> 01:15:40,859
coming along folks

1093
01:16:00,578 --> 01:16:06,429
we kind of need that glove to follow

1094
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:08,260
along with us by the way I don't think

1095
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:10,719
that would be that hard would it I mean

1096
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:12,969
it should just be floating along with us

1097
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,529
and then when we hop it hops with us so

1098
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:18,340
I don't know why it's doing what it's

1099
01:16:14,529 --> 01:16:20,170
doing at the moment I don't even know

1100
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:22,360
that I don't even remember writing much

1101
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:24,099
glove code so I think it's probably just

1102
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:27,518
doing some random residual stuff who

1103
01:16:24,099 --> 01:16:30,670
knows what but I'm liking that so I

1104
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:33,519
think now you know that that's good let

1105
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:37,989
me set ourselves to somebody who's not

1106
01:16:33,519 --> 01:16:40,960
busted who is also not the baby and

1107
01:16:37,988 --> 01:16:43,569
we'll pick like you know try to figure

1108
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:57,639
out what the right size is so let's

1109
01:16:43,569 --> 01:17:11,558
let's take let's take one of these

1110
01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:22,889
assets here and maybe we'll pick maybe

1111
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:22,889
we'll pick cassadee and we'll use

1112
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:44,519
actually know what let's do Viva instead

1113
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:44,519
and we will use maybe the spring outfit

1114
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:55,710
so let's set this one up we've never

1115
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:58,260
edited this our asset so it needs to be

1116
01:17:55,710 --> 01:18:00,810
aligned as well and so in terms of where

1117
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:05,369
it should sit it's probably like roughly

1118
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:07,140
there ish I would say and again remember

1119
01:18:05,369 --> 01:18:08,550
we have to fix although our Z bias tough

1120
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,710
so the fact that interpenetrates is

1121
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:14,579
correct like it's supposed to come out a

1122
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:18,480
little bit there right so let's say base

1123
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:20,069
of neck let's place that it's pretty

1124
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:24,169
clear where the base in neck is on this

1125
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:24,170
model it's like actually pretty explicit

1126
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:33,199
what why do I still have a baby head

1127
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:39,229
what's that about

1128
01:18:43,998 --> 01:18:50,338
it's not just a tag matching error did I

1129
01:18:46,979 --> 01:18:52,609
actually screw that up

1130
01:18:50,338 --> 01:18:52,609
Oh

1131
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:07,239
so interestingly enough the tags on the

1132
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:08,800
head so this should actually this is

1133
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:13,449
wrong the tags are supposed to be on the

1134
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:15,989
body now right sorry about that that

1135
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:15,989
explains a lot

1136
01:19:19,529 --> 01:19:24,099
right it's vive and she is in the spring

1137
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:26,340
dress it's actually what's going on

1138
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,340
there

1139
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,020
all right

1140
01:19:48,859 --> 01:19:59,779
there we go and we need to edit her head

1141
01:19:55,300 --> 01:20:02,270
and set where that goes so that's base

1142
01:19:59,779 --> 01:20:07,639
of neck is probably roughly there right

1143
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:11,139
so that's looks sized properly to me

1144
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:13,520
meaning that does look like the size

1145
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:16,130
that the orphan should be so I think we

1146
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,340
have the scale set at least somewhat

1147
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:18,340
right

1148
01:20:29,779 --> 01:20:35,530
oops

1149
01:20:32,168 --> 01:20:37,328
the weight heaven do god it's so weird

1150
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:38,708
we've got like so much advanced stuff

1151
01:20:37,328 --> 01:20:46,978
I'm like oh wait I don't have to like

1152
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:46,979
re-edit that thing I have undo all right

1153
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,500
so

1154
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:08,300
probably like roughly there keep doing

1155
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:08,299
that

1156
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:44,849
okay that seems better

1157
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:54,929
I want to be able to hide stuff now you

1158
01:21:54,269 --> 01:21:57,989
know what I mean

1159
01:21:54,929 --> 01:22:01,578
so I can place these things without with

1160
01:21:57,988 --> 01:22:01,578
being able to see through them sort of

1161
01:22:17,729 --> 01:22:24,809
it's really weird stuff going on with

1162
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:28,380
these texture poles that might be an art

1163
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:32,480
asset error though we'll find out but we

1164
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:32,480
got some debugging to do suffice to say

1165
01:22:51,448 --> 01:22:54,408
all right last one

1166
01:22:57,298 --> 01:23:03,798
oh whoops I didn't mean that at the hand

1167
01:23:14,269 --> 01:23:17,800
and think that's

1168
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:26,140
probably about right

1169
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:44,280
and that seems pretty good

1170
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:14,659
so I'm relatively happy with that

1171
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:29,919
I don't see any obvious problems with

1172
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:32,559
like perspective there we need to get

1173
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:35,800
the Z bias working again and you know

1174
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,810
accurately so that we don't have this

1175
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:40,150
sort of problem with the you know

1176
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:45,420
interpenetration there but in terms of

1177
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:45,420
looking proper it seems pretty good

1178
01:24:53,539 --> 01:25:02,300
so I think that will probably work just

1179
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:08,090
fine now there is of course the fact

1180
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:10,070
that it feels like the scale wants to be

1181
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:12,409
somewhere around there but it's kind of

1182
01:25:10,069 --> 01:25:16,399
ridiculous because the orphans then are

1183
01:25:12,409 --> 01:25:25,840
like really much too large for like the

1184
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:28,969
walls and stuff um so there is that and

1185
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:32,170
I don't really know what to do about

1186
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:32,170
that exactly

1187
01:25:33,609 --> 01:25:40,099
probably nothing

1188
01:25:35,390 --> 01:25:41,750
I mean we'll just try we'll just try and

1189
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:43,400
make sure that our Z bias works so we

1190
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:45,020
don't get that like clipping and you

1191
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:52,549
just that's just what it looks like and

1192
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:53,780
we make sure that you know yeah I mean I

1193
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:56,270
don't I don't know what else we could

1194
01:25:53,779 --> 01:25:57,769
really do because you know that seems

1195
01:25:56,270 --> 01:26:01,880
like roughly what it should look like

1196
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:08,930
and maybe it's a little large you know I

1197
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:12,550
mean maybe it's like maybe it's like

1198
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:12,550
should be somewhere more around there

1199
01:26:12,609 --> 01:26:21,049
but it's still gonna be a problem

1200
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:22,819
because they're still like yeah but at

1201
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:28,100
least they're you're not taller than the

1202
01:26:22,819 --> 01:26:30,109
wall so so maybe that's better and then

1203
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,700
we only need a little bit of Z biasing

1204
01:26:30,109 --> 01:26:34,279
there to fix like the problems where you

1205
01:26:31,699 --> 01:26:40,519
would clip through the wall in those

1206
01:26:34,279 --> 01:26:43,539
circumstances right but that seems

1207
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,540
pretty good otherwise

1208
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:56,939
all right I'm pretty happy with that I

1209
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:56,940
don't know how much time I've got left I

1210
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:06,430
would like to get the debug camera going

1211
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,989
probably now we got a lot of stuff to

1212
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:15,970
work on like you know I mean there's a

1213
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:18,159
hundred things to work on now so we got

1214
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:22,030
tons of things like we've got we've got

1215
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:26,710
some import problems we've got some

1216
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:28,179
transfer problems so I think you know in

1217
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:31,020
looking at some of these things I'm just

1218
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:33,850
like where's that coming from right like

1219
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:36,940
if I look in the source assets I'm not

1220
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:39,700
sure that that's there like I'm not sure

1221
01:27:36,939 --> 01:27:42,699
that's a bug that maybe our bug and

1222
01:27:39,699 --> 01:27:52,359
again it's hard to say so if I go into

1223
01:27:42,699 --> 01:27:54,939
handmade art that's vive right so well

1224
01:27:52,359 --> 01:27:57,179
yeah I think it's just probably the arts

1225
01:27:54,939 --> 01:27:57,179
wrong

1226
01:28:04,429 --> 01:28:12,980
yeah the arts just wrong so that's just

1227
01:28:09,738 --> 01:28:20,059
an art bug you can see here if I open up

1228
01:28:12,979 --> 01:28:27,769
like the grid and do the same thing I

1229
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:34,270
did before I think this time we'll

1230
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:34,270
actually see that it's busted

1231
01:28:47,559 --> 01:28:54,460
so that's not our fault right that's

1232
01:28:51,849 --> 01:28:56,170
that's actually the the art assets just

1233
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:57,788
wrong and that's not a big deal right

1234
01:28:56,170 --> 01:29:00,429
the artist can then just go edit that

1235
01:28:57,788 --> 01:29:00,969
later and so we can raid bugs on stuff

1236
01:29:00,429 --> 01:29:03,609
like that

1237
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:10,090
I guess that tells me what I do want to

1238
01:29:03,609 --> 01:29:13,509
do right now though is you know inside

1239
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:18,639
the in-game editor we know in theory

1240
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:20,860
anyway I think that for any given entity

1241
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:23,380
in the system we should have tracked the

1242
01:29:20,859 --> 01:29:29,889
errors on the entity in the system which

1243
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:37,300
means that in the asset stuff here baked

1244
01:29:29,889 --> 01:29:39,659
into the annotations should be the

1245
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,659
errors

1246
01:29:41,868 --> 01:29:47,670
so if one were so inclined we should be

1247
01:29:45,868 --> 01:29:50,698
able to write a function because there's

1248
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:54,449
gonna be like a write string function in

1249
01:29:50,698 --> 01:29:58,289
this in the asset system write asset

1250
01:29:54,448 --> 01:30:01,348
string so there there can be like a

1251
01:29:58,289 --> 01:30:05,368
reverse version of this so if you want

1252
01:30:01,349 --> 01:30:06,840
to read an asset string you should be

1253
01:30:05,368 --> 01:30:12,719
able to do a thing where you say like

1254
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:17,909
hey tell me you know get get an asset

1255
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:25,109
string out of the the file and you can

1256
01:30:17,908 --> 01:30:29,429
pass in some kind of a like some kind of

1257
01:30:25,109 --> 01:30:32,309
a place to put it so I don't know what

1258
01:30:29,429 --> 01:30:33,630
like the I don't know what the best way

1259
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:34,530
to do this would be because in theory

1260
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:35,730
you really don't want to be reading

1261
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:38,279
things out of files a lot of times so if

1262
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:43,098
you're really gonna be mister saucy

1263
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:43,099
pants about it you would probably go and

1264
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:48,750
actually be specific about how you would

1265
01:30:46,889 --> 01:30:51,599
cache these things but I don't think I

1266
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:56,670
care so probably all I would do here is

1267
01:30:51,599 --> 01:30:59,760
say look tell me where to put it and

1268
01:30:56,670 --> 01:31:03,929
that's it right

1269
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:08,909
so I'd say okay tell me what the count

1270
01:31:03,929 --> 01:31:12,960
and offset is for this string and and

1271
01:31:08,908 --> 01:31:19,259
I'll go read it and so in here we would

1272
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:22,828
have a thing that was like platform read

1273
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:26,340
data from file you know you want to read

1274
01:31:22,828 --> 01:31:33,929
from from this thing and here's the

1275
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:37,529
offset we have this count and then it's

1276
01:31:33,929 --> 01:31:40,078
just we need that space right so we

1277
01:31:37,529 --> 01:31:47,158
would just say and also we in here we'd

1278
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:48,868
say well the count is the count and the

1279
01:31:47,158 --> 01:31:51,899
data for the buffer is going to be a

1280
01:31:48,868 --> 01:31:52,219
push size of whatever the count is in

1281
01:31:51,899 --> 01:31:55,309
the

1282
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:59,570
Marie that you're asking for or that

1283
01:31:55,310 --> 01:32:05,000
you're telling me right so and then we

1284
01:31:59,569 --> 01:32:07,069
read that thing and so I think that is

1285
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,619
all we would really need if we wanted to

1286
01:32:07,069 --> 01:32:12,679
display the error messages in the

1287
01:32:09,619 --> 01:32:15,439
in-game editor meaning that like you

1288
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:17,210
know when we have the HHA in here or

1289
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:26,149
whatever and then there's like the asset

1290
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:35,000
editor and and whatever else right in

1291
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:39,949
this call here after we're done like

1292
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:42,829
this begins section thing for any asset

1293
01:32:39,949 --> 01:32:49,609
we should be able to do a different

1294
01:32:42,829 --> 01:33:06,380
section and so like this may be where we

1295
01:32:49,609 --> 01:33:15,139
say yeah this is the info section and in

1296
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:21,650
the info section I'm gonna print some

1297
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:26,780
stuff out I guess right I mean that

1298
01:33:21,649 --> 01:33:29,689
seems cool enough and so in here I could

1299
01:33:26,779 --> 01:33:32,469
print out like information about the

1300
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:32,469
asset

1301
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:51,000
and I don't know that should just work

1302
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:58,829
prop probably I don't actually know but

1303
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:59,970
I don't see why it wouldn't so the

1304
01:33:58,829 --> 01:34:01,500
reason I want to do that it's because

1305
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:03,180
then I don't have to let go dump the h

1306
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:07,739
@j or anything to like figure out what's

1307
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:10,770
going on so you know if I come back here

1308
01:34:07,739 --> 01:34:12,599
I don't know what's what's going on here

1309
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:16,740
but if I come back here and I you know I

1310
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:20,579
look at one of these you know in theory

1311
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:23,429
there's like an info flag here and that

1312
01:34:20,579 --> 01:34:27,930
could now like print out like errors and

1313
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:33,150
stuff if there were errors so you know

1314
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:39,560
going back to the file in question for

1315
01:34:33,149 --> 01:34:39,559
that asset we know in the annotation so

1316
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:52,979
here we know that that has the

1317
01:34:49,649 --> 01:34:54,899
information about where the thing came

1318
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:59,219
from and the errors that might have been

1319
01:34:54,899 --> 01:35:03,359
on it so in theory if I ask it to give

1320
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:06,420
me back some of that stuff like all of

1321
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:17,329
this stuff I should be able to see it

1322
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:17,329
you know so like for example if I say

1323
01:35:18,409 --> 01:35:28,710
name I could do like read assets string

1324
01:35:24,979 --> 01:35:34,199
and I could say well here's the asset

1325
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:39,420
name offset and here's the asset name

1326
01:35:34,199 --> 01:35:41,309
count I don't really remember even

1327
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:44,640
though I just wrote it what the format

1328
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:49,280
was there but it's like you know assets

1329
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:49,280
and then the assets file

1330
01:35:49,510 --> 01:36:02,650
and we know what that is because every

1331
01:35:52,779 --> 01:36:05,079
asset says which file it's from so we

1332
01:36:02,649 --> 01:36:08,799
can get that so we can say hey read the

1333
01:36:05,079 --> 01:36:13,569
asset string there and use like the

1334
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:18,850
frame use the frame arena because we're

1335
01:36:13,569 --> 01:36:20,079
just gonna render this string although

1336
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:21,400
honestly I don't even really need to do

1337
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:23,350
that I could just use a temporary no

1338
01:36:21,399 --> 01:36:25,509
because we do a label F on this thing so

1339
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:28,480
we're already pushing all of the stuff

1340
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:30,900
onto it so I don't even really need to

1341
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:30,899
do that

1342
01:36:40,350 --> 01:37:11,200
what I'm basically talking about here is

1343
01:36:42,729 --> 01:37:12,819
this I mean I could do that I don't

1344
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,170
really know again like this would

1345
01:37:12,819 --> 01:37:16,869
probably all just go into the frame

1346
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:20,260
arena because definitely no reason not

1347
01:37:16,869 --> 01:37:24,039
to it doesn't really make any sense to

1348
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:27,550
do an actual allocation in here to give

1349
01:37:24,039 --> 01:37:32,800
this thing a block of memory but you

1350
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:42,090
know point being that would be all you

1351
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:45,670
really would need to do so asset file

1352
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:48,750
there's a count and the offset it should

1353
01:37:45,670 --> 01:37:48,750
look like oops

1354
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:57,730
should look like that and then once you

1355
01:37:53,500 --> 01:38:00,819
get that piece of information we should

1356
01:37:57,729 --> 01:38:07,149
be able to just print it so if we do

1357
01:38:00,819 --> 01:38:09,309
that like you know name that we should

1358
01:38:07,149 --> 01:38:13,500
just then be able to like dump those

1359
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:13,500
strings in order I think

1360
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:38,630
so who knows maybe that'll work maybe

1361
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:40,820
that won't but in theory that is

1362
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:43,430
supposed to do something relating to

1363
01:38:40,819 --> 01:38:44,689
something so we'll see what goes on here

1364
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:46,460
I don't remember if these assets have

1365
01:38:44,689 --> 01:38:50,269
names because I guess they haven't ever

1366
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:52,010
been named in any particular way that I

1367
01:38:50,270 --> 01:38:54,880
know of so I would print out some things

1368
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:57,710
that we think should actually be there

1369
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:59,920
because inside the asset there are some

1370
01:38:57,710 --> 01:39:02,569
that that we definitely are setting and

1371
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:05,149
so for example I think the author should

1372
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:06,799
be set to Anna and then we can also dump

1373
01:39:05,149 --> 01:39:09,759
the error stream and the source file

1374
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:12,409
base name like you know that stuff

1375
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:15,199
should have been in there

1376
01:39:12,409 --> 01:39:29,809
name and description I don't know that

1377
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:32,079
we ever set but if we like we just grab

1378
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:32,080
this

1379
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:55,380
I know what I want to call this but well

1380
01:39:52,769 --> 01:40:02,130
actually I guess this is name and this

1381
01:39:55,380 --> 01:40:04,380
is value so if we did something like

1382
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:07,498
this then we could easily print out a

1383
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:10,229
lot of these and so I can just say all

1384
01:40:07,498 --> 01:40:13,288
right there's a UI layout for its rwi

1385
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:14,909
layout that I pass in here I give it the

1386
01:40:13,288 --> 01:40:16,708
name of the thing that I'm doing and

1387
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:19,170
then I give it like you know how I'm

1388
01:40:16,708 --> 01:40:24,059
gonna load this thing so I say what the

1389
01:40:19,170 --> 01:40:29,340
count and the offset is and then it just

1390
01:40:24,059 --> 01:40:31,829
does you know that and I would like I

1391
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:34,708
don't want to do and like I said any

1392
01:40:31,828 --> 01:40:43,948
kind of like allocation there so I think

1393
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:46,859
I do want to just do that right and so

1394
01:40:43,948 --> 01:40:50,609
then in here I should always be able to

1395
01:40:46,859 --> 01:40:53,089
now say like annotation label and I can

1396
01:40:50,609 --> 01:40:56,429
give it the layout in the temporary now

1397
01:40:53,090 --> 01:41:05,189
and I can say name and then I can say a

1398
01:40:56,429 --> 01:41:08,399
no-name asset name offset a nano asset

1399
01:41:05,189 --> 01:41:13,979
name or app said description offset and

1400
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:15,448
oops sorry asset name count and then in

1401
01:41:13,979 --> 01:41:17,519
theory we should be able to do like the

1402
01:41:15,448 --> 01:41:20,178
other ones on here as well so there's

1403
01:41:17,519 --> 01:41:20,179
like that one

1404
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:39,110
there's the author and the airstream

1405
01:41:53,238 --> 01:41:58,399
source file base name for some reason I

1406
01:41:56,158 --> 01:42:11,250
skipped some I'm gonna just say like

1407
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:16,879
yeah source and then we'll just see if

1408
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:16,880
that gives us anything interesting I

1409
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:28,679
don't know why assets is being passed

1410
01:42:26,130 --> 01:42:29,279
there because it doesn't actually do

1411
01:42:28,679 --> 01:42:33,779
anything

1412
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:37,609
so that should really just do that and

1413
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:37,609
it should just take the asset file I

1414
01:42:39,829 --> 01:42:42,979
would argue

1415
01:42:53,770 --> 01:43:03,370
and that is about all there is to it

1416
01:43:04,989 --> 01:43:31,069
layout asset file temporary 'no name

1417
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:32,599
count offsets those backwards so now the

1418
01:43:31,069 --> 01:43:34,519
question is do we actually get any of

1419
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:42,230
those and I think this is actually air

1420
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:46,360
stream right uh doesn't even work you

1421
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:46,359
know and I have no idea

1422
01:43:56,118 --> 01:44:02,368
interesting so when we try to print this

1423
01:43:59,128 --> 01:44:18,029
out we're getting a out-of-bounds fetch

1424
01:44:02,368 --> 01:44:21,179
here so our code point our code points

1425
01:44:18,029 --> 01:44:23,509
reading out of out of bounds but it

1426
01:44:21,179 --> 01:44:26,609
shouldn't really be possible right so

1427
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:28,199
the bitmap ID in this case should have

1428
01:44:26,609 --> 01:44:29,760
come back when we say get bitmap for

1429
01:44:28,198 --> 01:44:35,728
glyph if it comes back out of Bounce it

1430
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:36,989
should still work right I can see what's

1431
01:44:35,729 --> 01:44:41,338
happening there it's just hitting the

1432
01:44:36,988 --> 01:44:43,288
new line but that shouldn't cause an

1433
01:44:41,338 --> 01:44:44,550
assertion really unless maybe it's just

1434
01:44:43,288 --> 01:44:46,398
trying to tell us that we were trying to

1435
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:49,050
draw something that was out of bounds

1436
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:52,229
which could be true I'm gonna go ahead

1437
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:54,599
and since it's a reliable run I'm gonna

1438
01:44:52,229 --> 01:44:58,099
let it give me the error in debug mode

1439
01:44:54,599 --> 01:44:58,099
so I can just double check it myself

1440
01:45:21,859 --> 01:45:29,269
so it's just bitmap ID value zero which

1441
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:31,520
is to say there wasn't one so really

1442
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:35,920
this is just garbage because it was

1443
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:35,920
supposed to allow you to do that right

1444
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:41,930
so that was just us kind of screwing up

1445
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:47,110
that port that that was not that was not

1446
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:49,850
really what was supposed to happen so

1447
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:51,799
when you get the you know when you get

1448
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:55,789
the bitmap info here I'm gonna allow it

1449
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:57,440
to do that because that's so you're

1450
01:45:55,789 --> 01:45:59,920
supposed to be able to get the invalid

1451
01:45:57,439 --> 01:45:59,919
ones too

1452
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:10,159
so all I wanted to point out now was

1453
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:12,500
that in theory our system knew about

1454
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:15,229
that error and so I kind of wanted to

1455
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:17,289
make sure that we could see it it's

1456
01:46:15,229 --> 01:46:21,109
zooming that it did actually in fact no

1457
01:46:17,289 --> 01:46:22,100
and so you can see here we've got the

1458
01:46:21,109 --> 01:46:24,139
source file

1459
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:28,270
we don't have names of descriptions and

1460
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:33,260
we have who the author was correctly set

1461
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:37,520
you can see here that like for for some

1462
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:39,409
of these it's telling us the error tile

1463
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:43,510
0 to extends into bottom a pixel border

1464
01:46:39,409 --> 01:46:46,189
that's what that was right there and

1465
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:54,860
apparently it thinks that that's true of

1466
01:46:46,189 --> 01:46:59,869
this as well so I'm not sure that files

1467
01:46:54,859 --> 01:47:01,489
must all be aligned wrong basically and

1468
01:46:59,869 --> 01:47:02,989
so that's fine we probably want to

1469
01:47:01,489 --> 01:47:04,939
highlight things that have an error

1470
01:47:02,989 --> 01:47:11,090
stream when they get drawn they get

1471
01:47:04,939 --> 01:47:12,679
highlighted you know sue in here you can

1472
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:16,340
see we're getting like texture transfer

1473
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:19,100
problems there or load problem you know

1474
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:21,890
something is going wrong that it's not

1475
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:25,490
that the file is bad because if we run

1476
01:47:21,890 --> 01:47:27,440
it again we don't get that right so we

1477
01:47:25,489 --> 01:47:30,949
know that's a problem with how we're

1478
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:33,460
like when we load stuff out we're not

1479
01:47:30,949 --> 01:47:35,710
properly getting the

1480
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:39,039
the transfer to happen the way that it

1481
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:44,439
should so like inside like load asset

1482
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:47,198
work or something when we're actually

1483
01:47:44,439 --> 01:47:50,469
doing this complete texture up like

1484
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:52,809
either that like either the texture

1485
01:47:50,469 --> 01:47:55,329
transfer is not actually waiting for us

1486
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:58,390
to have actually finished you know what

1487
01:47:55,329 --> 01:48:06,670
I mean or we're doing something else

1488
01:47:58,390 --> 01:48:07,960
stupid there but you know that something

1489
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:11,800
along those lines it's like an

1490
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:22,260
unpredictable failure is occurring and

1491
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:22,260
so we have to get that solved so yeah

1492
01:48:22,289 --> 01:48:27,579
let me double check that there's nothing

1493
01:48:24,789 --> 01:48:31,448
weird going on in there because I feel

1494
01:48:27,579 --> 01:48:38,789
like if that could easily just be if we

1495
01:48:31,448 --> 01:48:47,589
screwed up the loop in here so that like

1496
01:48:38,789 --> 01:48:49,929
we didn't properly you know don't

1497
01:48:47,590 --> 01:48:53,190
properly stop the texture transfer

1498
01:48:49,929 --> 01:48:53,190
somehow or I don't know

1499
01:48:54,810 --> 01:49:05,130
hmm but it looks pretty good right so

1500
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:05,130
these should be set to pending load

1501
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:17,390
so when we hit begin texture up

1502
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:46,939
oh well okay I mean yeah so I guess you

1503
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:48,319
know technically I suppose this can't

1504
01:49:46,939 --> 01:49:50,750
this shouldn't be happening because

1505
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:54,829
we're not multi-threaded so this

1506
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:56,630
probably isn't the bug but otherwise it

1507
01:49:54,829 --> 01:50:01,519
would have been the bug right you can

1508
01:49:56,630 --> 01:50:06,890
see it right here we increment the OP

1509
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:12,110
count before setting the pending load

1510
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:16,610
flag so you know that's obviously not

1511
01:50:12,109 --> 01:50:20,809
what you would want to do honestly

1512
01:50:16,609 --> 01:50:21,739
though this is synchronous so you know

1513
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:24,470
it doesn't matter

1514
01:50:21,739 --> 01:50:25,670
that isn't the bug I'm too used to

1515
01:50:24,470 --> 01:50:27,079
looking at things multi-threaded I'm

1516
01:50:25,670 --> 01:50:29,029
like oh god this has all these bugs but

1517
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:33,439
like yeah it's not multi-threaded we

1518
01:50:29,029 --> 01:50:35,569
only run multi-threaded for like our

1519
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:38,359
lighting computations and the deferred

1520
01:50:35,569 --> 01:50:39,859
loading so that's actually fine you know

1521
01:50:38,359 --> 01:50:41,539
it'll get set depending load before

1522
01:50:39,859 --> 01:50:43,750
anyone could possibly have taken a look

1523
01:50:41,539 --> 01:50:43,750
at it

1524
01:50:50,599 --> 01:51:09,960
so one thing that we maybe want to do

1525
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:12,510
there is maybe we want to clear the

1526
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:15,840
memory here just so I can see whether

1527
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:20,820
this is an overwrite problem or whether

1528
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:23,038
it's a not filled yet problem so when we

1529
01:51:20,819 --> 01:51:26,609
get the transfer memory here I'm just

1530
01:51:23,038 --> 01:51:31,319
gonna do real quickly like a mem set

1531
01:51:26,609 --> 01:51:34,439
basically I'm just gonna say look for

1532
01:51:31,319 --> 01:51:36,799
the entirety of this thing however much

1533
01:51:34,439 --> 01:51:41,238
you know the size that you requested

1534
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:41,239
right or maybe I'll just do it like here

1535
01:51:41,359 --> 01:51:56,069
for that whole thing set that to

1536
01:51:48,748 --> 01:51:58,559
something known like maybe just zero

1537
01:51:56,069 --> 01:52:03,389
or maybe full white you know or

1538
01:51:58,559 --> 01:52:07,079
something like that and you know that

1539
01:52:03,389 --> 01:52:10,288
way we'll see solid white in any case

1540
01:52:07,078 --> 01:52:17,998
where and I don't know if I data may not

1541
01:52:10,288 --> 01:52:19,768
be a u8 there yeah and that way we would

1542
01:52:17,998 --> 01:52:21,658
see solid white instead of a noise

1543
01:52:19,769 --> 01:52:23,280
pattern which would give me a little bit

1544
01:52:21,658 --> 01:52:25,799
more information about what was going on

1545
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:28,198
there if it's just that we haven't like

1546
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:30,690
filled it in yet of course the problem

1547
01:52:28,198 --> 01:52:33,238
is getting it to screw up again you know

1548
01:52:30,689 --> 01:52:35,839
you've got to be able to actually make

1549
01:52:33,238 --> 01:52:35,839
it screw up

1550
01:52:40,469 --> 01:52:58,639
which at the moment doesn't seem to want

1551
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:58,639
to do so yeah maybe not

1552
01:53:04,658 --> 01:53:23,658
why won't you break well that's not

1553
01:53:21,288 --> 01:53:25,908
great because I kind of wanted to debug

1554
01:53:23,658 --> 01:53:31,009
that but I guess we'll have to wait for

1555
01:53:25,908 --> 01:53:34,969
a better repro case one could assume

1556
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:37,248
that we maybe we can get a clue from

1557
01:53:34,969 --> 01:53:41,418
that if it turns out that just the act

1558
01:53:37,248 --> 01:53:44,090
of having that in there is sufficient to

1559
01:53:41,418 --> 01:53:47,899
make sure that you don't see the bug

1560
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:49,489
that's also a clue but I'm guessing that

1561
01:53:47,899 --> 01:53:51,288
it's not that we just like we're not

1562
01:53:49,488 --> 01:53:56,029
hitting it right now for whatever

1563
01:53:51,288 --> 01:53:59,719
magical reason right and that does seem

1564
01:53:56,029 --> 01:54:02,268
to be the case so so we'll have to hold

1565
01:53:59,719 --> 01:54:05,529
off on that for a little bit I'll go

1566
01:54:02,269 --> 01:54:05,530
ahead and go to the Q&amp;A now

1567
01:54:22,729 --> 01:54:34,649
and we will take it from there I I do

1568
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:36,959
also think that you know now one of the

1569
01:54:34,649 --> 01:54:41,369
things that is nice is we can put

1570
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:45,060
orphans around the orphanage you know

1571
01:54:41,369 --> 01:54:47,579
which we couldn't do before so we can

1572
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:57,810
also have that happening which I think

1573
01:54:47,579 --> 01:55:01,019
would be fun and you know that's pretty

1574
01:54:57,810 --> 01:55:03,330
easy right because it's just a that's

1575
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:04,830
it's exactly the same as AD cat you know

1576
01:55:03,329 --> 01:55:16,439
it's we don't really have to do anything

1577
01:55:04,829 --> 01:55:18,809
to put in those things if we want to add

1578
01:55:16,439 --> 01:55:22,019
an orphan then we can just set up the

1579
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:25,070
orphan and the body in the head part

1580
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:34,850
pretty much just is the same as the cat

1581
01:55:25,069 --> 01:55:37,170
I mean really everything's the same so

1582
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:39,840
anywhere and here we were using add

1583
01:55:37,170 --> 01:55:42,149
orphan and add cat you know you could

1584
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:49,350
almost add just it's really just the

1585
01:55:42,149 --> 01:55:51,179
same call but it would be it would vary

1586
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:54,720
slightly once we actually get more stuff

1587
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:58,350
going on so at that point if you wanted

1588
01:55:54,720 --> 01:56:01,140
to in the world Jen right you know where

1589
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:08,060
we add like cats and stuff in the place

1590
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:08,060
cat thing like

1591
01:56:11,719 --> 01:56:16,908
you know we can just add orphans in

1592
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,909
there

1593
01:56:30,069 --> 01:56:35,059
and I don't really know how we want to

1594
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:45,200
do that exactly but you know if you just

1595
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:47,270
did this mm-hmm also don't ask me why we

1596
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:50,989
don't have those tags a little bit

1597
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:52,550
differently here though but you know if

1598
01:56:50,989 --> 01:56:53,989
we wanted to start placing the orphans

1599
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:58,430
around we could just say like you know

1600
01:56:53,989 --> 01:57:00,199
it's an orphan so you know that's gonna

1601
01:56:58,430 --> 01:57:04,030
happen up in here and we'd have one of

1602
01:57:00,199 --> 01:57:04,029
these things where we place the orphans

1603
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:17,150
and we'd have Jen options for orphans

1604
01:57:13,689 --> 01:57:21,229
and really nothing happened special in

1605
01:57:17,149 --> 01:57:23,089
here because we want to do more stuff

1606
01:57:21,229 --> 01:57:25,399
eventually but for the moment we just

1607
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:28,430
like play some orphans so in here we'd

1608
01:57:25,399 --> 01:57:31,099
say like alright let's just place some

1609
01:57:28,430 --> 01:57:38,530
orphans here so for example leered we'll

1610
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:42,829
go in mmm and that's it

1611
01:57:38,529 --> 01:57:44,929
you know what I mean and since we know

1612
01:57:42,829 --> 01:57:47,090
that orphans are individuals in a sense

1613
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:51,200
we could just put roll that in there

1614
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:53,800
directly where we just say yeah like

1615
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:53,800
whoever that is

1616
01:58:04,408 --> 01:58:14,289
where's the asset tag ID I'm so you can

1617
01:58:11,139 --> 01:58:15,789
just say like put everyone in there you

1618
01:58:14,289 --> 01:58:21,719
know we can just say like let's put

1619
01:58:15,789 --> 01:58:21,719
people in there and you want like

1620
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:33,060
everybody so here's all the orphans

1621
01:58:50,819 --> 01:59:04,500
and they're now gonna be all placed it's

1622
01:59:00,359 --> 01:59:04,500
well the heroes not going to get placed

1623
01:59:21,029 --> 01:59:27,099
we need to set up some other tags as

1624
01:59:23,979 --> 01:59:29,709
well but you know that's the basic idea

1625
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:32,860
and so when we're creating things here

1626
01:59:29,710 --> 01:59:35,109
where we iterate over options you can

1627
01:59:32,859 --> 01:59:37,569
see here that there'd be options in

1628
01:59:35,109 --> 01:59:41,949
these things for the various orphans

1629
01:59:37,569 --> 01:59:44,109
if you can't place one here then we just

1630
01:59:41,949 --> 01:59:46,809
say you know you don't add that orphan

1631
01:59:44,109 --> 01:59:50,259
so that's fine and so if we just added a

1632
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:52,030
few options to who might be in here you

1633
01:59:50,260 --> 02:00:04,030
know we probably want to do like a

1634
01:59:52,029 --> 02:00:07,710
couple of these but all of these can

1635
02:00:04,029 --> 02:00:07,710
have an orphan and the cat probably

1636
02:00:11,069 --> 02:00:27,599
right I mean you know why not and the

1637
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:27,599
garden has an orphan so I don't know

1638
02:00:32,189 --> 02:00:40,448
something like that and then you would

1639
02:00:38,738 --> 02:00:42,459
have like orphans around the orphanage

1640
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:44,649
which is what you would expect because

1641
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:46,630
it's would be kind of dumb if it was an

1642
02:00:44,649 --> 02:00:49,899
orphanage that had no orphanage right

1643
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:51,909
and right now we don't do any work to

1644
02:00:49,899 --> 02:00:55,000
place the entities in the rooms they

1645
02:00:51,908 --> 02:00:56,879
just stack up at the bottom but hey like

1646
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,770
at least the orphans are in there now

1647
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:01,480
and so you know we can go like align

1648
02:00:59,770 --> 02:01:02,830
them properly and stuff if we want to

1649
02:01:01,479 --> 02:01:04,269
but at least it starts to be a little

1650
02:01:02,829 --> 02:01:06,010
more gamey like we can place people

1651
02:01:04,270 --> 02:01:09,310
around there and who knows what the

1652
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:10,960
orphans are doing probably want to give

1653
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:14,409
them some agency so they can hop around

1654
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:15,730
and do stuff but you know now any room

1655
02:01:14,408 --> 02:01:20,469
be going we'll probably have an orphan

1656
02:01:15,729 --> 02:01:22,779
in it or something oh I think there's an

1657
02:01:20,469 --> 02:01:24,399
orphan blocking our path out there we're

1658
02:01:22,779 --> 02:01:25,809
gonna have to read a Bolivia bug camera

1659
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:33,089
so we can see but I believe there's an

1660
02:01:25,810 --> 02:01:33,090
orphan blocking or exit so yeah

1661
02:01:45,128 --> 02:01:50,108
let's see what we're talking about here

1662
02:01:48,238 --> 02:01:53,678
are you going to create a level editor

1663
02:01:50,109 --> 02:01:57,729
no the game's entirely procedural so we

1664
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:59,739
will be doing level editing in terms of

1665
02:01:57,729 --> 02:02:02,378
code like everything that we generate

1666
02:01:59,738 --> 02:02:04,418
has to be able to be programmed in in

1667
02:02:02,378 --> 02:02:09,399
some kind of like a logical way of

1668
02:02:04,418 --> 02:02:12,550
creating it if that makes sense also by

1669
02:02:09,399 --> 02:02:14,530
the way the lighting bounds are just

1670
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:30,809
driving me nuts so I'm gonna hack those

1671
02:02:14,529 --> 02:02:44,259
for a second we'll fix them later so

1672
02:02:30,809 --> 02:02:46,389
yeah like in here I don't know why we

1673
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:48,010
were really even doing this I think we

1674
02:02:46,389 --> 02:02:54,128
were just acting this in originally cuz

1675
02:02:48,010 --> 02:03:01,079
it's obviously stupid but I'll just

1676
02:02:54,128 --> 02:03:01,078
expand it for now so if we say it bounds

1677
02:03:01,208 --> 02:03:14,458
equals can we do a Minkowski grow on

1678
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:24,519
these things or can we do an ADD radius

1679
02:03:14,458 --> 02:03:28,179
yeah so if I just make it larger can I

1680
02:03:24,519 --> 02:03:33,070
avoid having that horrible weird looking

1681
02:03:28,179 --> 02:03:34,748
stuff yeah so this will be slower

1682
02:03:33,069 --> 02:03:36,998
because the lighting is now covering a

1683
02:03:34,748 --> 02:03:42,988
much too large of an area you're right I

1684
02:03:36,998 --> 02:03:42,988
mean but I'm okay with that temporarily

1685
02:03:43,109 --> 02:03:46,409
all right

1686
02:03:48,529 --> 02:03:56,849
any thoughts of using deal DL opened at

1687
02:03:53,399 --> 02:03:58,409
all to do some hot lunching and stuff up

1688
02:03:56,850 --> 02:04:02,270
with the feedback loop

1689
02:03:58,409 --> 02:04:02,269
sorry no idea what you're talking about

1690
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:17,460
we already do hot load everything so if

1691
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:18,840
you want to you can just hot load code

1692
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:20,579
all the time that's what I did with the

1693
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:21,929
lighting bounds just then I don't know

1694
02:04:20,579 --> 02:04:25,409
if you noticed it but we didn't restart

1695
02:04:21,929 --> 02:04:29,340
the game you and I mean so like in here

1696
02:04:25,409 --> 02:04:31,109
if we just say oh yeah you know don't do

1697
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:32,640
that then you know it's compiling over

1698
02:04:31,109 --> 02:04:34,319
here right when it's done compiling

1699
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:36,719
it'll the lighting bounce will be

1700
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:41,609
screwed up right cuz now it's reloaded

1701
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:47,300
the code and then if you just you know

1702
02:04:41,609 --> 02:04:47,299
make a pilot it's fixed

1703
02:04:49,609 --> 02:04:54,019
how does the back buffer work when you

1704
02:04:52,010 --> 02:04:55,909
resize the window do you create a new

1705
02:04:54,020 --> 02:05:00,020
back buffer matching the window size

1706
02:04:55,909 --> 02:05:04,210
when the window is resized no at the

1707
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:07,670
moment we actually start up the game in

1708
02:05:04,210 --> 02:05:10,760
some specific resolution that we want

1709
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:16,340
and we scale that to the window size

1710
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:18,380
afterward and that will probably remain

1711
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:21,460
the way we do it later although we may

1712
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:24,140
occasionally change the back buffer size

1713
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:26,149
the reason we don't want to change the

1714
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:29,450
back buffer size every time you know

1715
02:05:26,149 --> 02:05:32,599
just to fit the window is because we may

1716
02:05:29,449 --> 02:05:34,849
like only run fast enough at like 1080p

1717
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:37,280
or something and then if they have like

1718
02:05:34,850 --> 02:05:39,230
a 4k display we don't want to just run

1719
02:05:37,279 --> 02:05:43,489
really slowly and beyond 4k we're on a

1720
02:05:39,229 --> 02:05:45,889
run like 1080p and then stretch you know

1721
02:05:43,489 --> 02:05:48,260
what I mean so we want the back buffer

1722
02:05:45,890 --> 02:05:50,210
to to not really be in sync with the

1723
02:05:48,260 --> 02:05:52,400
window size except potentially very

1724
02:05:50,210 --> 02:06:01,039
loosely if that makes sense

1725
02:05:52,399 --> 02:06:08,000
um and so I don't know if we really need

1726
02:06:01,039 --> 02:06:11,560
this to be quite as large as it is so

1727
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,560
maybe like

1728
02:06:19,099 --> 02:06:40,500
I'm just totally screwing with this by

1729
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:42,868
the way don't do this at home yeah so

1730
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:46,130
we'll compute that correctly later don't

1731
02:06:42,868 --> 02:06:46,130
worry I'm not gonna leave it that way

1732
02:06:52,488 --> 02:06:55,888
quick question what exactly is theirs we

1733
02:06:54,539 --> 02:06:56,729
had temporary 'no framer unit as the

1734
02:06:55,889 --> 02:06:59,130
temporary negate collective that

1735
02:06:56,729 --> 02:07:02,218
suffering oh yeah like I don't really

1736
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:03,659
want to do what we did there I was just

1737
02:07:02,219 --> 02:07:07,198
saying well it's the other I would care

1738
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:09,479
what I do so it's fine but you know

1739
02:07:07,198 --> 02:07:11,219
what's up it's just important to

1740
02:07:09,479 --> 02:07:13,500
understand always what's actually

1741
02:07:11,219 --> 02:07:15,359
happening in your code and I happen to

1742
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:18,090
understand it so I didn't say it but

1743
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:20,039
that was you know that was not correct I

1744
02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:23,190
should have said the full thing that was

1745
02:07:20,039 --> 02:07:25,380
happening there um so when you're in the

1746
02:07:23,189 --> 02:07:26,908
in-game editor right and you might have

1747
02:07:25,380 --> 02:07:29,250
some things that are variably sized and

1748
02:07:26,908 --> 02:07:30,868
you want them to just work I don't

1749
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:33,090
really like allocating and deleting

1750
02:07:30,868 --> 02:07:36,118
things I feel like it leads to

1751
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:39,869
inefficient code and it also encourages

1752
02:07:36,118 --> 02:07:42,569
a lot of busy work and and acts there

1753
02:07:39,868 --> 02:07:43,889
are prone stuff and so you know I don't

1754
02:07:42,569 --> 02:07:46,289
really like garbage section I don't

1755
02:07:43,889 --> 02:07:48,118
really like new and delete so I prefer

1756
02:07:46,289 --> 02:07:50,010
to just have arenas and I shove

1757
02:07:48,118 --> 02:07:52,170
everything into like one of two or three

1758
02:07:50,010 --> 02:07:54,599
arenas and they get cleared at certain

1759
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:56,368
times now one of the things that we

1760
02:07:54,599 --> 02:07:58,889
don't have in handmade hero but that I

1761
02:07:56,368 --> 02:08:00,839
would like and like in my own code bases

1762
02:07:58,889 --> 02:08:04,289
I have I just never really did it here

1763
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:07,440
was the concept that there's a sort of

1764
02:08:04,289 --> 02:08:09,238
temporary arena that just you can always

1765
02:08:07,439 --> 02:08:12,928
use you don't to have one just have a

1766
02:08:09,238 --> 02:08:15,689
temporary arena always what happens if

1767
02:08:12,929 --> 02:08:18,618
you just create a memory arena

1768
02:08:15,689 --> 02:08:21,928
uninitialized in the middle of the code

1769
02:08:18,618 --> 02:08:25,109
is the first time someone goes to use it

1770
02:08:21,929 --> 02:08:27,090
it will actually just allocate it will

1771
02:08:25,109 --> 02:08:28,710
call virtual Alec to get some space

1772
02:08:27,090 --> 02:08:31,110
right then

1773
02:08:28,710 --> 02:08:32,789
use it and then at the end when I clear

1774
02:08:31,109 --> 02:08:35,429
it it just wipes everything away that it

1775
02:08:32,789 --> 02:08:37,920
did but the reason that's not that

1776
02:08:35,430 --> 02:08:42,000
efficient is because I don't really need

1777
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:44,159
to funk down to virtual a lock right so

1778
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:47,100
what I should have done here that's

1779
02:08:44,159 --> 02:08:48,930
that's a way better way to do exactly

1780
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:52,620
the same thing and really isn't any more

1781
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:54,960
difficult I just didn't do it is that in

1782
02:08:52,619 --> 02:08:55,649
here you've got this frame arena you

1783
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:59,850
know what I mean

1784
02:08:55,649 --> 02:09:02,549
and so I could have just used the frame

1785
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:05,370
arena and stuck a temp block around it

1786
02:09:02,550 --> 02:09:07,770
right so if I had just done like

1787
02:09:05,369 --> 02:09:11,519
temporary memory like be contemporary

1788
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:16,290
you know what I mean here and said like

1789
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:22,440
frame arena or anything else just

1790
02:09:16,289 --> 02:09:26,010
temporary in it it would have worked but

1791
02:09:22,439 --> 02:09:27,239
you know this is fine too it's really

1792
02:09:26,010 --> 02:09:29,880
something that the language should do

1793
02:09:27,239 --> 02:09:38,309
for you but doesn't because it's C++ and

1794
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:40,579
it's horrible yeah what do you what do

1795
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:40,580
you do

1796
02:09:51,488 --> 02:09:56,419
as each character going to have an

1797
02:09:53,899 --> 02:10:04,519
animation sequence as NPCs or are they

1798
02:09:56,420 --> 02:10:07,310
all playable so they're all playable in

1799
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:13,610
a sense like meaning if you want to

1800
02:10:07,310 --> 02:10:19,699
switch characters you can I think so

1801
02:10:13,609 --> 02:10:23,448
like you know if I go up to one of these

1802
02:10:19,698 --> 02:10:27,919
characters here like they'll be a way to

1803
02:10:23,448 --> 02:10:30,559
just like talk to them and and switch

1804
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:32,449
and then I'll I'll like hot they'll like

1805
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:44,539
do a switch and then you're playing the

1806
02:10:32,448 --> 02:10:47,210
other character right and so there won't

1807
02:10:44,539 --> 02:10:48,800
they'll I will want them to move around

1808
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:50,600
occasionally though probably

1809
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:52,940
I mean maybe they'll just stand still

1810
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:55,250
and hang out so that you can easily go

1811
02:10:52,939 --> 02:10:56,988
up to them and talk but I don't know

1812
02:10:55,250 --> 02:11:00,859
maybe they'll be doing stuff it's hard

1813
02:10:56,988 --> 02:11:02,359
to say I'm not a game designer so I

1814
02:11:00,859 --> 02:11:04,899
can't I couldn't tell you but well

1815
02:11:02,359 --> 02:11:04,899
something will happen

1816
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:22,699
Patricia didn't rename the baby

1817
02:11:29,909 --> 02:11:44,750
all right I'll rename the baby the

1818
02:11:41,399 --> 02:11:44,750
baby's name can be Gramps

1819
02:11:54,488 --> 02:12:06,669
all right so extreme has ended

1820
02:12:12,878 --> 02:12:16,488
