00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,080
hello everyone welcome to hand me here

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,129
oh sure we could a complete game live on

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,940
stream we have our user interface stuff

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,839
working now to edit attachment points

5
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,789
but it's not quite complete

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,339
so we did the work necessary to kind of

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,559
use our debug UI system as well for

8
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,149
doing editing and we got that working on

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,089
the last stream but there's a couple

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,009
things that we didn't implement yet and

11
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,629
we sort of have options of how we might

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,510
do that and you know we'll we'll see how

13
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:32,039
we want to well see basically how we

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,890
want to kind of fuss around with that

15
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,109
but we've put ourselves in a good a good

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,840
position to attack it now so what I like

17
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:40,829
to do is jump in there figure out what

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,950
other stuff we need do and just

19
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,870
basically clean up that interface into

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,460
in a usability sense adding the features

21
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,250
we need to actually edit some of the

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,350
elements and adding anything else that

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,640
we need to make sure that it feels ok to

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,910
actually do edits on it and you know

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,710
we'll we'll see if we can get by the end

26
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:05,219
of stream to the point where we reading

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,650
those points fairly reasonably so that's

28
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,599
all we're gonna be doing and it's a it's

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,760
a fairly you know nicely contained

30
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,438
problem let me show you where we're at

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,600
on this and I'll mention sort of things

32
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,548
we're going to do probably in order but

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,199
there is no real importance to the order

34
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:25,700
it's just probably how we'll tackle them

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,570
so here's the game running right and we

36
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,728
go ahead and jump that full screen

37
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:32,188
there's a couple of you I do so the deep

38
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:33,478
of you I lost it's snapping stuff

39
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:35,429
because we kind of changed how the

40
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,259
render would week we want these things

41
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,579
to probably snap to the upper corner so

42
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,719
I'd like to kind of get that going I

43
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,328
don't want to have to keep dealing with

44
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,709
them going where they're going there and

45
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:45,389
and you know if you go like this then

46
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,709
they're off the screen entirely right so

47
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,090
you know I think we should try and

48
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,319
restore that folks like Allen that would

49
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,299
take very long it's something we should

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,008
probably fix but that's neither here nor

51
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,649
there that's just one we should take a

52
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,509
look at so when we have this interface

53
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,599
stuff you can see all we did is we just

54
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,859
kind of slammed that UI into the center

55
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,188
of the screen so the first thing you

56
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,450
want to do actually move this over here

57
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:08,368
so that it's kind of in the corner or

58
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,959
somewhere where it's like a window we

59
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:12,509
can actually interact with in a more

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,000
meaningful way that isn't just

61
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:17,818
at 0-0 because that's what I typed in

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,199
right not a very good reason we want

63
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,988
these to look more like buttons and we

64
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,908
also maybe want them to be a little bit

65
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,769
harder to hit I don't really want the

66
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:27,449
Save button like right next to my undo

67
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,090
button so you know we we want to kind of

68
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,530
get this UI into a more UI like state

69
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,378
right because we all we did was just the

70
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,000
bare-bones wiring necessary to have it

71
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,098
be in there and we didn't really spend

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,810
any time on actual human factors we

73
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:42,719
could do a little bit more there to get

74
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,579
that nicer right so I'd like to do that

75
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,250
again because remember this is just all

76
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:50,549
we're doing here is just this right all

77
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,409
we're doing is getting these debug

78
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:53,670
features here that we've got we're just

79
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,009
putting that in here that's all we've

80
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:59,488
been doing and so you know it's not it's

81
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,628
not really we haven't implemented any of

82
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,969
this stuff specifically the editor we've

83
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:07,078
just been using these buttons that we

84
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:10,348
made so like we made a long time ago so

85
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:11,640
you know we want that to work and so

86
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:14,369
moving that over there and having that

87
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,500
be some kind of a thing that we can more

88
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,389
conveniently access and use that's good

89
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,219
and then what we want to do is work on

90
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:22,079
these right here so some of these are

91
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:24,060
going to be pretty simple like to parent

92
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:27,769
is just a toggle right so clicking that

93
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,659
on and off that's gonna be really simple

94
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:33,090
same thing here with like type right

95
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,829
like that's just going to be like either

96
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,959
a click we could do a quick to just

97
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,280
toggle through things or we could have

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,598
like left and right arrows to go back

99
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,000
and forth between the different ones or

100
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,979
something but since there's not going to

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,419
be that many of those we probably don't

102
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,879
even really need a drop-down list or

103
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,630
anything so I don't even know that we

104
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,650
want to go through the trouble of

105
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,609
implementing something like that because

106
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,599
it's probably just overkill for what

107
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:53,790
we're looking at so we could probably

108
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,098
something simpler there as well we've

109
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:57,539
got this size and that's again also very

110
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:58,858
simple because even just a simple

111
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:01,409
interaction that would allow us to drag

112
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,909
up and down on it would be sufficient

113
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:04,079
and we already kind of implemented one

114
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,199
of those so we've really that would

115
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,480
probably very simple for us to implement

116
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,608
so really the big one that's a little

117
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,369
confusing that we haven't really done

118
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:16,348
much with is this percent P again though

119
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,389
we could just choose this out this is

120
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:19,978
just for us doing basic alignment work

121
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,989
so we could just mix anywhere week-old

122
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,418
on it and just move

123
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:25,098
around and it just adjusts the values of

124
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:26,870
it or something as we move you know so I

125
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,069
don't really think there's gonna be a

126
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,840
lot of work involved in doing these

127
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:30,710
that's not the primary part of it I

128
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,709
think it's gonna be pretty

129
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:35,149
straightforward right so I think we can

130
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,829
hack those in there pretty quickly and

131
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,788
they may just be good enough we do want

132
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:39,079
to pretty this up a little bit I think

133
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:41,269
like I said and make it a little bit

134
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,818
easier to use so there's some of that

135
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:46,008
that probably should happen so we'll

136
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:47,030
take a look at that but the biggest

137
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,520
thing that I think we're gonna have to

138
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:51,918
do in an implementation sense is once we

139
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,318
allow that sort of dragging ability like

140
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,629
of the size and that sort of thing what

141
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,879
we're gonna do is we're gonna we're

142
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:01,279
gonna run to a problem where our undo

143
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,658
just buffer just fills up because as you

144
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,448
drag it around trying to push on do unto

145
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:08,569
a new dota on there right and so one

146
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:13,250
thing that we probably want to do is we

147
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:15,590
need our like undo redo system instead

148
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,319
of adding an undo for every modification

149
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:20,658
that you make we needed to understand

150
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,819
the concept that when you start an

151
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:24,228
interaction you would create an undo and

152
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:27,319
when you end the interaction

153
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:29,839
you would write to that undo but no

154
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,120
matter how you drag the thing you're

155
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,098
only gonna save the initial state and

156
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:42,218
the end state and you're never going to

157
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:44,629
do any kind of any kind of like

158
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:46,098
recording of what all those motions were

159
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:47,418
you just need to know what was the

160
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:49,129
original size and what was the final

161
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:51,198
size cuz that's all the undo and redo

162
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:53,060
are gonna care about so we don't it's

163
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,050
gonna be way too difficult for the user

164
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,699
to deal with 8 million undos for their

165
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,500
drag they've got the whale on the undo

166
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:02,150
button forever to like get that undo

167
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,740
done so we don't want to do that right

168
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:04,848
so we're gonna have to dress that and

169
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,110
that's more of a real implementation

170
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:07,279
prom which we're gonna have to do a

171
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,658
little bit of thinking there and make

172
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,369
sure that we do that correctly in a way

173
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:12,228
that's easy to use so that as we add

174
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,468
things to the system if we add more edit

175
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:16,758
operations it's not a problem to to have

176
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:18,860
them still understand and go through

177
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:21,020
that system right so that's what we're

178
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,610
looking at and so let's start with just

179
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:25,788
the basics let's just warm up with some

180
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,900
basics here let's try to get these

181
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:31,459
things to be editable so like let's just

182
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:33,228
do you know get each of these things

183
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,638
editable and the other thing that I

184
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:37,329
would like to do here

185
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:43,999
is sort sort of consider the fact that

186
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:46,399
the that when we are done making these

187
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:48,650
things editable we should also stop

188
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,329
allowing click through on anything

189
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:52,098
that's sort of in this window region

190
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:53,810
because right now if you don't have a

191
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:56,028
valid thing to interact with it's

192
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,439
considered a selection so for example

193
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:59,930
let's say click on this which is not a

194
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,028
thing it actually just looks past it and

195
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,439
grabs whatever is on the other side as

196
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:05,269
opposed to what happens if I click on

197
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,400
this which is an own button it actually

198
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:09,859
it prevents the selection which is what

199
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,478
we want so we would like to also while

200
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,158
we're in the you know while we're going

201
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:15,168
through process we would like to think a

202
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:17,750
little bit more seriously about how

203
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:20,000
we're going to say what is and isn't a

204
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,550
valid click through and probably

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,870
everything within like a window region

206
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,759
of this editor - more or less right now

207
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,430
know how we want to say that maybe we'll

208
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:35,088
just make a size that it is over the

209
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,668
corner or something that is just gonna

210
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:40,158
be off limits so you click in there and

211
00:07:37,668 --> 00:07:41,658
it's never gonna do pick through because

212
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:44,120
that's just confusing and it's almost

213
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:45,740
certainly not what any user would want

214
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,629
to have happen like they're not going to

215
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,278
be just because the thing wasn't

216
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:51,050
interactive that they're clicking on

217
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:53,000
doesn't mean they want to select the

218
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,098
thing behind it usually you know maybe

219
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,810
they do but you know it's probably not

220
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:59,228
the most likely case so you know

221
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:02,810
principally surprise and whatnot there

222
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:05,718
so going over to the editor side of

223
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,399
things here what you can see in like

224
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,408
when we when we have all the stuff that

225
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:11,778
we were working on like the undo system

226
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:14,209
and stuff like that we've got these

227
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:16,069
buttons and the buttons have like an if

228
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:18,829
and then you do something in it and it

229
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:21,229
returns back the you know the true if it

230
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:22,938
was pushed and false otherwise right and

231
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:24,978
if we look at what happens with these

232
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,330
things here like editable boolean and it

233
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:28,848
will type double size you know those

234
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:30,649
sorts of things um the problem that we

235
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:33,439
get there again is that like I said

236
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:35,629
right off the bat we end up in a

237
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,360
situation where those things are gonna

238
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:41,208
push on undo records every time they

239
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,370
change now that may be a reasonable

240
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,078
thing for type and that may be a

241
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,459
reasonable thing is for it to parent but

242
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:48,629
it's not really good for size and

243
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:50,929
percent P so

244
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:53,580
as I'm looking at these as I'm doing the

245
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:55,620
actual implementation of the edit to

246
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,650
begin with what I would like to do is

247
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,740
maybe upgrade my notion a little bit of

248
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:04,590
what this end edit block actually is

249
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,840
going to get as a return and what I'd

250
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,970
like to do there is say look what if we

251
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,550
could switch on the end edit block

252
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:15,090
instead of just an if what if in here I

253
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:20,609
could say like you know edit block begin

254
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:23,280
modification you know edit block you

255
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,909
know and the modification that kind of

256
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,279
thing and so in here I could say look

257
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:31,919
here's a bunch of edits that happened

258
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,860
with these align points I'd like to know

259
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:38,759
whether we started one or whether we're

260
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:42,360
ending one right and with that

261
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:45,960
information I can go ahead and and you

262
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,250
know do something reasonable we could

263
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:53,250
also include the concept of cancellation

264
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:56,909
in here which is to say if you were

265
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,889
doing a drag and hit the Escape key or

266
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:05,129
who knows what our semantics would be

267
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:06,600
for that it's decaf by the way I don't

268
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:10,830
normally drink coffee this late but I do

269
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,330
like to drink decaf this late so if you

270
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,889
do want to cancel the modification we

271
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:18,840
could have that you know be handled

272
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:23,100
directly in here by just not committing

273
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:25,620
that undo at all right so what I'd like

274
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,070
to do here is just look at what that

275
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,320
would entail exactly and one of the

276
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,850
interesting things about that is if you

277
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,320
look at what happens with edit a line

278
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,529
point it's kind of got a couple

279
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,170
different phases to it right if you look

280
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:44,100
at what happens here it's sort of a has

281
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:49,829
the begin and end in it right it kind of

282
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:53,970
has those stages all going on inside the

283
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:59,950
routine you can see like it looks like

284
00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:03,610
this like this is and this is you know

285
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:06,700
again and this is during in a sense

286
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:10,409
right so you can kind of see what's

287
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:15,970
going on there and what we need to do is

288
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:21,669
break that up or you know we need to do

289
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,600
something that will allow us to renew

290
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:25,059
something that will allow us to

291
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,420
aggregate that now there's a couple

292
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:31,359
different ways we could do that and you

293
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:33,269
know thinking it through if we really

294
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,909
wanted to be a little fancier about this

295
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:39,730
maybe one thing we could say is what if

296
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:42,730
we just leaned on the undo system and

297
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,649
said maybe the undo system itself is

298
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,970
responsible for aggregating these things

299
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:57,639
you know maybe there's sort of like an

300
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:59,379
interim idea there that that maybe

301
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,899
there's like an interim idea there that

302
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:03,460
we can lean on that we don't have to

303
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:06,100
actually manually go through these

304
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,759
processes in the first place either

305
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,620
right and so maybe one thing we could

306
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,389
say is like maybe we could say something

307
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,299
we're like all right maybe the original

308
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:17,799
way was fine you know maybe maybe we

309
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:21,279
don't need to really think about those

310
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:27,059
things and maybe what we can do instead

311
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,059
is just say hey we've got this notion

312
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:32,559
already in the editor of these sort of

313
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,950
lists of changes so we've got these

314
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:41,219
things right and maybe what we want to

315
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:45,490
do is say like a in progress

316
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:47,649
you know list and maybe what we say is

317
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,120
when you're doing editing maybe instead

318
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,889
of things going on the undo stack maybe

319
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,429
they all go into the in progress stack

320
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:56,980
right and then only once you confirm and

321
00:12:54,429 --> 00:13:02,009
edit will those things actually go on to

322
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:04,690
the undo stack and until then they won't

323
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:08,679
what that allows us to do is it gives us

324
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:12,640
that cancellation ability right but it

325
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:13,509
also gives us the ability to merge so

326
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,939
when we say

327
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:19,120
edit a line point maybe what we can do

328
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:22,930
there is merge those changes when you do

329
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,480
this operation we can change it from

330
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:28,028
something that allocates a new one of

331
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,449
these to something that first looks to

332
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:34,750
see whether or not there already was one

333
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:39,819
edit of this type and if there was we

334
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:43,509
merge them together right that to me

335
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:47,139
sounds fairly compelling I like the idea

336
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:49,448
of that and so I think I'm gonna run

337
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:52,600
with that instead what that means is

338
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:54,189
it's nice we can ignore this for now we

339
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,470
can leave it exactly the way that it was

340
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,630
we don't have to change anything and

341
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,670
what I can do is just implement these as

342
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:04,379
I wanted to and then we'll come back to

343
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:06,578
it later in and get this working right

344
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,019
that sounds like the right approach to

345
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:09,969
me and that's what I'm gonna go with and

346
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:12,339
by the way the reason it sounded like

347
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,050
the right approach to me was what I

348
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,389
imagined my head was I was like okay

349
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:18,479
since I don't have a real reason to pick

350
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:21,068
one of the other in this particular case

351
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,039
what would a more complex case want

352
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:25,719
right if I because I don't have a reason

353
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,818
to pick one of the other here what would

354
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,370
our complex case want and in a more

355
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:34,500
complex case we might have operations

356
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,578
that do a bunch of things like

357
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,539
complicated loops that look over things

358
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:41,289
and make changes

359
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:44,198
I don't want those loops to have to be

360
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:46,088
aware of which points they've edited so

361
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:47,828
far in which ones they haven't I want

362
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,750
them to just go ahead and edit whatever

363
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:52,328
they want to edit and then I'd like the

364
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,458
undo system to go ahead and aggregate

365
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:58,198
any changes that have to be aggregated

366
00:14:54,458 --> 00:15:02,409
as that as a consequence of that process

367
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:04,838
that to me then said oh okay so I need a

368
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:06,939
basically like a little in-progress ring

369
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,470
that I can just say here's all the edits

370
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,690
that have happened that are not

371
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,240
committed yet that are up for

372
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,310
aggregation and up for cancellation and

373
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,740
then I'll just deal with those in bulk

374
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:20,549
that make sense

375
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,549
hold on well I'd each app

376
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:29,029
so if we now just go in look in this

377
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,070
part here knowing that I'm going to

378
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,659
handle that part later I can now do

379
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,220
things exactly order I said that I want

380
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:37,250
to do them which is just implement these

381
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,840
actual editor functions here and then

382
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,870
we'll deal with the the fallout from it

383
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,019
in a minute I'm gonna use the same trick

384
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,490
we used before to speak about which ones

385
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,199
of these things are actually happening

386
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,350
so I'm just going to go ahead and here

387
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,090
and add this a this sort of unique

388
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,340
identifier to each of these because I

389
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:58,009
think I will like that ability to sort

390
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,740
of track that as we go forward and so

391
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:03,649
because that gives me the option of of

392
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,389
having like multi-step UI and always to

393
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:09,110
know which one of them I'm talking about

394
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:11,179
and so on so now if I come back to here

395
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,560
and we go back and look at where those

396
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:15,049
things are being called like editable

397
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,279
boolean both type edible size right so

398
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,019
where those things were getting called I

399
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,220
now want the ability to do the same

400
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,500
thing I was doing before which is to

401
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,360
pass a dev ID here so that any

402
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,419
interactions that we have will kind of

403
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,639
work with these right we'll work through

404
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:31,009
these IDs so I'm just gonna sort of spam

405
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,990
those in there and how so each of these

406
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:35,149
will take one of those things now the

407
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,340
easiest thing by far to implement here

408
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:38,840
is the edible boolean the reason that

409
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,879
the easiest thing to edit is the edible

410
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,670
bullying is because really it's just a

411
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,649
button right so what we can do is we we

412
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,199
don't even really need to implement

413
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:50,209
another piece of code what we can do is

414
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,820
just call the button code and leave it

415
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,830
at that so for example in here editable

416
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,560
boolean Slyke label label text instead

417
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,150
of calling label we'll just call this so

418
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:02,179
when I come through here I'll say all

419
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:07,338
right and I can I would really like to

420
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:11,240
stress a lot of people are used to

421
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:15,198
looking at weird class tortured class

422
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:18,650
hierarchy sorts of stuff for UI it's not

423
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,779
great you don't have to do ridiculous

424
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,509
stuff like inherit from a thing in order

425
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:25,369
to get the functionality of the thing

426
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:28,069
functional composition works it just

427
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:29,719
works so if you have something like a

428
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,639
boolean and you just want to use the

429
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,130
button code for it just use it right

430
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,750
just write it as a function and then

431
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,820
they compose they compose

432
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,250
well you don't need to go through all of

433
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:43,819
that ridiculous object-oriented nonsense

434
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,480
to get basic things like composition it

435
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:47,839
just works

436
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,779
it objects are not needed that they're

437
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,909
just not relevant to it right it's a

438
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:55,910
separate kind of concept functional

439
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,930
decomposition just is a basic thing that

440
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,070
works in programming

441
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:04,970
it doesn't require these sort of overall

442
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:06,559
bearing mindsets to to get to so what I

443
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,110
can do is I can just say look the

444
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:13,639
boolean it's just a button so if that

445
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:16,039
button actually gets you know actually

446
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,120
gets pressed then I'm gonna take the

447
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,859
value and not it right so that's all I

448
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,349
want to do there right that's how that

449
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:26,599
works and so we can implement the

450
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:28,669
editable boolean really really trivially

451
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:31,069
once we have those IDs flowing through

452
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:34,850
properly and really all we need to do

453
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:36,980
there is say well we might want some way

454
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:39,259
of saying which one it is I don't know

455
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,750
that I need that to be like a colon true

456
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:43,490
or colon false or anything you know we

457
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,279
could make it be like a checkbox or

458
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:50,170
something like that it's hard for me to

459
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:54,019
say what the best way to do that is I

460
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:56,509
really don't know okay so one way we

461
00:18:54,019 --> 00:19:01,309
could do it is by leaving the label call

462
00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:03,710
in so we passed the label text here you

463
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:05,659
know I'm saying and then in here with

464
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,960
the button code we actually just switch

465
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,970
on the value and say well either we're

466
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,789
gonna draw nothing in the case where

467
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:16,549
it's not set or you know we're gonna

468
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:18,950
draw something or maybe to be a little

469
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:22,069
bit more specific we'll do like that

470
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:23,840
right and again you know a fancier UI we

471
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:25,970
draw something like a check box or

472
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,959
something like that but in this case I

473
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,759
don't know that I really want to go

474
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,319
through that kind of trouble because

475
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,500
again this is just a simple little UI

476
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,720
for us to use and so something like this

477
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,880
is really all that we want to be able to

478
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,259
do now I need to get this actually

479
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,540
working and for some reason I'm not

480
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:43,660
getting my

481
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:49,230
my call back there which I'm not sure

482
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:54,450
why we wouldn't because that should

483
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:57,880
properly give me my bow I never mind

484
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,769
that is working just fine we didn't

485
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,780
finish the last part of the problem so

486
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:03,400
beginning edit block is the thing that

487
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:07,000
controls whether these things ever get

488
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,980
written back right so in here where we

489
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,750
do our edit a line point this has to

490
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,610
return true in order for us to ever

491
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,009
reach this part of the code and actually

492
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:17,559
do the change so what that means is in

493
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:20,440
here when we're actually doing this we

494
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,529
have to these pieces of code have to

495
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,860
write to the layout and let this edit

496
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:28,539
block know right whether those changes

497
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,419
occurred so let's do that it's really

498
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:34,089
easy what we're doing here is you know

499
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,279
edited edit occurred or something like

500
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:38,349
that right we just want to set that to

501
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:40,240
true and all of these want to do the

502
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:44,919
same right they want to set it to true

503
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,829
as well okay so what do I do now is when

504
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,680
I sit that that edit occurred right I

505
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:52,779
want that to be tracked and probably

506
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,539
throughout just the layout struct right

507
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:58,000
so I want that to be tracked here as

508
00:20:55,539 --> 00:21:00,399
edit occurred and what I want to do is

509
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,140
in UI n o'clock now you'll notice and I

510
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,880
said this when I added it remember I was

511
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,740
a little bit cryptic about it but I said

512
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:13,360
this very specifically which I had some

513
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:16,210
water I forgot my water what I want to

514
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:19,029
do here is I want to make it so that

515
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:22,600
it's free to nest these edit blocks if

516
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:24,190
you want to write so I want to be able

517
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:27,579
to do like a begin begin and then amend

518
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:31,120
and and I want that to work I don't know

519
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:33,480
that I ever will use that but just I've

520
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:36,669
learned from having program for so long

521
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:40,630
that it's really free for me to do that

522
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:43,240
if I just leverage the function stack

523
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,370
the actual execution stack to do that

524
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,609
for me so you'll notice that when I

525
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:51,549
wrote this when I wrote begin an edit

526
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:53,388
block I had begin edit block return Debu

527
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:56,358
I edit block and I had that

528
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:58,908
passed in here why did I do that well

529
00:21:56,358 --> 00:22:01,308
the reason that I did that was because I

530
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:03,789
wanted to make sure that I could store

531
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:08,868
the previous state of edit occurred

532
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:10,969
somewhere and that gives me a place to

533
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:17,988
store it so now we know what's gonna go

534
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:27,558
in here right and now we know what's

535
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:29,719
gonna happen here okay so now when we

536
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:33,019
come back in here the result is very

537
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:36,320
easy for us to produce it's just didn't

538
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:39,409
edit occur didn't it and we can preserve

539
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:42,408
the nesting behavior by just going ahead

540
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:44,929
and taking whatever the blocks previous

541
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:47,809
value was which we saved and restoring

542
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:49,700
it if we had the mat and we wanted that

543
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:52,069
behavior we would have needed our own

544
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,298
stack here and that stack would have had

545
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:55,338
to have been limited or dynamically

546
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:57,259
allocated or some other less efficient

547
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:59,749
thing whereas if we just track the

548
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:02,028
program stack it just works right

549
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:05,808
because the program stack always has to

550
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:07,398
actually have that shape to it so that's

551
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:08,928
usually the way you want to do that

552
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:10,449
because it usually gets it for you for

553
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:13,219
free there some cases where it can't

554
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,499
specifically if you actually have things

555
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:17,749
that are non recursive that do their own

556
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:19,639
stack walking but even in that case this

557
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:22,338
can usually just go into the stack

558
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:25,338
storage so you almost always get it for

559
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:28,578
free if you do it this way and that's

560
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:29,778
much nicer right so I highly recommend

561
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:32,928
that and that's why I wrote it this way

562
00:23:29,778 --> 00:23:35,028
that means now we're done right that was

563
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:36,709
a whole thing it was literally like four

564
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:38,628
lines of code or something the tracking

565
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:42,078
of whether anybody edited anything

566
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:43,878
during that block and nesting and all

567
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:45,858
that stuff just a couple lines of code

568
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:47,748
really really simple right and that's

569
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:50,868
why I like that construction it's just

570
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:53,139
that simple um so here I can I can set

571
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:55,788
this thing on and off like you can see

572
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:56,868
and you know for some reason like I said

573
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:59,148
we were having some problems with our

574
00:23:56,868 --> 00:24:00,708
baseline computation I don't know why I

575
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:02,658
don't know when that happened do you

576
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:05,058
notice that like we lost our baselines

577
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:06,679
and I feel like that was was that

578
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:07,129
something that happened when we upgraded

579
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,990
our

580
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,760
format I want to look and see if that

581
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,680
was the case because I'd be interested

582
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:13,819
to know when that happened exactly we

583
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,340
should probably look at that we could

584
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:18,019
even look at that now

585
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:19,730
but anyway I think that's fine so so

586
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:22,759
there's the code for for the editable

587
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,349
point again really really simple again

588
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,049
one of the things that I really like

589
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:30,829
about these constructions is they they

590
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:34,490
let you do a tremendous amount of easy

591
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:36,619
work that you know you don't you don't

592
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,019
have to be too fancy or inherit base or

593
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:41,269
a stuff to do it's pretty nice now

594
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,849
coming up here is something that's a

595
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:45,950
little bit nasty because it's a case

596
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:49,879
where you want to be able to have more

597
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:51,980
flexibility but you as I think you'll

598
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,610
see in a second it turns out that we can

599
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:57,259
probably do a few quick gyrations and

600
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:59,599
actually still make it pretty easy to do

601
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:02,779
what we want to do so what I'd like to

602
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,369
do here on the dev ID side of things is

603
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:06,259
I would actually like to make two

604
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:08,629
buttons when I'm only getting called

605
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:11,240
with one dev ID you can see why that's a

606
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,080
bit of an issue right I because that

607
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,549
makes things a little bit more

608
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,829
complicated than them you know we would

609
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:18,289
have liked it to be but one of the

610
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:22,069
things that we can look at there is that

611
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:23,899
that actually because the interactions

612
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:26,779
themselves can have different states I

613
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,990
could probably get away with doing

614
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:31,490
something a little bit I can probably

615
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,950
get away with some shenanigans to make

616
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,240
this work but we can also just consider

617
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,670
making our dev ID a little bit more

618
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,140
expressive that would also be a totally

619
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,539
valid way to go so we'll have to see

620
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:46,400
which one we want to do but here's what

621
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:48,409
I want to do I want to basically have a

622
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,630
way to increment or decrement this

623
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,009
particular value that's here so I

624
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,190
effectively want to be able to do

625
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:59,930
something roughly along the lines of you

626
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:02,450
know this so we can basically increment

627
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:04,640
or decrement this thing and the Edit

628
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,009
occurs depending on which one we do

629
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,410
right and then we just have some like

630
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:11,480
you know crappy left or right arrows

631
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:16,640
that allow us to make those changes

632
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:20,569
right so it's two sub buttons this would

633
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:24,139
just work if we had some way

634
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:26,148
of taking a dev ID and making sort of a

635
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:28,579
subordinate version of that thing that

636
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:33,619
allows us to do more than one type of

637
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:36,710
edit to it which is the moment we really

638
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:38,898
don't have right we don't have a way of

639
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:42,710
making a subordinate version of the dev

640
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:45,199
ID and that's kind of a problem we would

641
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:48,740
like we would have liked there have been

642
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,210
some way for us to do that and at the

643
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,429
moment there really isn't much of a way

644
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,620
for us to do that so the question is

645
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:56,840
what's the best way for us to make this

646
00:26:54,619 --> 00:27:00,439
a little bit more flexible and how there

647
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,819
be some way to do that right well

648
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,370
there's a couple things that happen in

649
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:07,638
here that we may want to take a look at

650
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:09,138
so if we and I'm not sure which one I

651
00:27:07,638 --> 00:27:11,269
want to do yet so I'm kind of saying

652
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:12,979
this more as a provisional thing but I

653
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:14,359
want to go into dev UI and just take a

654
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,298
look at how this stuff is generally

655
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,339
structured right so in here there's some

656
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:22,429
things that we call some general things

657
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:26,959
that we ask that's what we use the the

658
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:28,309
dev you I stuff the dev ID stuff for we

659
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,669
do things like asking if two

660
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:33,888
interactions are equal right or asking

661
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:36,200
if two interactions are hot and what you

662
00:27:33,888 --> 00:27:38,928
kind of see there is the interaction

663
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:44,929
actually is a much richer structure than

664
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:48,889
just the dev ID so if we were to make a

665
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:53,240
more expressive version of our button

666
00:27:48,888 --> 00:27:54,859
call right meaning this right here if we

667
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,730
were to make a more expressive version

668
00:27:54,859 --> 00:28:06,519
of that so for example maybe something

669
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:13,839
that looks like this where we pass the

670
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:17,419
dev ID and a target parameter let's say

671
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:19,548
or a generic or something like that you

672
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:21,679
know like other information that we may

673
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:22,609
want to have on there so we know it's a

674
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,809
button so we know it's a button

675
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:26,719
interaction but maybe we want some other

676
00:28:23,808 --> 00:28:30,128
things so I can add another thing here

677
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,970
which is like you know some other

678
00:28:30,128 --> 00:28:40,669
operation like up you know

679
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:43,160
something like this or a classifier you

680
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:46,220
know then what I could do is when I come

681
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:49,580
through here I can set that classifier I

682
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:52,069
can set something there like the target

683
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:55,129
can be this or I can have the generic be

684
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:56,299
set to that whatever I want to do now

685
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,100
I'll actually be getting some

686
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:00,049
discrimination there what that means is

687
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:01,629
that when I call this function I get

688
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:04,819
more than I was getting when I called

689
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:08,360
one of these and so what I can do there

690
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:09,980
is I can now go all right when I call

691
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:12,319
this function I really just thump

692
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,660
through I say I've got a dev ID and I

693
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,899
don't have one of these classifiers off

694
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:20,450
we go and I just return whatever the

695
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,940
result is that I have now I've got a

696
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,950
more powerful version of the button and

697
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,350
so what I can do there is call that

698
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:30,799
version when I need to do things that

699
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:32,529
are more complicated like this right and

700
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,269
so it's pretty easy for me to do

701
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:37,430
basically whatever I want there I can

702
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:39,230
make up any old thing I can use this

703
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,990
string pointer if I want to write I can

704
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:44,930
do anything I want so I can literally

705
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:50,380
just do something like you know left

706
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:50,380
label right label right

707
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:08,210
and at that point I should be able to

708
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,490
have both of these things right they

709
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,960
should both be there now what's gonna

710
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,779
happen when I actually allow this

711
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,240
editing is we also need some notion of

712
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,798
what would be a legal value because

713
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,200
we're gonna immediately set these to

714
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,269
some pretty invalid values if I let that

715
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,929
actually be the entirety of the editing

716
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:27,918
right but it would work so this is you

717
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:29,240
know you can see them highlighting

718
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,990
separately so I think we're good to go

719
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:38,329
there right so what I want to do is I

720
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:39,740
want to also I suppose we should print

721
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:43,129
this out because we're not actually

722
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:55,009
printing this out yet either so we also

723
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:59,090
want to do this right I don't know if

724
00:30:55,009 --> 00:31:01,490
we've got where's our label F yeah we've

725
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:04,159
got our label F so I should be able to

726
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,990
do my label F here and correct me if I'm

727
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:20,240
wrong but I think we did some kind of

728
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:21,620
thing where we passed a Capitol yeah so

729
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,450
we actually already have a way of

730
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:25,009
outputting one of these strings that's

731
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,179
much more convenient than the normal C

732
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,319
way where you have to pass like the

733
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:29,600
count and then the length is two

734
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,859
separate parameters so we should also be

735
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:35,509
able to print out what the type

736
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:38,329
currently is and so you know that gives

737
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:39,890
us again another kind of like you know

738
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,659
we've got the type field there and I

739
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,130
should be able to kind of cycle through

740
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,509
these of course it doesn't look like I'm

741
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,940
actually cycling through these for some

742
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:48,950
reason so I have to see why but that's

743
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,410
basically all we're talking about there

744
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,150
right and so again we want to clean this

745
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,500
up it looks horrid and I also need to

746
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,660
figure out why we're getting those weird

747
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,230
why we're not getting proper baselining

748
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:01,910
on those values I really don't know why

749
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:03,620
but it may be that we're interpreting it

750
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,900
the wrong way round two I'm not sure so

751
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:07,519
we'll see what's going on there but so

752
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,679
let me just take a look at why we're not

753
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,139
getting the correct strings coming

754
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,910
through there or maybe if the

755
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,290
isn't happening properly would be the

756
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,390
other thing so we should probably take a

757
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:23,289
look and see if there's something weird

758
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:30,220
going on there but let me see what's up

759
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:40,180
so yeah if I look let's see here

760
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:45,220
so we're sort of doing a u3 tube pointer

761
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:49,570
if ocation of this which I'm not sure is

762
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:51,789
a good thing what we may want to do here

763
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:56,759
is actually grab it in a way that's

764
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:59,680
editable more like that just to be safe

765
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:03,069
let me make sure cuz I don't really know

766
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:10,000
if that cast is okay there it's probably

767
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:11,559
a problem so yeah if I want to call that

768
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,289
I have to cast it back which is fine

769
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:19,119
with me let's see here editor line point

770
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:20,559
I just want that to be you three two

771
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:24,399
because as I passed that in here I don't

772
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:27,009
really want that to be I don't want that

773
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,300
in the mix let me make sure that wasn't

774
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:30,190
part of the problem and then we'll go in

775
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,690
and debug it as we go yeah you can kind

776
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,660
of see like we're just not getting any

777
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:39,130
changes to the to the value there for

778
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:41,080
whatever reason and so I want to go see

779
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,000
why that's happening I also want to look

780
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:44,230
at this again - I don't remember what's

781
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,799
actually happened there so we're calling

782
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:53,890
a line point name from type so we're

783
00:33:50,799 --> 00:34:04,329
calling this and it's always returning

784
00:33:53,890 --> 00:34:06,880
this for some reason and so I don't know

785
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:11,769
why that's happening and we'll have to

786
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,390
take a look because yeah I don't I don't

787
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:14,829
know why that would be the case it seems

788
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:17,618
like that should be

789
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:20,139
incrementing but what I was gonna say in

790
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:22,778
addition to all of that which will go to

791
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,519
vote now is once you know that it edit

792
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:27,068
has taken place we need to actually

793
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:30,958
check the bounds so here we need to do

794
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:34,329
like if the type is greater than

795
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:38,228
whatever the the count is of these

796
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:43,959
things so these these types here that

797
00:34:38,228 --> 00:34:45,818
we're using for align points we want to

798
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:49,778
count in there and we want to say that

799
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:53,318
if we've gotten out of the bounds of

800
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:56,648
what's allowed here we want to make sure

801
00:34:53,318 --> 00:34:59,318
that we wrap that properly right and so

802
00:34:56,648 --> 00:35:01,150
there's two cases that could happen one

803
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:06,038
is that it gets decremented on zero

804
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:08,229
right and that would wrap us round of

805
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:10,959
course once you decrement to zero you've

806
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:13,899
effectively killed the type so it would

807
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:17,588
actually have to be recreated so I'm not

808
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:20,019
sure that case really matters much but

809
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:24,400
if we come out around here we would want

810
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:27,848
to wrap back around to probably to the

811
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:33,430
default I want to say you know two one

812
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:37,420
if we got past count is my guess and if

813
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:39,969
we got to zero so probably if we got to

814
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,759
zero we would actually want to set it to

815
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:44,739
count minus one because I we don't

816
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:46,269
really want you to ever set it to zero

817
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:47,679
because that's the same as deleting it

818
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:49,689
so we would rather have you click on the

819
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:54,608
delete key to make it clear that's what

820
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:57,309
you were doing and so that would prevent

821
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:59,920
that from now now we just have to go see

822
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:02,039
why this operation doesn't seem to

823
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,499
actually be doing anything I'm gonna

824
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,729
switch ourselves over to debug mode just

825
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,838
because if I'm in a step to do something

826
00:36:06,728 --> 00:36:08,439
I wanna be able to see everything more

827
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:10,748
clearly

828
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,979
Divac modes doing really only real way

829
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:13,598
to do that with the visual studio

830
00:36:11,978 --> 00:36:16,808
debugger it's not very good at debugging

831
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,140
release mode code so I'm gonna set a

832
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:22,150
breakpoint at editable type that should

833
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:26,440
just allow me to go in there and and set

834
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:28,670
a breakpoint once I actually have a

835
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,679
break let's actually break on

836
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,659
this function itself I'm gonna get rid

837
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:35,539
of that break point and then a set one

838
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:36,230
inside the two buttons so when I click

839
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:39,259
on one of these

840
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:44,568
I should see this occur right I should

841
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:47,540
get an actual operation that makes that

842
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:49,190
that case get hit so here if I select

843
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,259
one of these and I go over here and I

844
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:53,510
click on it right

845
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:56,960
I should see and I do right so I should

846
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:59,809
see this this occur so let me take a

847
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,460
look at what the watch variables are

848
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:10,420
here let's look at what that value is

849
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:10,420
it's properly set to default right now I

850
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:19,000
I don't know what I was thinking there

851
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:22,338
that's that's not at all what I wanted I

852
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,059
just didn't want that at all I wanted

853
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:29,900
that so don't ask me what I was thinking

854
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:34,420
about there because I don't know so yeah

855
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:36,588
what I wanted to do was not that I

856
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,559
effectively want to do this actually I

857
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:41,058
guess I should do it more like that what

858
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:42,230
I want to do is just think I might have

859
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:44,530
decrement this thing so that was

860
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:48,740
probably the entirety of my stupidity

861
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:51,589
wrapped up in that little equal sign

862
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:52,729
that wasn't supposed to be there all

863
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:54,739
right so let's take a look at that real

864
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,769
quick and just see if that fixes our

865
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,769
problem

866
00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:02,029
it doesn't still okay so maybe I wasn't

867
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:05,480
as stupid as I thought I was although

868
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:08,720
that was still stupid so I kind of was

869
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,449
whether we like it or not so if we stop

870
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:14,029
here here's that value I just want to

871
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:16,730
see that value change so it went up to

872
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:18,740
one so that's good and now I want to

873
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,880
take a look at why our value annotation

874
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:25,489
now what's interesting is if the value

875
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:27,858
was zero there that's actually kind of

876
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:29,539
strange because does that mean it it did

877
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:31,279
both of these that because that could be

878
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:33,519
what happened let's take a quick look

879
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,519
there

880
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,210
okay so that's what happened it

881
00:38:40,748 --> 00:38:44,498
decrements then increments those gonna

882
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,849
say looking at the old mobs like it

883
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:50,738
still should have worked it was just

884
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:52,778
really stupid-looking code so when we're

885
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:56,798
doing the button for some reason the

886
00:38:52,778 --> 00:39:01,420
interaction is not properly registering

887
00:38:56,798 --> 00:39:05,349
as having occurred or not and you know I

888
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:08,289
I think why I think it's basically

889
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:09,068
because inside the dev UI we we didn't

890
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:12,880
properly

891
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:16,528
we didn't faithfully maintain the fact

892
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,528
that these should have been interactions

893
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:25,210
right and and we want that to be the

894
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:30,639
case so in here I think what I want to

895
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:36,309
do is say yeah we want to create this

896
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:41,920
interaction and we want to do in our

897
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:45,819
equals for those right and that's

898
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:51,269
actually what we're gonna check and I

899
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:51,268
need to go see what the name of that was

900
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:57,220
its interactions are equal I don't

901
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,589
really know that we want to type that

902
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:01,598
every time our are equal would have

903
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:05,018
probably been better but you know life

904
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:11,430
goes on so we wanna yeah we want to just

905
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:11,429
make sure that whole thing is solid

906
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:27,359
and that should do it

907
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:30,690
so now we'll get the proper tracking

908
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:33,989
which is what I wanted and we should be

909
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:38,639
able to just move on to the next thing

910
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:42,838
hopefully let's see here yeah there we

911
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:48,058
go so now we can sort of set those and I

912
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:49,349
would probably prefer if we had some

913
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:50,548
better rendering of them so we're gonna

914
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:54,599
have to go spend a little bit of time on

915
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:56,849
that so things aren't horribly ugly but

916
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,650
otherwise it looks like our UI is now

917
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:02,568
working just fine right so I can cycle

918
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:06,298
through these things here and off we go

919
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:09,298
right so that's all good and so and to

920
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:10,818
parent is toggleable as well so other

921
00:41:09,298 --> 00:41:13,588
than the fact that it's horribly ugly

922
00:41:10,818 --> 00:41:15,329
and not very usable in that sense it's

923
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:16,558
all implemented properly now and so

924
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:17,910
we'll do the size and percent as well

925
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,640
and then we'll just clean up this line

926
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:22,679
so it looks pretty right that'll be the

927
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,598
next thing that we want to focus on and

928
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:28,108
maybe get a window around there as well

929
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:31,260
you know maybe that sort of stuff so in

930
00:41:28,108 --> 00:41:32,608
terms of like size and percent P again I

931
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:37,410
think these are just gonna be draggy

932
00:41:32,608 --> 00:41:40,019
kind of kind of operations right and so

933
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:41,969
if I if I go into the dev UI what I want

934
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:43,349
to see in here is first of all I

935
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:46,439
probably want to print out what the

936
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:48,990
values actually are somehow right I want

937
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:54,230
to build see them which is the moment we

938
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:58,009
cannot do and so inside editable size

939
00:41:54,230 --> 00:42:11,460
what I probably want to do here is say

940
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:14,000
yeah call the label F we'll pass in

941
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:18,358
something like this

942
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:24,059
maybe I don't know exactly what I want

943
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:26,119
to do there but we'll do something like

944
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:26,119
that

945
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:37,630
and the same will be true here I don't

946
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:40,330
if we just do drag manipulation we could

947
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:44,519
avoid passing the min and Max as well I

948
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:49,769
don't know what I think about that

949
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:51,909
because if you wanted to have ways of

950
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:53,019
controlling what the range was I think

951
00:42:51,909 --> 00:42:57,730
we're still gonna want it so I think I'm

952
00:42:53,019 --> 00:43:02,530
gonna keep passing that honestly that's

953
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:06,639
just my that's just my guess so yes so

954
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:09,070
here's the X here's the Y and then what

955
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:12,279
I want to do is add the ability to drag

956
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:16,420
those around right have a way of playing

957
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,910
with those and so in here if I select

958
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,619
one now we can see that those are

959
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:22,059
actually printed out there and so what I

960
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:24,309
want to be able to do is like highlight

961
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:26,619
one of these and drag it around right

962
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:28,449
have the ability to actually to actually

963
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:30,759
move that and so what I think we're

964
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:34,000
gonna have to move from is like label F

965
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,910
right I don't really want to do in that

966
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,920
case what I want to do is I want to

967
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:42,399
actually do more what label F is

968
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:45,099
actually calling through to like basic

969
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,099
text element where I can define my my

970
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:51,460
own interaction that's gonna happen and

971
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:56,440
my own like specifics about all of this

972
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:59,440
stuff right so let me go ahead and call

973
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,750
that I don't know if I care about the v2

974
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,369
I don't think I do

975
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:05,190
but basically what I want to do here is

976
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:09,099
just say okay

977
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:13,980
when you do this right and we've got

978
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:13,980
that label F call right when you do this

979
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:26,639
just go ahead and make this out of what

980
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,639
you've got

981
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:33,318
like that and then call basic text

982
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:36,829
element yourself with whatever the thing

983
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:40,009
is that you that you've got the

984
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:44,480
interaction here can be whatever we're

985
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:49,030
going to make it and the rest of these

986
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:57,829
things we can set however we want I

987
00:44:49,030 --> 00:45:00,950
probably will keep these I don't really

988
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:04,849
know about the border part of it the

989
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:07,639
backdrop color obviously can just be

990
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:09,769
some yeah I don't know what it should be

991
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:12,338
whatever it is for these things right

992
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:12,338
like

993
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:28,369
so we should be able to do something

994
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,619
here where now we can take more control

995
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:33,289
that process and make an actual widget

996
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:34,670
for lack of a better term that just lets

997
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:36,470
us do the drag interaction that we

998
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,670
wanted which I don't really know what

999
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:39,139
it's going to be but you know we'll

1000
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:48,780
implement something that we think is

1001
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:49,929
reasonable so yeah so in here like if I

1002
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,430
[Music]

1003
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:54,169
have this thing now you can see that I'm

1004
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:57,379
drawing it there I feel like it wants a

1005
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:59,358
boarder probably I don't know how big it

1006
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,480
wants the border to be I guess why did I

1007
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:06,019
recompile I could've just done that live

1008
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:09,710
and probably should have so let's try

1009
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:16,788
that so the border didn't seem to do

1010
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:23,000
anything did it I can't see I don't see

1011
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:31,220
that doing anything what is basic text

1012
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:32,150
elements use of the border or maybe

1013
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:36,949
that's just too tiny

1014
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:43,579
oh that's in pixels okay that makes a

1015
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:46,129
little more sense so that's more of a

1016
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:48,140
reasonable thing right

1017
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,640
and so you know I don't know how big we

1018
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,318
want to make that really but it might

1019
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:53,509
want to be bigger than that right it

1020
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:56,119
might want to be more like six right

1021
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:58,010
that's a pretty reasonable size to click

1022
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:01,818
on and then I can kind of you know zoom

1023
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:03,980
around on it right I think we also want

1024
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:06,619
more spacing in between these two but

1025
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,179
that's kind of a you know look I said

1026
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:11,778
when we go to pretty up this line we'll

1027
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:14,838
take that a little bit more seriously so

1028
00:47:11,778 --> 00:47:18,829
yeah again same exact thing happened in

1029
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:22,578
here and in this case again we just have

1030
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:24,500
kind of another different type of

1031
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:27,019
editing operation that's gonna happen

1032
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,760
there I also don't know if maybe this

1033
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:31,278
should just be a part of V to like

1034
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,140
editable v2 I think that might have been

1035
00:47:31,278 --> 00:47:37,920
just dumb that I didn't do it that way

1036
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:40,798
and so we'll see we'll dress that in

1037
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,200
in one moment so looking at the dev yuan

1038
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:45,780
interaction we know we can introduce a

1039
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:49,439
thing here like for example toggle value

1040
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:51,480
I'm sorry a drag value which we have we

1041
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,130
can do something like that but my

1042
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,190
question is like what's the editing here

1043
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:59,910
and so if you look we've got like a star

1044
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:03,450
P that it's being edited what we

1045
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:09,960
probably can do is make that start we

1046
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:11,939
can probably make that star P we can

1047
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,349
probably make that star P be something

1048
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,760
that works whether you're dragging one

1049
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,349
variable or - right because that's

1050
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:20,400
probably what was happening in the

1051
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:27,510
previous drag value stuff so I think the

1052
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:31,440
only real issue here is there isn't

1053
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:36,030
anything that says how far the value

1054
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:41,900
should move relative to your drag right

1055
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:44,369
like there is no we're just not

1056
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:48,690
including anything that gives you

1057
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:53,010
information about that and that's

1058
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:55,139
unfortunate that's about the only

1059
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:57,030
blocking factor because we'd like to

1060
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:59,338
include some stuff about like what the

1061
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:02,730
boundary like what how fast it should

1062
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:07,230
move when it's moving the Delta you know

1063
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:09,798
essentially and that's just not that's

1064
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,798
not forthcoming

1065
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:14,599
[Music]

1066
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:39,119
so I don't have a lot of ideas about

1067
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:42,309
what the right way to do that would be

1068
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,839
there's a lot of options but I don't

1069
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:47,369
know that there's one of them that I

1070
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:50,050
find particularly compelling necessarily

1071
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:54,250
what I can say is I do think that

1072
00:49:50,050 --> 00:50:11,800
reinforces my sort of belief that these

1073
00:49:54,250 --> 00:50:14,320
should largely be V twos right so here's

1074
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,580
the thought if we do feed this back then

1075
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,470
I guess we don't really need to do that

1076
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:19,630
because we are sort of doing a thing

1077
00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:22,119
that returns results more immediately

1078
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:25,329
what I could do here is just return the

1079
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:28,539
total mouse movement in question and

1080
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:30,789
just use that so that does seem

1081
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:38,529
reasonable and so if I come through here

1082
00:50:30,789 --> 00:50:40,779
and say oh yeah like the hot interaction

1083
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:43,600
or just the interaction that's currently

1084
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:49,900
ongoing is my interaction so if I'm

1085
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:57,670
basically saying look yeah if this

1086
00:50:49,900 --> 00:51:00,420
interaction is the one in that's that's

1087
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:00,420
actually happening

1088
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:12,260
so I am currently interacting with this

1089
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:21,680
thing then we could just do this right

1090
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:25,580
so like the D Mouse P and the emails can

1091
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:27,739
why those take effect if this is the

1092
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:33,579
current thing that's getting interacted

1093
00:51:27,739 --> 00:51:35,929
with right and so that seems pretty good

1094
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:40,489
so all we would have to do there is just

1095
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:42,559
actually stuff the dev ID in there so

1096
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:45,469
inst in here where we're actually doing

1097
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:49,009
the ID and the type just has to be equal

1098
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:51,500
to any any type really we we don't

1099
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:54,980
really even need a different one we can

1100
00:51:51,500 --> 00:52:03,590
just make that be sort of a generic

1101
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:05,599
thing so immediate button you know I'll

1102
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:07,690
make another one we don't even really

1103
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,280
need it as I guess what I'm saying but

1104
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:12,829
it's just a draggable interaction I

1105
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,180
guess you know any draggable so if you

1106
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:17,509
end up interacting with it as a

1107
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:18,199
draggable thing then we just that's all

1108
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,770
we needed

1109
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:23,629
and we're you know we're good to go that

1110
00:52:21,769 --> 00:52:28,269
should be fine because then we can also

1111
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:33,050
do like a dxdy here sort of a situation

1112
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:37,849
and that allows me to take the min and

1113
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:41,089
Max and use those as ranges right so I

1114
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:42,470
can basically say look the the amount

1115
00:52:41,088 --> 00:52:49,489
that we want to move here is gonna be

1116
00:52:42,469 --> 00:52:52,789
the max minus the min you know I want

1117
00:52:49,489 --> 00:52:57,289
some fidelity of the range so you know I

1118
00:52:52,789 --> 00:53:01,039
want like a hundred steps of that so you

1119
00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:04,279
know that is how far you should move

1120
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:10,029
when you drag this thing back and forth

1121
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:10,030
right um that seems good to me

1122
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:14,980
reasonable you know

1123
00:53:15,768 --> 00:53:22,919
seems good to me and so that allows me

1124
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:26,009
also here I don't know exactly how I

1125
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:35,519
want to edit this particular value in

1126
00:53:26,009 --> 00:53:38,159
this case but that's mostly all we're

1127
00:53:35,518 --> 00:53:41,608
talking about so here what I can do is

1128
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:52,889
say well you know I want to be able to

1129
00:53:41,608 --> 00:53:54,838
do this probably Y could be X plus y I'm

1130
00:53:52,889 --> 00:54:00,118
not sure which one I want to do but

1131
00:53:54,838 --> 00:54:02,190
something like that so what I want to do

1132
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:04,740
in this case is I want to sort of say

1133
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:06,809
well I want to move this thing but I

1134
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:11,179
want to move it proportional to how big

1135
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:16,980
it already is right so if the thing is

1136
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:19,379
you know if the thing is 10 I want to

1137
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:21,719
move it you know 0.1 each time or

1138
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:25,980
something so I kind of want something

1139
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:27,808
you know that looks like that right and

1140
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:31,079
the problem with doing it that way is

1141
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:35,670
that doesn't properly respect the fact

1142
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:37,380
that it's a continuous thing so because

1143
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:39,329
you end up in a situation where what

1144
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,068
you're essentially writing here is an

1145
00:54:39,329 --> 00:54:44,609
ordinary differential equation an

1146
00:54:41,068 --> 00:54:49,018
equation where the change in the value

1147
00:54:44,608 --> 00:54:50,699
is proportional to the value handling it

1148
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:54,479
discretely like this leads to some nasty

1149
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:59,608
edge cases so we may want to say here

1150
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:05,579
handle this as a real OD II might want

1151
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:10,199
to actually happen right okay uh so

1152
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:13,650
anyway let me make this happen just so

1153
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:15,268
we can compile and get this working so

1154
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,769
we need to obviously have the UI be

1155
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:21,500
something that's that's known to these

1156
00:55:16,768 --> 00:55:28,579
functions and we also need to be able to

1157
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:34,210
let's hear this is interaction we also

1158
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:42,170
need to have this actually be handled so

1159
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:45,260
finish printing these right now remember

1160
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:46,430
we only have immediate button oh god

1161
00:55:45,260 --> 00:56:01,460
what have I done

1162
00:55:46,429 --> 00:56:03,259
there we go we that's the only thing

1163
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:09,108
that we actually have to so we need to

1164
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:13,869
make sure that we also have draggable so

1165
00:56:09,108 --> 00:56:13,869
really as you can see you know we don't

1166
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:20,059
we don't really need two cases because

1167
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:22,340
they're basically the same so in either

1168
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:28,420
case they can just be going through here

1169
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:32,450
and it's you know good enough right so

1170
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:35,809
let's see how that shakes out if I want

1171
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:39,679
to start dragging one of these well I'll

1172
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:45,019
be honest not working particularly well

1173
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:48,858
not great not fabulous but at least it's

1174
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:50,329
highlighted so you know okay not a

1175
00:56:48,858 --> 00:56:52,759
stunning victory you know now sending

1176
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:55,969
victory it's true but let's take a look

1177
00:56:52,760 --> 00:57:02,470
at what's going on in here and see why

1178
00:56:55,969 --> 00:57:02,469
that's happening okay okay so

1179
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:11,660
the UI interaction here should

1180
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:13,280
definitely these should be equivalent

1181
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:18,980
because we're setting them to the same

1182
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:21,680
things far as I know right so when you

1183
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:26,929
do a mouse down on those it should be

1184
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:35,210
setting the hot interactions should get

1185
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:37,899
taken here so I'm not really sure why

1186
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:41,039
that wasn't working

1187
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,039
[Music]

1188
00:57:51,579 --> 00:58:07,789
hmm Saudi mouse pee may not be set

1189
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:12,488
during that run through I'm not super

1190
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:15,799
certain about that let me just make sure

1191
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:17,088
and then we'll just step through it

1192
00:58:15,798 --> 00:58:19,489
after I check that out

1193
00:58:17,088 --> 00:58:32,210
so during beginning you I frame know

1194
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:37,059
it's set I mean there it is right so it

1195
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:37,059
sure seems like that should be valid

1196
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:45,730
I'm gonna go ahead and step in there and

1197
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,460
then and just see what's going on

1198
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:50,949
because I don't know hopefully it will

1199
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:54,460
be clear and we won't have to puzzle too

1200
00:58:50,949 --> 00:58:55,029
much but if it's not that's just the way

1201
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,980
of the world

1202
00:58:55,030 --> 00:59:01,630
that's just the way the crooked crumbles

1203
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:04,780
all right so let me go ahead and set a

1204
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:07,720
breakpoint there let's just look at

1205
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:10,210
what's going on in that at that piece of

1206
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:15,689
code right so in here we're we're doing

1207
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:21,490
one of these we'll just say okay let's

1208
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:28,450
let's break in one of these anytime I'm

1209
00:59:21,489 --> 00:59:39,250
dragging I should hit that so I am

1210
00:59:28,449 --> 00:59:42,149
hitting it oh did the same thing you

1211
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:47,619
never learned you never do learn do you

1212
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:49,750
as I said before and as I had to well I

1213
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:52,239
guess I predicted it before so I didn't

1214
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:54,849
actually have to debug to find it but it

1215
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:57,159
you know it's still not really a valid

1216
00:59:54,849 --> 00:59:59,559
excuse we need to say whether edits

1217
00:59:57,159 --> 01:00:01,059
occurred because otherwise nobody in the

1218
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:03,639
outside code will know that they need to

1219
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:05,529
update what they're doing so technically

1220
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:08,079
this should always look like this right

1221
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:11,410
we should always set edit occurred after

1222
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:13,480
we do something where we where that the

1223
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:15,219
edit system should respond you know

1224
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:20,139
anyone on the outside who needs to do

1225
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:25,329
work should respond I so we've got that

1226
01:00:20,139 --> 01:00:27,759
working now and we can go ahead and see

1227
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:29,710
if this happened yeah so that's fine all

1228
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,260
right so now I can i can drag left to

1229
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:34,809
right and i can drag up and down so

1230
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:39,370
that's good so i should be able to set

1231
01:00:34,809 --> 01:00:42,579
these percents pretty easily now and i

1232
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:46,529
need to cap you know make sure those

1233
01:00:42,579 --> 01:00:46,529
things stay within bounds

1234
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:52,329
i'm not sure why it's doing like a mod

1235
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:53,829
style thing there oh i know why because

1236
01:00:52,329 --> 01:00:54,869
these are stored in a way that

1237
01:00:53,829 --> 01:01:01,679
automatically clamp

1238
01:00:54,869 --> 01:01:08,819
that's why this also looks like it's

1239
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:09,779
working just fine so I think we're

1240
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:11,700
pretty much good to go

1241
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:17,280
that's that's all the things we actually

1242
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:19,309
needed um so yeah not really very

1243
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,900
difficult right pretty basic stuff

1244
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:25,519
nothing too hard there and now

1245
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:29,910
everything is properly being ended again

1246
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:32,820
the undo stream is getting spammed left

1247
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:38,879
and right so let's let's do one thing

1248
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:40,740
real quick let's go into the WI system

1249
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:45,539
and I just want to put in the clamping

1250
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:49,979
there so I want to do like clamp and I

1251
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:56,789
want to do min x max X there and I want

1252
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:59,360
to do a clamp here as well mmm so oh

1253
01:01:56,789 --> 01:01:59,360
whoops

1254
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:09,659
and again I just want to do that clamp

1255
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:11,429
because since we are passing them in and

1256
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:13,199
max in we might as well just do that

1257
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:14,819
work for the user because everyone

1258
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:16,980
obviously who hasn't been and Max is

1259
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:20,519
gonna want us to clamp for them

1260
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:23,340
that's just unsurprising right so that

1261
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:25,110
way we can't go below one and we can't

1262
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:29,070
go I'm sorry can't go above one I can't

1263
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:32,370
go below - right so that just allows us

1264
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:37,460
to edit that you know easily which is

1265
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:37,460
what I want okay

1266
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:43,460
so that's simple no issues there

1267
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:45,409
this one doesn't take a minute max so it

1268
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:47,750
doesn't clamp we could take a minute max

1269
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:48,619
if we wanted to I don't know whether we

1270
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:53,440
want to or not

1271
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:55,609
that's really up to us so that's all

1272
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:59,389
simple pretty simple and straightforward

1273
01:02:55,610 --> 01:03:01,340
and I again want to just underscore the

1274
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:02,900
spamming part that's probably what we

1275
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:06,650
should go look at next and then we'll go

1276
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:07,789
look at the beautification aspect of it

1277
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:11,090
just to try and make things less ugly

1278
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:14,000
right so here I am wiggling this all

1279
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:16,430
around right and now if I want to undo

1280
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,849
that what you can see is I've got to

1281
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:23,359
undo like the whole thing right and it's

1282
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:27,559
just like that's not what that is right

1283
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:32,599
when I do an operation like that I want

1284
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:35,960
to have some way of bulking those up so

1285
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:39,319
let's go upgrade that system a little

1286
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:45,769
bit before we go on to the

1287
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:48,769
beautification beautification so what we

1288
01:03:45,769 --> 01:03:50,179
want to do here is well as a couple

1289
01:03:48,769 --> 01:03:52,869
things you want to do here but what we

1290
01:03:50,179 --> 01:03:56,269
want to do here is we want to make sure

1291
01:03:52,869 --> 01:03:58,339
that we have a more robust way of

1292
01:03:56,269 --> 01:04:01,309
tracking these things write these

1293
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:03,769
in-game edits and so what I'd like to do

1294
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:05,929
is change the way we're getting those to

1295
01:04:03,769 --> 01:04:14,329
be a little bit more to be a little bit

1296
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:18,049
saucy err right so when we do one of

1297
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:20,480
these edit operations what I want to do

1298
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:23,539
instead of allocate editor edit here I

1299
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,809
want to do like a find editor edit

1300
01:04:23,539 --> 01:04:31,690
really right so I want to do something

1301
01:04:26,809 --> 01:04:31,690
more like this

1302
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:49,978
something like this or you know get or

1303
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:55,380
create/edit in progress you know like

1304
01:04:49,978 --> 01:04:57,178
because I want to essentially I want to

1305
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:00,419
essentially look to see if I have one of

1306
01:04:57,179 --> 01:05:10,139
something and then if I do I will use it

1307
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:12,118
right uh so how I do that exactly is its

1308
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:15,208
gonna change a little bit the way that

1309
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:19,459
this stuff works so first of all this is

1310
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:21,989
gonna want to be more down here right so

1311
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:24,868
this is gonna be a regular function now

1312
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:26,338
that just operates directly and this is

1313
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:33,298
going to be the function that actually

1314
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:38,668
does the thump through okay so well

1315
01:05:33,298 --> 01:05:42,208
thunk through on that in some way and

1316
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:44,969
then we'll we'll use this that that in

1317
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:47,458
game end it to work so the problem that

1318
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:49,979
will run into immediately is that how

1319
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:52,288
edits are merged will have a lot to do

1320
01:05:49,978 --> 01:05:54,478
with what they're storing and so what we

1321
01:05:52,289 --> 01:05:57,959
need to do is we need to do more of a

1322
01:05:54,478 --> 01:05:59,698
provisional push where we say look this

1323
01:05:57,958 --> 01:06:03,239
is the information that we are gonna

1324
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:05,969
need to be true can you get us something

1325
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:07,318
that has that which means this isn't

1326
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:12,179
really gonna be how we're gonna want to

1327
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:14,338
do it not exactly what we're gonna want

1328
01:06:12,179 --> 01:06:15,858
to do here is like say this is what

1329
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:19,739
we're looking for

1330
01:06:15,858 --> 01:06:22,768
this is our match if you will and so

1331
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:30,208
when we set the match we would set like

1332
01:06:22,768 --> 01:06:32,518
the type and the asset index and the

1333
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:35,969
align point index because those are the

1334
01:06:32,518 --> 01:06:39,738
things that actually matter right so

1335
01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:43,699
what we want to do here is say okay like

1336
01:06:39,739 --> 01:06:43,699
let's put those things in place

1337
01:06:52,519 --> 01:07:01,460
what's this called so we wanted to say

1338
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:07,639
alright get us you know get me one of

1339
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:10,429
those things and I'm gonna pass you the

1340
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:13,789
match type for that and I want you to

1341
01:07:10,429 --> 01:07:19,460
return me one that I can use you know I

1342
01:07:13,789 --> 01:07:22,489
mean um to me so we're gonna need to use

1343
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:23,690
something like that right that's you

1344
01:07:22,489 --> 01:07:27,618
know we're gonna need to do something

1345
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:28,099
like that and I'm not sure exactly how

1346
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:30,260
I'd do it

1347
01:07:28,099 --> 01:07:33,529
I guess one way I could do it too is I

1348
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:35,540
could do it like this the align point

1349
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:49,519
edit where I do the match right I could

1350
01:07:35,539 --> 01:07:53,480
do it more like this sort of a thing so

1351
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:56,210
I just pass an abstract match sort of

1352
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:58,159
type here something like that if that

1353
01:07:56,210 --> 01:08:02,030
gets used in the matching and off we go

1354
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:07,519
that seems plausible so you know in

1355
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:09,380
there if if it works if it's a new one

1356
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:11,150
it'll just assign whatever this thing is

1357
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:13,940
to it maybe something like that

1358
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:16,909
I don't know right so it'd be something

1359
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:20,020
like this and

1360
01:08:16,909 --> 01:08:20,019
[Music]

1361
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:35,840
maybe like this sort of thing right so

1362
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:37,760
we'd say okay here's the initial value

1363
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:41,750
that we would have saved

1364
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:44,720
we'll give you that will then ask you to

1365
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:46,220
give us back either one that exists or

1366
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,480
one that doesn't exist if it doesn't

1367
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:56,360
exist I'm assuming you will set it right

1368
01:08:49,479 --> 01:09:01,179
and then from there I'm going to change

1369
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:01,179
make the change and store the new value

1370
01:09:03,489 --> 01:09:11,329
seem fair maybe I don't know

1371
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:12,800
does it maybe it doesn't but I think

1372
01:09:11,329 --> 01:09:15,590
that's good like I think that's roughly

1373
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,909
what we want to do and so in here what I

1374
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:19,900
want to do is I want to say all right

1375
01:09:16,909 --> 01:09:24,380
this will take a void star that's like

1376
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:25,670
here's the match data to use so when we

1377
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:27,859
come through and do the getter

1378
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:36,170
create/edit in progress we want to look

1379
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:38,239
through all of the things that we

1380
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:42,500
currently have in progress which will be

1381
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:44,359
this stuff here right and we want to see

1382
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:49,789
if we can find one that matches so we

1383
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:55,939
want to do like in game edit test equals

1384
01:09:49,789 --> 01:10:04,310
in progress sentinel next and i want to

1385
01:09:55,939 --> 01:10:06,679
say this can't be equal to this because

1386
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:11,110
it's a sentinel based list so we have to

1387
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:13,310
go until we hit the sense of all right

1388
01:10:11,109 --> 01:10:14,869
so that would look over all of the

1389
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:16,789
things we want to test and then what we

1390
01:10:14,869 --> 01:10:19,909
need to do is look in there and see are

1391
01:10:16,789 --> 01:10:23,989
the align points the same so I mean that

1392
01:10:19,909 --> 01:10:26,329
unfortunately is a case based thing

1393
01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:27,889
right we can't we don't want to check

1394
01:10:26,329 --> 01:10:30,949
the change part we just want to check

1395
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:36,950
these two so it's actually specific to

1396
01:10:30,949 --> 01:10:38,760
the type so the align point editor here

1397
01:10:36,949 --> 01:10:41,429
right we have to say like

1398
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:43,170
first of all if the test type equals the

1399
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:45,300
type then we can check otherwise we

1400
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:49,920
can't check it all and then what we do

1401
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:50,600
is we say well this is the only one

1402
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:55,550
we've got

1403
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,550
so we can't we can't match anything else

1404
01:10:55,939 --> 01:10:59,159
you know what I might not do that I

1405
01:10:57,779 --> 01:11:00,630
might say that anything else doesn't get

1406
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:02,819
merged because we only want to merge

1407
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:05,159
things that we actually know merge right

1408
01:11:02,819 --> 01:11:07,229
so if we were going to edit this a line

1409
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:10,349
point in the current in-progress edits

1410
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:12,569
then what we want to do is say look is

1411
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:15,660
it the same asset and align point index

1412
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:17,189
if it is then it's a match so then what

1413
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:18,899
I would on all so I guess what I want to

1414
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:24,439
do is have a way of getting out of this

1415
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:27,599
loop right so I would say if the match

1416
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:29,009
version and in this case again I kind of

1417
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:33,980
know what this type is now because

1418
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:33,980
you've given me the match version of it

1419
01:11:37,489 --> 01:11:56,729
you know I might say let's be piggy er

1420
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:58,910
there let's actually do that let's just

1421
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,909
do that

1422
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:09,390
that seems reasonable um and that way we

1423
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:11,329
could just say okay you know this is

1424
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:16,440
in-game edit

1425
01:12:11,329 --> 01:12:23,850
there's the match and this this will do

1426
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:28,439
that this will set the whole thing that

1427
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:31,590
seems better it's not the cleanest thing

1428
01:12:28,439 --> 01:12:35,460
in the world but it's alright so I'll do

1429
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:37,079
that we'll look at that one and if it

1430
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,789
works we'll will assign it other you

1431
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:41,899
know it this will just do exactly what

1432
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:45,029
it was doing for everything will work

1433
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:46,829
essentially the same and we probably

1434
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:48,929
don't need this cast anymore either cuz

1435
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:51,149
you know we're we're just not that

1436
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:56,100
specific about it now so we probably can

1437
01:12:51,149 --> 01:13:01,500
just do this like that so I'm I'm and

1438
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:03,960
then we don't need this and this seems

1439
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,590
better so there we go we'll look for the

1440
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,980
match

1441
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:15,239
assuming that we find the match meaning

1442
01:13:07,979 --> 01:13:16,369
if a line point edit a set index equals

1443
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:19,469
[Music]

1444
01:13:16,369 --> 01:13:27,989
test the line point at it that's it

1445
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:34,579
index and of the align point index close

1446
01:13:27,989 --> 01:13:41,288
test light index index I'm sorry edit

1447
01:13:34,579 --> 01:13:43,210
we're good and we're good to go

1448
01:13:41,288 --> 01:13:44,768
so when we come down to the bottom here

1449
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:47,288
what we need to do is say like look if

1450
01:13:44,769 --> 01:13:48,699
we didn't find anything and maybe found

1451
01:13:47,288 --> 01:13:50,259
is the wrong word here maybe found

1452
01:13:48,698 --> 01:13:54,609
should just be results right because

1453
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:56,320
it's what we're gonna return so what we

1454
01:13:54,609 --> 01:13:57,729
want to do is say look if you found a

1455
01:13:56,319 --> 01:13:58,569
result we can just return it because

1456
01:13:57,729 --> 01:14:00,368
we're good to go

1457
01:13:58,569 --> 01:14:02,349
but if we didn't find a result then what

1458
01:14:00,368 --> 01:14:07,259
we need to do is say give me a new one

1459
01:14:02,349 --> 01:14:11,199
right which is this code right here and

1460
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:13,389
I want to be the type that they were

1461
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:18,308
asking to try and match when we actually

1462
01:14:13,389 --> 01:14:21,130
get it back you know inside here right

1463
01:14:18,309 --> 01:14:24,219
when it does this push first and it sets

1464
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:26,920
the result type and so on that's not

1465
01:14:24,219 --> 01:14:29,230
constructive we don't really want that

1466
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:32,710
anymore because that allocate editor

1467
01:14:29,229 --> 01:14:34,000
edit actually you know I I don't must

1468
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:36,939
say let's just get rid of this I don't

1469
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,630
know that I want this at all so I'm just

1470
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:46,689
gonna pull this down here like that and

1471
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:49,449
I must say this goes away and really

1472
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:51,638
what we're gonna do now instead is we're

1473
01:14:49,448 --> 01:14:54,638
gonna put this onto the in progress sack

1474
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:58,599
and we're gonna when we do this push let

1475
01:14:54,639 --> 01:15:02,199
me get back the results there we're

1476
01:14:58,599 --> 01:15:04,989
going to romp over the allocated memory

1477
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:06,609
that we got and just set it equal to

1478
01:15:04,988 --> 01:15:07,959
what they gave us because we're gonna

1479
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:12,069
assume that's what they wanted to start

1480
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:15,809
with right so that allows us to stack up

1481
01:15:12,069 --> 01:15:18,639
those in progress edits I and anytime

1482
01:15:15,809 --> 01:15:22,469
you're gonna do the same operation it'll

1483
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:25,809
just use one that already exists right

1484
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:29,230
so I mean once we get to once we have

1485
01:15:25,809 --> 01:15:30,309
that down then what we need to do is

1486
01:15:29,229 --> 01:15:32,859
actually have some way of committing

1487
01:15:30,309 --> 01:15:35,380
these back right so when we do editor

1488
01:15:32,859 --> 01:15:37,868
interact what we want to do is say okay

1489
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:39,699
any time the mouse goes up and we're

1490
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:41,768
going to clear an interaction we

1491
01:15:39,698 --> 01:15:44,379
probably want that to be a more specific

1492
01:15:41,769 --> 01:15:47,019
thing that happens right so that's like

1493
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:51,760
an end so this is like an end

1494
01:15:47,019 --> 01:15:54,070
interaction state and what I want to do

1495
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,510
here is say that these are just end

1496
01:15:54,069 --> 01:15:59,469
these are interaction

1497
01:15:55,510 --> 01:16:01,809
things does that make sense if the mouse

1498
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:04,179
goes up that's when it ends whatever the

1499
01:16:01,809 --> 01:16:18,639
interaction is that we were doing and

1500
01:16:04,179 --> 01:16:21,519
then that can come down here so that

1501
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:25,000
anyone inside here who wants to say that

1502
01:16:21,519 --> 01:16:30,400
this was an interaction ending thing can

1503
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:33,279
just do that right and so here when we

1504
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:35,109
do tech asset we can see that that would

1505
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:44,710
do it as well

1506
01:16:35,109 --> 01:16:58,988
I think this only wants to happen in

1507
01:16:44,710 --> 01:17:01,510
here probably so those all want to do

1508
01:16:58,988 --> 01:17:03,459
interaction ends when we get to that

1509
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:04,809
point right then what I can do is say

1510
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:07,000
all right when we go to end an

1511
01:17:04,809 --> 01:17:10,920
interaction all in progress things move

1512
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:16,599
on to the undo stack right so everything

1513
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:18,578
gets pushed on as an undo now the

1514
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:20,110
interesting thing about that right is

1515
01:17:18,578 --> 01:17:22,558
that there could have been multiple

1516
01:17:20,109 --> 01:17:24,848
changes in that in progress Sentinel

1517
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:27,489
right now we know that can never really

1518
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:29,050
happen but if we were to make that

1519
01:17:27,488 --> 01:17:33,848
happen what we want to do and I'm going

1520
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:40,599
to put to do for this right allow chains

1521
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:45,610
of undos so a single undo can represent

1522
01:17:40,599 --> 01:17:47,050
many undos when we get to that point

1523
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:51,098
this is the place where we would do it

1524
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:53,500
we would take the whole chain and just

1525
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:57,429
put it on to the undo stack as one

1526
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:59,319
single entry so we can do that we just

1527
01:17:57,429 --> 01:18:01,510
don't we don't need to do it now it's

1528
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:04,389
not really gonna make it life any harder

1529
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:07,059
for us really so we can just do that as

1530
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:07,210
the need arises but in the meantime what

1531
01:18:07,059 --> 01:18:10,270
we

1532
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:13,539
we're doing is we'd be saying while you

1533
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:19,630
know while whatever the in progress

1534
01:18:13,539 --> 01:18:21,699
Sentinel list is while it's not empty we

1535
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:25,050
would just do a push first pop first

1536
01:18:21,699 --> 01:18:27,309
right where we say take whatever

1537
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:28,480
whatever you got on that in progress

1538
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:39,070
sense and I'll put it on the undo

1539
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:40,479
Sentinel okay so again we just what we

1540
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:43,389
basically do there's we created like a

1541
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:46,209
holding cell right for all of our

1542
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:49,960
changes so that we could know how that

1543
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:51,609
got written as text so that our changes

1544
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:53,529
would buffer in there and we could

1545
01:18:51,609 --> 01:18:56,679
coalesce them right we could combine

1546
01:18:53,529 --> 01:19:00,039
them together and so then what we want

1547
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:03,159
to do is move those off of that any time

1548
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:04,988
we finish an interaction because that

1549
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:08,380
means all of the changes that happen

1550
01:19:04,988 --> 01:19:11,679
during that drag operation or whatever

1551
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:13,960
else is happening that needs to now get

1552
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:18,159
retired as an actual valid undo change

1553
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:21,390
that we want to record let me see what

1554
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:21,389
else we got here

1555
01:19:29,489 --> 01:19:40,659
that's just oh whoops

1556
01:19:35,069 --> 01:19:46,000
still still wrong no no no no this is

1557
01:19:40,659 --> 01:19:54,039
just always that it's not that's not the

1558
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:56,560
type we're talking about Lili use of

1559
01:19:54,039 --> 01:20:03,519
this type so especially yes that doesn't

1560
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:05,700
need to be there anymore and this is not

1561
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:09,390
the UI sorry my bad

1562
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:09,389
that's just the editor

1563
01:20:14,069 --> 01:20:31,738
all right so you know that was unhappy

1564
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:37,138
about this I know why as well that needs

1565
01:20:31,738 --> 01:20:38,848
to be initialized again you notice how

1566
01:20:37,139 --> 01:20:40,409
annoying it is to have to have clear to

1567
01:20:38,849 --> 01:20:41,969
not have clear to zero

1568
01:20:40,408 --> 01:20:43,979
anything that's clear to zero just

1569
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:45,868
always works and anything that's not is

1570
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:49,529
just waiting to be an initialized

1571
01:20:45,868 --> 01:20:50,639
variable problem and that's a lot of

1572
01:20:49,529 --> 01:20:52,529
times where you get people who really

1573
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:53,909
like constructor system is those are

1574
01:20:52,529 --> 01:20:55,109
really not necessary if clear to zero

1575
01:20:53,908 --> 01:20:57,029
just works but there's a couple things

1576
01:20:55,109 --> 01:20:59,698
where it doesn't and it's unfortunate

1577
01:20:57,029 --> 01:21:01,109
you you know I almost don't want to use

1578
01:20:59,698 --> 01:21:03,029
those kinds of methods specifically

1579
01:21:01,109 --> 01:21:06,569
because of that alright so let's see

1580
01:21:03,029 --> 01:21:08,219
here so let's say I undo back and let's

1581
01:21:06,569 --> 01:21:09,750
see if this works so I'm dragging this

1582
01:21:08,219 --> 01:21:11,279
all around now right

1583
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:13,078
and then I'm dragging this all around

1584
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:14,670
now and then I'm dragging this all

1585
01:21:13,078 --> 01:21:16,380
around now so the first thing that

1586
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:17,819
should happen is that should undo it

1587
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,949
does now the next thing happens is this

1588
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:22,289
should undo and it did and now we should

1589
01:21:19,948 --> 01:21:27,899
undo this back to ya amber back to

1590
01:21:22,289 --> 01:21:29,639
another um so that all looks pretty good

1591
01:21:27,899 --> 01:21:34,019
to me like that seems like that's

1592
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:37,739
operating pretty faithfully and you know

1593
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:40,860
we can we can do all of our stuff here

1594
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:44,968
we can toggle things we can change the

1595
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:49,348
sizes we can redo stuff we can undo

1596
01:21:44,969 --> 01:21:52,099
stuff so that feeling pretty good I mean

1597
01:21:49,349 --> 01:21:54,590
that interface is pretty solid now I

1598
01:21:52,099 --> 01:21:57,480
don't know how much time I have left

1599
01:21:54,590 --> 01:22:01,199
probably about a half an hour do I want

1600
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:04,439
to say that's probably about right I'm

1601
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:05,359
gonna go ahead and yeah I'm gonna I'm

1602
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:09,629
gonna go ahead and say I've got

1603
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:11,639
something like that and I'm gonna I'm

1604
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:13,590
just gonna take that time to pretty it

1605
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:14,909
up right I just wanna I'm just gonna

1606
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:17,699
spend some time putting up

1607
01:22:14,908 --> 01:22:19,259
maybe if I also have time I'm gonna make

1608
01:22:17,698 --> 01:22:20,848
these things properly snap to the upper

1609
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:22,860
corner of the screen because they're

1610
01:22:20,849 --> 01:22:26,069
annoying me that they're hanging around

1611
01:22:22,859 --> 01:22:28,829
like this and it's just it's annoying

1612
01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:32,759
right it's it's it's super not not what

1613
01:22:28,829 --> 01:22:36,869
I want super not what I want is like it

1614
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:41,369
is a new thing and there is one other

1615
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:43,829
aspect of this system that we have to

1616
01:22:41,369 --> 01:22:46,319
consider at some point and again like I

1617
01:22:43,829 --> 01:22:48,930
said I avoided doing anything with it

1618
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:54,840
because I'm not really sure what I want

1619
01:22:48,930 --> 01:23:00,720
to do but we need some argument excuse

1620
01:22:54,840 --> 01:23:06,840
metaphor paradigm for what is supposed

1621
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:10,949
to happen with the debug UI when it

1622
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:13,529
coexist with this UI like I said I don't

1623
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:15,840
really want them unified completely

1624
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:18,869
because the debug UI stuff should kind

1625
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,819
of compile out entirely probably whereas

1626
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:22,769
this will always be available for people

1627
01:23:20,819 --> 01:23:35,729
who want to import art into the game

1628
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:38,520
even end-users I think and so I want to

1629
01:23:35,729 --> 01:23:40,469
say that the best thing to do there is

1630
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:45,660
gonna be to have some sort of a modal

1631
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:48,150
thing that says if you're in editor mode

1632
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:50,279
the debug UI just turns itself off or

1633
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:53,250
something like I just I don't want them

1634
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:56,039
getting involved

1635
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:58,350
I want the debug UI to stay completely

1636
01:23:56,039 --> 01:24:00,680
separate so we'll see what we can do

1637
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:00,680
about that

1638
01:24:02,899 --> 01:24:09,420
you know we'll see by the way while

1639
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:10,409
we're on the subject of this I do want

1640
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,810
to know what the story is with that

1641
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:15,859
baseline stuff is is it just a case of

1642
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:15,860
like this going the wrong way

1643
01:24:16,729 --> 01:24:27,379
like when we call get baseline was that

1644
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:27,380
just going the wrong way or something

1645
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:32,969
like it's just supposed to be plus

1646
01:24:30,529 --> 01:24:34,319
because we used to be we just have wide

1647
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:36,270
going the other direction Juno I'm

1648
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,130
saying like is it just is it just a case

1649
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:41,010
of actually everything's fine

1650
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:43,730
and when we switched the order of those

1651
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:47,840
coordinates we never fixed that you know

1652
01:24:43,729 --> 01:24:47,839
so it should just be something like this

1653
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:59,460
you know and I don't know I like I have

1654
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:06,869
no idea I'm just wondering if that has

1655
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:25,859
something to do with it no it definitely

1656
01:25:06,869 --> 01:25:29,340
doesn't okay so that looks like not it I

1657
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:31,889
do want to know then - about the text

1658
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:34,110
out function so in here you know how

1659
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:36,180
does that do its adjustment because you

1660
01:25:34,109 --> 01:25:39,960
know when you do the what it's actually

1661
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:42,150
drawing the text right it doesn't a

1662
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,739
bitmap offset and it's got like an

1663
01:25:42,149 --> 01:25:48,479
addicts in an @y and stuff like that so

1664
01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:52,050
when it does that I'm wondering how it's

1665
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:56,309
computing the offset of the actual you

1666
01:25:52,050 --> 01:26:00,590
know the glyphs themselves to figure out

1667
01:25:56,310 --> 01:26:06,620
like how they should be aligned on the

1668
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:06,619
like you know on the off of the baseline

1669
01:26:06,649 --> 01:26:17,819
and I'll be honest I I don't see that

1670
01:26:12,689 --> 01:26:22,949
information here which is a little bit

1671
01:26:17,819 --> 01:26:26,729
strange because you need to know how far

1672
01:26:22,949 --> 01:26:30,899
up it is in order to make that

1673
01:26:26,729 --> 01:26:33,689
determination so I'm guessing that what

1674
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:36,359
was happening is everyone was aligned to

1675
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:39,119
the top when we originally made the

1676
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:41,130
fonts because pixels were going down and

1677
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:42,559
then when we switched to having an

1678
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:45,770
upside down

1679
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:56,090
maybe we just never did the revert like

1680
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:58,340
the actual realignment of it maybe it's

1681
01:26:56,090 --> 01:27:00,319
a bit of a stretch you know I'm reaching

1682
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:04,489
a little on that I don't mind telling

1683
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:07,250
you but it seems likely so you can see

1684
01:27:04,489 --> 01:27:10,099
here we've got a glyph very no

1685
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:11,750
information in here about alignment so

1686
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:15,530
I'm assuming that what actually is

1687
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:21,909
happening there is you have to back up

1688
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:21,909
to the baseline and then come down right

1689
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:28,760
you know that that's what I've seen so I

1690
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:31,340
would guess that really what we're

1691
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:35,239
seeing here is the fact that the the

1692
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:39,170
actual alignment of this thing when we

1693
01:27:35,239 --> 01:27:41,599
do you know when when we're actually

1694
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:43,720
doing this bit mombasa I think this

1695
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:50,390
actually has to have baked into the why

1696
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:54,260
sort of a like a baseline alignment for

1697
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:58,520
lack of a better term so what do we need

1698
01:27:54,260 --> 01:28:00,500
to do is it would need to actually take

1699
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:05,810
whatever the dimension of the thing was

1700
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:15,199
right it would need to take this and say

1701
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:18,230
I need to go I need to go that far I'm

1702
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:21,260
at the bottom I need to go to the top

1703
01:28:18,229 --> 01:28:24,709
and then back that however big the

1704
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:28,430
character was to align it to the top so

1705
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:33,260
this at Y needs to be like plus whatever

1706
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:40,970
the total height is so ascender plus d

1707
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:43,550
sender which i assume is baseline like

1708
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:44,750
that kind of thing I don't remember what

1709
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:47,829
was happening in there

1710
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:47,828
[Music]

1711
01:28:51,539 --> 01:29:03,180
let's get starting baseline why what

1712
01:29:00,579 --> 01:29:05,649
does that do

1713
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:07,630
so that's the center right I don't know

1714
01:29:05,649 --> 01:29:16,899
if a sender height is the right thing

1715
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:18,010
there um I'm not sure because it's been

1716
01:29:16,899 --> 01:29:18,539
a long time so we've looked at this

1717
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:26,230
stuff

1718
01:29:18,539 --> 01:29:27,789
um but either or that's okay you know we

1719
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:30,399
can fool around with it and figure out

1720
01:29:27,789 --> 01:29:31,390
what we actually encoded there I'm gonna

1721
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:34,539
go ahead and say it's something like

1722
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:38,200
that like that's roughly what's going on

1723
01:29:34,539 --> 01:29:41,859
here if not you know exactly what's

1724
01:29:38,199 --> 01:29:45,899
going on here so it's getting a little

1725
01:29:41,859 --> 01:29:45,899
closer not quite right

1726
01:30:09,969 --> 01:30:19,819
and I guess one thing is the bitmap

1727
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:23,629
scale here would also come into place so

1728
01:30:19,819 --> 01:30:33,639
the ascender height you know like this

1729
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:33,639
also would have to multiply these right

1730
01:30:33,819 --> 01:30:42,039
but that is I think set to one at the

1731
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:45,349
moment so that ain't gonna help us cuz

1732
01:30:42,039 --> 01:30:49,310
that we would only have errors there if

1733
01:30:45,349 --> 01:30:52,779
we yeah if we if we did it backwards so

1734
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:55,099
you know looking at that it's like that

1735
01:30:52,779 --> 01:31:03,198
aligns everything at the top in a weird

1736
01:30:55,099 --> 01:31:06,889
way so it's not quite that so what what

1737
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:10,309
could be causing those just the symbols

1738
01:31:06,889 --> 01:31:12,880
to be lowered like that I don't quite

1739
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:12,880
get

1740
01:31:30,329 --> 01:31:41,119
I mean maybe we need both of these

1741
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:55,130
still not quite right there

1742
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,538
but you can see how those are now more

1743
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:13,359
correct right and these are now more

1744
01:32:07,538 --> 01:32:15,130
incorrect it's very curious so I think

1745
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:18,399
we're on the right truck we just it's

1746
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:21,849
mainly just a problem of not really

1747
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:28,779
remembering exactly how we bake these

1748
01:32:21,849 --> 01:32:30,819
down I probably should go look just to

1749
01:32:28,779 --> 01:32:43,029
see how we were actually encoding them

1750
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:45,069
in fact I could just do that so here's

1751
01:32:43,029 --> 01:32:52,359
you know our sender D sender height

1752
01:32:45,069 --> 01:32:56,368
stuff let me take a look at how we were

1753
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:56,368
actually pulling these things out so

1754
01:33:03,029 --> 01:33:09,268
yeah like you know here's us getting the

1755
01:33:05,889 --> 01:33:09,269
bounding box of the thing

1756
01:33:24,329 --> 01:33:27,470
oh my

1757
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:36,600
oh how interesting

1758
01:33:40,929 --> 01:33:53,510
Wow so we really got saucy here you know

1759
01:33:51,288 --> 01:33:55,788
I'm glad I looked because I never would

1760
01:33:53,510 --> 01:34:00,309
have guessed that that was that's some

1761
01:33:55,788 --> 01:34:00,309
pretty fancy footwork there my friends

1762
01:34:01,448 --> 01:34:09,888
yeah Wow okay well we didn't we didn't

1763
01:34:07,939 --> 01:34:15,799
pull any punches on that one so

1764
01:34:09,889 --> 01:34:20,779
effectively what we did there is we said

1765
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:24,469
yeah let's just bake how that glyph gets

1766
01:34:20,779 --> 01:34:28,238
aligned to the baseline into the align

1767
01:34:24,469 --> 01:34:34,189
percentage of the bitmap because why not

1768
01:34:28,238 --> 01:34:36,259
right so the align percentage which is

1769
01:34:34,189 --> 01:34:40,879
going to offset the thing is going to

1770
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:43,130
offset it by this value problem is this

1771
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:46,038
alignment was probably going the wrong

1772
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:48,819
direction that'd be my guess

1773
01:34:46,038 --> 01:34:48,819
right

1774
01:35:00,439 --> 01:35:04,479
that is kind crazy

1775
01:35:14,908 --> 01:35:27,638
so there's one of two things could have

1776
01:35:18,698 --> 01:35:32,378
happened thing number one is that we we

1777
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:34,088
just never fixed that for fonts when we

1778
01:35:32,378 --> 01:35:39,418
were messing with our coordinate systems

1779
01:35:34,088 --> 01:35:42,878
and stuff and so it was always wrong

1780
01:35:39,418 --> 01:35:44,708
another is that it actually is right and

1781
01:35:42,878 --> 01:35:48,429
I'll go through the math here and try to

1782
01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:51,059
determine whether it is or not so

1783
01:35:48,429 --> 01:35:54,219
that'll be the way we'll figure that out

1784
01:35:51,059 --> 01:35:57,609
but the other way is that actually the

1785
01:35:54,219 --> 01:36:01,479
math was right for this and this should

1786
01:35:57,609 --> 01:36:07,419
be correct but what happened was when we

1787
01:36:01,479 --> 01:36:09,969
took and when we did our import there's

1788
01:36:07,418 --> 01:36:11,679
like a bug in this code that makes the

1789
01:36:09,969 --> 01:36:14,578
align percentages not work properly or

1790
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:14,578
something like this right

1791
01:36:28,448 --> 01:36:42,639
and you know it looks like they'd be

1792
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:46,359
fine because it certainly looks like

1793
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:48,550
it's getting undressed there let's take

1794
01:36:46,359 --> 01:36:52,448
a quick look at it shall we

1795
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:57,699
so let's go into handmade Hero data and

1796
01:36:52,448 --> 01:37:02,319
let's just ask for a dump of the test

1797
01:36:57,698 --> 01:37:04,029
fonts and let's just make sure they've

1798
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:09,429
got some same values that right this

1799
01:37:04,029 --> 01:37:21,659
will do that yeah and I'll load that up

1800
01:37:09,429 --> 01:37:21,659
in the tab view let's see

1801
01:37:27,869 --> 01:37:37,550
and so those look you know that unless

1802
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:40,880
we did something really wrong looks okay

1803
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:40,880
look tiny

1804
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:05,340
you know but I could I could be

1805
01:38:03,869 --> 01:38:07,170
convinced those from right you know I'm

1806
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:08,819
not really and say those are those got

1807
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:12,710
corrupted yet the fact that they're all

1808
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:22,799
pretty low you know doesn't necessarily

1809
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:30,000
seem great but you know it's sixty one

1810
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:35,989
half dozen together so that could be one

1811
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:39,590
problem if I do look at set a line point

1812
01:38:35,989 --> 01:38:39,590
let me go in there

1813
01:38:58,810 --> 01:39:03,639
if I do look at set a line point there

1814
01:39:06,849 --> 01:39:11,599
you know it doesn't look like there's

1815
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:18,469
that much room for error so that that

1816
01:39:11,599 --> 01:39:23,480
seems like it's probably working okay so

1817
01:39:18,469 --> 01:39:27,649
I think let's I'm gonna say it's a it's

1818
01:39:23,479 --> 01:39:29,388
hard to say where to look first but I'm

1819
01:39:27,649 --> 01:39:34,638
gonna say let's start with the math of

1820
01:39:29,389 --> 01:39:37,940
this like I just want to look at this

1821
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:43,310
situation so we're starting by saying

1822
01:39:37,939 --> 01:39:45,618
all right we took and let me let's let's

1823
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:48,469
pop over the blackboard just so like we

1824
01:39:45,618 --> 01:39:51,460
can draw these out and have some idea of

1825
01:39:48,469 --> 01:39:51,460
like where they actually are

1826
01:40:04,649 --> 01:40:08,969
so looking at this here we've got a

1827
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:11,850
couple different things

1828
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:15,480
we drew a bitmap right and this bitmap

1829
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:17,550
is not bottom-up right it's top-down so

1830
01:40:15,479 --> 01:40:24,029
when we're actually specifying this

1831
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:31,980
thing you know I don't know do we flip

1832
01:40:24,029 --> 01:40:40,170
it here we're using this fonts from

1833
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:48,559
windows path and so you can see here we

1834
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:50,489
we kind of we kind of work from the top

1835
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:54,140
down

1836
01:40:50,489 --> 01:40:54,139
it's a weird code dude

1837
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:08,840
so both of them go from the top down

1838
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:16,760
but why

1839
01:41:23,159 --> 01:41:33,010
right I mean there's no reason for them

1840
01:41:30,189 --> 01:41:35,829
to go from they I mean not from the top

1841
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:38,050
down from they all go backwards so they

1842
01:41:35,829 --> 01:41:43,059
all start at the end of the image and go

1843
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:51,850
backwards but there's no reason for them

1844
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:54,190
to do that is there it's like it was

1845
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:57,900
gonna flip them around but then it

1846
01:41:54,189 --> 01:41:57,899
doesn't flip them around

1847
01:42:06,329 --> 01:42:14,579
I don't get it so I don't know why

1848
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:17,090
that's doing that does not need to do

1849
01:42:14,579 --> 01:42:17,090
that I don't think

1850
01:42:25,078 --> 01:42:34,469
I don't I don't understand that very

1851
01:42:27,868 --> 01:42:36,569
well at all so you can see here right

1852
01:42:34,469 --> 01:42:41,368
this intentionally leaves a one pixel

1853
01:42:36,569 --> 01:42:46,768
apron and it starts writing at the last

1854
01:42:41,368 --> 01:42:57,238
row and it's gonna write backwards this

1855
01:42:46,769 --> 01:43:02,099
one starts also at the last row it moves

1856
01:42:57,238 --> 01:43:11,638
back by the min X but I by the min Y but

1857
01:43:02,099 --> 01:43:14,609
I'm not sure what the point of that is

1858
01:43:11,639 --> 01:43:19,019
really but I guess it's just saying

1859
01:43:14,609 --> 01:43:20,999
don't go that many up so I I got nothing

1860
01:43:19,019 --> 01:43:23,519
I mean that's just crazy I have no idea

1861
01:43:20,998 --> 01:43:25,948
what's going on here this code is kind

1862
01:43:23,519 --> 01:43:29,939
of super crappy and nuts it's in the

1863
01:43:25,948 --> 01:43:33,988
test asset builder so you know there is

1864
01:43:29,939 --> 01:43:37,369
that but anyway when we go through these

1865
01:43:33,988 --> 01:43:39,718
yeah I don't that's just bizarre so

1866
01:43:37,368 --> 01:43:40,889
that's gonna make it a little harder to

1867
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:43,019
work through this because we don't

1868
01:43:40,889 --> 01:43:45,929
really know why it's doing that and that

1869
01:43:43,019 --> 01:43:48,119
could affect this construction which is

1870
01:43:45,929 --> 01:43:50,578
not my favorite thing but let's look at

1871
01:43:48,118 --> 01:43:55,408
what these actually refer it to so bound

1872
01:43:50,578 --> 01:44:00,858
height here must be something that's

1873
01:43:55,408 --> 01:44:04,259
discussed further up so here we have the

1874
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:09,059
the height that I guess the font would

1875
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:14,159
say that this character is right so the

1876
01:44:09,059 --> 01:44:16,859
font says you know it's this big we

1877
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:21,598
asked it for the size and it comes back

1878
01:44:16,859 --> 01:44:25,109
with that so bound height is like how

1879
01:44:21,599 --> 01:44:30,029
big that text is I think that's probably

1880
01:44:25,109 --> 01:44:33,510
going to be usually tight but maybe not

1881
01:44:30,029 --> 01:44:36,268
right so the fact that we're checking to

1882
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:38,760
see what the stuff is here suggests that

1883
01:44:36,269 --> 01:44:40,440
it's not that tight actually

1884
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:42,239
because otherwise why would we have had

1885
01:44:40,439 --> 01:44:46,379
to do that like we wouldn't have had to

1886
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:48,959
have done that right so the bound height

1887
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:55,020
is probably gonna be something right

1888
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:57,869
like if we imagine like here's a capital

1889
01:44:55,020 --> 01:45:00,930
a the bound height is probably gonna be

1890
01:44:57,869 --> 01:45:08,309
something like that where it's like you

1891
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:13,650
know it's a little bit much I'm just

1892
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:16,739
guessing the TM descent is how far the

1893
01:45:13,649 --> 01:45:25,199
descenders go so that's like this

1894
01:45:16,738 --> 01:45:26,549
distance right you imagine if there is

1895
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:30,090
like one of these it would actually be

1896
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:31,680
you know like that distance right but

1897
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:36,210
I'm just saying like that's the part

1898
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:38,250
below the line so we're taking whatever

1899
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:41,579
the boundaries were subtracting off the

1900
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:45,270
descent so that's that value there is

1901
01:45:41,579 --> 01:45:48,809
effectively we've now got this this is

1902
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:53,970
our you know at the moment our and we'll

1903
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:56,460
call that B let's say so that's B so

1904
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:58,530
we're taking our max Y which is the

1905
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:01,859
highest value that we've seen and we're

1906
01:45:58,529 --> 01:46:03,750
subtracting B from from I'm sorry

1907
01:46:01,859 --> 01:46:06,679
no we're yeah we're subtracting B from

1908
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:06,680
it right

1909
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:26,270
and so we're just fry I guess that a

1910
01:46:24,439 --> 01:46:29,029
line point is just trying to figure out

1911
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:31,160
if we were here and we needed to go up

1912
01:46:29,029 --> 01:46:44,529
to where we would start where would that

1913
01:46:31,159 --> 01:46:44,529
be it's a pretty tortured way to do that

1914
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:53,240
but I can sort of see why and so max why

1915
01:46:51,170 --> 01:46:56,899
is the maximum value that we could have

1916
01:46:53,239 --> 01:47:00,260
achieved and that's where we want to

1917
01:46:56,899 --> 01:47:07,219
start our drawing so normally we would

1918
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:14,239
go to that max Y okay so I'm starting to

1919
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:16,820
see what the problem is here - if we're

1920
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:20,630
assuming that you can align outside of

1921
01:47:16,819 --> 01:47:27,199
the zero to one range which this could

1922
01:47:20,630 --> 01:47:32,980
definitely do because there's no reason

1923
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:39,319
why these have to be constrained by this

1924
01:47:32,979 --> 01:47:45,199
right so you could have a negative value

1925
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:47,689
that presumably is quite a bit more than

1926
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:51,079
the height value so you could end up

1927
01:47:47,689 --> 01:47:52,639
with negative larger than 1 or negative

1928
01:47:51,079 --> 01:47:56,409
something like negative done that'd be

1929
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:56,410
there you could end up with less than 0

1930
01:47:58,270 --> 01:48:02,440
and we don't currently allow that

1931
01:48:04,038 --> 01:48:13,250
right um so if we wanted to make that

1932
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:21,829
aligned percentage be able to properly

1933
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:24,979
handle the fonts that looks like

1934
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:27,049
actually the problem so that value might

1935
01:48:24,979 --> 01:48:28,339
be correct and it may have we may have

1936
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:29,719
actually done the flip around because it

1937
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:32,630
kind of looks like it is doing that in

1938
01:48:29,719 --> 01:48:35,719
there but I think the reason that we're

1939
01:48:32,630 --> 01:48:37,849
actually getting those is actually just

1940
01:48:35,719 --> 01:48:42,170
because it might be requiring us to

1941
01:48:37,849 --> 01:48:45,590
encode them better which we could do if

1942
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:48,199
we wanted to do that all we would have

1943
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:55,069
to do here is just allow for things to

1944
01:48:48,198 --> 01:48:56,899
be offset so you know what do we want

1945
01:48:55,069 --> 01:48:59,479
the range to be right like what do we

1946
01:48:56,899 --> 01:49:03,138
want that mapping to be you know because

1947
01:48:59,479 --> 01:49:05,569
it's kind of up to us so when we do this

1948
01:49:03,139 --> 01:49:09,889
P percent here and we multiply this out

1949
01:49:05,569 --> 01:49:12,679
by the u16 max what we want to do is

1950
01:49:09,889 --> 01:49:15,139
just precondition this value really you

1951
01:49:12,679 --> 01:49:25,190
know what I mean so we want it to be in

1952
01:49:15,139 --> 01:49:27,920
the zero to one range and so what we

1953
01:49:25,189 --> 01:49:30,428
want to do is say whatever it is let's

1954
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:34,699
do a clamp zero one map two range on it

1955
01:49:30,429 --> 01:49:44,389
and give it a minimum acts right so

1956
01:49:34,698 --> 01:49:46,308
we'll say in here that we've got some

1957
01:49:44,389 --> 01:49:49,909
min and Max whatever we want them to be

1958
01:49:46,309 --> 01:49:52,639
so you know okay you can do up to a

1959
01:49:49,908 --> 01:49:56,479
negative two to two or something right

1960
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:59,059
like we support you know a wider gamut

1961
01:49:56,479 --> 01:50:02,569
there of percentages that are allowed

1962
01:49:59,059 --> 01:50:04,190
and then when this thing comes out right

1963
01:50:02,569 --> 01:50:06,768
so when we do clamps are two one map to

1964
01:50:04,189 --> 01:50:08,779
range we just say look put this thing in

1965
01:50:06,769 --> 01:50:11,300
between there and give me back a zero to

1966
01:50:08,779 --> 01:50:14,090
one value that actually works when we

1967
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:17,889
then create this thing we know we just

1968
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:20,979
need to start at negative two and go

1969
01:50:17,889 --> 01:50:23,078
out by however much that percentage

1970
01:50:20,979 --> 01:50:30,999
gives us to re spread out to the entire

1971
01:50:23,078 --> 01:50:35,529
range of the thing right so we can do

1972
01:50:30,998 --> 01:50:38,139
that if we now run the program we should

1973
01:50:35,529 --> 01:50:43,509
get nuts no stuff right because it's not

1974
01:50:38,139 --> 01:50:45,760
encoded that way on import but what we

1975
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:52,689
then can do is say well alright you know

1976
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:53,289
now let's re-imported Atta that we had

1977
01:50:52,689 --> 01:50:56,880
before

1978
01:50:53,288 --> 01:51:02,969
so you know here we've got all these

1979
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:08,019
tests hhas right and so if I want to

1980
01:51:02,969 --> 01:51:12,399
derp the v-0 directory there and I want

1981
01:51:08,019 --> 01:51:17,399
to bring all of these back in in a bulk

1982
01:51:12,399 --> 01:51:22,719
import right I can delete all of my hhas

1983
01:51:17,399 --> 01:51:29,110
in question here including the text

1984
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:40,958
files and then I can just update those

1985
01:51:29,109 --> 01:51:46,118
so do a rewrite v-0 intro art HHA and

1986
01:51:40,958 --> 01:51:53,938
each of these I can just do theirs test

1987
01:51:46,118 --> 01:51:53,938
one two

1988
01:51:55,439 --> 01:52:16,649
three antis fonts and also I guess I

1989
01:52:03,969 --> 01:52:16,649
should have put the v2 on this um so

1990
01:52:17,729 --> 01:52:27,729
yeah that was a crazy one but you know

1991
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:30,179
you notice it was exactly correct so

1992
01:52:27,729 --> 01:52:33,428
yeah there you go

1993
01:52:30,179 --> 01:52:34,210
debugging is debugging if you go find

1994
01:52:33,429 --> 01:52:39,489
the problem

1995
01:52:34,210 --> 01:52:42,309
turns out fix is usually easy so let's

1996
01:52:39,488 --> 01:52:45,698
make a local and let's let this Rhian

1997
01:52:42,309 --> 01:52:48,489
port but that was good so we've got that

1998
01:52:45,698 --> 01:52:50,379
bug solved and that was our fault with

1999
01:52:48,488 --> 01:52:52,359
the HHA upgrade we did not properly

2000
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:54,130
account for some of the uses of that and

2001
01:52:52,359 --> 01:52:57,609
it turns out was pretty simple for us to

2002
01:52:54,130 --> 01:53:01,868
do so so we just did now this stuff is

2003
01:52:57,609 --> 01:53:03,368
more properly aligned I think it

2004
01:53:01,868 --> 01:53:04,779
definitely looks like it is so the

2005
01:53:03,368 --> 01:53:07,328
beautification pass would be much easier

2006
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:09,399
now and now these are all proper so

2007
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:12,759
that's good well let's go to a brief Q&amp;A

2008
01:53:09,399 --> 01:53:15,848
there and and then we should be able to

2009
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:18,489
next stream will do the beautification

2010
01:53:15,849 --> 01:53:21,090
and get that window editing window

2011
01:53:18,488 --> 01:53:21,089
looking nice

2012
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:41,719
what does pound pound mean I looked it

2013
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:43,340
up but I don't think understand what

2014
01:53:41,719 --> 01:53:45,680
it's use is is it supposed to link

2015
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:51,560
different variables into one variable so

2016
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:54,440
pound pound is he's actually it's only

2017
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:57,920
available in preprocessor macro

2018
01:53:54,439 --> 01:53:59,839
expansion and so that's why if you

2019
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:02,180
haven't seen it or aren't familiar with

2020
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:07,579
it that's probably why it doesn't it's

2021
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:10,070
not actually in the C++ grammar for a

2022
01:54:07,579 --> 01:54:13,189
code it's only in the preprocessor uh

2023
01:54:10,069 --> 01:54:16,899
and so when you see that pound pound

2024
01:54:13,189 --> 01:54:19,579
operator what that's actually saying is

2025
01:54:16,899 --> 01:54:22,069
you know normally I've got something

2026
01:54:19,579 --> 01:54:25,640
like here's my macro and I've got a and

2027
01:54:22,069 --> 01:54:29,359
B right and the way that the macro

2028
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:33,739
preprocessor works is when it gets to

2029
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:36,079
parameters it then looks inside the text

2030
01:54:33,738 --> 01:54:38,689
that's coming for the macro expansion so

2031
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:41,569
the expansion of the macro this is the

2032
01:54:38,689 --> 01:54:45,549
expansion here right it's gonna look at

2033
01:54:41,569 --> 01:54:48,829
that and it's gonna say anytime I see a

2034
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:51,020
recognizable token so in the traditional

2035
01:54:48,829 --> 01:54:53,600
C sense of the word token so an

2036
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:55,310
identifier is a letter and then some

2037
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:58,670
series of letters and numbers with

2038
01:54:55,310 --> 01:55:01,310
underscores right anytime I can pluck

2039
01:54:58,670 --> 01:55:04,550
out a token I will look back to see if

2040
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:06,560
that token matches one of the named

2041
01:55:04,550 --> 01:55:09,680
parameters and if it is I will

2042
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:15,230
substitute in the result so if I was to

2043
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:17,539
do this and then I typed this okay what

2044
01:55:15,229 --> 01:55:21,468
I would expect to see as the result in

2045
01:55:17,539 --> 01:55:24,229
the resulting code is this okay because

2046
01:55:21,469 --> 01:55:26,719
as it expands this it looks at the a and

2047
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:27,979
says well it's what it looks this

2048
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:29,329
essentially goes let me read the

2049
01:55:27,979 --> 01:55:31,279
expansion first token is this the

2050
01:55:29,329 --> 01:55:34,010
expansion does that match grammar no a

2051
01:55:31,279 --> 01:55:35,960
does that match parameter yes what was

2052
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:39,140
the value of it okay put it in place

2053
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:41,500
right does this match memory yes what

2054
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:44,929
was the value of it put it in place okay

2055
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:50,500
the problem is it means that if your

2056
01:55:44,929 --> 01:55:55,010
goal for this was to produce that

2057
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:57,949
you can't do it because typing that

2058
01:55:55,010 --> 01:56:01,760
makes it look at the token as if it were

2059
01:55:57,949 --> 01:56:04,460
a B and then it can't find either of

2060
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:07,730
those here so it just does that and

2061
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:12,550
that's not what you wanted so this

2062
01:56:07,729 --> 01:56:16,129
operator actually what it does is

2063
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:18,800
nothing it actually does nothing but the

2064
01:56:16,130 --> 01:56:21,770
key is you needed some way to have

2065
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:24,020
nothing there so that it could see the

2066
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:26,510
two different tokens so what it actually

2067
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:28,130
does is it just serves as a noting that

2068
01:56:26,510 --> 01:56:30,949
you can insert between two things so

2069
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:32,119
that can recognize them so now what

2070
01:56:30,949 --> 01:56:34,250
happens is it goes what's the first

2071
01:56:32,119 --> 01:56:35,329
token this is the expansion okay put

2072
01:56:34,250 --> 01:56:37,520
that in the output it doesn't match

2073
01:56:35,329 --> 01:56:39,710
anything what's the next token a what

2074
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:42,920
does that match this put the value there

2075
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:44,390
so it does that right what's the next

2076
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:49,489
thing pound pound what does that

2077
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:52,130
evaluate to nothing so we're still right

2078
01:56:49,489 --> 01:56:54,889
here and ready to go what does the next

2079
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:57,260
token equal B what's that this okay

2080
01:56:54,890 --> 01:57:03,369
output the two and so that's how you get

2081
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:07,579
the 12 right so that's really all it is

2082
01:57:03,369 --> 01:57:08,300
is nothing but sometimes especially when

2083
01:57:07,579 --> 01:57:10,640
you're dealing with text processing

2084
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:12,739
nothing is very important because then

2085
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:14,690
nothing is what allows you to glue those

2086
01:57:12,739 --> 01:57:17,229
things together that's why it's called

2087
01:57:14,689 --> 01:57:20,000
the paste operator glues things together

2088
01:57:17,229 --> 01:57:22,009
but it doesn't actually do anything it

2089
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,569
that's not it the operator isn't

2090
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:25,430
actually doing that I guess is where I

2091
01:57:23,569 --> 01:57:27,079
would say it what the operator can

2092
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:28,340
really call the nothing operator if

2093
01:57:27,079 --> 01:57:30,619
that's what you want cuz that's what it

2094
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:33,050
does it just so happens that nothing is

2095
01:57:30,619 --> 01:57:37,309
exactly what you need hopefully that

2096
01:57:33,050 --> 01:57:38,630
helps answer the question skin pop I've

2097
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:40,700
been trying to implement the wok system

2098
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:42,319
from a recent talk the talk made the

2099
01:57:40,699 --> 01:57:44,569
point that shrinking the wok edges

2100
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:46,429
trivial I've made it that far in my own

2101
01:57:44,569 --> 01:57:48,170
code but I haven't been able to figure

2102
01:57:46,430 --> 01:57:51,140
out how to do the shrinking without

2103
01:57:48,170 --> 01:57:54,079
testing all edges against all segments

2104
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:55,670
of the wok edge that approach doesn't

2105
01:57:54,079 --> 01:57:57,199
scale well so I was wondering if you

2106
01:57:55,670 --> 01:58:02,449
could say a few words about how you did

2107
01:57:57,199 --> 01:58:03,909
it assuming you had another approach so

2108
01:58:02,449 --> 01:58:15,939
let me just make sure I understand

2109
01:58:03,909 --> 01:58:20,979
what you're saying you tried testing all

2110
01:58:15,939 --> 01:58:27,629
edges against the segments of the walk

2111
01:58:20,979 --> 01:58:29,819
edge no that's that's correct

2112
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:33,220
so I guess what I would say is know that

2113
01:58:29,819 --> 01:58:35,859
you're doing the right thing

2114
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:38,350
the only thing I would say is you have

2115
01:58:35,859 --> 01:58:43,299
to implement it in a way that does scale

2116
01:58:38,350 --> 01:58:45,789
well so let me let me give you a real

2117
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:53,100
quick it's just really off topic here

2118
01:58:45,789 --> 01:58:53,100
but I'll try to give you the idea so

2119
01:58:54,239 --> 01:59:00,340
what you need is a fundamental operator

2120
01:58:57,010 --> 01:59:07,210
on the grid on the walk rid right so

2121
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:10,029
I've got the grid and what you need is a

2122
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:14,739
fundamental operator that says I have an

2123
01:59:10,029 --> 01:59:18,389
edge apply the edge to the grid if you

2124
01:59:14,739 --> 01:59:21,279
will right and so if this is my edge

2125
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:24,160
then I have some fundamental operator

2126
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:26,170
which rasterizes that edge effectively

2127
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:29,039
into the points of the grid that would

2128
01:59:26,170 --> 01:59:29,039
be affected by it

2129
01:59:31,079 --> 01:59:39,880
makes sense because you know it's like

2130
01:59:34,479 --> 01:59:42,849
this or something so you're doing the

2131
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:44,470
right thing I think but I guess I would

2132
01:59:42,850 --> 01:59:46,390
just say you might be doing it in

2133
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:50,070
slightly the wrong way instead of

2134
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:52,780
testing all of the edges in your system

2135
01:59:50,069 --> 01:59:57,549
versus the walk edge you need to think

2136
01:59:52,779 --> 02:00:01,779
of it more as a spatial query that can

2137
01:59:57,550 --> 02:00:03,850
very easily determine like you know much

2138
02:00:01,779 --> 02:00:06,969
more easily than checking all of these

2139
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:13,510
edges which ones fall within the

2140
02:00:06,970 --> 02:00:16,119
knockout region of that of that walk

2141
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:18,430
edge right

2142
02:00:16,119 --> 02:00:20,199
so you don't want to be testing like you

2143
02:00:18,430 --> 02:00:23,740
should never be testing this edge

2144
02:00:20,199 --> 02:00:26,019
against this because it's simply not in

2145
02:00:23,739 --> 02:00:28,420
the spatial domain so you want to write

2146
02:00:26,020 --> 02:00:33,460
all of your code to only iterate over

2147
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:35,050
the possible poles that could be you

2148
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:36,789
know involve an edge it's exactly

2149
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:38,529
analogous to anything else you might do

2150
02:00:36,789 --> 02:00:40,600
in a game where you have a large play

2151
02:00:38,529 --> 02:00:43,300
field and you're doing like collision

2152
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:45,670
detection and stuff you only do it on

2153
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:48,610
the local on the things that are local

2154
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:50,440
to that and you usually have a way of

2155
02:00:48,609 --> 02:00:54,159
fast lookup right you have a way of

2156
02:00:50,439 --> 02:00:56,889
doing fast access to your - like buckets

2157
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:59,139
that only contain things in a in a local

2158
02:00:56,890 --> 02:01:03,030
space and you need to do that here as

2159
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:03,030
well does that help

2160
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:12,420
since there's just hi do you know how to

2161
02:01:09,069 --> 02:01:15,819
rotate a font do you use SVG or anything

2162
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:18,250
so no we don't use SVG front-running

2163
02:01:15,819 --> 02:01:22,809
because on handmade here we don't use

2164
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:24,930
libraries so we just directly go to

2165
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:28,030
win32 and we get the font that way

2166
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:30,940
however one time on Shawn's birthday I

2167
02:01:28,029 --> 02:01:33,880
did do a demonstration of how to use STD

2168
02:01:30,939 --> 02:01:35,919
TrueType so there is if 0 dot code that

2169
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:37,810
shows how you would call this to be true

2170
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:44,609
type but we don't use it at the moment

2171
02:01:37,810 --> 02:01:48,160
um as far as how to rotate a font so I

2172
02:01:44,609 --> 02:01:50,889
guess what I would say is we do all of

2173
02:01:48,159 --> 02:01:52,659
our rotation in real time because

2174
02:01:50,890 --> 02:01:54,880
obviously that thing that's very easy to

2175
02:01:52,659 --> 02:01:57,489
do if you already have a renderer that

2176
02:01:54,880 --> 02:02:00,159
rotates sprites you could just rotate if

2177
02:01:57,489 --> 02:02:03,519
I wanted to rotate a font I would just

2178
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:06,760
rotate it when I go to render it I

2179
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:13,950
wouldn't pre-rotate the font so if

2180
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:17,260
you're actually talking about how do i

2181
02:02:13,949 --> 02:02:20,729
pre rotate the font and like save it out

2182
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:23,560
as a font that has been rotated which I

2183
02:02:20,729 --> 02:02:26,709
can't say sounds like a good idea but

2184
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:29,230
let's say you were going to do that then

2185
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:30,010
what you're gonna have to do is you're

2186
02:02:29,229 --> 02:02:35,529
gonna have

2187
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:38,889
to either leverage the underlying

2188
02:02:35,529 --> 02:02:42,639
library you're using to make the font if

2189
02:02:38,889 --> 02:02:45,099
you have one to ask it to rasterize it

2190
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:47,109
originally in that angle which for

2191
02:02:45,099 --> 02:02:50,769
example even though we're not using any

2192
02:02:47,109 --> 02:02:53,229
libraries we are calling windows to get

2193
02:02:50,769 --> 02:02:55,090
the font and it happens to have a thing

2194
02:02:53,229 --> 02:02:57,218
that allows you to set the angle of a

2195
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:59,679
font for rasterization I if I remember

2196
02:02:57,219 --> 02:03:02,109
correctly so you could actually do that

2197
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:03,670
in some sense it's more powerful to not

2198
02:03:02,109 --> 02:03:05,469
use a library to rasterize your font

2199
02:03:03,670 --> 02:03:06,658
than to use one because windows if

2200
02:03:05,469 --> 02:03:09,368
you're getting the font from that

2201
02:03:06,658 --> 02:03:11,979
directly it actually is in a sense a

2202
02:03:09,368 --> 02:03:13,658
giant library it just so happens that

2203
02:03:11,979 --> 02:03:15,968
almost all of it is useless for games

2204
02:03:13,658 --> 02:03:19,000
right but it is a giant library that you

2205
02:03:15,969 --> 02:03:21,578
have there and you can use so in some

2206
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,229
sense not using true type s to be true

2207
02:03:21,578 --> 02:03:24,429
type it's actually a benefit because if

2208
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:25,658
you go through Windows I think it does

2209
02:03:24,429 --> 02:03:28,029
have two billion clips up the flap for

2210
02:03:25,658 --> 02:03:29,848
you if you wanted that I don't know if

2211
02:03:28,029 --> 02:03:33,069
that's you're asking um

2212
02:03:29,849 --> 02:03:34,840
OpenType so more complete font i was i

2213
02:03:33,069 --> 02:03:36,578
sv true that's like a one header you

2214
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:39,219
know it's supposed to be small right

2215
02:03:36,578 --> 02:03:42,670
suppose we compact easy to use to in

2216
02:03:39,219 --> 02:03:45,099
your project um more complex libraries

2217
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:49,090
like open type or free type or whatever

2218
02:03:45,099 --> 02:03:50,739
it's called that might have it to the

2219
02:03:49,090 --> 02:03:52,000
ability to tilt I don't know but I don't

2220
02:03:50,738 --> 02:03:53,198
think a subi TrueType does because it's

2221
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:57,399
kind of outside the scope of what su

2222
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:59,768
btrim I was down to do so if you only

2223
02:03:57,399 --> 02:04:04,078
have access to say something like s to

2224
02:03:59,769 --> 02:04:07,679
be true type which rasterizes the fonts

2225
02:04:04,078 --> 02:04:11,319
um and you need them to be rasterized

2226
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:14,590
rotated then you've got two options one

2227
02:04:11,319 --> 02:04:16,658
you can go edit SD be true type to

2228
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:22,059
rotate the curves

2229
02:04:16,658 --> 02:04:24,879
prior to rasterizing them okay that's a

2230
02:04:22,059 --> 02:04:28,769
mod has to be true type not particularly

2231
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:32,230
hard when probably but it is a mod two

2232
02:04:28,769 --> 02:04:35,050
you could write a true type font loader

2233
02:04:32,229 --> 02:04:36,488
that loads a true type font rotates all

2234
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:38,340
the curves and writes it out as a new

2235
02:04:36,488 --> 02:04:42,678
font then pass a test to be true type

2236
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:45,409
that would work too or

2237
02:04:42,679 --> 02:04:46,819
no pain let su be TrueType or whatever

2238
02:04:45,408 --> 02:04:49,998
library using rasterize the flop

2239
02:04:46,819 --> 02:04:51,920
right-side up and then you write

2240
02:04:49,998 --> 02:04:53,809
something like we have on handmade hero

2241
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:56,449
when we wrote our software rasterizer

2242
02:04:53,809 --> 02:04:59,869
that takes a rectangle and can rotate

2243
02:04:56,448 --> 02:05:02,268
the rectangle call that into an

2244
02:04:59,868 --> 02:05:07,458
off-screen bitmap we grab the rectangle

2245
02:05:02,269 --> 02:05:10,939
and save it out I mean those are options

2246
02:05:07,458 --> 02:05:12,889
I would however asked again are you sure

2247
02:05:10,939 --> 02:05:15,920
that you want to actually rotate the

2248
02:05:12,889 --> 02:05:19,489
font and not actually just take the

2249
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:23,328
output of the font as unrotated and

2250
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:27,198
rotate it at runtime you know be sure

2251
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:31,578
you actually want what you want before

2252
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:38,149
you go too far down one of those one of

2253
02:05:31,578 --> 02:05:40,658
those roads right so all right let's

2254
02:05:38,149 --> 02:05:40,658
wrap it up

2255
02:05:52,630 --> 02:05:58,060
okay thank you everybody for joining up

2256
02:05:57,130 --> 02:05:59,859
sort of handmade here it's been a

2257
02:05:58,060 --> 02:06:01,690
pleasure coding with you as always if

2258
02:05:59,859 --> 02:06:03,279
you would like to follow along series at

2259
02:06:01,689 --> 02:06:05,019
home you can always peer to the game at

2260
02:06:03,279 --> 02:06:06,969
handmade hero org and it comes to source

2261
02:06:05,020 --> 02:06:08,020
code so you can play around with it if

2262
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:09,250
you're interested in learning engine

2263
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:10,900
programming and you want to follow what

2264
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:13,960
we're doing on this series that's a good

2265
02:06:10,899 --> 02:06:16,210
way to do it I will be back here for

2266
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:18,119
another Krampus loft surprise stream

2267
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:19,989
probably tomorrow let's be honest

2268
02:06:18,119 --> 02:06:24,220
there's going to be a lot of streams

2269
02:06:19,989 --> 02:06:27,069
this month and next month so hope to see

2270
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:28,570
you back here for that surprise I can't

2271
02:06:27,069 --> 02:06:30,969
promise when it's going to be but it'll

2272
02:06:28,569 --> 02:06:31,989
be sometime soon until then have fun

2273
02:06:30,970 --> 02:06:34,980
programming I'll see everyone on the

2274
02:06:31,989 --> 02:06:34,979
Internet take it easy everybody
