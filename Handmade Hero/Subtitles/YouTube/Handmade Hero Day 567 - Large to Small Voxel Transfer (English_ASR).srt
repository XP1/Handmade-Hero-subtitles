00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,649
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:08,250
Hero show recode a complete game live on

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:11,309
stream and sometimes as it happens those

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,650
of you watching out there at at home in

5
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:16,250
the comfort of your own living room or

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,719
wherever you're watching this room I

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,570
have some ideas that are better than my

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,448
ideas when you're watching stream and I

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,740
feel like that happened yesterday at the

10
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,118
very end of the stream I was like whom

11
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,618
we got to align this thing and maybe I

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,649
need to sort of figure out some way to

13
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,719
do an alignment update and then in the

14
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,949
Q&amp;A some was just like can't we just

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,890
make sure this thing is always a

16
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,059
multiple and I had discounted that

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,679
possibility in my head because I was

18
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,439
thinking about the wrong way I was

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,530
thinking like well I don't want to have

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,959
to make the world chunks be a multiple

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,920
of the lighting size and then I was like

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,230
wait a minute that's where I'm going to

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,489
think of it just make the lighting size

24
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:59,189
be a divider on the chunk size that's

25
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,538
what we should have done and it's okay

26
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,009
we didn't really spend hardly any time

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,960
on it yesterday it was only 10 minutes

28
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:05,728
or 15 minutes or something so I'm not

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,659
you know I'm not gonna lose sleep about

30
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:11,969
it but it is definitely true that that

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,549
that was a case where the chat was on

32
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:17,429
top of it and I wasn't so let's take a

33
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,189
look at what I'm saying for those of you

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,400
just joining us inside the lighting code

35
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:26,039
there's something I want to do which is

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,680
that if you look here at the bottom of

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,509
the sort of lighting solution work that

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,299
we're doing and this is kind of a big

39
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,368
old gnarly struct that this will get

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,540
sort of mushed down there's a lot of

41
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:39,060
crap in here that was just from

42
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,219
experiments or that isn't relevant

43
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,950
anymore so I realize it's a mess to look

44
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,629
at that's okay we're not gonna clean any

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,478
of this up until we're sure we've got

46
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:50,819
the right solution people who focus on

47
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,359
clean code the entire time you waste a

48
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,828
lot of time of your time cleaning up

49
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,420
code that shouldn't be cleaned up yet

50
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:59,789
and so you know just to re-emphasize

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,549
that what you're doing experimentation

52
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,439
get the experiments working well first

53
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,149
then clean up the code don't do it the

54
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,519
other way around because otherwise you

55
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,679
end up wasting a lot of time it already

56
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,890
wastes a ton of time well I shouldn't

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,568
waste its time well spent but it takes a

58
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,009
a lot of time to do experimentation when

59
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,810
you're exploring and trying to find a

60
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:21,179
good solution to a problem the last

61
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:25,319
thing you want to do is strap another

62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,700
sort of slowdown or or you know when

63
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:28,289
you're running the marathon like that

64
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,389
you don't want to strap a refrigerator

65
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:31,560
to your back don't know why use that

66
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:33,419
metaphor my dad always used to say

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,939
something about strapping refrigerator

68
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,769
back when running a marathon I don't

69
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,569
know why you can't do that people can't

70
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,770
even move favorite Ford Raptor that's

71
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,709
the matter maybe one of those mini

72
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,159
fridges that people use in haut college

73
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,909
dorm rooms or hotels the mini bar

74
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,530
obviously without the stuff in it

75
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,780
because they have those weird sensors

76
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,489
when you pick up the thing at charges to

77
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,019
your hotel room in the mini bar or

78
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,969
whatever so if you actually strap one of

79
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,310
those to your back then as you were

80
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,750
running the jostling would probably make

81
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,860
it so it kept thinking that you bought

82
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,930
stuff from the mini bar and you would

83
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,640
end up with like a huge bill by the time

84
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,409
you got to the end of the marathon and

85
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,958
it seems to me that when you get to the

86
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,250
end of the marathon at very least you

87
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,780
should not have to pay because you

88
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,849
already did a tremendous amount of work

89
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,229
just to run the marathon and it's kind

90
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,489
of like adding insult to injury that's

91
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,979
like congratulations you finished the

92
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,420
marathon oh by the way now you have to

93
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,000
pay the hotel like a hundred and seventy

94
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:27,509
dollars because like the M&amp;M peanuts

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,079
like got bought 1,700 times or something

96
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:34,859
right so if you take nothing else away

97
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,629
from handmade hero I would say don't buy

98
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,640
things from the minibar it's overpriced

99
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:44,159
now back to what I was talking about we

100
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,789
have this idea that we're going to store

101
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,430
the voxel cells as a large sort of

102
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:53,219
region around where the player is and

103
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,310
the reason for that is just that we want

104
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,689
to be able to sort of cache lighting and

105
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,530
it may be a little inaccurate but at

106
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:04,079
least it's cached and then as the player

107
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,169
moves around what we'll do is we'll sort

108
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,750
of page in that section sort of scroll

109
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:12,268
it in inside the voxel if you will and

110
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,219
only in the center area of the voxel

111
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,739
will be actually like update the

112
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:19,680
lighting though and it's true that this

113
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,538
could have some negative artifacts but

114
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,110
with lighting we're always going to have

115
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:27,569
negative artifacts like like artifacts

116
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,100
that that come from the fact that we can

117
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,569
solve the entire lighting every frame

118
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,670
because there's always gonna be some lag

119
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:34,139
some lighting lag and there's nothing we

120
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,840
can do about that but what we're trying

121
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,979
to avoid here is the possibility that

122
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,139
something spills into view and there's

123
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,030
no lighting there right we would rather

124
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,219
have the lighting be a little bit wrong

125
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:46,429
because a light moved or turned off and

126
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,780
it's a little bit wrong or something now

127
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,840
we would rather have that than it always

128
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:53,250
be wrong where we page we scroll fast

129
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,049
and we end up seeing some area that

130
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,560
hasn't had any lighting computations in

131
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,900
a while

132
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,360
I would much rather not get there and go

133
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:04,349
okay it's just black right now and we've

134
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,160
have to like spend 20 30 frames getting

135
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,860
it back up to lit right so I would like

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,470
the ability to cache voxel results as we

137
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,569
move around and so I'm gonna do is have

138
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,730
a large voxel here that stores the

139
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:19,529
lighting information in something much

140
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,420
larger than what we actually transmit to

141
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:23,519
the graphics card so it is is really

142
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,170
just a buffer we're not computing the

143
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,939
lighting necessarily on this we're

144
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:30,390
literally just saying we're gonna store

145
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,860
a big region of the voxel cells and then

146
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,060
what we're gonna do is say we've got a

147
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,449
couple of different things we've got

148
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,240
wear them in in world space in

149
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:41,789
simulation space where is the minimum

150
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,860
corner where is the corner of the part

151
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,990
we're actually doing and then we have

152
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,030
what it's index is in the larger voxel

153
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,220
we have the dimensions of voxel cells

154
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:52,500
and then we have the storage for itself

155
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,470
and then remember the hot voxel region

156
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:59,970
so the region that is the center of this

157
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:02,640
larger voxel grid the center part

158
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,560
specifically that part is what gets

159
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,019
copied to the card and it's actually

160
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,730
used to render lookups we won't copy the

161
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,589
whole voxel because it's much larger

162
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,050
than we actually need to compute the

163
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:16,259
lighting it's just a cache around that

164
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,509
area so where we left off yesterday for

165
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,539
those of you who did not see yesterday's

166
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:23,189
stream is when we actually go to do the

167
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,960
begin lending computation you can see

168
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:28,649
here we sort of had some stuff we were

169
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:31,229
starting with this is the part that we

170
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:33,810
wanted to change instead of trying to

171
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,700
align on every frame we don't want to do

172
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,500
that we want to do this part right here

173
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,149
what I said should we just divided world

174
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,420
chunked in mirrors by some constants the

175
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:43,549
answer is yes so when we in it

176
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,610
lighting what I'd like to do is I'd like

177
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,800
to get that world chunk dim here so

178
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,389
basically I'm gonna demand that when we

179
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,030
initialize the lighting you tell me what

180
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,860
the world is and that way when we look

181
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:57,019
at the world so you know inside the

182
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,960
world struct here you can see that we've

183
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:01,189
got this chunk dim in meters so since we

184
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,430
know that the world will be kind of

185
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:09,050
aligned to that chunk dim in meters at

186
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:12,740
least for the the most part that for the

187
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:16,520
most part we know that world positions

188
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,740
anyway are aligned first of the chunk

189
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,029
Dumon meters with their int offsets and

190
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,040
then there's just a floating-point

191
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:24,199
offset on that that makes it a lot

192
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,090
easier for us to deal with origin P when

193
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,000
it comes into the system inside begin

194
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:31,129
lighting computation so here what I

195
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,319
would like to do is say okay we've got

196
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:34,279
world we got this like chunk Tim in

197
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,219
meters

198
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,619
situation here and the problem that we

199
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:44,840
would have with chunk diamond meters I

200
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:52,280
think is that if you look that's gonna

201
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:53,929
be here yeah so if you look what we end

202
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,939
up with for the world chunk Tim in

203
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,740
meters is you can see that it would

204
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:01,069
imply that our voxel would be

205
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:05,389
non-uniform right because if you look

206
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:07,189
you've got sort of a 17 times 1.4 a nine

207
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,879
times 1.4 and then the typical floor

208
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:12,139
height bit here typical floor height way

209
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:20,659
I don't really know what that's set to

210
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:22,339
at the moment but oh so it's literally

211
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,480
set right there I thought it was

212
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:25,639
something that was get passed in but

213
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,810
it's not um so the typical floor height

214
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:34,309
is like five these are like 1.4 right

215
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:35,960
and it's just like we haven't really set

216
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:40,069
ourselves up for success particularly

217
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:43,639
well here because the the the factors

218
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,730
don't seem to line up like these don't

219
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:49,340
have a factor of five in them and so

220
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:52,789
they wouldn't be even with this these

221
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:55,070
both have a factor of 1.4 and so in

222
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:56,509
theory what we could do is say that the

223
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:04,670
there has to be I mean we you know we

224
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:06,200
could do something like this right so

225
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,269
let's say it is something like that if

226
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,759
we took a look at what the fundamental

227
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:14,329
unit was and we said this 1.4 for

228
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:16,549
whatever reason the we could just set

229
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,820
the typical floor height to be like

230
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:22,849
slightly larger or slightly less large

231
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,220
so instead of 3.5 maybe it's just three

232
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,930
you know so maybe it's like three times

233
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,910
the fundamental unit for something like

234
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:34,939
this and if we did that then our

235
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:37,250
lighting could be represented cleanly

236
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,560
because each of these things divides

237
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:43,159
evenly for the fundamental unit right

238
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:48,139
it's 17 fundamental units across nine

239
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:51,529
fine fundamental units down and three

240
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:54,889
fundamental units vertically like in the

241
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:58,069
Z direction right and maybe that's fine

242
00:09:54,889 --> 00:10:02,840
right like maybe that totally works or

243
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:05,270
maybe that's a like horrible idea and we

244
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,250
have no idea but it would let us align

245
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:11,179
our voxels to the world better and so

246
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:15,169
let's just see if that's terrible or not

247
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:19,370
if I come in here to the world mode

248
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:22,279
itself so we're looking at this game

249
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,870
mode world structure here and I want to

250
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,659
add this concept of a fundamental unit

251
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,820
so we sort of have the typical floor

252
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,990
height here I don't know why that's

253
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,180
stored in here but we probably had a

254
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,730
pretty good reason back in the day

255
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:36,589
because it needs to kind of be known

256
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,470
elsewhere but we got this typical floor

257
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:42,470
height so here we can also have the

258
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,570
fundamental unit size right and then

259
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,330
that way that is just something that

260
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,910
everything is is created from now I'm

261
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:52,040
gonna go ahead and if these out again as

262
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:53,629
well and we're gonna have a problem here

263
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:56,029
where our lighting is not actually

264
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:57,139
working right and that's gonna be an

265
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,339
issue because we won't be able to see

266
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:04,600
anything probably but we could do maybe

267
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,600
this I don't know

268
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,890
yeah you can see here this this wants to

269
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,830
take the world and so when we do our

270
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:20,659
lighting initialization we have the

271
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,790
create world down here and so we should

272
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:24,319
be able to do our init lighting now what

273
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:25,849
we could do though is say look it

274
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,070
doesn't really need to take the world it

275
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,840
could just take the fundamental unit and

276
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,700
that's actually a lot easier so in here

277
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:37,040
we would just say what's the fundamental

278
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:39,320
unit and that becomes our voxel

279
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,230
dimension right so here we would just

280
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,390
say well okay you know the cell

281
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,879
dimensions stuff now we know exactly

282
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:48,710
what it is the cell dimension is always

283
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,590
just the fundamental unit in all

284
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,350
directions that's 1.4 that's the size of

285
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,389
the voxel you know what are you gonna do

286
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,370
about it we can also say that maybe it

287
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:00,379
should have been three wide maybe one

288
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,269
point four was not enough so we could

289
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:04,009
start with twice the fundamental unit as

290
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:06,370
our box will sell them again doesn't

291
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:08,629
matter as long as an even multiple of

292
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,539
the fundamental unit I think we're

293
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:14,090
probably okay so we can certainly do

294
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:16,389
something like this and then we would be

295
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:20,480
out of the business of having to do this

296
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:22,100
modulus based nonsense for our voxel but

297
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,680
again let's just go ahead and see if

298
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,269
this is sensible in terms of the way

299
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,639
everything else works I don't know it

300
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:30,949
might horribly break everything for all

301
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,179
we know now the problem is we don't have

302
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,580
lighting in there at the moment because

303
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:37,129
I've disabled it and so we're just gonna

304
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,320
see a black screen which is not so much

305
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:43,159
what I would like so what I'm gonna do

306
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,480
is inside the OpenGL renderer just so I

307
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:46,339
can verify that we didn't break

308
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,820
everything horribly there I'm gonna go

309
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:52,490
into the Z bias program here and where

310
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,870
we set up the lighting I'm gonna turn it

311
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:59,840
off right so in here I'm just gonna say

312
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,220
lighting disabled equals true and we

313
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,290
should probably hook that up to a more

314
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,790
convenient debug key so I can just

315
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:07,339
toggle that on and off any time we want

316
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:08,719
but we haven't quite gotten there yet so

317
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,120
we're not going to worry about that at

318
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,610
the moment so if you look at what we've

319
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,470
got now here is the version of this

320
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,230
where we've changed the floor height a

321
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,220
little bit the floor Heights are now

322
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,028
less than they were

323
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,129
before and so we may have a couple

324
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:26,600
issues with our world Jen because I

325
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:30,019
don't know if we really made that floyd

326
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,480
parametric but it looks to me right like

327
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:35,899
there's no real harm in that

328
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,060
i you know big deal right

329
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:40,458
everything looks kind of fine it looks

330
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:42,799
like we have a little bit of an early

331
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:44,239
alpha issue but a lot of that's because

332
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,809
we're still using the height of the

333
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:51,889
player for the for the alpha fade which

334
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:53,419
i really didn't want to do like that's

335
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:55,938
kind of just a bug that's been in there

336
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:58,578
for a while and we really don't want

337
00:13:55,938 --> 00:14:02,719
that we sort of want more it to be based

338
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:04,729
on the the stable height of the player

339
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,079
so not like the hopping height the

340
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,819
ground point height and so you know in

341
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:13,068
fact i might maybe let's just go fix

342
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:15,289
that right now but that's the only thing

343
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:17,899
that looks like it's a little annoying

344
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:21,049
so we may also want to change though

345
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,669
that threshold in addition because we

346
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:25,338
might be getting a little bit in fact

347
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:28,219
you can see it's tuned a little bit

348
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:30,050
wrong now if i remember correctly

349
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,199
didn't we do this you can see we've got

350
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:37,370
an alpha min alpha max there so if you

351
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:40,099
look you can kind of see this may be

352
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,409
hard for the folks at home to see and i

353
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,839
apologize for that but if you look at

354
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:47,899
what the alpha level you can see these

355
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:51,620
like the black lines of just just a very

356
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:53,778
bottom of those cubes from the ceiling

357
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,179
are visible that's again because the

358
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:59,480
floor height is the Alpha min alpha span

359
00:14:56,179 --> 00:15:01,429
is now tuned in properly so you know you

360
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,490
can see if I if I adjust this value

361
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:07,159
using our real-time controls right you

362
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,379
can see me kind of play with that I

363
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:12,019
think we want that to be somewhere more

364
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:12,800
around to now probably or something like

365
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,438
that

366
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,688
let's just see if we can tune that value

367
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:20,318
something that we like better and then

368
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:20,318
we'll use it

369
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:46,189
so I think I like that I think I like

370
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,740
that maybe so a 1.6 and then the 7.5

371
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:52,250
alphys man so I'm gonna go ahead and

372
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,750
take a look at the Alpha min default

373
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,089
setting that we've got in there I think

374
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,429
I might go ahead and change that you can

375
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:00,350
see it's set to 275 here I'm gonna go

376
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:02,449
ahead and change that alpha min to 1.6

377
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,879
again you can see how nice it is when

378
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:09,250
you get those debug sliders working in

379
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:14,659
there again that's just a nice way of

380
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:17,240
making sure that you always can tune the

381
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:19,328
artistic elements of the game as

382
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,500
necessary to make them work better

383
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:23,199
without having to go through a lot of

384
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,230
trial ner it's just a nice little

385
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,060
simplistic aspect of that I'm seeing a

386
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,070
little bit of alpha there so you know

387
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:33,129
I'm I'm actually thinking maybe I was a

388
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,600
little bit aggressive so you know maybe

389
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:41,448
maybe 2 is actually a little bit more

390
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:44,540
required I will say it looks like that

391
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:54,109
alpha is not based on Z it looks like

392
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:57,559
it's based on camera Z no no it's not

393
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,060
so nevermind we did it correctly but I

394
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,500
guess yeah like I said I see a little

395
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,078
alpha coming in there so I want I don't

396
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:07,750
want any out on those bottom ones so it

397
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:07,750
maybe needs to be more like a 2 5

398
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:19,548
and that just clips out that ceiling

399
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:35,789
or just you know two to five seems

400
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:38,519
pretty safe all right so I'm gonna

401
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:40,920
switch that to two to five and then I

402
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,210
want to just go fix that bouncy bug cuz

403
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,529
it bugs me

404
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,930
I really hate graphics you've

405
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:50,579
you've seen me get annoyed on stream for

406
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,080
stuff like that and so even though I

407
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:55,470
know that's not something that's

408
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:59,039
probably that bad I just I

409
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,410
yeah it's not super okay with it

410
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,930
so anyway I'm gonna go take a look I

411
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:05,460
don't remember much about that code so I

412
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,430
just want to see it I'm assuming it's

413
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,500
probably something to do with the the

414
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,539
code for update camera for enemy

415
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,740
movement and so I don't know I'm just

416
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:19,009
gonna take a quick look at it but so you

417
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,620
can see the focus Minzy and Maxie are

418
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:25,769
basically like set from the the room

419
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:27,689
focus in the entity focus so if we look

420
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:35,849
at what the entity focus is I just want

421
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:39,000
to see what that that is okay so if you

422
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:46,259
look here you've got new target P - n DP

423
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,900
z there for the editing focus see and

424
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:51,269
the room focus Z is just whatever the

425
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,800
distances to the cameras are so I want

426
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:55,650
to take a look what does entity here is

427
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,839
it just the entity yes so entity is just

428
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,490
the thing that we're focusing on and so

429
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,689
you can see the fact that we've we're

430
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:06,089
taking this this this new target P here

431
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,820
and it looks like what we're saying for

432
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:11,730
entity focus Z is this is like the

433
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:20,069
difference between the thing that the

434
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:22,380
cameras focusing on and and and where

435
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:27,599
the the player is right that's that's

436
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:31,530
all that is and if we look I you know I

437
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,509
guess we must use that entity Z value in

438
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:34,500
a way that makes that make sense because

439
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:37,099
those are sort of measuring two

440
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,099
different things here

441
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:48,610
oh because that's the new target P of

442
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,160
the camera no that's fine that's of the

443
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:53,409
camera not of the room okay so we're

444
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,610
good so basically all we're saying here

445
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,070
is look how far is the camera from the

446
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:59,169
entity all good problem is the entity

447
00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:01,269
hops around and so what I want to do is

448
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:04,200
go look and see like what do we do for

449
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:07,569
get ground point or do we even have that

450
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,330
like how does the entity know where it

451
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:13,359
is in terms of like hopping around and

452
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:15,059
stuff like that we need to figure that

453
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:19,269
out right we need to sort of get that

454
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:23,169
under control so if we take a look at

455
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:25,990
entity here and we just want to make

456
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:30,210
sure that we have some kind of a you

457
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:36,849
know a handle on its out of Z location I

458
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:38,610
feel like we need it really we store

459
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:40,899
this must be why we didn't do it

460
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:44,229
originally doesn't lis we really store

461
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:48,670
information about where it was on the

462
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:52,000
ground so let me take a look just inside

463
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:55,060
the entity code that little like hopping

464
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,190
code that we're out I just want to look

465
00:20:55,059 --> 00:21:00,099
and see how that's working so if you

466
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:03,600
look here at hopping it looks like we

467
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:05,709
just set the nd P between these two

468
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:11,169
directly right so there's a twosome

469
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:13,150
space traversable yeah so I feel like we

470
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:16,269
kind of need to store a little bit of

471
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,490
extra data here because this is how

472
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:22,420
we're this is how we're keeping this

473
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:26,200
information it's implicit in in the

474
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:28,890
to-and-from and so we kind of need to be

475
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,180
able to project it back down onto that

476
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:36,660
vector if that makes sense

477
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:43,480
so I would say we need something like

478
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:46,120
you know when we're planted the entity P

479
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,259
just is what it is right so like you

480
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:52,109
know entity ground P equals entity P or

481
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:56,720
something like that

482
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:56,719
so this is like the the stable version

483
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:02,069
although come to think of it even this

484
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,620
is not quite right because as you hop

485
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:06,629
around there's sort of a you're sort of

486
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:10,769
moving at different heights as the

487
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:13,350
ground is uneven so but that's probably

488
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:16,200
okay so let's say that we do it this way

489
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:17,609
where we have a ground fee that we

490
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,289
update and it's just whatever the

491
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:21,449
entity's actual placement is and then

492
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:25,500
when we are doing anything where you

493
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:29,100
might actually have a hop of some kind

494
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:32,339
there what I'd like to do is set this up

495
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:35,490
so that we are properly doing that

496
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:40,349
projection so here it looks like when

497
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:48,900
we're doing movement to and movement

498
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:56,369
from right this should be pretty

499
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:58,800
straightforward yeah it is if you look

500
00:22:56,369 --> 00:23:01,829
at this right all we really need to do

501
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:05,839
here is there's like the hopping like

502
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:05,839
the height displacement so it's this

503
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:10,979
right here is like the height

504
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:14,250
displacement it's the it's the Z

505
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,819
displacement right and so this is just a

506
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:22,019
parabola between these points and if you

507
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:24,808
look at sort of the the parabolic arc

508
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:27,690
here the B function which is just linear

509
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:30,799
between the two if we want to we can

510
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:33,750
just compute that actual linear quantity

511
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,690
and use that directly to update the

512
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,609
position so in terms of the entity like

513
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,070
ground P here it's actually quite simple

514
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:45,000
it's just the lerp between these two

515
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:47,269
vectors these two based on T so what do

516
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,009
we call this is it lerp it's just lerp

517
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:52,170
so if we want to we can just say there's

518
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:54,150
a movement from and a movement to and

519
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,340
we're gonna lurk those for the ground P

520
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:59,880
in that case but in that case only for a

521
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:04,230
hopping entity I think that's all we

522
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:07,049
really need right and so I think that

523
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:09,210
that's probably sufficient I don't know

524
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:11,368
that ground P needs to be saved because

525
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,720
it's derived from the other information

526
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:14,278
so we can probably just stick it in the

527
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,690
part that's only for active entities

528
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:21,720
that are in the cache seems plausible to

529
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,179
me anyway oh and yeah obviously we have

530
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,350
to we compile we're changing the layout

531
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:34,980
of a fundamental structure there so

532
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:38,278
that's not gonna fly alright so now in

533
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,980
theory I think we should have stable

534
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:43,589
ground projection so when we hop down

535
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:53,128
the stairs we should now see smooth

536
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:55,319
descent through the Alpha and I'm

537
00:24:53,128 --> 00:24:59,199
totally wrong about that apparently oh

538
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,200
[Laughter]

539
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,720
yeah so it turns out one thing you

540
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:06,989
should do is if you go through the

541
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,819
trouble of computing this value you

542
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,230
should actually use it I don't know how

543
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:12,329
many times I've done that in a mere here

544
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,069
or where I'm like and so we will use

545
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:17,759
this thing and then we don't use the

546
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:19,230
thing so yet obviously I was trying to

547
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,690
compute a different value to use for

548
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,220
that expression never actually used it

549
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,450
in that expression so it's not a

550
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,879
surprise let's try that one more time

551
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,429
hopefully we'll get a better result now

552
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:34,949
so here is the stopping around we're

553
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:37,190
gonna go ahead and go down the stairs

554
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:43,210
here

555
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:43,210
and so let's give that a shot

556
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:51,950
and so you know we do get from the

557
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:53,988
height variance like the fact that this

558
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,929
is higher than that we get a little bit

559
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:58,879
of variance there so you know I don't

560
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:01,129
know if we want to try and clamp to an

561
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:05,408
actual floor level or something like

562
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:07,788
that you know we certainly could and

563
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:10,278
that's something we can think about a

564
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:13,339
little bit later we could store for

565
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:18,288
example with our interpolation points we

566
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:20,238
could store a ground p-value with those

567
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:22,249
interpolation points so that the the

568
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:25,759
actual traversable x'

569
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:27,979
right the hopping locations we could

570
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,048
store something that that told us about

571
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:31,548
that and then interpolate that for

572
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:36,069
stable I don't know if we want to go

573
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:42,288
that far with it that's a tough call

574
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:44,388
probably we do want to go that far with

575
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:46,128
it but at least we've gotten rid of most

576
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:50,898
of the objection artifact there so we'll

577
00:26:46,128 --> 00:26:52,009
save that part for another day cuz you

578
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:54,378
know what we would do is we would just

579
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:56,118
go and say that there's a ground p-value

580
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:58,339
well you know what I'm just I'm sorry

581
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:59,808
it's these things really bugged me and

582
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:03,618
there's not much I can can do about it

583
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:05,829
but let me just take a look at what that

584
00:27:03,618 --> 00:27:08,829
would look like so in the entity code

585
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:12,019
when we're doing the hopping calculation

586
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:20,989
when you get this sim spaced reversible

587
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:23,419
right you can see it doing this this

588
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:25,999
given D by ID and then it looks at

589
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:31,429
whichever traversable is on that

590
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:32,720
particular entity right which by the way

591
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:34,159
I'm not sure why we do it that way

592
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,278
instead of just making traversals be

593
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,599
their own entities probably not so what

594
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:40,190
do i do so you know what we would

595
00:27:38,598 --> 00:27:44,358
probably do is in the future I think we

596
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:46,249
would probably say that these will will

597
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:48,728
be their own entities and we'll probably

598
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:52,569
just use parenting to move them around

599
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:52,569
that would be my suspicion

600
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,120
yeah so looking at this I think there's

601
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,850
a couple things you want to do and I'm

602
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,619
gonna make some notes up here on these

603
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:13,909
so in the entity itself I think what we

604
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:54,589
want to do is say okay I think we want

605
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:55,850
to say and the last thing is I think we

606
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:57,259
want to make these changes but I'm gonna

607
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:59,829
do that more towards the gameplay code

608
00:28:57,259 --> 00:28:59,829
side of things

609
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,470
I think we want to do that later but I

610
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:30,900
do want to do it is awesome saying so

611
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:35,950
let's get back to the lighting code now

612
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:38,170
and yeah I think like I said setting

613
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,549
that fundamental unit is just seems like

614
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:43,029
the right thing because there's really

615
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:44,440
no there's really no harm in it and it

616
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:47,230
seems like everything works just fine

617
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:52,059
there's no weirdness to having the

618
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:55,120
fluorides be smaller so everything's

619
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:57,849
just just dandy I think and if you look

620
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,169
at this it fits nicely in there it

621
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:02,139
doesn't look like the floors are too

622
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:04,470
small if anything that's probably little

623
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:08,920
bit better than it was before

624
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:12,220
so I'm I'm totally fine with that all

625
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,350
righty then so coming back to the

626
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,740
lighting code that means that this is

627
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:19,389
now basically all correct in terms of

628
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,609
showing the voxel cell dimensions and

629
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:24,280
all that good stuff when we go in to

630
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:27,879
begin lighting computation here what we

631
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:34,750
want to do is we want to go ahead and

632
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:37,360
take the sort of the part we were gonna

633
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,519
do with the modulus before and what we

634
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:42,009
know is that the world position now that

635
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,799
part we don't really care about as much

636
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:46,170
right the world position is not super

637
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,579
important to us anymore

638
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:51,490
what we really because we know that the

639
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:56,589
the sort of numerical version of that

640
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:59,680
the go ahead and jump over here the

641
00:30:56,589 --> 00:31:03,970
chunk X chunk Y in shunt Z we know those

642
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,580
are now correctly aligned to the light

643
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:09,339
voxel automatically so it's really only

644
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:11,679
this part that's not aligned if that

645
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:14,250
makes sense so that's the only part we

646
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,380
really have to worry about aligning

647
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:19,390
verses so you know we can kind of come

648
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,180
up with a composite offset there right

649
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:25,509
where we say if this is the origin P and

650
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,600
this is the offset from the chunk centre

651
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:30,069
where this world position actually is

652
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:33,129
then if we wanted to figure out where

653
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:38,389
this camera offset origin was in terms

654
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:41,270
of its relative position we would

655
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:45,380
have to use this offset manually and we

656
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:47,509
know that these parts are alive right so

657
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,300
we have to do now is start to get these

658
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:52,670
voxels placed in the correct way I would

659
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:55,399
like to be able to sort of draw this

660
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:58,820
region a little bit so what I want to do

661
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:05,660
here if possible is go into the world

662
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:08,389
mode and we have the sort of you have

663
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:11,750
the sort of volume outline stuff right

664
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:15,620
and what I'd like to do is draw this in

665
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:18,259
here so I want to draw two things I want

666
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:20,779
to draw the region that we're actually

667
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:23,869
going to light so I want to draw like

668
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:26,539
the large voxel and in the hot voxel

669
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:29,839
right so I want to have a large voxel

670
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:31,879
erect and a hot voxel erect and I want

671
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:36,859
to draw like the large voxel rec this

672
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:39,410
one thing and the you know the hot voxel

673
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:41,509
rect is another thing and now I want to

674
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,670
be able to like hop the dude around and

675
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:45,710
I want to see them move correctly

676
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:48,740
because there's a lot of stuff we can

677
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:53,210
get wrong in here it's gonna be a pretty

678
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:55,099
finicky computation so rather than try

679
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:57,350
to get it working all at once I just

680
00:32:55,099 --> 00:33:00,019
want to get the visual version working

681
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:04,099
so I know it's right and then we move on

682
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:05,779
to actually using it for lighting again

683
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:08,919
always breaking the problem down as much

684
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:11,450
as I can into smaller verifiable chunks

685
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,100
because especially with something like

686
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,890
lighting where it's very hard sometimes

687
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:18,379
to tell what's going on when you look at

688
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,570
it you want as much as possible to break

689
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:23,120
it down into pieces that you have some

690
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:26,659
chance of getting a thumbs up or thumbs

691
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,729
down on clearly rather than Maya looks

692
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,350
kind of like it's working I don't know

693
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:34,120
you know that's not a good place to be

694
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:38,619
because small bugs can pound their right

695
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:40,639
alright so what I might want to do is

696
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:44,000
try and figure out the rest of this

697
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:48,470
information so inside the lighting comp

698
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,700
I'm sorry inside the lighting solution

699
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:54,440
right we do want to keep an old value

700
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,100
for the world for like where we're

701
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,320
aligning our large voxel but I'm not

702
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:02,808
going to do that yet because before we

703
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:06,378
do anything that keeps an old one we

704
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:09,289
want to do something that figures out

705
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:11,358
where the new one is and so I'm gonna go

706
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:13,279
ahead and do just that part first and

707
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:16,929
then we'll worry about updating the

708
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,940
voxel 4motion a little bit later on

709
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:24,168
alright so we need to come up with two

710
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:27,318
things we need a rectangle three four

711
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:29,000
large voxel erect and this needs to be

712
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:31,909
something and then we need the hotbox

713
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,800
erect now if we have the large voxel

714
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:36,409
erect it should be pretty easy to come

715
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,050
up with the hot voxel rect right because

716
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:41,088
the hot voxel rect is pretty simple it's

717
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,619
just gonna be well and I guess in some

718
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:44,269
sense both of these are very simple but

719
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:46,700
I guess what I mean is the Vox min

720
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:51,280
corner hot part we kind of know what it

721
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:54,408
is because it's a fixed offset away from

722
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,700
the larger one or alternatively if we

723
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:57,530
want to phrase it the opposite way

724
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,088
around we could just say once we know

725
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,890
where the hot one is we know where the

726
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:02,809
large one is so we really only need to

727
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:05,719
compute one or the other because they're

728
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:09,259
locked to each other and so it's it

729
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:11,480
should be a straightforward equation to

730
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,460
get one once we know the other one right

731
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,318
but computing the first one is what will

732
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:19,550
be hard because it requires that

733
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:22,639
alignment calculation okay so we know

734
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:24,318
that in order to do the the hot versus

735
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,909
the large these are both going to start

736
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:28,190
with whatever we compute the corners to

737
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:31,279
be up above and then we sort of got some

738
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,980
some ancillary information that has to

739
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,170
be computed here we'll go ahead and set

740
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,608
that up but I want to start naming these

741
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,588
things more appropriately because if you

742
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:42,529
look at what these are named light dim

743
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:44,630
ins light dim not helpful what we want

744
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:47,300
to say is this is the hot dim versus the

745
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:50,119
large dim so let's just make sure that

746
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:55,930
that's clear so here we say all right

747
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:55,930
we've got a hot sell count here oops

748
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:05,720
so that's how many that's how how big

749
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:07,400
the the sort of hot version is this way

750
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,679
so the dimension of that is going to be

751
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,039
the hot cell count times the voxel cell

752
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,339
diem

753
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:16,159
again voxel damn same between the two so

754
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,780
the inverse of the of that right it's

755
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,579
just one over it so all that stuff

756
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,320
remains the same and then here we're

757
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:24,259
just gonna say alright so this is the

758
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:27,170
large Jim and this is the hot-dip right

759
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:29,450
so now we're down to like okay what's

760
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:31,849
the large dim how is that specified

761
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:33,769
again pretty straightforward all we

762
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:37,880
really need to do here is figure out

763
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:41,389
what you know back here we got the light

764
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,210
large voxel dim we can do large cell

765
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:46,250
count like so and then we can compute

766
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,650
these same two values now we don't need

767
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,000
this one necessarily at least not at the

768
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,340
moment so we're not going to compute it

769
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,280
till we know we actually need it so we

770
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:58,490
really just have large cell count times

771
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,940
that voxel down so now we've got all of

772
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:03,979
that is pretty much correct right and

773
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,159
what you can see breaking down here is

774
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:09,590
most of this stuff is just known so all

775
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:12,139
of this is like a no-brainer right

776
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:15,440
that's just right off the bat without

777
00:37:12,139 --> 00:37:18,139
doing any calculations really we can

778
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,150
compute all of those values just from

779
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:23,359
what are effectively constants really

780
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:26,360
right and so when you look at the the

781
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,789
actual hard part of the computation the

782
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,099
part that it's gonna be finicky is

783
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:34,099
computing one of these two corners and

784
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:35,929
again once we get one of the corners the

785
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:38,690
other one will follow suit so what I'm

786
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:40,609
gonna do is say look the hot voxel is

787
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,590
the one that actually matters the hot

788
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,599
voxel is the one that actually has to be

789
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:48,500
fit to the camera and it's gonna require

790
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:53,119
a lot of sort of funky sauce there to

791
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:54,710
make that be a reasonable equation that

792
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,319
always gives us you know a reasonable

793
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,490
expression that always gives us

794
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,340
something that covers the area properly

795
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:02,329
and doesn't you know because before we

796
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,829
were sort of doing something it's like

797
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:05,569
let's look at the camera frustum and

798
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:07,369
what's it doing we can't really do that

799
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:09,890
because we don't want this thing to

800
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:10,849
shift around so we kind of have to do is

801
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:13,759
go what's

802
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:17,630
the maximum amount we're ever gonna zoom

803
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,750
out and make that lighting capture that

804
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:25,090
right and then when we zoom in we need

805
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:25,090
to stay the same so we have to kind of

806
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:33,620
we have to kind of do some more

807
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:36,559
aggressive positioning here we can't

808
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:38,420
just use camera information directly so

809
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:43,940
it's gonna be a little bit of work to

810
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:45,829
make this to make this go right I think

811
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,300
we and I think we need one more piece of

812
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:50,630
information here too which is like the

813
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:57,800
target location like what the camera is

814
00:38:50,630 --> 00:39:00,289
actually looking at right so anyway if

815
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,539
we want to you know keep seam down this

816
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:04,820
path let's compute this one so that

817
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:07,519
means now I think I can also down here

818
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:11,539
before we go pass it I can write an

819
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:13,849
expression that gives me the large voxel

820
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:16,429
corner from the hot voxel corner and the

821
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:19,670
reason that I think that's easy is

822
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:21,139
because we've sort of already said that

823
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,869
there's a fixed displacement between

824
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:25,759
these two things so the hot corner I for

825
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:27,949
example will probably just be something

826
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,930
we set in here it's not gonna be dynamic

827
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:32,449
it's just gonna be something that says

828
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:35,089
where does the hot voxel live inside the

829
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:38,799
larger voxel so the hot corner I is a

830
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:42,470
pretty easy thing I think for us to do

831
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:46,039
all we need to say is look what's the

832
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:48,500
actual dimensions of these various

833
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:50,690
voxels right and that will tell us where

834
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,570
they go in fact I can even do this

835
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:56,059
dynamically in case we do want to allow

836
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:58,400
the lighting voxel to be different

837
00:39:56,059 --> 00:40:00,619
dimensions at runtime I don't know that

838
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,470
we ever actually want that but you can

839
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:05,389
imagine doing that because if you assume

840
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:07,399
that you have the large cell count and

841
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:10,069
the hot cell count that's more or less

842
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,570
all you really need to know because if

843
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,220
you think of what we're doing we have

844
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:15,230
the large cell count which is a bigger

845
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:18,230
number than hot cell count it's like 128

846
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:21,280
and hot cell counts like 16 right so

847
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:24,250
what we want to do is say if we have a

848
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,260
16 in the middle of a 128 how

849
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:28,090
we figure out where that's a line well

850
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,760
pretty straightforwardly we can just say

851
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:33,010
let's remove the large the hot cell

852
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:41,170
count from the large cell count right so

853
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:45,420
we would say something like this so we'd

854
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:49,840
say this is how many cells are left over

855
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:52,720
on either side right so if we divided

856
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,640
this by two right we would get how many

857
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,699
large cells there should be like on the

858
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:58,690
left of the hot cell count and how many

859
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:02,319
there should be on the right of the

860
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:05,789
count right roughly speaking so that

861
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:09,760
tells us where the hot corner should be

862
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:11,920
if we just use that offset that tells us

863
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,680
how far we would go to get to where if

864
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,289
we want a roughly center the hot cell

865
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:18,940
count inside the large cell count that's

866
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:21,550
all we really need right because that's

867
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:25,000
how many you would go to get roughly

868
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:26,680
halfway to where this thing is right and

869
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,449
we don't want to go the whole way

870
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:30,219
because that would push it all the way

871
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:31,599
to the end right and we want it in the

872
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:33,909
middle so we're dividing by two so that

873
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,250
we put the same on either side of the

874
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:39,099
hot cell count so competing the hot

875
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:42,219
corner I very simple right

876
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:44,769
so once we have the hot corner I all we

877
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:47,649
need to do then is say well from the min

878
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:50,230
corner if we just go backwards however

879
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,960
that much however much that is that's

880
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:56,800
all we need right so the Hadamard

881
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:01,170
product just of the of how many cells we

882
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:04,930
need to go the Hadamard product of that

883
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:07,590
like so or is this just this now I think

884
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:10,059
the Hadamard product of that with

885
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:16,809
whatever the cell dimension actually is

886
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:20,039
right is is all wheat I think right

887
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:23,380
there shouldn't really be anything else

888
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:25,809
involved so once we have all of those

889
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:28,180
computed then we're just at a point

890
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,500
where yeah now we need to okay so we

891
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:30,639
don't know we do have the render group I

892
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:35,769
was like we need the render group in

893
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:37,389
here there we go so once we have all

894
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:37,789
that the only thing that's missing now

895
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,609
you

896
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:42,440
just that anchor point where does we

897
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,329
just need one point in space and we've

898
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,670
computed everything else for our entire

899
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:48,619
voxel system from that point of space we

900
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,090
now need to get that point in space we

901
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:51,739
need to find that point space and that's

902
00:42:50,090 --> 00:43:00,740
where we're at now let's make sure that

903
00:42:51,739 --> 00:43:02,629
all of this stuff is is set up properly

904
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:04,849
as well so we should have no compiler

905
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:07,130
errors now and the only problem that we

906
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:09,860
have now with our voxel is the voxels

907
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,809
just not we it's not centered right so

908
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,000
it's always gonna be at zero the hot the

909
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:16,369
hot voxel corner is always gonna be at

910
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,090
zero zero zero which we know is not

911
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:23,929
correct right but if we actually look at

912
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:26,210
it you can see we've got it now right we

913
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:28,460
actually do have it there and you can

914
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:31,220
see it's sort of aligned in the middle

915
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:33,530
as well so it's exactly what we would

916
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:36,019
have wanted right it's it looks exactly

917
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:39,530
right now one thing I would say is

918
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:42,409
something seems off about the dimensions

919
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:47,000
of the voxel that looks too large

920
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:49,460
potentially well actually it might not

921
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,769
when you think about zooming out to that

922
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,019
thing maybe it's not it might be a

923
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:56,690
little bit but let's see what happens if

924
00:43:54,019 --> 00:44:00,110
we change the fundamental unit scalar

925
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:03,769
there so I'm just curious let's suppose

926
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:06,079
I go into this system during unit time

927
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:09,920
and say the fundamental unit it's it's

928
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:14,569
one long instead right I'm just I'm not

929
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,519
sure that that might not be good but

930
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:20,030
that might now be two that might be too

931
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:21,440
small now right but that's what that

932
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,000
would look like and and that looks like

933
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,190
a little bit better bounce I'm just not

934
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,019
sure this might not be quite enough when

935
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:29,809
you look at what happens when we sort of

936
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:32,210
hop into let's say this other region

937
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:34,900
over here right I'm just not sure that

938
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:37,519
that's enough lighting information

939
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:42,230
necessarily it might be a little too

940
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:44,389
small and so that's the only sort of

941
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:47,389
Squinkie bit

942
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:51,498
maybe we do want it the - maybe we want

943
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:54,558
the one I really don't know I so let's

944
00:44:51,498 --> 00:44:57,498
go ahead and and just try to get a

945
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:01,009
little bit of a better feel for this so

946
00:44:57,498 --> 00:45:04,578
in here let's make one small change just

947
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:05,778
so we can get a more ballpark feel for

948
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:08,210
whether it's too big or too small or

949
00:45:05,778 --> 00:45:12,679
whatever else if I take the Vox Minh

950
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:15,739
corner hot and I just say yeah I'm gonna

951
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:18,588
place that at I'm gonna shift its dim

952
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:20,838
sort of back a bit so I'm gonna compute

953
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:24,400
this first and I'm gonna say that it's

954
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:31,849
gonna be the negative hot Vox erect

955
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:33,318
minimum or rather dimension oh I

956
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:38,390
actually never mind I don't need that I

957
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:41,239
just need hot dick I'm just gonna go

958
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:42,920
back by half the hot dimension so I'm

959
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:45,679
basically shifting this back I'm gonna

960
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,180
shift it over this way just to see what

961
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,768
that looks like when it lines up with

962
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:50,568
the simulation center properly because

963
00:45:48,768 --> 00:45:52,848
this is roughly what we actually are

964
00:45:50,568 --> 00:45:56,480
trying to compute right here so if I

965
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:59,509
look at what's in the view right now you

966
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,329
can see that if I were to actually track

967
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:04,699
the exact target it looks like that

968
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:08,960
would be potentially enough lighting

969
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:11,588
would it not on the end though so not

970
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,659
quite right it's a little too small for

971
00:46:11,588 --> 00:46:19,159
that zoom level you know what I'm saying

972
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:21,288
to you so it seems like you we do

973
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:24,170
actually need it to be twice the

974
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:25,640
fundamental unit and I don't know if

975
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:29,210
that means we're gonna have to make the

976
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:32,328
fundamental unit be something that's

977
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:39,909
half of that value I'm not sure we'll

978
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:39,910
see in a second let's try this again

979
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:51,349
and so that's a much cleaner

980
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:53,480
encapsulation that gets everything I

981
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:56,480
think that's what I want to use for the

982
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,369
lighting I think I think seeing it

983
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,159
centered around here it's like yeah

984
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:04,279
that's yeah that's probably right you

985
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:06,319
know I'm saying and what we can do if we

986
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,350
need to if that's not resolute enough

987
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:13,580
right so if that's not an acceptable

988
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:16,400
amount for the lighting what we can do

989
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:19,730
is we can go ahead and increase our

990
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,960
voxel resolution by two to X because we

991
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:23,240
know right now it's sixteen by sixteen

992
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,289
by sixteen we know we can go to 32 by 32

993
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:28,699
by 32 no worries so we can play with

994
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:30,110
that value a little bit and and make

995
00:47:28,699 --> 00:47:31,669
sure that that works okay so let's check

996
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:33,500
that and then I'm gonna move forward

997
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:37,700
with this I think I think we're in the

998
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:39,469
ballpark of of where we want to be so

999
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:41,599
I'm not I'm not too worried about that

1000
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:45,139
so I'm gonna switch to test light

1001
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:48,769
checkerboard i'ma turn the lighting back

1002
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:51,980
on and so in compile Z bias program and

1003
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:53,509
get rid of that lighting disabled and

1004
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,599
then we should see the checkerboard

1005
00:47:53,510 --> 00:48:00,170
light and roughly like how big that

1006
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:01,880
checkerboard pattern ends up being will

1007
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:05,119
give us a little bit of an indication of

1008
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,860
how resolute the the actual lighting is

1009
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,289
right and I said I think it's gonna be a

1010
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,940
little bit too sparse right

1011
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:13,250
in fact I'm pretty sure that's too

1012
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,900
sparse so what I want to do there this

1013
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:17,179
gives us pretty much information that we

1014
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,070
needed what I want to do there is kind

1015
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:20,989
of scale things back a little bit push

1016
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:23,360
them around a little bit I'm gonna say

1017
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:26,750
that we're gonna make this be a plus one

1018
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:30,230
and I'm gonna say that we're gonna make

1019
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:32,780
the renderer version instead of sixteen

1020
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:36,230
it is going to be five so it's gonna

1021
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:39,350
look like that and then we can go ahead

1022
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:41,990
and back off of that scalar because now

1023
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:45,289
the hot region could be one it will

1024
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:47,839
actually be one fundamental unit each

1025
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,710
time right so instead of this it will

1026
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,050
now be that

1027
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:53,360
so that just ups the resolution of the

1028
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:55,310
voxel and then I think we're probably

1029
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,780
where we want to be we'll double-check

1030
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:58,679
in a second

1031
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:01,890
but I think that's roughly

1032
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:06,779
okay right so now let's take a look at

1033
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:09,299
how the voxel aligns here's a more sort

1034
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:13,920
of dense packing you can see the stripes

1035
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:15,120
they seem better now why I'm not seeing

1036
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,530
the blue stripe very well I'm not sure

1037
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,980
probably because this is green so

1038
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:22,860
there's not a lot of ability to show any

1039
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:26,900
any of the stripes there but yes I'm not

1040
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:30,289
not sure about why we're not getting oh

1041
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:32,940
no you know what the reason is because

1042
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:39,289
know what the reason is because is that

1043
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:43,079
checker pattern busted hold on a second

1044
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:46,710
everybody just hold your horses

1045
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:51,449
I want to go in and see in test

1046
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:57,769
checkerboard here it is I want to go and

1047
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:57,769
see what the problem is here so

1048
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,969
maybe something like this

1049
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:27,369
so now that's more of a checkerboard and

1050
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:29,199
it's an actual checkerboard pattern so

1051
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:30,849
in fact I like that a lot better because

1052
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,548
I could see it really clearly now

1053
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:35,499
and furthermore you can see that areas

1054
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:38,318
with lines are areas that are outside

1055
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:39,788
the region which I like you can see

1056
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:41,259
right on the boundary it changed from

1057
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:43,150
the checkerboard to just a clamped

1058
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:44,559
pattern and I like that because before

1059
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:46,209
it was kind of hard to see what was

1060
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,459
happening there but now it's not right

1061
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:50,768
so now we can see the relative

1062
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:52,868
resolution of the lighting in here that

1063
00:50:50,768 --> 00:50:54,458
looks pretty good to me I don't think

1064
00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:56,380
we're gonna need more than that because

1065
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:58,838
again the quality of our lighting

1066
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:03,568
transport is not going to be you know

1067
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:06,489
like super resolute this isn't you know

1068
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:08,288
Hardware ray-tracing or something so we

1069
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:10,929
know we're not gonna get any kind of

1070
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:13,690
spectacular levels of light transport

1071
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:16,199
fidelity so we probably don't need our

1072
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:19,659
voxel to be like mr. awesome voxel

1073
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,129
because at some level it's it's not

1074
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,958
gonna have that good of lighting

1075
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:25,088
information to start with we don't need

1076
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:28,149
super great interpolation on a voxel

1077
00:51:25,088 --> 00:51:30,880
that doesn't actually have particularly

1078
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:33,818
good fidelity in the first place looking

1079
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:36,249
at the vertical resolution is a little

1080
00:51:33,818 --> 00:51:43,150
bit hard here so I'm having a hard time

1081
00:51:36,248 --> 00:51:44,468
really telling like what the I'm having

1082
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:48,219
a hard time telling exactly what's going

1083
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:53,229
on there and you can see there's blue

1084
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:54,940
and not blue but it's not it's not very

1085
00:51:53,228 --> 00:52:00,728
clear so I think what I would like to do

1086
00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:02,619
here is maybe Brian alternate some color

1087
00:52:00,728 --> 00:52:06,129
pattern to make it a little easier to

1088
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:09,910
see maybe we'll try to alternate between

1089
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:13,209
like a blue and a you know a green or

1090
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:14,139
something I'm not sure I'm just trying

1091
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:15,818
to see if that would make it a little

1092
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:22,358
bit easier for me to see what was going

1093
00:52:15,818 --> 00:52:26,650
on it probably won't I mean you can sort

1094
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:32,548
of see as you get up to the top of that

1095
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:32,548
blue you know maybe

1096
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:45,150
but then it's really hard to see the

1097
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:45,150
checkerboard pattern right as well

1098
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,500
so if we wanted to make the checkerboard

1099
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:20,269
pattern be in all dimensions can you

1100
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:25,039
just do this not actually sure I've

1101
00:53:20,269 --> 00:53:46,610
never thought about this before but if

1102
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:52,000
we just wanted something like this so we

1103
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:52,000
have like fulbright and then you know

1104
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:55,150
dim

1105
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,590
that did not work well

1106
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,590
trying to think of what the right answer

1107
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,690
is there so normally if you want to a

1108
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:20,550
checkerboard you can have this first one

1109
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:22,139
right so you just say if X I guess you

1110
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:25,350
just want to invert the pattern as you

1111
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:26,789
go up and down you know what I might

1112
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:32,429
also do just so we can get this pattern

1113
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:34,769
properly in the open Jill seriously I

1114
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:37,349
would want to go ahead and when we

1115
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:44,250
initialize that texture I'd want to set

1116
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:48,199
the texture to be nonlinear so I want to

1117
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:57,780
do nearest lookups so like for example

1118
00:54:48,199 --> 00:55:01,409
let's see here a B right right here so

1119
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:03,870
here where we do the color

1120
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:11,009
interpolations I would just set this to

1121
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:12,750
nearest so for the checkerboard I guess

1122
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:14,730
all I want to do is on the z plane

1123
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:20,429
I just want to flip it so I would just

1124
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:22,800
want to do like one wave it sort of an

1125
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:24,690
XOR right so there's the lighting

1126
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,360
checkerboard and that's much easier to

1127
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:29,220
see right that's what I wanted so that's

1128
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:32,430
pretty easy to see and then I would like

1129
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:34,949
it to be that I could also see it this

1130
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:39,389
way right like I'd like to be able to

1131
00:55:34,949 --> 00:55:41,009
see it up and down as well and I suppose

1132
00:55:39,389 --> 00:55:44,670
that part of the problem is this

1133
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:49,260
lighting normal should also kind of be

1134
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:51,539
something that can be sort of placed in

1135
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:54,570
fact I couldn't do this so I want to be

1136
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:57,329
able to look at least at one side of

1137
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:59,820
walls so I can see them get checkerboard

1138
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:03,210
as well so like for example you know you

1139
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:04,350
look at this and so now what I want is I

1140
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:05,970
want to be able to look at that

1141
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:10,110
checkerboard I want to see how many

1142
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:12,329
vertical resolutions I get as well now I

1143
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:14,070
can sort of tell because I know that

1144
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:17,549
this is cubic right I know that we're

1145
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:20,430
not the the the voxel cells our cubes

1146
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:22,230
not right rectangular prisms so I can

1147
00:56:20,429 --> 00:56:23,940
understand the size roughly by saying

1148
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:25,858
well it's it's that big and it going

1149
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:28,048
down but I would like to just see it for

1150
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:33,960
myself so what I want to do here is say

1151
00:56:28,048 --> 00:56:35,639
well okay so we've got X mod 2 and Y mod

1152
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,170
2 another way of saying that is just

1153
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:42,739
this right like if the low bit is set

1154
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:45,740
right oops

1155
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:48,979
finish please

1156
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:52,679
compiles take too long and release mode

1157
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:56,130
so this is another way of saying that so

1158
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:59,730
we should now be able to you know get

1159
00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:04,200
the same result here right and so if I

1160
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:06,719
have X mod 1 not equal to X mod 1 that's

1161
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:08,969
just an exclusive or right in other

1162
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,439
words if I want to say I only want the

1163
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:13,949
thing to be true if these are different

1164
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:18,059
it's just that right that's that's the

1165
00:57:13,949 --> 00:57:20,278
entirety of the of the expression and so

1166
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:23,130
then if I want to make it so that it

1167
00:57:20,278 --> 00:57:25,588
goes the opposite way depending on Z I

1168
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:27,088
should be able to just X or Z in as well

1169
00:57:25,588 --> 00:57:30,509
right like I should be able to say

1170
00:57:27,088 --> 00:57:34,230
whatever Z is well just toggle it based

1171
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:37,769
on that as well right

1172
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:38,670
it should flip it yeah there we go so

1173
00:57:37,768 --> 00:57:40,558
there's our three dimensional

1174
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:42,499
checkerboard and now you can really see

1175
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:45,298
like where all the lighting cells are

1176
00:57:42,498 --> 00:57:47,488
and I guess what I would say is my only

1177
00:57:45,298 --> 00:57:51,449
objection is we probably want this to be

1178
00:57:47,489 --> 00:57:53,429
shifted because if you look well we

1179
00:57:51,449 --> 00:57:55,288
don't need to destroy be shifted we just

1180
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:57,389
when we place our lighting probes and

1181
00:57:55,289 --> 00:58:01,278
our lighting grid we want the probes to

1182
00:57:57,389 --> 00:58:04,288
probably be placed in locations that are

1183
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:06,028
not right on the edge of a grid but I

1184
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:06,480
don't actually know if that even that's

1185
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:07,980
true

1186
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:13,588
we'll have to see but it's something to

1187
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:16,170
be aware of anyway so looking at this

1188
00:58:13,588 --> 00:58:17,880
you can see where the active lighting

1189
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:21,930
region is it nicely encapsulates

1190
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:23,640
everything that could be involved when

1191
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:27,088
we're zoomed in here we should now never

1192
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:28,639
really see the checkerboard stop there

1193
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:33,568
should always be a checkerboard

1194
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:37,379
everywhere we go and I think

1195
00:58:33,568 --> 00:58:39,869
that should be just about it right now

1196
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:43,048
looking at it the way it is now I would

1197
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:46,380
almost say gosh with the lighting region

1198
00:58:43,048 --> 00:58:49,938
that encompassing we may be able to just

1199
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:54,239
not bother with anything else yet anyway

1200
00:58:49,938 --> 00:58:59,098
because that's pretty much just fine

1201
00:58:54,239 --> 00:59:00,898
right like that just works and it's

1202
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:02,579
always if it's always centered around

1203
00:59:00,898 --> 00:59:03,118
the simulation center we're pretty much

1204
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:05,039
good to go

1205
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,539
the only thing we have to do is make

1206
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:10,469
sure we handle the simulation center

1207
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:12,989
possibly having an offset there but

1208
00:59:10,469 --> 00:59:17,579
otherwise this really just doesn't shift

1209
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:19,978
it's pretty much locked to where the

1210
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:22,349
cells are and that's all I really wanted

1211
00:59:19,978 --> 00:59:24,598
to make sure it would do right I wanted

1212
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:27,869
to make sure that wouldn't slide around

1213
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:29,699
relative to that and cause artifacts so

1214
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:32,309
we might be able to just leave this as

1215
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:33,778
it is temporarily and and revisit it

1216
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:35,999
later when we actually have a case that

1217
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:38,818
you know doesn't work or something

1218
00:59:35,998 --> 00:59:41,308
but that seems pretty good in terms of

1219
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:45,538
where the voxels are so it's kind of

1220
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:50,699
where the wild things are right so I

1221
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:54,509
think that's alright if we then move

1222
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:57,269
forward with what we're doing and we go

1223
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:59,759
ahead and set the transfer lighting

1224
00:59:57,268 --> 01:00:02,668
version so in here I'm gonna say a test

1225
00:59:59,759 --> 01:00:04,168
light transfer and you know what I could

1226
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:14,278
do I could just make this easier on

1227
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:18,298
myself so we just toggle which one it is

1228
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:20,548
I so if we actually go ahead and set

1229
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:22,528
back to the transfer version now what I

1230
01:00:20,548 --> 01:00:24,048
want to do is try and figure out a way

1231
01:00:22,528 --> 01:00:26,818
to get our sphere lighting happening

1232
01:00:24,048 --> 01:00:29,188
using the transfer system and I don't

1233
01:00:26,818 --> 01:00:30,329
remember where we left that but you can

1234
01:00:29,188 --> 01:00:31,678
see there's nothing on the screen right

1235
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:33,689
now so our lighting is not really doing

1236
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:35,608
anything so the first thing we need to

1237
01:00:33,688 --> 01:00:38,428
do is now get that version working and

1238
01:00:35,608 --> 01:00:40,708
we know that now our actual voxel values

1239
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:43,858
are not garbage right they're actually

1240
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:46,819
Chrisette to something right so what I

1241
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:50,190
want to do is now have that something

1242
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:52,650
actually create valid light legging

1243
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:55,920
values by going through the large voxel

1244
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:58,889
to the small voxel so here is a loop

1245
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,030
that loops over the voxel dimension

1246
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:02,069
unfortunately if you look at what's

1247
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,930
happening here this is not correct this

1248
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:06,450
is and that's against cuz we have this

1249
01:01:03,929 --> 01:01:09,299
kind of a Vox dim Vox ting is not good

1250
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:12,299
it's ambiguous we want to start talking

1251
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:16,650
about these things more concretely so

1252
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:18,420
what we want to do is take a look at the

1253
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:21,750
Nama clay Chur where we've got hot and

1254
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:27,240
large and and make that be sort of the

1255
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:27,929
the more appropriate nama clay Chur here

1256
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:33,089
right

1257
01:01:27,929 --> 01:01:35,339
so when we set this up we go like this

1258
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:37,200
now we know what the hot and the large

1259
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:41,180
dims are and now we can make sure that

1260
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:44,189
these two loops actually operate on

1261
01:01:41,179 --> 01:01:47,750
values that that are correct for the

1262
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:47,750
thing that was trying to be expressed

1263
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:53,519
and we can set the inverse dimension up

1264
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:57,510
here for the hot version I don't know

1265
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:59,219
that we actually need that later but at

1266
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:03,240
least for our old test code we need it

1267
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:05,189
now in here where we're doing the this

1268
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:07,618
initial setup this is supposed to be

1269
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:08,490
looping over the large voxel you can see

1270
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:11,940
that happening here

1271
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:15,989
so this is a large dim loop that's going

1272
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:19,289
over the 128 by 128 voxel here we're

1273
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:25,379
going over the small interior version so

1274
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:27,150
that's the hot voxel like so and so in

1275
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:30,840
here where we're doing these old tests

1276
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:32,639
this is like the in pot dem so things

1277
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,190
that we're operating in here that that

1278
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:41,549
need to talk about dimensions there they

1279
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:44,730
have to be using hot dim all right so if

1280
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:46,980
we look at this indexing here this is

1281
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:49,260
just saying we're inside these we're

1282
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:52,829
going to be again that's gonna be hot

1283
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:55,470
dimmed all the way as well so let's get

1284
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:56,219
that started and then I just I think

1285
01:02:55,469 --> 01:02:59,219
that might be it

1286
01:02:56,219 --> 01:03:00,449
actually and so then we could start

1287
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:01,949
working on the

1288
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:06,328
the transfer code and getting that

1289
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:08,338
working properly so alright so we I

1290
01:03:06,329 --> 01:03:09,480
think now or have the loops right but

1291
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:11,190
we're gonna have to actually figure out

1292
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,539
how to get the transfer technique so

1293
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:17,309
we're gonna transfer you can see it's

1294
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:19,440
just looking up the displaced version so

1295
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:23,699
that's Z Y and X there the displaced

1296
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:25,349
version of the hot voxel this is us

1297
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:27,629
packing all the values in there

1298
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:29,070
as we would expect to do and then

1299
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:31,230
they're just going to get shoved into

1300
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:33,300
the voxels that the voxels actually used

1301
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:35,909
for lighting at hopefully the correct

1302
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:38,160
location so that's all we really need

1303
01:03:35,909 --> 01:03:40,710
and so the problem is just probably in

1304
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:43,078
here or somewhere we're doing we're not

1305
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:45,690
actually stuffing these values correctly

1306
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:47,579
or you know who knows what but we're

1307
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:48,990
doing something wrong and so we need to

1308
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:51,450
figure out like why we're screwing this

1309
01:03:48,989 --> 01:03:54,689
up here's us looping over the large

1310
01:03:51,449 --> 01:03:57,689
dimension and filling out each of the

1311
01:03:54,690 --> 01:04:00,690
cells you can see us using zyx

1312
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:03,659
which I believe is is the way that the

1313
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:08,429
transfer is working there is it doing a

1314
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:11,159
zyx extraction of the sort of sub region

1315
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:14,009
of the grid it's using n 0 through 3 and

1316
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:16,618
C 0 to 3 so the question is are we

1317
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:19,470
setting those you can see a setting two

1318
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:21,180
of them anyway the the 0 C value the 0 n

1319
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:23,789
value those are the two we're trying to

1320
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:25,858
get happening here looking at what the

1321
01:04:23,789 --> 01:04:27,809
actual values that are coming through

1322
01:04:25,858 --> 01:04:31,920
the question is why aren't we seeing

1323
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:34,858
anything at all I'm not quite sure feels

1324
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:38,269
like we should be and so something's a

1325
01:04:34,858 --> 01:04:41,269
little bit up looking at the fall-off

1326
01:04:38,269 --> 01:04:41,269
here

1327
01:05:01,909 --> 01:05:13,940
so I don't really see anything obviously

1328
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,939
wrong

1329
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:40,710
ah yeah

1330
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:57,450
so I'm not quite sure what's going on

1331
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,449
there

1332
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:09,029
I don't really see anything immediately

1333
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,309
wrong

1334
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:12,309
[Music]

1335
01:06:20,699 --> 01:06:28,578
so I may I may say let's let's take a

1336
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,579
step back

1337
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:35,608
let's first let's just first play with

1338
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:42,659
this a little so suppose I was to nerf

1339
01:06:35,608 --> 01:06:45,529
this stuff temporarily and just use the

1340
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:49,920
checkerboard pattern on the whole voxel

1341
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:55,829
right and so we're gonna set the light

1342
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:57,389
c0 here and that irradiance pack let me

1343
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:59,400
just make sure I understand what a

1344
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:01,379
radiance pack is doing yeah that just

1345
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,450
takes a light though so if we were to

1346
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,130
just say let's put a bright value in

1347
01:07:03,449 --> 01:07:11,250
there so we're gonna say that like our

1348
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:14,309
light C is just going to be nothing in

1349
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:18,650
here we'll say there are light c0 is

1350
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:27,690
gonna be some bright light like you know

1351
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:29,400
5 or 1 which the max light intensity so

1352
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:31,048
6 times the light I don't know what the

1353
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:35,480
max light intensity wants to be here but

1354
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:39,630
you know what who knows I don't know

1355
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:42,539
it's something you can see the

1356
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:45,119
irradiance pack what it actually does it

1357
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:47,608
looks at the max value and then scales

1358
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,108
it by dividing by the max light

1359
01:07:47,608 --> 01:07:50,519
intensity so we can have values pretty

1360
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:52,409
high here right I mean these could be

1361
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:57,298
who knows what they can be quite a bit

1362
01:07:52,409 --> 01:08:05,250
right so who knows what we set this to

1363
01:07:57,298 --> 01:08:07,588
something like this maybe and I just

1364
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:09,960
want to see can I make the checkerboard

1365
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:12,449
like is it why are we getting nothing

1366
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:14,579
right like I don't know why I'm not

1367
01:08:12,449 --> 01:08:16,798
seeing anything at all and so I wanted

1368
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:19,440
to start by saying is the transfer that

1369
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:24,630
copies from the large voxel to the

1370
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:27,000
graphics output routine correct and you

1371
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:30,210
know that looks like it is to a certain

1372
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,988
extent if I go in here and set this to 5

1373
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:32,989
what do I see

1374
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:45,550
so I'm kind of not sure why we're

1375
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,289
getting such a steep fall out there I

1376
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:50,590
think we may have some bugs in our

1377
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:52,180
irradiance code let's take a look at

1378
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:54,369
this so what we're doing here is we're

1379
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:56,440
creating a result value first we look at

1380
01:08:54,369 --> 01:09:00,550
what the highest value of any light

1381
01:08:56,439 --> 01:09:00,939
intensity is assuming there's any it at

1382
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:06,329
all

1383
01:09:00,939 --> 01:09:09,129
we then scale all the light values right

1384
01:09:06,329 --> 01:09:13,300
such that what we're gonna multiply by

1385
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:17,560
is some fraction of the maximum light

1386
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:19,420
intensity value well actually so we

1387
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:22,120
scale the colors so we know that the

1388
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:23,500
brightest color Channel is one and

1389
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:25,689
everything else is a proportion of that

1390
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:28,119
right and that's what this does then we

1391
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:31,029
set the intensity to be whatever this

1392
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:32,920
max value was divided by the max light

1393
01:09:31,029 --> 01:09:36,279
intensity so that's the alpha unpack

1394
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:39,239
right and then we we pack all that crap

1395
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:43,509
together right that's just a BG RI pack

1396
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:47,939
four by eight and I guess it's worth

1397
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:47,940
noting that stuff is not gamma corrected

1398
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:57,659
right so one problem that we will have

1399
01:09:53,859 --> 01:10:01,539
is none of that was gamma corrected so

1400
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:03,220
it's actually not gonna be right when we

1401
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:07,420
unpack it if it was a gamma texture

1402
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:12,460
right if it was an sRGB texture so what

1403
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:15,399
did we actually tell it that it was okay

1404
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:23,380
so it's not it's just straight RGB right

1405
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:25,299
so that seems good to me so that seems

1406
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:26,980
fine let's take a look at our Z bias

1407
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:30,779
program where we actually unpack the

1408
01:10:26,979 --> 01:10:30,779
light and see what we get there

1409
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:43,630
oh right and so our max light intensity

1410
01:10:41,829 --> 01:10:45,430
yeah this is all just kind of wonky now

1411
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:48,670
because since it's actually negative one

1412
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:51,579
to one it means anything less than half

1413
01:10:48,670 --> 01:11:00,220
the max light intensity just wouldn't

1414
01:10:51,579 --> 01:11:08,130
show up right interesting so basically

1415
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:08,130
like yeah we need to fix that as well

1416
01:11:11,369 --> 01:11:20,829
because it's a full by normal and it

1417
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:25,319
should not be so that's probably that

1418
01:11:20,829 --> 01:11:25,319
was probably the entire problem right

1419
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:33,880
now that seems bad where did our voxel

1420
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:36,220
go how come I'm not seeing any oh

1421
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,350
because it's so it does miss a line

1422
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:40,869
itself sometimes there's an example of

1423
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:44,170
it miss aligning itself yeah you like

1424
01:11:40,869 --> 01:11:46,210
it's on half alignment here it's on

1425
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:47,680
whole alignment so we will need to fix

1426
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:50,619
that and that's good we have a test case

1427
01:11:47,680 --> 01:12:00,190
now that is unaligned that is aligned

1428
01:11:50,619 --> 01:12:01,960
right so that's good alright so that was

1429
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:03,849
probably most of our problem it's

1430
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:09,789
probably just that this is not creating

1431
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:11,200
enough of a of a light value and you can

1432
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:13,390
you can actually yeah in fact this was

1433
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:15,130
just garbage so I feel like we're gonna

1434
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:16,990
have to work on our max light intensity

1435
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:18,310
and coding in a second here that's gonna

1436
01:12:16,989 --> 01:12:20,859
have to happen because it's it's pretty

1437
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:22,120
much garbage at the moment and you can

1438
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:25,599
see we have it to do there for it in

1439
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:27,789
fact as well so when we look at what the

1440
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,620
light see is and it's clamping negative

1441
01:12:27,789 --> 01:12:32,949
one to one this is all just complete

1442
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:35,140
garbage and when we actually go to do

1443
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:36,939
that packing of the lighting this is not

1444
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:39,640
going to be correct so we want to do

1445
01:12:36,939 --> 01:12:40,839
instead here probably is we probably

1446
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:44,320
just want to say like all right this is

1447
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:46,960
the fall-off value so the fall-off value

1448
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:50,199
is like going to be something where we

1449
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,109
just do like alert between the maximum

1450
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,809
light intensity

1451
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:55,579
and the minimum light intensity so it's

1452
01:12:53,810 --> 01:13:06,860
like max light intensity

1453
01:12:55,579 --> 01:13:10,010
you know half and whole something like

1454
01:13:06,859 --> 01:13:14,170
that alternatively we can just do it you

1455
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:14,170
know with these two values here so

1456
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:20,619
whatever the zero value basically is

1457
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:26,060
yeah we give you something like that and

1458
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,860
I don't know why we're clients lights

1459
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:29,120
see yeah there's so many weird things in

1460
01:13:27,859 --> 01:13:31,429
this code let's clean this up this is

1461
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:36,260
just ridiculous this is the light

1462
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:38,390
distance right this is what this is the

1463
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:40,280
light like intensity value basically

1464
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:43,640
right like the this is the distance

1465
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:45,920
fall-off right and so here where we do

1466
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:47,390
the the light alpha value again doesn't

1467
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,210
really make any sense the way that we're

1468
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:51,710
doing this exactly because the way that

1469
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:54,439
these get packed down is they're getting

1470
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:56,300
packed down using the max intensity so

1471
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:58,519
again all of this stuff is kind of

1472
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:01,730
busted from where it probably should be

1473
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:03,560
so this is not what that's this this

1474
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:06,319
light alpha is totally wrong the light

1475
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,630
alpha wants to be alert between like say

1476
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:11,509
you know half the max intent light

1477
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:12,829
intensity and you know seven five times

1478
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:14,720
the max light intensity or something

1479
01:14:12,829 --> 01:14:16,939
like that based on the distance fall-off

1480
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:19,340
right that's what would actually give us

1481
01:14:16,939 --> 01:14:22,669
usable values and then the light

1482
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:26,300
actually now does have a correct color

1483
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:29,029
so if we were to look at that now maybe

1484
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,770
we would see a proper spot light and in

1485
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:33,949
fact we do right so it's just a again

1486
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:36,890
that was just the encoding problem so

1487
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:39,590
again looks pretty good let's go ahead

1488
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:42,980
and turn back on our linear and see how

1489
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:46,699
we do on that what I would expect now is

1490
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:49,159
a nice clean version very similar to the

1491
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:53,649
one we had before and now we're set up

1492
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:56,689
more to start doing our transport right

1493
01:14:53,649 --> 01:14:58,429
so if we go ahead and change back I

1494
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:59,750
really need a hotkey for somebody's

1495
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:01,369
things one of these days we have to do a

1496
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:03,560
quality-of-life improvements things so

1497
01:15:01,369 --> 01:15:05,210
we can just toggle these really quickly

1498
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,410
because it's really important to be able

1499
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:08,270
to see these and I have to keep going

1500
01:15:06,409 --> 01:15:09,680
back to the code to change them I don't

1501
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,450
want to have to go into the code to

1502
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,610
change them I would rather just be able

1503
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:15,590
to just quickly hit a key and talk about

1504
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:20,599
training them without having to find any

1505
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:23,180
code so there's our interpolation right

1506
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:24,860
and you can in fact we could even stop

1507
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:27,730
it from hopping up and down if we wanted

1508
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:29,929
to by making it use the ground P now

1509
01:15:27,729 --> 01:15:31,519
which might be nice but anyway you can

1510
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:33,260
kind of see us moving that around there

1511
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:36,650
and that looks pretty nice and again we

1512
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:39,619
get really really good radial again from

1513
01:15:36,649 --> 01:15:41,299
such a small voxel it still reconstructs

1514
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:43,970
the edges perfectly because of the

1515
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:47,180
signed distance field encoding which is

1516
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:49,550
pretty good and then what I want to do

1517
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:52,220
now is say all right let's try to start

1518
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:55,369
extending this by actually doing some

1519
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:57,789
casting in the voxel so what if I wanted

1520
01:15:55,369 --> 01:16:01,909
to say can I see the light source right

1521
01:15:57,789 --> 01:16:04,640
so where's that ray cast here it is so

1522
01:16:01,909 --> 01:16:16,760
if I was to call ray cast and say you

1523
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:19,700
know give me back which what I hit just

1524
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:22,310
literally that right so if I wasn't here

1525
01:16:19,699 --> 01:16:25,159
when we're going to do this light alpha

1526
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:29,530
what if I just called ray cast on it

1527
01:16:25,159 --> 01:16:34,399
just just defer for purely for amusement

1528
01:16:29,529 --> 01:16:37,969
purposes and I guess I don't know what

1529
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:40,179
does the work function do it's just a

1530
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:43,220
way of having the solution here okay so

1531
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:46,310
if I was to say like all right there's a

1532
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:49,369
lighting work thing and I'm gonna just

1533
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:53,950
like initialize that

1534
01:16:49,369 --> 01:16:53,949
what does that having it oops

1535
01:16:54,050 --> 01:17:03,289
so it's just got this so if I just want

1536
01:17:01,579 --> 01:17:06,289
I don't care about any of this stuff so

1537
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:10,609
if I just want that and I and I want to

1538
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:12,529
go ahead and do a cast on that let's try

1539
01:17:10,609 --> 01:17:16,250
and get that working now so we know

1540
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:18,229
where the REA origin is or you know it

1541
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:20,300
depends how we want to look at it but

1542
01:17:18,229 --> 01:17:22,279
what we could say is look the origin is

1543
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:24,560
going to be its we're gonna cast away

1544
01:17:22,279 --> 01:17:26,539
from the voxel center we're gonna cast

1545
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,010
it in the direction of the light and I

1546
01:17:26,539 --> 01:17:30,170
just want to know if we got to the light

1547
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:32,659
or not like that's all I wanted to know

1548
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:36,409
so if I look back at the raycast

1549
01:17:32,659 --> 01:17:44,539
result here right then what I want to

1550
01:17:36,409 --> 01:17:48,769
know is is this is the the value is the

1551
01:17:44,539 --> 01:17:53,510
T value basically that I would receive

1552
01:17:48,770 --> 01:18:02,420
is that going to be closer or further

1553
01:17:53,510 --> 01:18:12,079
away than then is the first thing I hit

1554
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:14,659
further than the then the light that I

1555
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:18,500
was trying to hit or not right and I

1556
01:18:14,659 --> 01:18:21,590
don't know what kit is here is that like

1557
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:24,319
just a boolean value or is that actually

1558
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:27,710
like I don't know I have to go look at

1559
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:32,319
what we set that to so let's see when

1560
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:32,319
we're actually tracking hits in here

1561
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:45,340
so it looks to me like it is just a test

1562
01:18:40,899 --> 01:18:47,529
on t array and I'll be honest I'm not

1563
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:57,369
sure why we don't just return the tier a

1564
01:18:47,529 --> 01:19:12,939
value but seems like we should just

1565
01:18:57,369 --> 01:19:16,239
return the minty ray value here but hard

1566
01:19:12,939 --> 01:19:18,309
to say so when we do the raycast here we

1567
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:21,429
need the origin and the Ray distance

1568
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:22,900
right and in this case I'm just trying

1569
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:25,690
to a single ray cast I'm not trying to

1570
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:28,719
do this actually quickly so what I want

1571
01:19:25,689 --> 01:19:31,359
to do is I want to sort of generate one

1572
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:33,940
of these by lofting up one into just a

1573
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:35,949
four wide version of itself which I'm

1574
01:19:33,939 --> 01:19:38,319
assuming we have a way of doing I don't

1575
01:19:35,949 --> 01:19:40,420
actually know but we would in theory

1576
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:42,880
have right I'm assuming we can do

1577
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:49,630
something like this so I can say like

1578
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:51,640
box Center P 4 right and light in 4 and

1579
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:54,609
that just does the same ray cast four

1580
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:56,980
times because hey it's the same cost as

1581
01:19:54,609 --> 01:19:58,630
doing it once so who cares

1582
01:19:56,979 --> 01:20:03,969
but like normally we would want to pack

1583
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:04,960
multiple things in here right and so

1584
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:06,640
let's see if we can just get that

1585
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,529
working and then we'll kind of end there

1586
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:11,500
for the day and then next weekend we can

1587
01:20:08,529 --> 01:20:14,349
start to work on the actual light

1588
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:18,430
transport code so here we have the cast

1589
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:22,150
value the cast value gets back like I

1590
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:25,360
said it's got this sort of hit and P

1591
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:27,759
values I just want to look at one of

1592
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:32,469
these so looking at the actual structure

1593
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:38,110
for this thing I kind of want to extract

1594
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:40,119
a single v3 from it and I'm not sure

1595
01:20:38,109 --> 01:20:43,359
what the easiest whoops that was not

1596
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:45,729
what I wanted I'm not sure what the

1597
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:46,989
easiest way to do that is because I

1598
01:20:45,729 --> 01:20:50,468
don't remember how we set this up

1599
01:20:46,989 --> 01:20:54,448
exactly so I don't know what we use for

1600
01:20:50,469 --> 01:20:56,769
action here here it is

1601
01:20:54,448 --> 01:20:58,689
so assuming I just want one of these

1602
01:20:56,769 --> 01:21:01,809
things I can just say look watch you

1603
01:20:58,689 --> 01:21:02,710
give me back the zeroth answer that's

1604
01:21:01,809 --> 01:21:04,960
fine with me

1605
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:09,639
so I'm gonna say like here's where the

1606
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:12,279
the hit P was right and I can also ask

1607
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:14,739
if there actually was a hit there right

1608
01:21:12,279 --> 01:21:17,288
I should be able to use a mask version

1609
01:21:14,738 --> 01:21:18,609
and in fact I guess I can just look at

1610
01:21:17,288 --> 01:21:20,738
where we were calling this before and

1611
01:21:18,609 --> 01:21:22,509
presumably like the extraction stuff was

1612
01:21:20,738 --> 01:21:24,698
there and I know I look at there first

1613
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:27,610
but inside compute light propagation

1614
01:21:24,698 --> 01:21:33,488
right we set up this light work stuff

1615
01:21:27,609 --> 01:21:35,288
and then here you can see us doing doing

1616
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:40,089
the tests so it looks like I can just

1617
01:21:35,288 --> 01:21:42,759
literally do this so all I want to do is

1618
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:45,519
say if we hit something then I want to

1619
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:48,429
test to see how far away it actually was

1620
01:21:45,519 --> 01:21:50,349
right and again that's why I would have

1621
01:21:48,429 --> 01:21:52,538
wanted that tear a value because I would

1622
01:21:50,349 --> 01:21:55,989
I wanted to be able to look and see is

1623
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:58,719
it longer than light dist but it's okay

1624
01:21:55,988 --> 01:22:00,669
I don't really need to know one way or

1625
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:03,760
the other I guess so

1626
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:09,550
that Caspi value that we get out here I

1627
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:12,579
can just can compare that with the with

1628
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:18,090
the actual light position so what I can

1629
01:22:12,578 --> 01:22:18,090
do is say here if the inner product I

1630
01:22:21,809 --> 01:22:27,460
could say if the inner product of the

1631
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:29,948
thing I hit - the place I'm casting from

1632
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:33,239
so that's the Vox Enter key right if the

1633
01:22:29,948 --> 01:22:38,198
if the inner product of that along the

1634
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:41,558
direction I was casting I is less than

1635
01:22:38,198 --> 01:22:43,629
the distance to the actual light so in

1636
01:22:41,559 --> 01:22:48,340
this case I've got the light P - the Vox

1637
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:50,559
Center P right and I already did that

1638
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:54,819
effectively because I took the length of

1639
01:22:50,559 --> 01:22:57,880
that of that - acute like isn't it so

1640
01:22:54,819 --> 01:22:59,738
it's that so if I hit something closer

1641
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:03,550
than the light source then I would just

1642
01:22:59,738 --> 01:23:04,239
say let's set the light C zero to its

1643
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:07,060
minimum

1644
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:10,960
and I can do that a little bit easier by

1645
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:13,120
moving this stuff down below so where we

1646
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:17,560
go here I can I can do that right and

1647
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:20,739
this light D F value which we've

1648
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:22,420
computed ranging from sort of a clamped

1649
01:23:20,739 --> 01:23:23,529
version I should oh I should clamp this

1650
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:25,090
shouldn't I

1651
01:23:23,529 --> 01:23:28,559
this is that should have been a clamp

1652
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:28,560
zero to one I lost my clamp in there

1653
01:23:29,189 --> 01:23:34,059
right in here what I'll do is I'll amok

1654
01:23:32,649 --> 01:23:35,319
with that value but first I want to make

1655
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:36,610
sure that my clamp doesn't screw me up

1656
01:23:35,319 --> 01:23:38,619
there needed to be a clamp in there and

1657
01:23:36,609 --> 01:23:47,289
there wasn't so let's make sure that

1658
01:23:38,619 --> 01:23:49,809
works also this is just cast and 0su

1659
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:51,909
then we will just see and our rigged

1660
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:53,380
casting code may have been worked

1661
01:23:51,909 --> 01:23:55,149
because again we were mucking with it

1662
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,800
and haven't tested it since then so I

1663
01:23:55,149 --> 01:23:58,029
don't necessarily SPECT this to work but

1664
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,789
I just wanted to get this in there and

1665
01:23:58,029 --> 01:24:01,840
then that sets us up for a next weekend

1666
01:24:00,789 --> 01:24:03,779
where we can start playing with the

1667
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:05,770
right caster and getting that solid

1668
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:07,329
alright so in here

1669
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:10,600
what I do is say all right let's just

1670
01:24:07,329 --> 01:24:13,600
set the light DF down to some negative

1671
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:16,510
values so this is you know gonna be

1672
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:20,590
where it felt the the field falls off

1673
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:23,230
steeply at this point so you know deal

1674
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:24,610
with it and and we'll just go from there

1675
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:26,500
now I don't necessarily accept I don't

1676
01:24:24,609 --> 01:24:28,659
expect this necessarily work so we're

1677
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:31,170
not who knows what this will do probably

1678
01:24:28,659 --> 01:24:31,170
nothing

1679
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:43,820
looks like well that's kind of weird I

1680
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:48,530
don't know what that exactly it looks

1681
01:24:43,819 --> 01:24:51,139
like he looks like the Ray caster is

1682
01:24:48,529 --> 01:24:55,210
returning hits for things out here but

1683
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:55,210
not for any here or something

1684
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:08,149
not quite sure what that's doing but

1685
01:25:06,329 --> 01:25:14,100
it's doing something around the edges

1686
01:25:08,149 --> 01:25:15,689
for some reason I'm not sure and again

1687
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:22,410
like we haven't really looked at this

1688
01:25:15,689 --> 01:25:25,879
function in a while and it's probably a

1689
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:36,420
little bit busty it's just a busted

1690
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:37,739
busted busted function um not sure I

1691
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,850
want to dive in here cuz probably add a

1692
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:40,079
bunch of things to do but I just want to

1693
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:41,610
look and see if there's anything I was

1694
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:46,760
like doing it was where I was

1695
01:25:41,609 --> 01:25:46,759
misinterpreting what it's actually doing

1696
01:25:53,929 --> 01:26:01,550
that's seems reasonable

1697
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:18,759
I don't see anything completely

1698
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:24,869
ridiculous here it looks like I already

1699
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:24,869
had that comment in here

1700
01:26:41,099 --> 01:26:43,849
hmm

1701
01:26:56,670 --> 01:27:00,029
say I don't know

1702
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:07,789
I don't know what's going on there

1703
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:24,239
is cast pset what does calf pset from

1704
01:27:21,979 --> 01:27:25,979
because I also don't really know how

1705
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:29,119
we're setting that what that actually

1706
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:37,199
means like where is that getting set and

1707
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:39,269
why so result P equals hit P and so

1708
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:41,039
that's just yeah so that's just tear a

1709
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:42,630
times there rave distance so that is

1710
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:47,550
literally just yet

1711
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:51,460
taking tear a and moving it so this

1712
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:54,569
should be roughly correct I think

1713
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:54,569
[Music]

1714
01:28:05,099 --> 01:28:14,110
and we are only going on things that are

1715
01:28:09,788 --> 01:28:17,329
valid like greater than valid values

1716
01:28:14,109 --> 01:28:17,329
[Music]

1717
01:28:26,659 --> 01:28:32,599
the close enough thing might also be a

1718
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:35,420
problem for us here because that is the

1719
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:39,110
thing that I think lets us say that the

1720
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:42,920
box is kind of like like if I were to

1721
01:28:39,109 --> 01:28:44,779
turn that off right so when we do t

1722
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:46,579
close enough and we're checking to see

1723
01:28:44,779 --> 01:28:48,889
whether we can use a larger bound like a

1724
01:28:46,579 --> 01:28:49,519
thing that doesn't actually continue to

1725
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:52,490
raycast

1726
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:55,040
I'm curious if we were to look at that

1727
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:57,229
is that causing a problem here

1728
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:59,029
I don't think so cuz 10 meters is is

1729
01:28:57,229 --> 01:29:00,829
further than I think where we were

1730
01:28:59,029 --> 01:29:03,649
seeing that the weird sort of artifact

1731
01:29:00,829 --> 01:29:08,090
around the ring but in terms of saying

1732
01:29:03,649 --> 01:29:10,250
like is it less than close enough so in

1733
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:15,529
there I wonder if I just said like look

1734
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:17,300
that's gonna be a lot higher I'm

1735
01:29:15,529 --> 01:29:20,269
assuming that doesn't really help us

1736
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:22,699
right fix the weird like I just have no

1737
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:24,830
idea what's producing that result so I'm

1738
01:29:22,699 --> 01:29:26,539
kind of curious to be completely honest

1739
01:29:24,829 --> 01:29:35,149
yeah and it's not it has nothing to do

1740
01:29:26,539 --> 01:29:36,829
with that it looks like so so hmm I want

1741
01:29:35,149 --> 01:29:38,809
to end the stream but I just I hate I

1742
01:29:36,829 --> 01:29:40,699
always my curiosity gets the better of

1743
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:43,400
me I want to know what that artifact is

1744
01:29:40,699 --> 01:29:46,279
and it's hard for me to not know I'm

1745
01:29:43,399 --> 01:29:50,629
assuming that this is the entirety of it

1746
01:29:46,279 --> 01:29:56,319
meaning if I remove that I would get my

1747
01:29:50,630 --> 01:30:00,140
perfect circle back oh no no I don't

1748
01:29:56,319 --> 01:30:03,909
okay so it was something else

1749
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:03,910
what was the something else

1750
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:30,500
right this has to go below zero and zero

1751
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:35,630
is half the light intensity so that was

1752
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:37,880
all yeah okay so at least now we know

1753
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:40,400
that the raycasting code is not actually

1754
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:44,390
producing that artifact that was gonna

1755
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:46,279
drive me nuts so very good and so what

1756
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:50,420
it looks like here is if we were to set

1757
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:52,159
the light DF to zero in that what it

1758
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:53,239
really looks like is going on the only

1759
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:55,189
thing that looks like it's happening is

1760
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:57,939
the raycasting code is never hitting

1761
01:30:55,189 --> 01:31:02,960
anything right I mean that seems like

1762
01:30:57,939 --> 01:31:05,649
roughly what we're seeing and to be fair

1763
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:12,710
I guess I don't really know how high up

1764
01:31:05,649 --> 01:31:14,809
the how high up that light is but you

1765
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:15,980
know like Nuria regardless of how high

1766
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:18,980
up it is I think it probably should have

1767
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:20,719
been hitting something and so I think

1768
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:23,239
that codes just not hitting anything

1769
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:25,159
would be my guess I don't know if we're

1770
01:31:23,239 --> 01:31:29,239
maybe we nerfed the call that builds the

1771
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:31,639
bounds that might also do it but I guess

1772
01:31:29,239 --> 01:31:33,639
I could also look to see so if we're

1773
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:35,960
like here are we kidding

1774
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:39,110
are we prevented from hitting stuff

1775
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:41,420
below we're not I mean we're totally

1776
01:31:39,109 --> 01:31:43,460
hitting it so let me just double check

1777
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:44,750
that we're calling it because like I

1778
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:46,489
said my curiosity always gets the better

1779
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:49,039
of me I'm supposed to be ending stream

1780
01:31:46,489 --> 01:31:52,399
but sometimes I just don't and that's

1781
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:57,050
just the way it goes so in here where we

1782
01:31:52,399 --> 01:32:01,069
do compute like propagation we we don't

1783
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:02,750
set anything up there I don't think so

1784
01:32:01,069 --> 01:32:08,509
so I think the only thing that we would

1785
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:11,359
have to do is when we actually call the

1786
01:32:08,510 --> 01:32:13,750
start of this stuff we have to build the

1787
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,750
actual

1788
01:32:19,989 --> 01:32:24,939
the actual space footage but that's it

1789
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:27,260
so build spatial prediction for lighting

1790
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:32,719
that's the thing that acts just a okay

1791
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:36,380
so we need to actually build the spatial

1792
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:37,400
partition that maybe 90% of it but we

1793
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:38,109
still don't know if that code is working

1794
01:32:37,399 --> 01:32:40,789
properly

1795
01:32:38,109 --> 01:32:44,389
but anyway so now the spatial partition

1796
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:47,390
is actually fair right it doesn't seem

1797
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:48,980
to be doing a very good job because I'm

1798
01:32:47,390 --> 01:33:00,020
not sure what it thinks it's hitting

1799
01:32:48,979 --> 01:33:02,539
there right that is freaky okay so at

1800
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:07,250
least now we're getting actual like an

1801
01:33:02,539 --> 01:33:10,279
answer from this thing about the raycast

1802
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:13,520
and so that's a that's a much bigger

1803
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:15,349
improvement that's what I wanted to see

1804
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:18,920
something like that cuz that's like okay

1805
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:21,320
the raycast is broken and that's what we

1806
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:25,399
should be seeing right not what we were

1807
01:33:21,319 --> 01:33:27,529
seeing before which is kind of like so

1808
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:29,899
I'm gonna I'm gonna play around a little

1809
01:33:27,529 --> 01:33:31,489
more sorry it's just like I like where

1810
01:33:29,899 --> 01:33:33,170
I'm at and that's just way it goes

1811
01:33:31,489 --> 01:33:37,909
sometimes so you know you gotta live

1812
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:41,449
with it it's it's my stream it's really

1813
01:33:37,909 --> 01:33:45,409
all you need to know um so anyway when

1814
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:47,689
we come through here and we build this

1815
01:33:45,409 --> 01:33:51,309
base positioning then we're gonna do the

1816
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:53,929
Ray casting what I want to do is say I

1817
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:55,910
don't want to have to rely on those

1818
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:57,560
p-values I just want to use the T value

1819
01:33:55,909 --> 01:33:59,479
here and since we already I had to do

1820
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:01,760
for that anyway

1821
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:04,759
what I want to do is is let the people

1822
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:07,550
on the outside do the hit P detection of

1823
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:09,320
Rea origin plus T ray because if you

1824
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:11,150
look at that it has to actually do the

1825
01:34:09,319 --> 01:34:13,039
computation so there's no point in us

1826
01:34:11,149 --> 01:34:16,129
doing that computation that's just dumb

1827
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:18,829
but we don't need that ever so if we

1828
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:22,970
moved that out to where the raycast

1829
01:34:18,829 --> 01:34:25,789
actually happens so inside our compute

1830
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:28,940
light propagation call which we're not

1831
01:34:25,789 --> 01:34:31,210
using right now but just to keep it so

1832
01:34:28,939 --> 01:34:34,960
that it is like roughly correct

1833
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:37,719
it turns a sketch of code in terms of

1834
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:41,198
using the positional value where we do

1835
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:45,609
like ray dot P or whatever that's going

1836
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:51,069
to be this so that value is going to be

1837
01:34:45,609 --> 01:34:55,960
Ray origin ray Direction times the TT

1838
01:34:51,069 --> 01:34:59,799
the ray doc T value so like T hit or

1839
01:34:55,960 --> 01:35:02,408
something I don't know

1840
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,460
so whatever the T or guess T ray is what

1841
01:35:02,408 --> 01:35:06,429
it was called

1842
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:09,010
I'm gonna call it t here so in here what

1843
01:35:06,429 --> 01:35:12,460
we want to do is record that value and

1844
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:16,659
so instead of using the p value here

1845
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:20,350
we want to actually use the the tear a

1846
01:35:16,658 --> 01:35:26,969
value instead so this is actually that

1847
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:26,969
and bat so that we've got hit and T hit

1848
01:35:30,029 --> 01:35:34,179
who knows

1849
01:35:31,649 --> 01:35:36,279
and then we never compute that thing in

1850
01:35:34,179 --> 01:35:37,270
here so we just return the T value and

1851
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:39,219
if you wanted to know where the position

1852
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:40,600
is well you can do the add because you

1853
01:35:39,219 --> 01:35:44,679
can do the add this is like we do the

1854
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:45,670
add there's no not harder and so we

1855
01:35:44,679 --> 01:35:49,270
might as well give you the maximum

1856
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:52,750
amount of information there and it's

1857
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:54,820
also smaller right so we we have less we

1858
01:35:52,750 --> 01:36:01,840
have to actually return which seems like

1859
01:35:54,819 --> 01:36:04,840
a plus and then plus we also have the

1860
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:06,610
you know additional the ability to do

1861
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:10,420
like fancy footwork like I just did

1862
01:36:06,609 --> 01:36:11,829
where I or or like I want to do here

1863
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:14,739
where I don't have to actually use the

1864
01:36:11,829 --> 01:36:17,760
computation anymore right

1865
01:36:14,738 --> 01:36:17,759
so yeah

1866
01:36:20,069 --> 01:36:28,649
oh crap alright outsmarted myself so the

1867
01:36:26,369 --> 01:36:32,239
reason we were doing the hit p is

1868
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:35,239
because we had to compute it for this I

1869
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:35,239
guess

1870
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:56,190
so this is because we need to compute

1871
01:36:51,210 --> 01:37:00,300
the normal I guess of the surface for

1872
01:36:56,189 --> 01:37:03,829
transports which is kind of a pain in

1873
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:03,829
the butt right

1874
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:32,480
yeah so it looks like it's really the

1875
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:33,920
hit value that needs to change and we do

1876
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:37,549
want to keep doing the P because we had

1877
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:47,420
to do it I wish we didn't if I'm honest

1878
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:53,539
about it I don't love it oh that's a hit

1879
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:58,699
P sorry so okay and then we just we'd

1880
01:37:53,539 --> 01:38:02,529
get rid of that and you you can compute

1881
01:37:58,699 --> 01:38:02,529
that on the outside right

1882
01:38:20,529 --> 01:38:30,609
yeah so if you look in here then this

1883
01:38:24,039 --> 01:38:32,409
would be where we compute t hit and then

1884
01:38:30,609 --> 01:38:35,849
anyone who is using that it has to do it

1885
01:38:32,409 --> 01:38:35,849
this way but that's the only difference

1886
01:38:46,569 --> 01:38:50,779
okay and then here we don't have to do

1887
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:52,760
this anymore

1888
01:38:50,779 --> 01:38:57,019
all of this stuff can go away and it's

1889
01:38:52,760 --> 01:39:01,250
just one comparison so only have to do

1890
01:38:57,020 --> 01:39:03,350
is say if the caste tier a dot what was

1891
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:06,859
that thing that you value or whatever

1892
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:10,430
it's called you thirty-two

1893
01:39:06,859 --> 01:39:18,769
if the tier eight or what sexually nasty

1894
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:20,300
tube I guess yeah thirty-two so it's a

1895
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:21,830
floating-point version or is probably an

1896
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:23,989
e you know I think about it but if the

1897
01:39:21,829 --> 01:39:25,909
floating-point version of what we hit

1898
01:39:23,989 --> 01:39:27,289
the distance a way that it was is less

1899
01:39:25,909 --> 01:39:29,090
than the light distance then that means

1900
01:39:27,289 --> 01:39:30,470
we hit something before we hit the light

1901
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:40,010
and that was all I really wanted to

1902
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:42,079
check right so and then we just have a I

1903
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:43,699
think everything now is is the way it

1904
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:45,859
should be and then now we have a problem

1905
01:39:43,699 --> 01:39:49,579
of going back and actually implementing

1906
01:39:45,859 --> 01:39:52,489
our ray cast right so something is buggy

1907
01:39:49,579 --> 01:39:57,050
in the actual ray cast like this is not

1908
01:39:52,489 --> 01:39:59,479
correct you know obviously and so when

1909
01:39:57,050 --> 01:40:01,699
we're actually like for some reason that

1910
01:39:59,479 --> 01:40:04,699
light source thinks there's something in

1911
01:40:01,699 --> 01:40:07,609
the way trying to get to the voxel

1912
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:09,859
centers but those voxel centers don't

1913
01:40:07,609 --> 01:40:16,009
even remotely look like there's anything

1914
01:40:09,859 --> 01:40:18,380
in the way to me and furthermore I'm not

1915
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:21,829
sure like yeah like it's like there's

1916
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:24,770
something like right here it's blocking

1917
01:40:21,829 --> 01:40:27,140
it but there isn't anything right so

1918
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:30,740
there's something busted about that ray

1919
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:35,570
cast function and who knows what it is I

1920
01:40:30,739 --> 01:40:36,829
have no idea so if we look I don't know

1921
01:40:35,569 --> 01:40:41,210
that I want to dive into this because it

1922
01:40:36,829 --> 01:40:43,489
probably need to draw it but what I

1923
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:48,649
could do I think we still have a debug

1924
01:40:43,489 --> 01:40:51,949
line capability built in here which may

1925
01:40:48,649 --> 01:40:55,960
help so if I turned off the lighting

1926
01:40:51,949 --> 01:40:57,550
temporarily and just looked at the

1927
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:00,020
raycast

1928
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:01,670
we should be able to push a debug line

1929
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:04,970
that shows where the raycast

1930
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:10,880
actually happened so for example this

1931
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:14,869
push debug line here this could give us

1932
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:19,699
that value if I said cast from the voxel

1933
01:41:14,869 --> 01:41:24,199
center P out to Vox Center P plus or

1934
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:30,590
well actually just get component cast up

1935
01:41:24,199 --> 01:41:32,000
P Zero and we draw like a I don't know

1936
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:36,560
that we're going to draw we draw a

1937
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:39,260
yellow line right then we should now be

1938
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:42,710
able to see yellow lines going to the

1939
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:43,940
light source from the cast locations and

1940
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:46,630
I should turn the lighting off so we

1941
01:41:43,939 --> 01:41:55,219
don't have lighting in the way of that

1942
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:57,800
but no why I don't see any lights here

1943
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:59,900
or in a debug lines where's the debug

1944
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:00,350
line drawing code is that still

1945
01:41:59,899 --> 01:42:04,000
happening

1946
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:07,670
I guess that's like something to to ask

1947
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:10,789
oh yes so this is in the wrong place

1948
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:15,920
right we need to make this output the

1949
01:42:10,789 --> 01:42:21,769
lines after we generate them so this

1950
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:24,829
just draws the debug lines there we go

1951
01:42:21,770 --> 01:42:28,090
and now we should be able to get them to

1952
01:42:24,829 --> 01:42:28,090
show up although I still don't see them

1953
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:45,529
what's interesting is it like almost

1954
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:49,420
works like you can see it can't seem to

1955
01:42:45,529 --> 01:42:52,099
really get past that outside area and

1956
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:53,960
like right there you can see it sort of

1957
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:56,510
is preventing me from seeing down the

1958
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:59,210
hallway right so it's like only right

1959
01:42:56,510 --> 01:43:02,239
it's like there's these weird like bugs

1960
01:42:59,210 --> 01:43:04,159
where it's introducing so we definitely

1961
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:05,899
just have some kind of weird like sim

1962
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:08,720
debug in the raycast but it's almost

1963
01:43:05,899 --> 01:43:12,889
correct it's it's like Edward James

1964
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:14,810
almost correct and I'm just not sure

1965
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:16,820
what's going on there I would like to

1966
01:43:14,810 --> 01:43:20,380
see those lines and so I want to know

1967
01:43:16,819 --> 01:43:20,380
why I'm not seeing debug lines anymore

1968
01:43:21,069 --> 01:43:28,639
here's us trying to push that on going

1969
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:34,630
through the debug linecount do we have

1970
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:34,630
to enable that compute light propagation

1971
01:43:44,199 --> 01:43:50,439
so solution update debug lines is never

1972
01:43:47,779 --> 01:43:50,439
such anything

1973
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:57,448
which seems bad

1974
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:14,329
I'm not sure how that's supposed to work

1975
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:34,949
I guess I'll just said it

1976
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:57,010
so we're getting a assertion there so

1977
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:59,020
that's like it's in release mode so it's

1978
01:44:57,010 --> 01:45:02,260
not showing us but you can see the

1979
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:04,690
reason for that is this array count is

1980
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:09,270
blown out here so if we look at how many

1981
01:45:04,689 --> 01:45:12,219
debug lines it supports you can see it's

1982
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:15,640
4096 I'm imagining that the reason for

1983
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:18,789
that is unsurprisingly there's two

1984
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:21,520
million of them right and for those of

1985
01:45:18,789 --> 01:45:25,930
you just joining us two million lines is

1986
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:27,040
actually more than 4096 lines so that's

1987
01:45:25,930 --> 01:45:29,350
a little bit of an issue

1988
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:31,029
what I'm going to do is restrict the

1989
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:33,370
casting instead of doing it over the

1990
01:45:31,029 --> 01:45:38,889
whole cube I'm gonna do it only in the

1991
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:40,569
hot region so when we do a compute light

1992
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:42,820
propagation or whatever else not it's

1993
01:45:40,569 --> 01:45:46,149
actually just insert sort of the light

1994
01:45:42,819 --> 01:45:47,619
computation and light computation what

1995
01:45:46,149 --> 01:45:50,409
I'm going to do there for our test in

1996
01:45:47,619 --> 01:45:55,750
here I'm gonna say let's go ahead and

1997
01:45:50,409 --> 01:45:57,909
actually only do it in the region that

1998
01:45:55,750 --> 01:46:01,779
we're actually gonna copy so if we look

1999
01:45:57,909 --> 01:46:04,510
at the solution hot corner I dot Z and

2000
01:46:01,779 --> 01:46:07,149
then we go from there to hot corner Z

2001
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:10,060
plus hot damn right

2002
01:46:07,149 --> 01:46:12,460
this will only loop over the values that

2003
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:15,250
we actually plan to use and that'll just

2004
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:20,230
make it so we're only casting on a 32 by

2005
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:25,420
32 by 32 which we can probably draw the

2006
01:46:20,229 --> 01:46:28,389
lines for well actually you know what I

2007
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:35,319
could do we could do an even smaller

2008
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:41,500
subset so maybe what I'll do is yeah

2009
01:46:35,319 --> 01:46:46,119
yeah yeah maybe what I'll do is I'll

2010
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:47,109
only draw the line in a small subset of

2011
01:46:46,119 --> 01:46:52,059
them because gonna be too many lines

2012
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:55,179
anyway so maybe we'll do it like if X is

2013
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:58,749
greater than or equal to solution hot

2014
01:46:55,180 --> 01:47:01,360
corner I'd X and

2015
01:46:58,748 --> 01:47:06,550
why's less are greater than Eclipse

2016
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:11,279
solution hot corner I'd why and the like

2017
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:13,889
so right and then we also say like and

2018
01:47:11,279 --> 01:47:19,988
[Music]

2019
01:47:13,889 --> 01:47:23,889
the same thing again right so let's take

2020
01:47:19,988 --> 01:47:27,939
a look at something more like this where

2021
01:47:23,889 --> 01:47:30,670
we're gonna say I probably should have

2022
01:47:27,939 --> 01:47:40,478
done this as part of the cut and paste

2023
01:47:30,670 --> 01:47:44,498
but I didn't which was thumb so let's

2024
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:47,619
say greater than equal to some kind of

2025
01:47:44,498 --> 01:47:53,109
an A Center like a more centered kernel

2026
01:47:47,618 --> 01:47:57,848
so the the hot dim over to write this

2027
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:59,828
would be sort of the center area and

2028
01:47:57,849 --> 01:48:05,380
then what I want to do is say let's go

2029
01:47:59,828 --> 01:48:07,299
like eight in either direction so it's

2030
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:10,389
like a so it's like the we're gonna do a

2031
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:11,829
sixteen by sixteen by sixteen kind of in

2032
01:48:10,389 --> 01:48:16,538
the center oh that's the baby kept me a

2033
01:48:11,828 --> 01:48:20,558
little close let's do eight by eight by

2034
01:48:16,538 --> 01:48:22,328
eight right so just in the middle I'll

2035
01:48:20,559 --> 01:48:24,190
see if I can get some debug lines just

2036
01:48:22,328 --> 01:48:26,368
in that like middle region so I can see

2037
01:48:24,189 --> 01:48:29,138
what's happening with the raycast there

2038
01:48:26,368 --> 01:48:32,828
so there it is right there's our ray

2039
01:48:29,139 --> 01:48:39,069
cast and you can see it ray casting out

2040
01:48:32,828 --> 01:48:41,408
to the voxel in from from this is the

2041
01:48:39,069 --> 01:48:44,710
debug light that's like hovering over

2042
01:48:41,408 --> 01:48:46,328
the the hero's head there right and what

2043
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:48,569
I want to do now is I want to like see

2044
01:48:46,328 --> 01:48:51,849
what does it actually think it's hitting

2045
01:48:48,569 --> 01:48:56,288
in in these cases where it thinks it's

2046
01:48:51,849 --> 01:48:58,599
hitting something right so let's filter

2047
01:48:56,288 --> 01:49:00,728
the lines out by only things that we

2048
01:48:58,599 --> 01:49:02,828
think that that that actually think they

2049
01:49:00,729 --> 01:49:05,229
hit right that actually think that the

2050
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:10,808
distance that the Ray was able to travel

2051
01:49:05,229 --> 01:49:12,369
is like less than the distance that the

2052
01:49:10,809 --> 01:49:15,248
light is from

2053
01:49:12,368 --> 01:49:17,648
the voxel center of casting so I'm gonna

2054
01:49:15,248 --> 01:49:20,318
go in here and say just show me like

2055
01:49:17,649 --> 01:49:23,199
only show me rays that we actually think

2056
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:25,149
hit something so that I can see why you

2057
01:49:23,198 --> 01:49:26,978
seem to think that it's hitting things

2058
01:49:25,149 --> 01:49:36,209
in places where I don't see anything

2059
01:49:26,979 --> 01:49:36,208
right okay so taking a look at that I

2060
01:49:39,389 --> 01:49:44,559
guess so so it's really confusing I

2061
01:49:42,189 --> 01:49:48,429
don't understand what I'm seeing because

2062
01:49:44,559 --> 01:49:55,628
if you look the lighting that says it's

2063
01:49:48,429 --> 01:49:57,939
hitting something is like over here all

2064
01:49:55,628 --> 01:50:00,309
of these think they hit something which

2065
01:49:57,939 --> 01:50:07,649
is correct because they all hit the

2066
01:50:00,309 --> 01:50:12,128
floor right but like why am I getting a

2067
01:50:07,649 --> 01:50:16,239
oh is it because of stuff that's just

2068
01:50:12,128 --> 01:50:18,248
under the floor I wondered if all we're

2069
01:50:16,238 --> 01:50:21,308
seeing is just because it's just under

2070
01:50:18,248 --> 01:50:23,519
the floor a little bit you think that's

2071
01:50:21,309 --> 01:50:23,519
possible

2072
01:50:31,368 --> 01:50:37,969
I mean it could be let's draw the let's

2073
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:40,460
draw it the other way so let's draw it

2074
01:50:37,969 --> 01:50:45,770
from the light source to the cast

2075
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:49,279
location so we can see if that's the

2076
01:50:45,770 --> 01:50:53,599
case right so let's draw it this way

2077
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:55,609
instead which is not really correct it's

2078
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:57,369
not showing you the Ray that was

2079
01:50:55,609 --> 01:51:00,469
actually cast but I just want to see

2080
01:50:57,368 --> 01:51:04,279
it's a more interesting connector line

2081
01:51:00,469 --> 01:51:07,219
for me so if we look and we go here's

2082
01:51:04,279 --> 01:51:12,800
the light source here's the places that

2083
01:51:07,219 --> 01:51:14,389
it hit right and I'm wondering if there

2084
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:16,369
just look right there I guess even that

2085
01:51:14,389 --> 01:51:22,279
doesn't really tell me kind of what I

2086
01:51:16,368 --> 01:51:24,500
need to know does it so yeah I guess I

2087
01:51:22,279 --> 01:51:27,319
don't really know maybe this is actually

2088
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:29,238
working just fine and so if you look at

2089
01:51:27,319 --> 01:51:32,238
what's going on here really the only

2090
01:51:29,238 --> 01:51:34,428
problem that I might maybe I'm having is

2091
01:51:32,238 --> 01:51:37,279
I'm not using the light probes yet so

2092
01:51:34,429 --> 01:51:40,130
we're casting from places like inside

2093
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:46,250
the floor and Counting that against the

2094
01:51:40,130 --> 01:51:48,020
voxel right it's possible it's possible

2095
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:50,539
I don't know

2096
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:52,670
so maybe we just need to cast from the

2097
01:51:50,539 --> 01:51:54,939
voxels and if that's the case I may be

2098
01:51:52,670 --> 01:51:56,618
mean to cast from the light probes right

2099
01:51:54,939 --> 01:52:01,549
[Music]

2100
01:51:56,618 --> 01:52:02,569
and I really shouldn't do that now all

2101
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:06,560
right all right

2102
01:52:02,569 --> 01:52:08,960
whatever I'm gonna call it we're gonna

2103
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:10,340
go to the QA I'm gonna call it but it's

2104
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,420
really exciting because now we're at the

2105
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:14,619
point where we should be able to

2106
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:17,840
actually go cast from the light probes

2107
01:52:14,618 --> 01:52:20,000
add the frame persistence back in and

2108
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:22,849
then we're like basically at light

2109
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,130
transport we're really close and then we

2110
01:52:22,849 --> 01:52:27,980
can see the main thing we've got left

2111
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:29,449
that's a kind of unknown is how we're

2112
01:52:27,979 --> 01:52:31,488
going to encode that as assigned

2113
01:52:29,448 --> 01:52:34,279
distance field correctly that's gonna

2114
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:37,250
take a little bit of doing right but

2115
01:52:34,279 --> 01:52:40,059
we're really close now all right let's

2116
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:40,060
go go ahead and QA

2117
01:53:10,399 --> 01:53:16,010
shouldn't world Shump dim in metres use

2118
01:53:13,219 --> 01:53:17,479
fundamental unit yes it probably should

2119
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:25,269
now that we've verified that that

2120
01:53:17,479 --> 01:53:25,269
actually works there's no reason not to

2121
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:44,370
how about increasing the Vox gonna see

2122
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:48,270
and see if that reduces acne I don't

2123
01:53:44,369 --> 01:53:50,189
really want to again because I I want to

2124
01:53:48,270 --> 01:53:58,110
now make sure that I'm casting in the

2125
01:53:50,189 --> 01:54:00,269
right place so what I'd rather do is go

2126
01:53:58,109 --> 01:54:02,579
start casting from known good locations

2127
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:04,110
and then once we know we're casting from

2128
01:54:02,579 --> 01:54:07,340
known good locations see if it's still

2129
01:54:04,109 --> 01:54:07,339
there right

2130
01:54:18,489 --> 01:54:24,939
let's see I'm a big fan have always been

2131
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:29,390
delighted with your grouchy and a good

2132
01:54:24,939 --> 01:54:31,159
very good sense okay I believe that this

2133
01:54:29,390 --> 01:54:32,990
is a very useful quality that allows you

2134
01:54:31,159 --> 01:54:35,000
to look at things and the role of sober

2135
01:54:32,989 --> 01:54:36,710
look just I still can't understand how

2136
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,420
to develop this quality in myself can

2137
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:40,430
you advise something a book production

2138
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:42,409
new programming work as a web developer

2139
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:46,640
if you do not mind the time these--of do

2140
01:54:42,409 --> 01:54:48,199
you feel answer thank you so I would say

2141
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:49,970
that it's more of like just a

2142
01:54:48,199 --> 01:54:52,039
personality trait that you probably

2143
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:53,990
either have or don't have and I don't

2144
01:54:52,039 --> 01:54:55,640
know but you necessarily want to develop

2145
01:54:53,989 --> 01:54:57,829
it if you don't have it because it leads

2146
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:01,970
to it a very frustrating existence it's

2147
01:54:57,829 --> 01:55:06,850
the one way to say it essentially where

2148
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:12,350
the where the grumpiness comes from is i

2149
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:15,710
here's what I would say fundamentally

2150
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:19,450
speaking your mental model of the world

2151
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:23,420
as you get better at doing something

2152
01:55:19,449 --> 01:55:26,239
there are two ways that your natural

2153
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:29,989
reaction to seeing other people do it

2154
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:34,840
worse than you for what appears to be no

2155
01:55:29,989 --> 01:55:36,949
reason how you internalize that and

2156
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:38,630
everyone kind of has to manage it to a

2157
01:55:36,949 --> 01:55:40,519
certain degree because as you get better

2158
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:42,260
at anything even if you're never that

2159
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:43,820
good at it just the fact that you're

2160
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:45,770
getting better at it at all means you're

2161
01:55:43,819 --> 01:55:49,909
better than the person who hasn't liked

2162
01:55:45,770 --> 01:55:52,100
practicing it alright so you're always

2163
01:55:49,909 --> 01:55:53,989
gonna be better than someone a lot of

2164
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:56,060
the times and you're gonna see people

2165
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:58,899
doing stuff that you know how to do

2166
01:55:56,060 --> 01:56:01,250
better right as you get good at anything

2167
01:55:58,899 --> 01:56:02,750
even if you never get really good it

2168
01:56:01,250 --> 01:56:06,560
doesn't matter right just getting good

2169
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:12,109
at all so some people internalize that

2170
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:14,420
as kind of like a like an egotism or an

2171
01:56:12,109 --> 01:56:19,039
arrogance of the form like I'm really

2172
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:21,109
awesome right and so the better they get

2173
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:25,289
at something the more they think they're

2174
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:29,309
awesome other people internalize that

2175
01:56:25,289 --> 01:56:31,829
as why is everyone else stupid right so

2176
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:34,470
they don't think they continue to think

2177
01:56:31,829 --> 01:56:37,050
of themselves as average and they think

2178
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:38,430
of other people as below average whereas

2179
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:39,930
other people continue to think of other

2180
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:42,300
people as average and themselves as

2181
01:56:39,930 --> 01:56:44,280
above average and as far as I can tell

2182
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:45,869
this is just automatic it does it like

2183
01:56:44,279 --> 01:56:49,619
this is just what will happen to people

2184
01:56:45,869 --> 01:56:53,609
and one of the other two things will one

2185
01:56:49,619 --> 01:56:56,369
of those two things will occur and then

2186
01:56:53,609 --> 01:57:00,269
your natural disposition will either be

2187
01:56:56,369 --> 01:57:01,829
that you're a grouch which is my case

2188
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:04,200
and that's when you think of other

2189
01:57:01,829 --> 01:57:05,970
people as being stupid because they're

2190
01:57:04,199 --> 01:57:09,269
not doing something as well as you think

2191
01:57:05,970 --> 01:57:10,650
you could do it even if the correct

2192
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:12,120
answer is that that's just because you

2193
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:16,339
spent the time getting good at something

2194
01:57:12,119 --> 01:57:19,170
and they haven't done that yet right or

2195
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:20,579
you're a dick right and you're just

2196
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:23,039
someone who thinks you're awesome all

2197
01:57:20,579 --> 01:57:24,630
the time and that everyone else is not

2198
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:28,859
as good as you because you're special

2199
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:30,480
right neither are great right I mean

2200
01:57:28,859 --> 01:57:32,339
there's a reason that people don't have

2201
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:36,000
a positive opinion of people who are

2202
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:37,170
grouchy or dicks all the time but I

2203
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,510
think that's just kind of the natural

2204
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:40,859
brain chemistry response goes one of

2205
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:49,140
those two ways I don't know what

2206
01:57:40,859 --> 01:57:51,449
determines it right and so you kind of

2207
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:54,180
want to develop mental techniques to

2208
01:57:51,449 --> 01:57:56,369
avoid that being a problem like you want

2209
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:58,560
to credit try to be conscious of these

2210
01:57:56,369 --> 01:58:00,659
natural tendencies and then not do them

2211
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:02,490
to the extent that you want to not be a

2212
01:58:00,659 --> 01:58:03,960
grouch all the time or you not want

2213
01:58:02,489 --> 01:58:10,409
don't want to be a dick all the time

2214
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:12,359
right the problem is sometimes you end

2215
01:58:10,409 --> 01:58:14,639
up in a situation where it's just

2216
01:58:12,359 --> 01:58:17,039
relentless right and this is the problem

2217
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:23,220
that I find the world in these days

2218
01:58:17,039 --> 01:58:25,319
where literally it's not just a little

2219
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:27,000
bit of the world doing things that are

2220
01:58:25,319 --> 01:58:30,630
kind of incredibly stupid all the time

2221
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:34,470
it's like all the time right everything

2222
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:38,359
you use like everything you touch is

2223
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:40,250
like incredibly low quality right

2224
01:58:38,359 --> 01:58:43,579
compared to what you think should

2225
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:47,510
roughly be the case and then it just

2226
01:58:43,579 --> 01:58:49,939
becomes like I would like to not be

2227
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:51,409
grouchy about stuff and I'd like to kind

2228
01:58:49,939 --> 01:58:53,779
of have a more positive framing on

2229
01:58:51,409 --> 01:58:57,739
things a lot of the time and I just

2230
01:58:53,779 --> 01:58:59,689
can't it like overwhelms me right and so

2231
01:58:57,739 --> 01:59:03,050
that's not a good thing and similarly I

2232
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:04,759
think other people who want to think of

2233
01:59:03,050 --> 01:59:06,260
themselves as hotshots are awesome or

2234
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:08,390
whatever would have a pretty easy time

2235
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:10,039
doing that in today's world because if

2236
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:11,720
you become even a slightly good

2237
01:59:10,039 --> 01:59:14,359
programmer everyone is way worse than

2238
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:17,090
you right so if your if your jam is

2239
01:59:14,359 --> 01:59:18,769
feeling really good about yourself well

2240
01:59:17,090 --> 01:59:21,110
now's a good time to do it I guess I

2241
01:59:18,770 --> 01:59:24,080
would say but for those of us who just

2242
01:59:21,109 --> 01:59:27,170
feel bad about the world when it's doing

2243
01:59:24,079 --> 01:59:29,479
poorly it's not rewarding and it doesn't

2244
01:59:27,170 --> 01:59:37,850
really make you feel good right you get

2245
01:59:29,479 --> 01:59:39,289
no positive I guess all I'm trying to

2246
01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:40,520
say is some people will feel better

2247
01:59:39,289 --> 01:59:42,289
about themselves when they see other

2248
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:43,640
people doing things stupid and they know

2249
01:59:42,289 --> 01:59:45,380
how they would do them correctly other

2250
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:47,990
people just feel bad because they think

2251
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:50,690
the world is crap at that point I am in

2252
01:59:47,989 --> 01:59:52,489
the latter category so the more I learn

2253
01:59:50,689 --> 01:59:54,529
about something the more I think

2254
01:59:52,489 --> 01:59:58,279
everyone is stupid the more I feel

2255
01:59:54,529 --> 02:00:01,550
scared and unhappy rather than feeling

2256
01:59:58,279 --> 02:00:04,359
good about myself I feel bad about the

2257
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:08,180
state of the world and get scared right

2258
02:00:04,359 --> 02:00:10,549
so that's just what happens and you

2259
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:13,130
can't change it I couldn't suddenly

2260
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:14,720
decide to be a dick all the time instead

2261
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:17,000
of being Grouch all the time because

2262
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:18,920
your brain just I think just does one or

2263
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,630
the other and then what you have to do

2264
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:23,000
is is figure out how to not do that

2265
02:00:20,630 --> 02:00:24,710
thing if you want to be happy right you

2266
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,090
have to figure out how to not be a

2267
02:00:24,710 --> 02:00:27,409
grouch if you're someone who feels

2268
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:30,710
scared about the world when you see

2269
02:00:27,409 --> 02:00:32,809
people doing things stupid or if you're

2270
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:34,670
an arrogant if you go the arrogant

2271
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:36,590
direction and think you're awesome you

2272
02:00:34,670 --> 02:00:39,619
need to tone it down right you need to

2273
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:43,550
figure out how to stop thinking those

2274
02:00:39,619 --> 02:00:46,430
thoughts and think more about how to

2275
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:47,420
just like be happy and not not rub

2276
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:48,619
people the wrong way because you're

2277
02:00:47,420 --> 02:00:51,510
being a dick right instead of rubbing

2278
02:00:48,619 --> 02:00:54,630
people throw away because you're being

2279
02:00:51,510 --> 02:00:57,119
I don't have an answer to how to solve

2280
02:00:54,630 --> 02:01:00,630
that problem if I did I would do it

2281
02:00:57,119 --> 02:01:02,750
right you're asking the opposite which

2282
02:01:00,630 --> 02:01:06,090
is how to become a grouch or a dick and

2283
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:06,899
I'm not sure I think it's a good idea to

2284
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:09,930
do that

2285
02:01:06,899 --> 02:01:13,349
like if you're already in the standpoint

2286
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:15,960
of not having a visceral chemical

2287
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:21,240
reaction to people being stupid I don't

2288
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:23,250
know that you want to gain that because

2289
02:01:21,239 --> 02:01:25,739
there's probably ways you can get the

2290
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:28,500
good part of it which is driving

2291
02:01:25,739 --> 02:01:30,300
yourself to be better that's the that's

2292
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:32,310
the good part of thinking things are

2293
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:36,720
crap is you try to work towards

2294
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:38,220
improving them or vice versa right if

2295
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:41,039
you're going the arrogant route or the

2296
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:42,930
egotism route it's driving yourself to

2297
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:46,229
be better than everybody else right and

2298
02:01:42,930 --> 02:01:48,270
those are both good right they both both

2299
02:01:46,229 --> 02:01:50,279
you thinking everything sucks and you

2300
02:01:48,270 --> 02:01:52,260
have to do something to fix it or you

2301
02:01:50,279 --> 02:01:53,429
wanting to be better than everyone so

2302
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:54,810
you drive yourself to be better than

2303
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:56,990
everyone right those are both good

2304
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:59,460
drives because they help you get better

2305
02:01:56,989 --> 02:02:01,289
but the problem is they both lead to

2306
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:03,840
unhappiness right in different ways

2307
02:02:01,289 --> 02:02:06,149
because in one way you think the world

2308
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:10,140
is awful all the time and in the other

2309
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:12,689
way you become insufferable right and in

2310
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:15,390
both cases people don't like it most

2311
02:02:12,689 --> 02:02:17,039
right I mean nobody wants to sit around

2312
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:18,869
listening to how awesome you are and

2313
02:02:17,039 --> 02:02:20,670
nobody wants to listen sit around

2314
02:02:18,869 --> 02:02:22,170
listening to how awful the world is so

2315
02:02:20,670 --> 02:02:27,630
no matter which way you go it's not

2316
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:31,440
great right so what I would say about it

2317
02:02:27,630 --> 02:02:33,150
in general is the ideal situation like

2318
02:02:31,439 --> 02:02:36,059
if you could just tune your brain

2319
02:02:33,149 --> 02:02:38,639
chemistry perfectly what you would

2320
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:41,460
probably want to do is be able to

2321
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:43,860
possess the quality of looking at the

2322
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:46,680
world and realizing how much it sucked

2323
02:02:43,859 --> 02:02:49,920
without it having an effect on you

2324
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:52,200
somehow so like you could see how we're

2325
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:54,840
doing all these things wrong and want to

2326
02:02:52,199 --> 02:02:56,609
try and fix them but without you feeling

2327
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:58,920
the negative feelings that come with

2328
02:02:56,609 --> 02:03:01,979
that or in the opposite case which I

2329
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:03,520
can't speak as much to because I usually

2330
02:03:01,979 --> 02:03:05,199
don't get a positive

2331
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:07,570
feeling for feeling like I did something

2332
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:08,769
better than other people I get the

2333
02:03:07,569 --> 02:03:09,849
opposite when I feel like I did

2334
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:13,570
something better than someone else I

2335
02:03:09,850 --> 02:03:15,670
feel bad about the other people like I

2336
02:03:13,569 --> 02:03:21,219
have a negative feeling about them not a

2337
02:03:15,670 --> 02:03:22,539
positive feeling about me right so I can

2338
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:23,710
talk more about that one as from a

2339
02:03:22,539 --> 02:03:27,130
visceral experience cuz that's what I

2340
02:03:23,710 --> 02:03:29,170
experience I and somebody who was more

2341
02:03:27,130 --> 02:03:31,420
on the egotistical side of things and

2342
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:33,539
felt positive about themselves rather

2343
02:03:31,420 --> 02:03:36,550
than negative about other people

2344
02:03:33,539 --> 02:03:39,220
again same basic idea it just manifests

2345
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:43,750
itself in two different attitudes right

2346
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:46,030
I don't know what the best way of toning

2347
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:48,000
down that is because again still bad but

2348
02:03:46,029 --> 02:03:50,019
it's you you end up with a different

2349
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,250
thing you're not sitting around telling

2350
02:03:50,020 --> 02:03:52,390
everyone else how bad they are but you

2351
02:03:51,250 --> 02:03:54,489
are sitting around telling one else how

2352
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:59,079
awesome you are and that's you know also

2353
02:03:54,489 --> 02:04:00,789
kind of insufferable right so anyway the

2354
02:03:59,079 --> 02:04:05,649
ideal thing if you could do it somehow

2355
02:04:00,789 --> 02:04:07,180
would be to have the outlook that is all

2356
02:04:05,649 --> 02:04:08,979
of the stuff that we're doing now can

2357
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:11,159
always be better and we could be much

2358
02:04:08,979 --> 02:04:13,239
better than we are right now we are not

2359
02:04:11,159 --> 02:04:15,069
definitely not performing up to our

2360
02:04:13,239 --> 02:04:18,699
potential and you know that and you can

2361
02:04:15,069 --> 02:04:21,309
see it right it would be great if you

2362
02:04:18,699 --> 02:04:24,939
could develop that without having one of

2363
02:04:21,310 --> 02:04:27,550
those other two feelings right and I'm

2364
02:04:24,939 --> 02:04:28,989
not sure how to do that because if I was

2365
02:04:27,550 --> 02:04:32,279
trying to do that I would just do it

2366
02:04:28,989 --> 02:04:35,170
because you will be a happier person

2367
02:04:32,279 --> 02:04:36,340
just for your own good right even if you

2368
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:39,850
don't care about other people at all

2369
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:43,869
which I guess I probably don't just your

2370
02:04:39,850 --> 02:04:46,630
own just just purely selfishly right you

2371
02:04:43,869 --> 02:04:48,789
will be in a better mood I think most of

2372
02:04:46,630 --> 02:04:51,250
the time at least for the grouchy people

2373
02:04:48,789 --> 02:04:53,019
speaking for me if you're someone who

2374
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:59,829
feels grouchy when you see people not

2375
02:04:53,020 --> 02:05:01,120
doing something very well you would be

2376
02:04:59,829 --> 02:05:04,930
happier if you didn't have those

2377
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:06,399
negative emotions you don't care about

2378
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:08,230
the other people at all you don't care

2379
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:10,119
what they think of you you don't care

2380
02:05:08,229 --> 02:05:11,409
like whether they think you're a good

2381
02:05:10,119 --> 02:05:14,500
person or any of that stuff you just

2382
02:05:11,409 --> 02:05:15,760
forget it you don't care you're still

2383
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:17,170
unhappy because you're sitting around

2384
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:19,510
going wow the world is just

2385
02:05:17,170 --> 02:05:21,039
totally screwed like we can't learn

2386
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:23,110
anything we're dumb we make the same

2387
02:05:21,039 --> 02:05:25,269
mistakes over and over again even though

2388
02:05:23,109 --> 02:05:28,389
there's obvious information people are

2389
02:05:25,270 --> 02:05:29,860
always rejecting science on every you

2390
02:05:28,390 --> 02:05:31,600
know every part of the political

2391
02:05:29,859 --> 02:05:33,309
spectrum these days just completely

2392
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:36,039
rejects the scientific method and nobody

2393
02:05:33,310 --> 02:05:38,500
uses it right programming we don't use

2394
02:05:36,039 --> 02:05:40,060
it like we don't nobody actually tries

2395
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:42,939
to do a good job right we're just like

2396
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:44,830
screw it forget it we don't care we're

2397
02:05:42,939 --> 02:05:46,569
losing all of our knowledge we're losing

2398
02:05:44,829 --> 02:05:49,029
all our abilities and society just

2399
02:05:46,569 --> 02:05:50,319
bumbles forward by the fact that systems

2400
02:05:49,029 --> 02:05:52,090
that are actually working take a long

2401
02:05:50,319 --> 02:05:53,979
time to break and then eventually they

2402
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:55,750
just will you know and then nobody has

2403
02:05:53,979 --> 02:05:58,899
power in California and everything else

2404
02:05:55,750 --> 02:06:00,819
right you know we're all driving around

2405
02:05:58,899 --> 02:06:02,859
in Mad Max mobiles like hitting each

2406
02:06:00,819 --> 02:06:09,819
other with long Spears from from the

2407
02:06:02,859 --> 02:06:12,759
back of a 4x4 right and so I don't know

2408
02:06:09,819 --> 02:06:14,769
how you develop that like perfect

2409
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:16,449
harmony of knowing we need to do things

2410
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:18,160
better actively working towards no

2411
02:06:16,448 --> 02:06:20,500
anything's better but not letting the

2412
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:23,260
negative emotions affect you I don't

2413
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:26,679
know how you do that it you know in a

2414
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:29,829
world where things are at least somewhat

2415
02:06:26,679 --> 02:06:34,529
getting better I think it's easier to do

2416
02:06:29,829 --> 02:06:38,289
and what I can say is that when I was

2417
02:06:34,529 --> 02:06:42,130
younger things always felt really

2418
02:06:38,289 --> 02:06:44,409
positive to me and part of that is

2419
02:06:42,130 --> 02:06:47,109
obviously because I had not learned as

2420
02:06:44,409 --> 02:06:50,439
much so the the more naive you are the

2421
02:06:47,109 --> 02:06:50,859
less you see the problems in what people

2422
02:06:50,439 --> 02:06:52,479
are doing

2423
02:06:50,859 --> 02:06:56,469
so there's definitely true because as

2424
02:06:52,479 --> 02:06:58,988
you learn more you are more critical of

2425
02:06:56,469 --> 02:07:02,109
the things that you see because you have

2426
02:06:58,988 --> 02:07:06,009
more capacity to be but another part of

2427
02:07:02,109 --> 02:07:08,519
it was I in general like the industry

2428
02:07:06,010 --> 02:07:13,110
that I cared about which is computing

2429
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:16,810
everyone really was better than me

2430
02:07:13,109 --> 02:07:20,019
not just at that time but possibly today

2431
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:24,550
even right like the great programmers of

2432
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:29,970
that time period we're very numerous

2433
02:07:24,550 --> 02:07:34,250
compared to the average and in a

2434
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:39,510
sampling of game developers from like

2435
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:43,489
1992 I would say that the me of today

2436
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:52,289
would probably not be very good right

2437
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:54,929
like so like I maybe am fooling myself

2438
02:07:52,289 --> 02:07:56,909
but I actually think that a lot of what

2439
02:07:54,930 --> 02:08:00,150
happened is not me getting particularly

2440
02:07:56,909 --> 02:08:02,430
much better at programming but rather I

2441
02:08:00,149 --> 02:08:06,569
think the world got a lot worse at

2442
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:09,329
programming like a lot worse and so what

2443
02:08:06,569 --> 02:08:13,859
I perceive to have happened over the

2444
02:08:09,329 --> 02:08:17,279
past say 20 years or so is that I got a

2445
02:08:13,859 --> 02:08:20,729
little better for sure like I I'm always

2446
02:08:17,279 --> 02:08:25,139
improving but I never really got that

2447
02:08:20,729 --> 02:08:28,409
good I'm still kind of I mean I there's

2448
02:08:25,140 --> 02:08:31,230
a lot of things I do wrong every day and

2449
02:08:28,409 --> 02:08:33,539
I know what they are right and I still

2450
02:08:31,229 --> 02:08:35,099
make a lot of mistakes all the time it

2451
02:08:33,539 --> 02:08:38,399
still takes me way too long to do things

2452
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:40,410
and it still takes me like sometimes

2453
02:08:38,399 --> 02:08:44,699
years to explore a problem and come to

2454
02:08:40,409 --> 02:08:48,359
the correct solution and like the whole

2455
02:08:44,699 --> 02:08:51,269
world just like slid past me like in a

2456
02:08:48,359 --> 02:08:54,089
huge way right so now I look and I go

2457
02:08:51,270 --> 02:08:56,520
like what the heck like I drop in to

2458
02:08:54,090 --> 02:08:59,220
like do some web programming stuff and

2459
02:08:56,520 --> 02:09:01,380
like I feel like our website is like far

2460
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:03,600
and away better than like 90% of the

2461
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:05,190
things that I use and I am a rank

2462
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:10,980
amateur at that I have no experience

2463
02:09:05,189 --> 02:09:12,929
right what is going on like if if I had

2464
02:09:10,979 --> 02:09:15,299
dropped into some other field of

2465
02:09:12,930 --> 02:09:17,820
programming in 1992 and tried to do

2466
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:19,949
something in six months I would be a

2467
02:09:17,819 --> 02:09:22,769
nobody like I couldn't I wouldn't be

2468
02:09:19,949 --> 02:09:26,460
able to put up anything of value really

2469
02:09:22,770 --> 02:09:27,120
right and like that just makes me feel

2470
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:29,100
horrible

2471
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:30,920
it does not make me feel like I'm good

2472
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:35,820
at programming it makes me feel

2473
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:39,930
terrified at like how bad the state of

2474
02:09:35,819 --> 02:09:43,069
things is and I just get like horrified

2475
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:43,070
by it right and

2476
02:09:43,319 --> 02:09:50,099
I don't think you want that in your life

2477
02:09:47,369 --> 02:09:51,720
I really don't think you do I don't I

2478
02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:54,380
don't know how to say it any other way

2479
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:57,900
but it's just like it's terrifying like

2480
02:09:54,380 --> 02:10:04,050
you don't want to feel good about your

2481
02:09:57,899 --> 02:10:06,179
programming in that way like I felt so

2482
02:10:04,050 --> 02:10:11,640
much better when everyone was better

2483
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:13,530
than me and if I really thought I was a

2484
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:16,680
very good programmer right now I would

2485
02:10:13,529 --> 02:10:19,590
be okay with the fact that I'm feeling

2486
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:25,980
that way about it but I didn't get much

2487
02:10:19,590 --> 02:10:30,720
better like like like we have a serious

2488
02:10:25,979 --> 02:10:33,089
problem that's all I can say we have a

2489
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:36,810
really serious problem the kinds of

2490
02:10:33,090 --> 02:10:40,789
people that I randomly interacted with

2491
02:10:36,810 --> 02:10:48,120
in programming in like the early 90s or

2492
02:10:40,789 --> 02:10:50,279
late 80s the the average case was so

2493
02:10:48,119 --> 02:10:55,050
much better than it is right now that it

2494
02:10:50,279 --> 02:11:00,599
is absolutely terrifying to me like it's

2495
02:10:55,050 --> 02:11:02,400
absolutely terrifying so I don't think

2496
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:04,230
you want that feeling I really don't

2497
02:11:02,399 --> 02:11:07,170
think you do I mean it really feels

2498
02:11:04,229 --> 02:11:08,519
horrible it doesn't feel good maybe if

2499
02:11:07,170 --> 02:11:10,289
you're the kind of person who goes the

2500
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:12,330
other way and just and and you just

2501
02:11:10,289 --> 02:11:16,170
become an egotistical maniac

2502
02:11:12,329 --> 02:11:18,269
maybe that feels great to be working to

2503
02:11:16,170 --> 02:11:19,890
be such a big fish in such a small pond

2504
02:11:18,270 --> 02:11:21,450
which I think a lot of people could

2505
02:11:19,890 --> 02:11:23,130
achieve these days if you put your mind

2506
02:11:21,449 --> 02:11:27,389
to it you can become a better programmer

2507
02:11:23,130 --> 02:11:28,619
than like you know 80% of the people who

2508
02:11:27,390 --> 02:11:34,680
work at Facebook or something probably

2509
02:11:28,619 --> 02:11:36,000
right like maybe go ahead and do it if

2510
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:37,500
you think you're that person if you

2511
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
think that's the natural because man

2512
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:40,470
you'll feel so good about yourself every

2513
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,329
day but if you think you're the kind of

2514
02:11:40,470 --> 02:11:45,840
person who just feels bad about the

2515
02:11:42,329 --> 02:11:47,640
world don't do it like don't learn that

2516
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:50,610
behavior like if you don't have it in

2517
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:52,650
you to have those feelings don't by

2518
02:11:50,609 --> 02:11:54,859
default don't gain them like don't do

2519
02:11:52,649 --> 02:11:54,859
that

2520
02:11:56,109 --> 02:12:05,649
I don't know I wish I had something

2521
02:12:04,270 --> 02:12:08,410
constructive to say it's an excellent

2522
02:12:05,649 --> 02:12:10,839
question that you asked which is how do

2523
02:12:08,409 --> 02:12:12,729
you develop that sort of cynicism that

2524
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:15,460
allows you to say we need to do this

2525
02:12:12,729 --> 02:12:17,009
better because we know we can and we

2526
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:19,270
need to focus on all of these flaws

2527
02:12:17,010 --> 02:12:21,400
because that's a fundamental engineering

2528
02:12:19,270 --> 02:12:23,620
mindset and I don't think you get great

2529
02:12:21,399 --> 02:12:25,599
engineers who can't do that like it's

2530
02:12:23,619 --> 02:12:28,180
obvious to me that every great engineer

2531
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:34,530
I've ever met is able to focus on flaws

2532
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:34,530
and say how do we move this forward but

2533
02:12:36,119 --> 02:12:44,079
there are times in humanity's history

2534
02:12:40,029 --> 02:12:45,969
where being that kind of person feels ok

2535
02:12:44,079 --> 02:12:47,470
and there's times when it doesn't and I

2536
02:12:45,970 --> 02:12:55,210
think now is the time when it really

2537
02:12:47,470 --> 02:12:57,940
definitely very much doesn't like it is

2538
02:12:55,210 --> 02:13:02,739
just a horribly miserable existence as I

2539
02:12:57,939 --> 02:13:05,069
guess what I would say and like don't do

2540
02:13:02,739 --> 02:13:05,069
it on purpose

2541
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:27,590
since the Jersey did you make your

2542
02:13:25,369 --> 02:13:29,000
website also in C and if so is it

2543
02:13:27,590 --> 02:13:30,980
possible to build an entire website from

2544
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:34,909
scratch and plain C using new libraries

2545
02:13:30,979 --> 02:13:37,429
- yes so I did build our entire website

2546
02:13:34,909 --> 02:13:40,069
and see it's basically an offline

2547
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:43,039
content management system because I

2548
02:13:40,069 --> 02:13:46,819
don't put the machines on the web here

2549
02:13:43,039 --> 02:13:48,560
at Molly rocket I just have like one

2550
02:13:46,819 --> 02:13:50,448
machine that's like a crap machine

2551
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:51,949
that's you know made for doing web

2552
02:13:50,448 --> 02:13:54,649
uploads and that's plugged into the net

2553
02:13:51,948 --> 02:13:58,369
and it does the streaming here and

2554
02:13:54,649 --> 02:14:01,089
everything else is disconnected and so I

2555
02:13:58,369 --> 02:14:04,420
basically have a CMS that I wrote in C

2556
02:14:01,090 --> 02:14:07,369
you feed data into it on one side like

2557
02:14:04,420 --> 02:14:11,149
images and you know markdown basically

2558
02:14:07,369 --> 02:14:13,988
and you know stuff stuff that you want

2559
02:14:11,149 --> 02:14:16,159
it's like the content for your website

2560
02:14:13,988 --> 02:14:20,779
there's a little animation and coding

2561
02:14:16,159 --> 02:14:24,979
thing right for like like this stuff

2562
02:14:20,779 --> 02:14:26,929
right and it just knows about a lot of

2563
02:14:24,979 --> 02:14:29,359
things like it knows like okay how to

2564
02:14:26,930 --> 02:14:31,039
you know how do these things frame and

2565
02:14:29,359 --> 02:14:33,259
and how do I automatically make stuff

2566
02:14:31,039 --> 02:14:34,909
that maintains aspect ratios you know

2567
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:36,170
like that sort of stuff and it

2568
02:14:34,909 --> 02:14:38,149
understands all these things so you just

2569
02:14:36,170 --> 02:14:44,930
basically give it like here's roughly

2570
02:14:38,149 --> 02:14:46,639
what I want to have you know and it

2571
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:49,340
takes all of that ingress and it just

2572
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:53,600
spits out a static blob basically right

2573
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:56,000
so it like hashes all the binary data

2574
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:58,969
and figures out like which of it has to

2575
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,920
be updated which if it doesn't and puts

2576
02:14:58,969 --> 02:15:03,770
those into like permanent things so they

2577
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:05,569
can be marked as cache always and that

2578
02:15:03,770 --> 02:15:09,320
sort of stuff it it dumps all that stuff

2579
02:15:05,569 --> 02:15:13,309
out and it puts it into a ready to

2580
02:15:09,319 --> 02:15:16,549
distribute format for fastly or are

2581
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:21,590
sorry for firebase fastly is the thing

2582
02:15:16,550 --> 02:15:25,489
that runs firebase at the CMS the CDN

2583
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:27,380
level and then all I do is I just bulk

2584
02:15:25,488 --> 02:15:30,829
upload that whenever I want to update

2585
02:15:27,380 --> 02:15:34,010
the website and you know I'd love to run

2586
02:15:30,829 --> 02:15:35,800
our sync but of course firebase can't

2587
02:15:34,010 --> 02:15:38,170
use our sync it uses node

2588
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:40,029
jas so updating our website despite the

2589
02:15:38,170 --> 02:15:43,359
fact that only like three HTML files

2590
02:15:40,029 --> 02:15:45,389
have changed still takes frickin five

2591
02:15:43,359 --> 02:15:47,439
minutes because the people who wrote

2592
02:15:45,389 --> 02:15:50,980
firebase don't know what our sink is

2593
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:52,689
right like problem to solve since 1987

2594
02:15:50,979 --> 02:15:59,319
or something like that but there's the

2595
02:15:52,689 --> 02:16:00,669
Grouch again krub do you ever try and

2596
02:15:59,319 --> 02:16:02,889
measure how much of your current outlook

2597
02:16:00,670 --> 02:16:04,420
is affected by rose-tinted memories

2598
02:16:02,889 --> 02:16:06,039
there were great things about using

2599
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:07,210
computers in 1992 but I remember having

2600
02:16:06,039 --> 02:16:09,309
to constantly do things like messed with

2601
02:16:07,210 --> 02:16:10,960
hi I'm that sis to try and get the most

2602
02:16:09,309 --> 02:16:14,980
basic things working not arguing the

2603
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:22,868
current state of things isn't woeful so

2604
02:16:14,979 --> 02:16:24,308
yeah I guess what I would say is I don't

2605
02:16:22,868 --> 02:16:26,649
think there's really any rose-tinted

2606
02:16:24,309 --> 02:16:29,770
glasses at all and the reason I say that

2607
02:16:26,649 --> 02:16:32,138
is because when I think of the Haiti or

2608
02:16:29,770 --> 02:16:34,149
it like I think of using the like Amiga

2609
02:16:32,138 --> 02:16:36,159
500 or something like that and I have an

2610
02:16:34,148 --> 02:16:38,019
Amiga 2000 here and I occasionally boot

2611
02:16:36,159 --> 02:16:43,510
it up and it's like the best thing I've

2612
02:16:38,019 --> 02:16:45,579
ever used Hey and sure there's all kinds

2613
02:16:43,510 --> 02:16:48,130
of problems with it like does it have

2614
02:16:45,579 --> 02:16:49,510
all the features that Windows 10 has

2615
02:16:48,129 --> 02:16:53,858
like no of course not

2616
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:55,859
right so I'm not trying to make that

2617
02:16:53,859 --> 02:16:58,989
comparison at all

2618
02:16:55,859 --> 02:17:04,929
but when you look at what they did on an

2619
02:16:58,989 --> 02:17:08,289
Amiga 1000 with a 68k and 512k a ram and

2620
02:17:04,929 --> 02:17:14,679
you look at what Microsoft is shipping

2621
02:17:08,290 --> 02:17:19,149
today with a PC running at 4 gigahertz

2622
02:17:14,679 --> 02:17:22,960
like all core with 8 cores and hyper

2623
02:17:19,148 --> 02:17:26,769
threading and 32 gigabytes of memory and

2624
02:17:22,959 --> 02:17:28,949
a graphics card with its own 4 gigabytes

2625
02:17:26,769 --> 02:17:34,530
of memory and and and

2626
02:17:28,950 --> 02:17:37,890
and and it's just it boggles the mind

2627
02:17:34,530 --> 02:17:41,370
how pathetic the code is today it's just

2628
02:17:37,889 --> 02:17:44,129
garbage and it doesn't do anything else

2629
02:17:41,370 --> 02:17:46,620
really the number of features I actually

2630
02:17:44,129 --> 02:17:51,089
interact with on Windows 10 is slightly

2631
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:54,390
like a fraction more than what I did

2632
02:17:51,090 --> 02:17:55,950
day-to-day on my Amiga 3000 which I

2633
02:17:54,389 --> 02:17:57,809
don't have anymore unfortunately I've

2634
02:17:55,950 --> 02:18:01,200
got I've got a 2000 I grabbed from

2635
02:17:57,809 --> 02:18:04,680
somebody who was throwing it out I sold

2636
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:07,560
my Amiga 3000 to buy a PC when the

2637
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:09,780
amigas kind of went out of production

2638
02:18:07,559 --> 02:18:13,379
really and you couldn't really stay on

2639
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:17,700
that lineage anymore I wish I had I had

2640
02:18:13,379 --> 02:18:18,959
if I was a rich person back then I never

2641
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:20,969
would have gotten rid of it right but

2642
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:23,069
you know can usually only afford one

2643
02:18:20,968 --> 02:18:24,779
computer back in those days I mean they

2644
02:18:23,069 --> 02:18:26,579
were thousands of dollars so you know

2645
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:28,260
some people couldn't afford them at all

2646
02:18:26,579 --> 02:18:29,819
and those who could you could you know

2647
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:36,500
unless you were well really wealthy you

2648
02:18:29,819 --> 02:18:38,159
can only afford one so anyway the I

2649
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:40,229
really don't think there's any

2650
02:18:38,159 --> 02:18:43,760
rose-colored glasses man I mean it's

2651
02:18:40,229 --> 02:18:50,449
true that that adjusting like PC memory

2652
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:54,059
was a pain in the butt but I mean so

2653
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:57,840
like yeah there were some problems with

2654
02:18:54,059 --> 02:19:02,279
it when I plugged in the mouse pretty

2655
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:03,780
much always worked like my Linux machine

2656
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:07,530
the mouse just doesn't work sometimes

2657
02:19:03,780 --> 02:19:09,420
that's it right so and I have no way to

2658
02:19:07,530 --> 02:19:11,579
fix it ever like no chance

2659
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:14,610
hi ma'am that cyst was pretty easy to

2660
02:19:11,579 --> 02:19:20,069
learn so only a few parameters and once

2661
02:19:14,610 --> 02:19:23,130
you knew him you knew him right my

2662
02:19:20,069 --> 02:19:24,449
machine never ran an update didn't

2663
02:19:23,129 --> 02:19:28,529
interrupt him me in the middle of

2664
02:19:24,450 --> 02:19:32,400
playing the original doom to just make a

2665
02:19:28,530 --> 02:19:33,750
few quick updates right there weren't

2666
02:19:32,399 --> 02:19:35,218
all these background services running

2667
02:19:33,750 --> 02:19:37,049
they don't know what they are there were

2668
02:19:35,218 --> 02:19:40,079
no security holes because hey guess what

2669
02:19:37,049 --> 02:19:42,420
nothing is running right like so it was

2670
02:19:40,079 --> 02:19:43,978
pretty basic at the time and if you want

2671
02:19:42,420 --> 02:19:46,170
get a virus on your machine you had to

2672
02:19:43,978 --> 02:19:47,938
actually take a floppy disk and put it

2673
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:50,549
in the drive that had a virus on it

2674
02:19:47,939 --> 02:19:52,649
you couldn't just get one because the

2675
02:19:50,549 --> 02:19:53,969
thing is sitting around and Microsoft

2676
02:19:52,649 --> 02:19:59,250
doesn't know what they're doing right

2677
02:19:53,969 --> 02:20:00,989
like I don't know like it's a disaster

2678
02:19:59,250 --> 02:20:01,799
now I just I feel like it's a complete

2679
02:20:00,989 --> 02:20:03,420
mess

2680
02:20:01,799 --> 02:20:05,840
and it's not it's just getting worse and

2681
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:05,840
worse and worse

2682
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:13,500
the number of things that we've gained

2683
02:20:08,610 --> 02:20:16,100
is not even even close to what it should

2684
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:16,100
have been right

2685
02:20:28,879 --> 02:20:32,089
go bond says hey meteor I feel like this

2686
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,529
was a pretty recent shift in the

2687
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:35,181
zeitgeist you I remember just five ten

2688
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:38,000
years ago everyone was much more excited

2689
02:20:35,181 --> 02:20:41,090
about tech I don't know if five or ten

2690
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:46,761
years ago is enough far back but yeah

2691
02:20:41,090 --> 02:20:48,890
like I mean Windows was at least until

2692
02:20:46,761 --> 02:20:52,101
like Vista like Windows was actually

2693
02:20:48,890 --> 02:20:54,020
alright to like and sometimes things

2694
02:20:52,101 --> 02:20:57,051
were getting better GPUs were getting

2695
02:20:54,021 --> 02:21:01,851
better right and we were doing stuff and

2696
02:20:57,050 --> 02:21:06,649
I don't know right which Windows is the

2697
02:21:01,851 --> 02:21:09,170
best version oh that's easy NT 351 yeah

2698
02:21:06,649 --> 02:21:10,609
hands down and t35 one is the best

2699
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:15,710
version of Windows this ever been ever

2700
02:21:10,610 --> 02:21:17,450
will be in transition this about

2701
02:21:15,709 --> 02:21:19,100
grouchiness but when you do something

2702
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:20,450
you do it qualitatively because you know

2703
02:21:19,101 --> 02:21:21,829
what quality is it's cool from a

2704
02:21:20,450 --> 02:21:29,601
programmer interview that's all I wanted

2705
02:21:21,829 --> 02:21:32,149
to say yeah I mean people have drives

2706
02:21:29,601 --> 02:21:34,641
that drive them to do things better than

2707
02:21:32,149 --> 02:21:39,220
they need to right and it's true that a

2708
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:39,220
lot of people do that and you know like

2709
02:21:39,579 --> 02:21:47,931
and it's definitely a beneficial

2710
02:21:44,050 --> 02:21:50,539
character trait for doing better work

2711
02:21:47,931 --> 02:21:53,030
right like I know that I'm a much better

2712
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:57,200
programmer than I would have been

2713
02:21:53,030 --> 02:22:00,261
because I get angry with myself when I

2714
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:03,530
think something isn't right and when I

2715
02:22:00,261 --> 02:22:05,149
think I could do better right and I know

2716
02:22:03,530 --> 02:22:08,840
that getting angry with myself like that

2717
02:22:05,149 --> 02:22:11,300
is what makes me go further than I would

2718
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:12,920
have gotten if I was just didn't have

2719
02:22:11,300 --> 02:22:14,779
those negative emotions if I didn't feel

2720
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:16,579
badly about myself all the time I

2721
02:22:14,780 --> 02:22:18,590
wouldn't get better like that if I

2722
02:22:16,579 --> 02:22:25,399
wasn't like this was stupid you did this

2723
02:22:18,590 --> 02:22:27,500
dumb right and so I don't deny that's

2724
02:22:25,399 --> 02:22:30,069
valuable to have that character trait in

2725
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:33,681
certain circumstances the problem is

2726
02:22:30,069 --> 02:22:35,569
when the world goes into decline it's

2727
02:22:33,681 --> 02:22:42,470
terrifying that's that that's the cost

2728
02:22:35,569 --> 02:22:46,549
right that's that's the cost and

2729
02:22:42,469 --> 02:22:51,069
and that's like the past 20 years let's

2730
02:22:46,549 --> 02:22:56,479
say 15 years maybe that that's the cost

2731
02:22:51,069 --> 02:22:59,289
and I and it's not good right it does

2732
02:22:56,479 --> 02:22:59,289
not feel good at all

2733
02:23:10,478 --> 02:23:13,208
brian says the city apartments Freesat

2734
02:23:12,189 --> 02:23:14,709
is doing some investigating the other

2735
02:23:13,209 --> 02:23:16,810
day and you need to use process monitor

2736
02:23:14,709 --> 02:23:17,979
spy and dev and random looking around I

2737
02:23:16,809 --> 02:23:19,600
notice a big number of events

2738
02:23:17,978 --> 02:23:22,748
sequentially all calling read file knows

2739
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:25,059
dev am loading 180 K bike config file in

2740
02:23:22,748 --> 02:23:27,279
42 calls each reading four K chunks from

2741
02:23:25,059 --> 02:23:30,488
the file setting the offset every time

2742
02:23:27,279 --> 02:23:32,738
so you should be happy I feel like Devon

2743
02:23:30,488 --> 02:23:35,588
oftentimes loads things in one bite

2744
02:23:32,738 --> 02:23:44,398
chunks from files so the four K is a big

2745
02:23:35,588 --> 02:23:47,379
improvement Brian um I would say that

2746
02:23:44,398 --> 02:23:48,878
one of these days I need to do a stream

2747
02:23:47,379 --> 02:23:50,529
from an old machine I think I've got one

2748
02:23:48,879 --> 02:23:52,959
that has old Devon I would like to show

2749
02:23:50,529 --> 02:23:54,969
just how bad Visual Studio has gotten I

2750
02:23:52,959 --> 02:23:56,850
think I have a machine that still has

2751
02:23:54,968 --> 02:23:58,988
Visual Studio you're like five on there

2752
02:23:56,850 --> 02:24:00,100
and I'd like to run it and just show you

2753
02:23:58,988 --> 02:24:02,529
what using a debugger is like it's

2754
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:06,908
instant and this is on a machine that

2755
02:24:02,529 --> 02:24:08,918
runs at 120th the speed of a modern

2756
02:24:06,908 --> 02:24:11,708
machine so this machine is 20 times

2757
02:24:08,918 --> 02:24:13,600
faster than the machine I'll demo on and

2758
02:24:11,709 --> 02:24:20,739
stepping through code in Visual Studio

2759
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:25,270
is several orders of magnitude we get

2760
02:24:20,738 --> 02:24:27,038
here I don't know and more so because I

2761
02:24:25,270 --> 02:24:29,069
come from a place where I feel horrible

2762
02:24:27,039 --> 02:24:31,930
about those sorts of things

2763
02:24:29,068 --> 02:24:33,578
viscerally I don't understand why the

2764
02:24:31,930 --> 02:24:36,338
people making these things don't feel

2765
02:24:33,578 --> 02:24:37,809
horrible about themselves it's hard for

2766
02:24:36,338 --> 02:24:40,298
me to wrap my head around that

2767
02:24:37,809 --> 02:24:42,488
like I realize that it's just that's

2768
02:24:40,299 --> 02:24:43,869
because it's the way that my brain works

2769
02:24:42,488 --> 02:24:47,588
and it other people's brains don't work

2770
02:24:43,869 --> 02:24:51,129
that way but like how does the team that

2771
02:24:47,588 --> 02:24:54,270
makes Visual Studio not feel absolutely

2772
02:24:51,129 --> 02:25:00,249
horrible about themselves every day I I

2773
02:24:54,270 --> 02:25:03,520
would just be a wreck like I would just

2774
02:25:00,248 --> 02:25:06,488
be horrified about my own self every day

2775
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:08,979
and yet they clearly don't because they

2776
02:25:06,488 --> 02:25:10,180
don't fix any of it right like it would

2777
02:25:08,978 --> 02:25:13,628
be eating at me

2778
02:25:10,180 --> 02:25:16,180
so much that I knew that I'd taken

2779
02:25:13,629 --> 02:25:18,850
something that ran in real time and made

2780
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:21,988
it takes several seconds and that was my

2781
02:25:18,850 --> 02:25:21,988
fault like

2782
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,750
I just feel horrible about that sort of

2783
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:31,340
stuff and that's why like you know I'm

2784
02:25:29,750 --> 02:25:34,670
oh wait like when I release something

2785
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:36,290
into the world I try to make it okay you

2786
02:25:34,670 --> 02:25:41,809
know I write plenty of crappy code but I

2787
02:25:36,290 --> 02:25:44,240
keep it internal right I try to keep

2788
02:25:41,809 --> 02:25:48,289
that only for my dev you know only for

2789
02:25:44,239 --> 02:25:50,420
my like internal process and even that I

2790
02:25:48,290 --> 02:25:53,000
feel bad about sometimes like like I've

2791
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:54,799
said before some things that I've

2792
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,280
written that were meant to just be for

2793
02:25:54,799 --> 02:25:58,069
me

2794
02:25:55,280 --> 02:26:00,560
like and that are pretty crappy are

2795
02:25:58,069 --> 02:26:01,879
things that still get used as part of

2796
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:05,000
the dead process it like rad or

2797
02:26:01,879 --> 02:26:06,679
something right and I feel bad about

2798
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:08,329
that even though I kind of don't feel

2799
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:10,120
like that's my fault because someone

2800
02:26:08,329 --> 02:26:12,379
else just does something about that

2801
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:16,460
those were supposed to be little tools

2802
02:26:12,379 --> 02:26:17,869
for me right to use but you know

2803
02:26:16,459 --> 02:26:19,819
sometimes tools that you were thought

2804
02:26:17,870 --> 02:26:22,220
were just a little simple something take

2805
02:26:19,819 --> 02:26:24,289
on a life of their own right and at that

2806
02:26:22,219 --> 02:26:26,869
point it's like a crap like this was

2807
02:26:24,290 --> 02:26:30,560
never intended to be good and now it's

2808
02:26:26,870 --> 02:26:31,850
actually getting used and but I don't

2809
02:26:30,559 --> 02:26:34,069
usually beat myself about that cuz I'm

2810
02:26:31,850 --> 02:26:35,750
like that's your fault man I sell you

2811
02:26:34,069 --> 02:26:38,270
this like you didn't pay me to do this

2812
02:26:35,750 --> 02:26:40,159
right this was something I had to do

2813
02:26:38,270 --> 02:26:42,050
quickly and in the course of some other

2814
02:26:40,159 --> 02:26:44,000
thing I was working on and if you want

2815
02:26:42,049 --> 02:26:45,469
to use it that's your decision right so

2816
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,760
I don't feel that bad about that but if

2817
02:26:45,469 --> 02:26:48,649
I'm like selling something like dev

2818
02:26:46,760 --> 02:26:51,500
studio for a thousand bucks or whatever

2819
02:26:48,649 --> 02:26:54,350
the heck I license cost and I like screw

2820
02:26:51,500 --> 02:27:00,799
it up that badly i man I would feel

2821
02:26:54,350 --> 02:27:02,390
horrible right I mean I felt horrible

2822
02:27:00,799 --> 02:27:05,119
when I thought the boat glitch was my

2823
02:27:02,389 --> 02:27:07,639
fault in the witness right and it turned

2824
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:09,140
out it wasn't thankfully but like even

2825
02:27:07,639 --> 02:27:10,489
just a little thing like that gets by me

2826
02:27:09,139 --> 02:27:13,639
and I feel terrible because it's my

2827
02:27:10,489 --> 02:27:14,809
fault right and you know I still even

2828
02:27:13,639 --> 02:27:16,129
felt a little bit bad because I was like

2829
02:27:14,809 --> 02:27:17,779
well if I had actually gone on this

2830
02:27:16,129 --> 02:27:18,649
project full-time which I didn't do at

2831
02:27:17,780 --> 02:27:20,840
the end of the witness I wasn't

2832
02:27:18,649 --> 02:27:21,859
full-time and I'm like I would have

2833
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:24,469
caught that because I would have gone

2834
02:27:21,860 --> 02:27:27,950
and checked and I could have done that

2835
02:27:24,469 --> 02:27:29,149
right and so in a way well I didn't feel

2836
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:32,780
like it was my fault cuz it wasn't my

2837
02:27:29,149 --> 02:27:34,789
bug I could have I could have fixed it

2838
02:27:32,780 --> 02:27:35,359
right because if I had been on full-time

2839
02:27:34,790 --> 02:27:39,789
I

2840
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:43,328
have found that I bet and so you know I

2841
02:27:39,789 --> 02:27:43,329
still feel bad about that

2842
02:28:03,559 --> 02:28:07,818
what's one thing in programming your

2843
02:28:05,748 --> 02:28:12,859
tech that can excite you and you think

2844
02:28:07,818 --> 02:28:18,378
is an improvement well I mean I don't

2845
02:28:12,859 --> 02:28:20,510
really know of any software things at

2846
02:28:18,379 --> 02:28:23,149
the moment except for maybe the work

2847
02:28:20,510 --> 02:28:31,309
that John Blair was doing on his new

2848
02:28:23,148 --> 02:28:34,219
language so you know I don't know what

2849
02:28:31,309 --> 02:28:39,318
it will turn out to be in the end but I

2850
02:28:34,219 --> 02:28:41,618
just feel like it's the only language

2851
02:28:39,318 --> 02:28:44,448
development effort that I've seen so far

2852
02:28:41,619 --> 02:28:48,319
where it seems like the person has any

2853
02:28:44,449 --> 02:28:52,270
idea what they're doing right and that's

2854
02:28:48,318 --> 02:28:52,269
kind of refreshing because like

2855
02:28:53,318 --> 02:29:00,859
especially because John has created like

2856
02:28:57,578 --> 02:29:04,189
you know effectively two whole game

2857
02:29:00,859 --> 02:29:06,559
architectures all related like braid in

2858
02:29:04,189 --> 02:29:09,818
the witness herb have some similar

2859
02:29:06,559 --> 02:29:13,010
architectural features to them but like

2860
02:29:09,818 --> 02:29:18,288
that shipped incredibly impressive

2861
02:29:13,010 --> 02:29:19,998
things I feel like that kind of

2862
02:29:18,289 --> 02:29:22,039
perspective is something that most

2863
02:29:19,998 --> 02:29:26,539
people who develop languages just don't

2864
02:29:22,039 --> 02:29:31,069
have and so I'm pretty excited to see

2865
02:29:26,539 --> 02:29:32,779
what ends up happening with it it may

2866
02:29:31,068 --> 02:29:37,578
still be no good you know I mean

2867
02:29:32,779 --> 02:29:39,498
everything is difficult and you never

2868
02:29:37,578 --> 02:29:44,958
know if thing will succeed but I feel

2869
02:29:39,498 --> 02:29:46,430
like if I if I had to put money on it I

2870
02:29:44,959 --> 02:29:48,199
would say that it's the only language

2871
02:29:46,430 --> 02:29:49,639
probably in development right now that

2872
02:29:48,199 --> 02:29:52,279
I'm excited to see what happens because

2873
02:29:49,639 --> 02:29:54,198
I feel like it's the only one with a

2874
02:29:52,279 --> 02:29:56,810
person behind it who actually has done

2875
02:29:54,199 --> 02:29:59,209
the kinds of large-scale architecture

2876
02:29:56,809 --> 02:30:01,728
successfully that I think you need to

2877
02:29:59,209 --> 02:30:03,140
have done - or in order to actually be

2878
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:05,838
able to make good language design

2879
02:30:03,139 --> 02:30:07,128
decisions right because a lot of other

2880
02:30:05,838 --> 02:30:09,228
languages are just people making

2881
02:30:07,129 --> 02:30:10,579
language design decisions without that

2882
02:30:09,228 --> 02:30:11,898
perspective they have never shipped

2883
02:30:10,578 --> 02:30:15,818
something on the scale of the witness

2884
02:30:11,898 --> 02:30:15,818
that they architected themselves right

2885
02:30:16,299 --> 02:30:28,159
so I'm pretty interested to see what's

2886
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:30,560
gonna happen with that and I don't know

2887
02:30:28,159 --> 02:30:33,100
if I had to pick something other than

2888
02:30:30,559 --> 02:30:33,100
Jie

2889
02:30:40,210 --> 02:30:48,390
I mean one thing that I was excited

2890
02:30:42,489 --> 02:30:52,120
about recently was Charles and Fabien

2891
02:30:48,390 --> 02:30:55,029
making the Udo compressor I mean they

2892
02:30:52,120 --> 02:30:58,180
made some advances in compression

2893
02:30:55,030 --> 02:30:59,739
technology that are you know I don't

2894
02:30:58,181 --> 02:31:03,431
think anyone even thought we're

2895
02:30:59,739 --> 02:31:05,470
necessarily possible like I mean nobody

2896
02:31:03,431 --> 02:31:06,791
had really made a advancement in

2897
02:31:05,470 --> 02:31:08,140
compression technology for quite some

2898
02:31:06,790 --> 02:31:09,609
time and they come along with this thing

2899
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:13,359
that just totally destroys like

2900
02:31:09,610 --> 02:31:18,730
everything that came before it and and

2901
02:31:13,360 --> 02:31:21,641
that's pretty exciting to me again

2902
02:31:18,729 --> 02:31:24,069
because these are just examples of where

2903
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:25,511
I can like look up to somebody who's

2904
02:31:24,069 --> 02:31:27,520
doing something that I know is much

2905
02:31:25,511 --> 02:31:29,970
better than anything I would do right

2906
02:31:27,521 --> 02:31:34,989
like I know the util compressor is

2907
02:31:29,970 --> 02:31:37,720
probably something that if I wanted to

2908
02:31:34,989 --> 02:31:41,530
do something of that caliber it would

2909
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:43,120
take years of study and I mean and I'm

2910
02:31:41,530 --> 02:31:43,631
and I might just not be good enough to

2911
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:47,500
do it

2912
02:31:43,630 --> 02:31:49,331
right and it's inspiring to see that

2913
02:31:47,501 --> 02:31:51,700
occasionally because you almost never

2914
02:31:49,331 --> 02:31:54,251
see it anymore most of the things people

2915
02:31:51,700 --> 02:31:58,601
produce are just garbage and it's not

2916
02:31:54,251 --> 02:32:01,060
impressive and I don't like I'm I don't

2917
02:31:58,601 --> 02:32:02,081
want to make it like I don't want to be

2918
02:32:01,060 --> 02:32:04,390
that way right

2919
02:32:02,081 --> 02:32:06,011
and so when you see something that you

2920
02:32:04,390 --> 02:32:07,841
go like wow like the people who made

2921
02:32:06,011 --> 02:32:09,551
this we're just amazing and they were so

2922
02:32:07,841 --> 02:32:12,729
on top of it and they just absolutely

2923
02:32:09,550 --> 02:32:15,251
crushed it I feel like that's pretty

2924
02:32:12,729 --> 02:32:18,850
inspiring too because you want to be

2925
02:32:15,251 --> 02:32:21,911
seeing people make things that you that

2926
02:32:18,851 --> 02:32:23,110
are beyond your capability right you

2927
02:32:21,911 --> 02:32:24,581
don't want to constantly be looking

2928
02:32:23,110 --> 02:32:27,940
around and seeing only things that you

2929
02:32:24,581 --> 02:32:30,581
feel like are not even at the level you

2930
02:32:27,940 --> 02:32:32,171
could just sit down and do even though

2931
02:32:30,581 --> 02:32:34,479
it's not your area of expertise

2932
02:32:32,171 --> 02:32:36,220
right and so when you see people who

2933
02:32:34,479 --> 02:32:37,841
have specialized in something and they

2934
02:32:36,220 --> 02:32:40,180
go and do this thing that's just like

2935
02:32:37,841 --> 02:32:42,431
way better than what you would have any

2936
02:32:40,181 --> 02:32:44,471
idea how to do that's really inspiring

2937
02:32:42,431 --> 02:32:48,011
because it it's like let's you know that

2938
02:32:44,470 --> 02:32:50,859
there are people like pushing boundaries

2939
02:32:48,011 --> 02:32:53,021
in directions that are further than you

2940
02:32:50,860 --> 02:32:54,579
can conceive

2941
02:32:53,021 --> 02:33:02,561
you know what I mean and you want to

2942
02:32:54,579 --> 02:33:04,239
feel that way and like in terms of

2943
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:05,979
software I can't think of a lot of

2944
02:33:04,239 --> 02:33:13,060
things like that you know like that the

2945
02:33:05,979 --> 02:33:15,250
Google compressors one but you know I

2946
02:33:13,060 --> 02:33:17,289
think I would be hard-pressed to think

2947
02:33:15,250 --> 02:33:19,560
of another one there probably is one out

2948
02:33:17,290 --> 02:33:19,561
there

2949
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:42,729
I just don't know I I don't have

2950
02:33:39,489 --> 02:33:45,940
anything offhand but the auto compressor

2951
02:33:42,729 --> 02:33:47,500
is definitely one where I think like

2952
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:51,870
that was just like a demonstration of

2953
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:51,870
skill that I found very impressive I

2954
02:33:55,229 --> 02:34:00,341
think with that question I'm sorry you

2955
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:02,709
didn't upset me with the question it's

2956
02:34:00,341 --> 02:34:04,870
it's a state of upsetness with the world

2957
02:34:02,709 --> 02:34:06,880
that is just lingering and it just

2958
02:34:04,870 --> 02:34:13,030
happens to be a question where that was

2959
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:14,529
the topic of the question right you have

2960
02:34:13,030 --> 02:34:16,181
any advice for applying for triple-a

2961
02:34:14,530 --> 02:34:17,891
engineering jobs I've worked on a few

2962
02:34:16,181 --> 02:34:20,230
indie titles porting them to consoles

2963
02:34:17,890 --> 02:34:21,789
mostly uni games I think a lack of sea

2964
02:34:20,229 --> 02:34:23,289
boses work experience is hurting me but

2965
02:34:21,790 --> 02:34:24,311
it's hard to get that rig experience

2966
02:34:23,290 --> 02:34:29,051
without previously those less

2967
02:34:24,310 --> 02:34:33,279
experienced any advice not really I mean

2968
02:34:29,050 --> 02:34:35,409
I think you want to have some spare time

2969
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:38,681
projects probably if you if you can't

2970
02:34:35,409 --> 02:34:42,761
get a if you cannot get a C++ job right

2971
02:34:38,681 --> 02:34:46,210
now I don't know how you could really

2972
02:34:42,761 --> 02:34:49,000
get one with no experience it probably

2973
02:34:46,209 --> 02:34:51,880
pretty tough entry-level C++ work is

2974
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:56,021
hard to come by I think in the game

2975
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:59,109
industry anyway but I don't really know

2976
02:34:56,021 --> 02:35:06,159
I don't apply for triple-a engineering

2977
02:34:59,110 --> 02:35:07,900
jobs obviously so I'm not sure how how

2978
02:35:06,159 --> 02:35:10,119
that market looks there may be places

2979
02:35:07,899 --> 02:35:14,649
for junior programmers to get into it

2980
02:35:10,120 --> 02:35:17,351
where there's a you know like a sort of

2981
02:35:14,649 --> 02:35:20,109
a bridge there but I guess I would ask

2982
02:35:17,351 --> 02:35:24,011
the question when you say porting a

2983
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:33,400
Unity game to a console what does that

2984
02:35:24,011 --> 02:35:36,060
mean so cuz doesn't unity just run on

2985
02:35:33,399 --> 02:35:36,060
consoles

2986
02:35:36,959 --> 02:35:42,909
so that's not C++ expiry what does that

2987
02:35:40,239 --> 02:35:44,380
mean I was trying to figure out where

2988
02:35:42,909 --> 02:35:47,130
you're coming from exactly because then

2989
02:35:44,380 --> 02:35:47,130
I could kind of maybe

2990
02:35:54,959 --> 02:35:59,839
do you do anything specific to motivate

2991
02:35:57,180 --> 02:36:05,010
yourself in the world of office software

2992
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:07,109
well no because you know it's not really

2993
02:36:05,010 --> 02:36:10,079
about motivation or not I just enjoy

2994
02:36:07,109 --> 02:36:13,199
programming so I do it every day pretty

2995
02:36:10,079 --> 02:36:14,909
much by default you know and if I go for

2996
02:36:13,199 --> 02:36:20,550
too many days without programming I just

2997
02:36:14,909 --> 02:36:22,079
get sort of for Lauren really so I never

2998
02:36:20,549 --> 02:36:26,148
really have to motivate myself to

2999
02:36:22,079 --> 02:36:26,148
program it's always just gonna happen

3000
02:36:27,409 --> 02:36:33,109
it's more of the feeling that you get

3001
02:36:30,329 --> 02:36:35,010
and a psychological tool that that takes

3002
02:36:33,109 --> 02:36:36,809
is the problem

3003
02:36:35,010 --> 02:36:39,180
not that it's demotivating it doesn't

3004
02:36:36,809 --> 02:36:42,859
ever demotivates me it just makes me

3005
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:46,680
terrified all the time right

3006
02:36:42,859 --> 02:36:51,568
what I can say is that like if there was

3007
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:55,559
I I do think it creates an opportunity

3008
02:36:51,568 --> 02:36:57,000
in the world though and you know I don't

3009
02:36:55,559 --> 02:37:04,909
think that opportunity is ever going to

3010
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:08,879
be taken but if you were some kind of a

3011
02:37:04,909 --> 02:37:20,420
enterprising small country out there

3012
02:37:08,879 --> 02:37:28,528
somewhere right and you were like okay

3013
02:37:20,420 --> 02:37:34,079
we are like the government of I don't

3014
02:37:28,529 --> 02:37:38,870
know I'm not sure who this would ever be

3015
02:37:34,079 --> 02:37:45,988
in reality but you're the government of

3016
02:37:38,870 --> 02:37:47,489
Qatar let's say and you just decide one

3017
02:37:45,988 --> 02:37:49,350
day that you're gonna be like this

3018
02:37:47,488 --> 02:37:52,318
enlightened government and you're gonna

3019
02:37:49,350 --> 02:37:55,800
like try and create the next world

3020
02:37:52,318 --> 02:38:01,289
economy because why not before the oil

3021
02:37:55,799 --> 02:38:03,778
money runs out I don't know if you

3022
02:38:01,290 --> 02:38:05,819
actually set up a thing where it's like

3023
02:38:03,779 --> 02:38:08,760
okay we're gonna take a government and

3024
02:38:05,818 --> 02:38:13,760
we're going to say that like we

3025
02:38:08,760 --> 02:38:13,760
guarantee certain things like you know

3026
02:38:14,239 --> 02:38:23,579
we're going to create a environment

3027
02:38:18,989 --> 02:38:25,709
where people are 100% encouraged to be

3028
02:38:23,579 --> 02:38:27,539
like scientific about everything and our

3029
02:38:25,709 --> 02:38:29,969
entire government will be run this way

3030
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:34,439
so everything has to be based on

3031
02:38:29,969 --> 02:38:39,019
repeatable premises and we're not going

3032
02:38:34,439 --> 02:38:41,700
to do any of the weird like sort of

3033
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:44,189
liberal arts self-esteem complete

3034
02:38:41,700 --> 02:38:46,649
garbage that like the u.s. does nowadays

3035
02:38:44,189 --> 02:38:49,229
or that a lot of places do we're

3036
02:38:46,648 --> 02:38:51,750
actually gonna be like we're creating a

3037
02:38:49,228 --> 02:38:54,599
place primarily for people who want to

3038
02:38:51,750 --> 02:39:00,180
focus on excellence and never be sort of

3039
02:38:54,600 --> 02:39:01,260
like you know told that their primary

3040
02:39:00,180 --> 02:39:05,309
goal of something else

3041
02:39:01,260 --> 02:39:09,500
I mean I'd move there tomorrow right

3042
02:39:05,309 --> 02:39:11,789
like I would love to know that

3043
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:18,209
everything in that society was gonna run

3044
02:39:11,790 --> 02:39:19,770
like on that premise right but you know

3045
02:39:18,209 --> 02:39:22,949
short of something like that where

3046
02:39:19,770 --> 02:39:24,510
someone actually creates and you know

3047
02:39:22,950 --> 02:39:26,069
it's not unprecedented you know there's

3048
02:39:24,510 --> 02:39:28,760
been plenty there's you know I mean you

3049
02:39:26,068 --> 02:39:31,680
look at even the founding of the u.s. or

3050
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:34,680
countries that that followed suit

3051
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:37,380
afterwards right there's tons of times

3052
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:39,960
when there's been shifts in the way that

3053
02:39:37,379 --> 02:39:43,679
that people framed their societies and

3054
02:39:39,959 --> 02:39:45,688
how they were going to work right and so

3055
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:48,720
there's nothing that says that someone

3056
02:39:45,689 --> 02:39:51,389
brilliant somewhere who's smarter than

3057
02:39:48,719 --> 02:39:56,568
me and knows how to figure this crap out

3058
02:39:51,389 --> 02:39:56,568
you know John Madison 2.0 or something

3059
02:39:56,809 --> 02:40:02,909
figures out how to structure a society

3060
02:39:59,279 --> 02:40:05,790
so that people are driven to always do

3061
02:40:02,909 --> 02:40:09,090
things well and be focused on excellence

3062
02:40:05,790 --> 02:40:15,450
always and everything else is not part

3063
02:40:09,090 --> 02:40:16,790
of your societal fabric right I feel

3064
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:19,409
like it wouldn't be long before

3065
02:40:16,790 --> 02:40:22,630
literally all the top talent wants to be

3066
02:40:19,409 --> 02:40:24,189
with you right I mean I would be

3067
02:40:22,629 --> 02:40:25,688
trying to convince them I was good at

3068
02:40:24,189 --> 02:40:27,130
something so that they will let me in

3069
02:40:25,689 --> 02:40:28,960
because the feeling of being surrounded

3070
02:40:27,129 --> 02:40:33,519
by people who are all trying to be good

3071
02:40:28,959 --> 02:40:34,799
I mean these days I feel the opposite I

3072
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:37,569
feel like I'm surrounded

3073
02:40:34,799 --> 02:40:41,079
pretty much entirely other than like the

3074
02:40:37,568 --> 02:40:42,039
small group of people who I know I feel

3075
02:40:41,079 --> 02:40:45,488
like I'm is surrounded by people who

3076
02:40:42,040 --> 02:40:47,979
could couldn't care less like everything

3077
02:40:45,488 --> 02:40:50,978
else is more important to them than any

3078
02:40:47,978 --> 02:40:53,789
quality right then then excelling then

3079
02:40:50,978 --> 02:40:55,750
pushing forward right and being better I

3080
02:40:53,790 --> 02:40:59,199
don't I don't feel like it's even on

3081
02:40:55,750 --> 02:41:03,790
their radar right and you can see that

3082
02:40:59,199 --> 02:41:05,790
manifested everywhere you go when was

3083
02:41:03,790 --> 02:41:09,310
the last time you saw a TED talk called

3084
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:10,449
focusing on excellence like how do we

3085
02:41:09,309 --> 02:41:12,459
make people want to focus on excellence

3086
02:41:10,449 --> 02:41:14,619
I don't know is there one maybe there

3087
02:41:12,459 --> 02:41:15,549
was I've never there's hundred of these

3088
02:41:14,619 --> 02:41:16,869
things are passed around

3089
02:41:15,549 --> 02:41:19,809
no one ever passes that one around if

3090
02:41:16,869 --> 02:41:23,350
there was one right when was the last

3091
02:41:19,809 --> 02:41:24,879
time you saw a political debate where

3092
02:41:23,350 --> 02:41:26,109
they were like you know what the problem

3093
02:41:24,879 --> 02:41:28,959
with our country is right now no one

3094
02:41:26,109 --> 02:41:32,199
cares about doing things well know where

3095
02:41:28,959 --> 02:41:35,198
he found right not not on the table not

3096
02:41:32,199 --> 02:41:41,649
interesting when was the last time there

3097
02:41:35,199 --> 02:41:41,829
was a like a what's the word I'm looking

3098
02:41:41,648 --> 02:41:45,719
for

3099
02:41:41,829 --> 02:41:48,670
not not really incident but like

3100
02:41:45,719 --> 02:41:50,738
national news focused college campus

3101
02:41:48,670 --> 02:41:53,139
incident who knows what where the

3102
02:41:50,738 --> 02:41:54,368
primary flashpoint was are we focusing

3103
02:41:53,139 --> 02:41:55,568
on excellence are we trying to be

3104
02:41:54,369 --> 02:41:58,180
excellent about things when was the last

3105
02:41:55,568 --> 02:42:00,398
time that was a huge issue in a public

3106
02:41:58,180 --> 02:42:01,930
schooling debate is are we driving all

3107
02:42:00,398 --> 02:42:05,318
of our children to try and be excellent

3108
02:42:01,930 --> 02:42:08,710
of the things they do right it's like

3109
02:42:05,318 --> 02:42:09,158
never everything else is more important

3110
02:42:08,709 --> 02:42:11,019
than that

3111
02:42:09,158 --> 02:42:13,738
right everything else at least where I

3112
02:42:11,020 --> 02:42:19,600
live and probably where you live too is

3113
02:42:13,738 --> 02:42:22,180
not about being good we've like somehow

3114
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:24,250
developed a culture where the idea is

3115
02:42:22,180 --> 02:42:28,270
about everything other than actually

3116
02:42:24,250 --> 02:42:31,809
doing a good job and I think that has

3117
02:42:28,270 --> 02:42:34,510
consequences in the long run if there's

3118
02:42:31,809 --> 02:42:35,689
ever competition and that's why I say it

3119
02:42:34,510 --> 02:42:39,200
creates kind of a pretty

3120
02:42:35,690 --> 02:42:41,301
big opportunity and it certainly creates

3121
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:44,721
a big opportunity for adversaries you

3122
02:42:41,300 --> 02:42:47,439
know if if larger sort of competing

3123
02:42:44,720 --> 02:42:53,539
countries if Russia or China or you know

3124
02:42:47,440 --> 02:42:55,730
large industry on industrial bases got

3125
02:42:53,540 --> 02:42:58,190
serious about competing with the US

3126
02:42:55,729 --> 02:43:01,149
which you know trying to maybe is kind

3127
02:42:58,190 --> 02:43:04,730
of in that position to a largest then I

3128
02:43:01,149 --> 02:43:06,800
don't think it'd be that hard focus on

3129
02:43:04,729 --> 02:43:08,119
excellence in EULA be passed the u.s. in

3130
02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:10,459
a few decades

3131
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:12,891
right because no one here cares not even

3132
02:43:10,459 --> 02:43:15,109
a little bit and it's never talked about

3133
02:43:12,890 --> 02:43:17,479
and there's no money in it and people

3134
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:20,659
there are many many many many many

3135
02:43:17,479 --> 02:43:23,511
people all over the place whose primary

3136
02:43:20,659 --> 02:43:27,351
goal every day is something opposite or

3137
02:43:23,511 --> 02:43:29,631
at least under tangential right so

3138
02:43:27,351 --> 02:43:33,440
there's huge amounts of money and effort

3139
02:43:29,630 --> 02:43:35,000
and people spending their time trying to

3140
02:43:33,440 --> 02:43:38,540
get everyone to focus on things that are

3141
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:41,601
not that and there's nobody like almost

3142
02:43:38,540 --> 02:43:43,790
nobody spending their time trying to get

3143
02:43:41,601 --> 02:43:46,721
people to focus on that and so what do

3144
02:43:43,790 --> 02:43:46,721
you think is gonna happen right

3145
02:43:51,109 --> 02:44:00,290
are you describing technocracy um just I

3146
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:05,659
don't know if I'm describing technocracy

3147
02:44:00,290 --> 02:44:07,760
I'm just describing a a place where you

3148
02:44:05,659 --> 02:44:10,030
Center your cultural values around

3149
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:13,010
excellence

3150
02:44:10,030 --> 02:44:17,060
that's all I'm describing right and like

3151
02:44:13,010 --> 02:44:18,648
I said if I knew how to do it I try to

3152
02:44:17,059 --> 02:44:21,049
get someone to do it right I mean I'd

3153
02:44:18,648 --> 02:44:23,809
I'd try to be James Madison 2.0 if I

3154
02:44:21,049 --> 02:44:25,159
thought that I was that good but I'm not

3155
02:44:23,809 --> 02:44:26,809
I don't know

3156
02:44:25,159 --> 02:44:28,219
right what the hell do I know I'm a

3157
02:44:26,809 --> 02:44:31,219
software engineer I don't know anything

3158
02:44:28,219 --> 02:44:34,969
about how you run a society right

3159
02:44:31,219 --> 02:44:37,039
I am simply talking about a symptom

3160
02:44:34,969 --> 02:44:38,989
right I'm talking about a symptom of a

3161
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:43,250
problem which is that I'm sorry a

3162
02:44:38,989 --> 02:44:44,840
symptom that I can observe and it's a

3163
02:44:43,250 --> 02:44:47,329
symptom of something that I don't know

3164
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:49,728
what it is or why it happens or how you

3165
02:44:47,329 --> 02:44:54,228
would prevent it right it's similar to

3166
02:44:49,728 --> 02:44:57,469
some kind of disease you know you see

3167
02:44:54,228 --> 02:45:00,949
that someone has you know hives all over

3168
02:44:57,469 --> 02:45:04,608
their body well you know there's hives

3169
02:45:00,950 --> 02:45:07,670
right but you don't know how they got

3170
02:45:04,609 --> 02:45:09,350
there and so that's kind of you know

3171
02:45:07,670 --> 02:45:11,600
what the world looks like to me I can

3172
02:45:09,350 --> 02:45:13,659
see that we no longer care about doing a

3173
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:18,559
good job and getting better at things

3174
02:45:13,659 --> 02:45:20,689
that's obvious but why right I can point

3175
02:45:18,559 --> 02:45:22,879
to a lot of people who make it their

3176
02:45:20,689 --> 02:45:25,639
mission in life to distract people from

3177
02:45:22,879 --> 02:45:28,129
that but I don't know why they are

3178
02:45:25,639 --> 02:45:30,170
either right so I know that that they

3179
02:45:28,129 --> 02:45:32,599
are and that they don't care but I don't

3180
02:45:30,170 --> 02:45:34,340
know why they don't care right and I can

3181
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:36,170
come up with all sorts of hypotheses but

3182
02:45:34,340 --> 02:45:38,920
really I'm just engaging in pop

3183
02:45:36,170 --> 02:45:42,530
psychology at that point and who knows

3184
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:51,350
so I think unfortunates left to people

3185
02:45:42,530 --> 02:45:55,550
smarter and more more in tune to the way

3186
02:45:51,350 --> 02:45:58,960
societies function to to solve that

3187
02:45:55,549 --> 02:45:58,959
problem if it ever does get solved

3188
02:46:10,168 --> 02:46:13,719
one way to force the idea of excellences

3189
02:46:12,279 --> 02:46:15,640
through some form of authoritarianism

3190
02:46:13,719 --> 02:46:19,418
but many wouldn't like that well and

3191
02:46:15,639 --> 02:46:22,059
authoritarianism is is not really that

3192
02:46:19,418 --> 02:46:23,588
helpful because it's just as likely to

3193
02:46:22,059 --> 02:46:25,359
go sour right I mean this is why

3194
02:46:23,588 --> 02:46:27,609
dictatorships are problematic because

3195
02:46:25,359 --> 02:46:29,979
you know maybe you create a dictatorship

3196
02:46:27,609 --> 02:46:31,390
and it's great for a little while when

3197
02:46:29,978 --> 02:46:32,408
you're running things the way that

3198
02:46:31,389 --> 02:46:37,148
dictators running them because they're

3199
02:46:32,408 --> 02:46:39,398
really good but they die right and now

3200
02:46:37,148 --> 02:46:42,939
someone succeeds them and maybe they're

3201
02:46:39,398 --> 02:46:46,028
not so good right and so one of the

3202
02:46:42,939 --> 02:46:48,039
problems is that you need more than just

3203
02:46:46,029 --> 02:46:49,838
a way of getting people to focus on

3204
02:46:48,039 --> 02:46:53,010
excellence for a little while through

3205
02:46:49,838 --> 02:46:55,568
coercion or through some kind of a of a

3206
02:46:53,010 --> 02:46:58,299
dictatorial or authoritarian regime

3207
02:46:55,568 --> 02:47:00,038
that's not stable look maybe you'll

3208
02:46:58,299 --> 02:47:04,749
succeed for a little while but you won't

3209
02:47:00,039 --> 02:47:06,159
succeed forever and so really what

3210
02:47:04,748 --> 02:47:08,859
you're talking about or at least what

3211
02:47:06,158 --> 02:47:14,288
what I would see is the the you know the

3212
02:47:08,859 --> 02:47:16,600
great sort of achievement if you were

3213
02:47:14,289 --> 02:47:19,479
ever able to do it was how do you create

3214
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:28,049
a culture where everyone feels compelled

3215
02:47:19,478 --> 02:47:31,298
to drive towards excellence right and I

3216
02:47:28,049 --> 02:47:35,549
really don't know how you do that right

3217
02:47:31,299 --> 02:47:35,549
I don't know

3218
02:47:47,101 --> 02:47:54,750
Oh Julian yet I mean that's that's a

3219
02:47:52,950 --> 02:47:56,190
good option right define excellence to

3220
02:47:54,750 --> 02:48:05,780
be whatever it's we're doing right now

3221
02:47:56,190 --> 02:48:08,431
and then we can kind of go oh right so

3222
02:48:05,780 --> 02:48:09,811
yeah I mean yeah I couldn't tell you I

3223
02:48:08,431 --> 02:48:11,579
don't know it's interesting to theorize

3224
02:48:09,810 --> 02:48:15,869
about but it's just I don't have any

3225
02:48:11,579 --> 02:48:18,060
answers right you know we've we've

3226
02:48:15,870 --> 02:48:21,931
figured out a lot of things you know if

3227
02:48:18,060 --> 02:48:23,940
you look at like capitalism one way of

3228
02:48:21,931 --> 02:48:26,130
looking at that is like oh so that was a

3229
02:48:23,940 --> 02:48:28,471
way of figuring out how to assign wealth

3230
02:48:26,129 --> 02:48:33,119
to people who accomplished something

3231
02:48:28,470 --> 02:48:35,761
right and that's really good because it

3232
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:38,820
does drive a lot of things forward to a

3233
02:48:35,761 --> 02:48:42,931
certain extent but the problem is it's

3234
02:48:38,819 --> 02:48:44,579
still based on the wealth right so what

3235
02:48:42,931 --> 02:48:46,620
you end up happening what you end up

3236
02:48:44,579 --> 02:48:52,261
seeing happened with systems that are

3237
02:48:46,620 --> 02:48:54,090
like you know using capitalism is once

3238
02:48:52,261 --> 02:48:57,200
you have a way of generating the wealth

3239
02:48:54,090 --> 02:48:59,250
you no longer care about the excellence

3240
02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:00,690
right and that's where you end up with

3241
02:48:59,250 --> 02:49:02,729
having to have antitrust law and all

3242
02:49:00,690 --> 02:49:03,960
these sorts of things because once you

3243
02:49:02,729 --> 02:49:06,899
have you know monopoly you can just

3244
02:49:03,959 --> 02:49:08,430
extract the wealth you can bundle things

3245
02:49:06,899 --> 02:49:09,569
together and then some things can be

3246
02:49:08,431 --> 02:49:12,840
good and something's bad and now you

3247
02:49:09,569 --> 02:49:14,459
don't have to worry you know bla bla bla

3248
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:15,780
if there's a glut or a Gold Rush

3249
02:49:14,459 --> 02:49:18,629
situation then there's no need for

3250
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:20,761
excellence at all so you know we found

3251
02:49:18,629 --> 02:49:22,260
some tricks and and capitalism was a

3252
02:49:20,761 --> 02:49:24,000
really good one right

3253
02:49:22,261 --> 02:49:28,140
like I think capitalism was a great idea

3254
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:29,489
as brilliant right the question is how

3255
02:49:28,140 --> 02:49:31,199
to get better than that and you know you

3256
02:49:29,489 --> 02:49:32,459
see a lot of time nowadays people saying

3257
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:37,530
like socialism is good idea or something

3258
02:49:32,459 --> 02:49:39,689
it's like okay come on like we need to

3259
02:49:37,530 --> 02:49:43,141
be coming up with something better than

3260
02:49:39,690 --> 02:49:45,120
what we've had right like know like

3261
02:49:43,140 --> 02:49:47,011
figure out what's the thing after

3262
02:49:45,120 --> 02:49:48,630
capitalism figure it out it's not

3263
02:49:47,011 --> 02:49:54,720
socialism that was the thing we had

3264
02:49:48,629 --> 02:49:57,029
before right what's next you know give

3265
02:49:54,720 --> 02:50:00,209
me give me the next version there's got

3266
02:49:57,030 --> 02:50:00,840
to be a better way of making it so that

3267
02:50:00,209 --> 02:50:03,089
people

3268
02:50:00,840 --> 02:50:06,840
are constantly motivated to be good

3269
02:50:03,090 --> 02:50:11,579
right and I know there's a way to do it

3270
02:50:06,840 --> 02:50:13,799
right it can't be that capitalism was

3271
02:50:11,579 --> 02:50:18,030
the best answer we had there has to be a

3272
02:50:13,799 --> 02:50:19,500
better one right and you know like I

3273
02:50:18,030 --> 02:50:21,810
said it's not my herb SP so I don't know

3274
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:26,549
what it is but it can't be it can't be

3275
02:50:21,809 --> 02:50:28,559
that after only ten thousand years and I

3276
02:50:26,549 --> 02:50:30,779
know how long we've been screwing with

3277
02:50:28,559 --> 02:50:33,239
this stuff it can't be that we hit the

3278
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:35,399
maximum there's got to be a way to get

3279
02:50:33,239 --> 02:50:38,850
past it right to a place where people

3280
02:50:35,398 --> 02:50:42,090
are driven more towards excellence and

3281
02:50:38,850 --> 02:50:43,290
also driven towards excellence like one

3282
02:50:42,090 --> 02:50:46,739
of the really big problems that I see

3283
02:50:43,290 --> 02:50:49,439
with like capitalism for example is it

3284
02:50:46,739 --> 02:50:51,600
also doesn't have a way to account for

3285
02:50:49,439 --> 02:50:54,898
the problem of driving towards

3286
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:58,470
excellence locally as opposed to

3287
02:50:54,898 --> 02:51:02,489
laterally so for example if you have

3288
02:50:58,469 --> 02:51:05,340
someone who is a who is the best janitor

3289
02:51:02,489 --> 02:51:08,549
in the world they are not making very

3290
02:51:05,340 --> 02:51:10,469
much money right and this creates a

3291
02:51:08,549 --> 02:51:11,519
problem because what it means is anyone

3292
02:51:10,469 --> 02:51:12,750
who's good enough to be the greatest

3293
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:14,399
trainer in the world probably could have

3294
02:51:12,750 --> 02:51:16,228
gone and done something else and they

3295
02:51:14,398 --> 02:51:18,629
will because they'll get paid more right

3296
02:51:16,228 --> 02:51:21,090
and so you end up with this problem of

3297
02:51:18,629 --> 02:51:23,969
your current the industries that are

3298
02:51:21,090 --> 02:51:26,819
currently able to extract the most money

3299
02:51:23,969 --> 02:51:29,969
out of the economy those get all the

3300
02:51:26,819 --> 02:51:31,709
good people and everything else you have

3301
02:51:29,969 --> 02:51:35,760
to do it just because you love it or

3302
02:51:31,709 --> 02:51:37,769
something right and there's constant

3303
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:38,909
pressure to not do it to do something

3304
02:51:37,770 --> 02:51:41,729
else because you would have gotten paid

3305
02:51:38,909 --> 02:51:43,500
better right and so there's also like

3306
02:51:41,728 --> 02:51:45,239
that kind of cross that lateral

3307
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:47,148
allocation from that capitalism stock

3308
02:51:45,239 --> 02:51:50,039
suffers for that pretty much guarantees

3309
02:51:47,148 --> 02:51:53,309
that anybody who works in certain

3310
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:55,470
sectors even if they are excellent at

3311
02:51:53,309 --> 02:51:58,529
their job either doesn't feel good about

3312
02:51:55,469 --> 02:52:01,289
it cuz society doesn't value them or has

3313
02:51:58,530 --> 02:52:04,890
no incentive to excel even if they could

3314
02:52:01,290 --> 02:52:06,660
have right and so there's a lot of

3315
02:52:04,889 --> 02:52:08,279
problems there too and that was never

3316
02:52:06,659 --> 02:52:10,200
really addressed with capitalism now

3317
02:52:08,280 --> 02:52:11,790
that's there's some good aspects of that

3318
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:14,070
in capital because it means that in

3319
02:52:11,790 --> 02:52:14,729
theory it allocates your quote unquote

3320
02:52:14,069 --> 02:52:17,809
best

3321
02:52:14,728 --> 02:52:23,788
people to the most important place maybe

3322
02:52:17,809 --> 02:52:26,158
but come on now right like it has a

3323
02:52:23,789 --> 02:52:27,838
pretty high cost for doing that you know

3324
02:52:26,158 --> 02:52:30,538
what I'm saying and you end up with

3325
02:52:27,838 --> 02:52:32,908
ridiculous stuff like 3,000 people

3326
02:52:30,539 --> 02:52:35,399
working on the back end for like Twitter

3327
02:52:32,908 --> 02:52:37,168
or something getting huge amounts of

3328
02:52:35,398 --> 02:52:39,568
money when really that could have been

3329
02:52:37,168 --> 02:52:41,459
done by 20 people and what are we

3330
02:52:39,568 --> 02:52:42,958
burning all this money for we could have

3331
02:52:41,459 --> 02:52:45,229
paid all the janitors a lot of money and

3332
02:52:42,959 --> 02:52:50,969
gotten really awesome janitors

3333
02:52:45,228 --> 02:52:53,488
really awesome janitor right so there's

3334
02:52:50,968 --> 02:52:55,438
a problem with the societal value of

3335
02:52:53,488 --> 02:52:57,568
things and so when I think about

3336
02:52:55,439 --> 02:52:59,158
excellence I'm thinking everybody in

3337
02:52:57,568 --> 02:53:01,259
every position should be driven to be

3338
02:52:59,158 --> 02:53:02,850
excellent at what they do and we

3339
02:53:01,259 --> 02:53:06,509
definitely haven't developed a system

3340
02:53:02,850 --> 02:53:08,939
that makes that work we place a much

3341
02:53:06,509 --> 02:53:11,998
higher premium on which job you're doing

3342
02:53:08,939 --> 02:53:14,668
than how well you're doing it a super

3343
02:53:11,998 --> 02:53:17,100
crappy doctor makes way more money than

3344
02:53:14,668 --> 02:53:20,039
the world's best janitor and to me

3345
02:53:17,100 --> 02:53:21,988
that's not right to me that yields a

3346
02:53:20,039 --> 02:53:25,939
worse world outcome than what I would

3347
02:53:21,988 --> 02:53:28,078
have preferred right and so again like

3348
02:53:25,939 --> 02:53:29,248
and and you know obviously like

3349
02:53:28,078 --> 02:53:30,298
everything faction in this I it's not

3350
02:53:29,248 --> 02:53:30,930
just recognized system it's your

3351
02:53:30,299 --> 02:53:32,759
religion

3352
02:53:30,930 --> 02:53:34,709
it's your schooling like everything

3353
02:53:32,759 --> 02:53:37,139
plays a part in reinforcing the culture

3354
02:53:34,709 --> 02:53:39,959
of excellence we don't have it I don't

3355
02:53:37,139 --> 02:53:43,108
know why I don't know how to fix it it's

3356
02:53:39,959 --> 02:53:46,020
just sad that's all you know it's

3357
02:53:43,109 --> 02:53:48,709
nobody's fault just we haven't come up

3358
02:53:46,020 --> 02:53:48,709
with a better system

3359
02:53:51,978 --> 02:53:55,619
and yeah like I said capitalism versus

3360
02:53:54,420 --> 02:53:58,469
social number things like that they're

3361
02:53:55,620 --> 02:54:01,680
their small arguments they're arguments

3362
02:53:58,469 --> 02:54:04,228
of us eNOS if you have a small outlook

3363
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:06,238
on the world it's you saying there's

3364
02:54:04,228 --> 02:54:08,698
nothing better than what has already

3365
02:54:06,238 --> 02:54:10,799
been tried right and and I don't

3366
02:54:08,699 --> 02:54:13,199
fundamentally believe that like I

3367
02:54:10,799 --> 02:54:16,619
believe we can do better than capitalism

3368
02:54:13,199 --> 02:54:17,010
and socialism and a combination of the

3369
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:19,590
two

3370
02:54:17,010 --> 02:54:21,329
like I think we have to I think we can

3371
02:54:19,590 --> 02:54:22,738
do better than what we're doing but of

3372
02:54:21,329 --> 02:54:24,870
course that's my nature like right like

3373
02:54:22,738 --> 02:54:28,920
seeing that things are probably not as

3374
02:54:24,870 --> 02:54:30,840
good because you know if they were if if

3375
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:32,520
they were actually optimal we would have

3376
02:54:30,840 --> 02:54:35,520
been living with them for hundreds of

3377
02:54:32,520 --> 02:54:42,870
thousands of years not not thousands

3378
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:44,250
right all right I'm gonna this has been

3379
02:54:42,870 --> 02:54:45,779
a very long and ridiculously

3380
02:54:44,250 --> 02:54:47,159
philosophical stream where you know

3381
02:54:45,779 --> 02:54:49,290
what's the point is what I say right

3382
02:54:47,159 --> 02:54:51,139
like I mean I don't have any answer so I

3383
02:54:49,290 --> 02:54:53,460
just not sure what the point is of

3384
02:54:51,139 --> 02:54:55,379
talking about it it's outside my field

3385
02:54:53,459 --> 02:54:57,478
of expertise and I don't have anything

3386
02:54:55,379 --> 02:54:58,920
to suggest other than to tell you that

3387
02:54:57,478 --> 02:55:00,358
I'm depressed about it and I'm not sure

3388
02:54:58,920 --> 02:55:04,770
what good it does to let everyone know

3389
02:55:00,359 --> 02:55:07,380
that I'm depressed about it right unless

3390
02:55:04,770 --> 02:55:08,460
you all want to be depressed - all right

3391
02:55:07,379 --> 02:55:09,568
thank you everyone for joining me for

3392
02:55:08,459 --> 02:55:11,309
that sort of handmade here out so a

3393
02:55:09,568 --> 02:55:13,469
pleasure coding with you as always if

3394
02:55:11,309 --> 02:55:15,209
you would like to pre-order the game on

3395
02:55:13,469 --> 02:55:16,469
handmade hair org I should say if you

3396
02:55:15,209 --> 02:55:18,629
would like to follow the source code you

3397
02:55:16,469 --> 02:55:20,129
can pare the game of hand here at org

3398
02:55:18,629 --> 02:55:22,049
and it comes with source code so you can

3399
02:55:20,129 --> 02:55:24,358
follow with it on your machine I don't

3400
02:55:22,049 --> 02:55:28,948
have any answer as to how you make the

3401
02:55:24,359 --> 02:55:30,870
world try to strive for bigger and

3402
02:55:28,949 --> 02:55:32,310
better accomplishments but I do have a

3403
02:55:30,870 --> 02:55:35,489
way for you to get the source code and

3404
02:55:32,309 --> 02:55:36,930
and that is it and then hey you can take

3405
02:55:35,488 --> 02:55:38,430
my source code and strive for bigger and

3406
02:55:36,930 --> 02:55:40,590
better accomplishments there is not a

3407
02:55:38,430 --> 02:55:41,639
single piece of handmade hero that I

3408
02:55:40,590 --> 02:55:44,159
don't think could be done better than

3409
02:55:41,639 --> 02:55:46,318
we're doing it right now and so have at

3410
02:55:44,159 --> 02:55:48,500
it man there is always something to

3411
02:55:46,318 --> 02:55:52,829
improve and pretty much everything

3412
02:55:48,500 --> 02:55:55,738
except the few very small very specific

3413
02:55:52,829 --> 02:55:57,270
pieces of things and so you know maybe

3414
02:55:55,738 --> 02:55:58,978
you can get a little bit of a drive to

3415
02:55:57,270 --> 02:56:00,600
excellence going find something in

3416
02:55:58,978 --> 02:56:02,670
handmade hero that currently sucks and

3417
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:04,590
make it good I guarantee you there's

3418
02:56:02,670 --> 02:56:07,109
tons of parts you can do that with

3419
02:56:04,590 --> 02:56:09,030
you mentioned them all the time so you

3420
02:56:07,109 --> 02:56:11,069
know give it a shot

3421
02:56:09,030 --> 02:56:12,720
I'll be back here probably next week I

3422
02:56:11,069 --> 02:56:14,069
haven't put schedule yet oh wait no

3423
02:56:12,719 --> 02:56:15,389
that's not true I'll probably off next

3424
02:56:14,069 --> 02:56:19,350
week so I'll probably be back here in

3425
02:56:15,389 --> 02:56:21,478
two weeks when we will try to take the

3426
02:56:19,350 --> 02:56:24,059
ray-tracing core and start implementing

3427
02:56:21,478 --> 02:56:25,619
that across light probes which will then

3428
02:56:24,059 --> 02:56:27,148
distribute out to our lighting voxel and

3429
02:56:25,620 --> 02:56:28,890
I think that's kind of the last step in

3430
02:56:27,148 --> 02:56:30,569
the process before we're into tuning

3431
02:56:28,889 --> 02:56:32,728
mode really excited about that and

3432
02:56:30,569 --> 02:56:35,639
hopefully we can come up with good ways

3433
02:56:32,728 --> 02:56:37,379
of mapping those things so we can yeah

3434
02:56:35,639 --> 02:56:39,750
so we can have some really really really

3435
02:56:37,379 --> 02:56:41,339
good lighting which you know again I

3436
02:56:39,750 --> 02:56:44,219
want plugin to be excellent because I

3437
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:45,420
want everything excellent if I can hope

3438
02:56:44,219 --> 02:56:46,709
see you back here for that in about two

3439
02:56:45,420 --> 02:56:49,409
weeks sorry I won't be here next week

3440
02:56:46,709 --> 02:56:51,929

3441
02:56:49,409 --> 02:56:53,159
