1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
and start recording hello everyone and

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,949
welcome to handmade hero the show recode

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:14,580
a complete game live on stream we have

4
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:16,829
well yesterday we sort of added doing

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,850
sort of a fog blend versus alpha

6
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:22,679
blending and we're sort of doing part of

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,050
our render or Z clean up right now and

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,679
what I wanted to do is I want it to go

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,589
in today I think and actually make sort

10
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,229
of slices a first class citizen so

11
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:37,380
that's the really big change that needs

12
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:39,089
to happen and you know it's it's going

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,410
to take a little bit of work and I think

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,800
today would be the right day to get

15
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:45,538
started on that we kind of you know

16
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,009
we're kind of all set up for it now we

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,308
just have to cut go in there and

18
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:54,119
actually get it done here's the day

19
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:56,578
today is 297 so use 296 source code if

20
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:01,108
you want to follow along at home in the

21
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:05,280
meantime I'm going to load up that sweet

22
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,978
sweet project here it is all right so

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,329
I'm going to run the game as it stands

24
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:13,200
currently so you can kind of see where

25
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:15,599
we're at and so we did this test where

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,379
we place the tiles that kind of fade out

27
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,478
up into the distance right and we we

28
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,679
sort of did this testing and you can

29
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:24,509
kind of see that we have some z's

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,670
sorting problems there of the kind that

31
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,180
I discussed yesterday but then we also

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,509
have some issues where for example right

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,159
now we're not treating these slices of

34
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,769
separate things all objects are kind of

35
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,210
being fed in uniformly and so we get

36
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:45,719
some problems such as if I am to go do

37
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:52,109
the Alpha fade out so for example like

38
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:54,840
here see right it's kind of a

39
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:57,750
little bit tricky to see because there's

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,840
not a lot of it going on but any

41
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,530
overlapping objects that we have alpha

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,469
fade out together separately right so

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,979
basically like if you look what we would

44
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:13,030
want to have happen here and I can slow

45
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,280
this down

46
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,180
oh you know what we have a thing for us

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,590
I can slow this transition down

48
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,230
considerably to show you what I'm

49
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,539
talking about so let's say we throw it

50
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:28,060
slow it down to ten percent of its

51
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:32,318
original speed right so i can see

52
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:36,099
everyone is moving very slowly so take a

53
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:39,849
look right here at Monstar torso who's

54
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:42,609
hopping around as i hopped down to the

55
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:46,359
level below take a look at what happens

56
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,400
to him and to the thing below him right

57
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,230
and we've talked about this before by

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,310
just want refresh your memory do you see

59
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:57,280
how he fades out in addition to the tile

60
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:01,269
fading out and you can see the tile

61
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:05,199
behind him while he's fading out right

62
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:07,569
and that's not really what we want we

63
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,509
don't want the objects that are sitting

64
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:12,699
on tiles above us to fade out as well as

65
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:15,159
the tiles fade out in sort of a separate

66
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:19,209
per object fade what we want is that

67
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:22,239
whole coherent image that whole piece to

68
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:25,299
fade out as one image so it still looks

69
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,129
like a coherent thing that we're just

70
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:32,739
sort of moving through it's becoming

71
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:36,579
more ethereal as a whole right so that

72
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:38,400
is what I want to get to and we have

73
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:40,570
another issue that we need to address

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,060
coming down the pipe a little later on

75
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:44,620
which is lighting that we did some work

76
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,680
on earlier and we'll do a little bit

77
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,109
more work on before we're done and that

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,760
also wants to have an understanding of

79
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:54,370
these slices because our lighting is

80
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,500
going to be very much US based on an

81
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,730
understanding of a 2d slice and how the

82
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:04,090
light in it is working right so we need

83
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:07,298
this this understanding of the slices

84
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,969
and I want to start putting information

85
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:13,590
into the renderer so that it can decide

86
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:16,478
to render each slice as a separate thing

87
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,410
and in order to do that we need some

88
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:23,649
kind of communication regarding that now

89
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:26,800
I have an idea about how we might do

90
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:28,719
this and it's a little while

91
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,949
ki but I'm just going to throw it out

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,819
there and you'd see what you think my

93
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:40,330
idea was we already have the notion of a

94
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:43,810
clip wrecked and so I was thinking why

95
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:47,800
not have clip Rex have the information

96
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,629
on them about slices since every entry

97
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,360
knows that it goes with a particular

98
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:58,210
clip wrecked it seems only fitting that

99
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,598
we go ahead and throw all of our

100
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:03,878
information about what goes into a slice

101
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:06,968
into the clip wrecked that way we just

102
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:08,889
set up a series of clip Rex one for each

103
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:10,899
slice which don't actually do any

104
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,418
additional clipping right they can all

105
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:17,198
have the same clip rectangle but each

106
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:19,029
one of those would have with it in the

107
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,189
the information about what to do with

108
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:25,269
that slice like should it be fog should

109
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:28,000
it be faded what order should it be

110
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:32,288
drawing anything we want to do like that

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,778
right so that seems to me like a pretty

112
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:37,718
reasonable thing to do I don't know

113
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:40,629
that's just my gut instinct and so I'm

114
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:42,848
you know just thinking that would be the

115
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:45,339
easiest way to go because if we don't do

116
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:48,000
that we would need to introduce a sec

117
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:53,859
like a separate concept really right

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,718
that's about these Z slices and yet you

119
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,080
know because we need to be able to

120
00:05:55,718 --> 00:06:01,389
gather things up into these slices and

121
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:04,658
draw the slices as separate things

122
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:08,050
because if we didn't do that then what

123
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:13,509
would happen is that when we do our

124
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:15,848
rendering we couldn't do stuff like put

125
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,229
them in a render buffer by themselves so

126
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:20,439
that they could be alpha faded out

127
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:22,329
separately the other thing that I'm what

128
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,848
the other thing we could do as another

129
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:27,459
potential option is to duplicate the

130
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:29,500
render group right so we could have

131
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:33,008
multiple render groups one for each

132
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,259
slice and just you know sort of render

133
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:38,680
render render render and put the slices

134
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:40,560
in sort of separately I don't know if

135
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,750
that's a particularly good idea

136
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,660
but that's another thing we could do

137
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:49,139
right and I don't know which of these is

138
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,060
the smartest thing I I really don't and

139
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,069
so we should just sort of take a look

140
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,730
and see what's going to be involved each

141
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:58,349
of them or you know maybe there's a sort

142
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:02,540
of a thing that's separate from all of

143
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:05,790
those that we want to do as well alright

144
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:09,180
so we already know some information

145
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:12,840
about how these things should be moved

146
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:16,228
into slices potentially right and that

147
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:22,019
is we know the Z sort of taught the the

148
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:26,879
Z packing address of each of our of each

149
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:29,430
individual entity right and at the

150
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,728
moment we have a little bit of an odd

151
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,949
pneus in that those I I don't know that

152
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:38,219
those are particularly aligned to

153
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:40,168
Flora's exactly yet and that is a little

154
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,300
bit of an issue like we don't have a

155
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:47,939
solid of an idea of what it means to be

156
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,860
on this floor or that floor right we

157
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,089
just sort of have a 3d spatial query

158
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,340
that allows you to place things

159
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:55,978
arbitrarily in 3d so even though it's a

160
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,819
2-d game right it's actually free to

161
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:02,099
kind of place things arbitrarily in 3d

162
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:04,620
so the question is you know how do we

163
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,080
start by even knowing what sliced

164
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,050
something's in and it seems to me that

165
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,550
you know when we're we kind of want

166
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,870
those slices to be represented in the

167
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,689
world storage since we know that the

168
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,090
world is evenly sliced up into them so

169
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:23,459
it seems to me that we could easily say

170
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:25,859
that whatever our sort of packing

171
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:27,599
tranche is going to be that would be a

172
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,280
good indication of where we should get

173
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,190
drawn or which slice we should get drawn

174
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,620
in now it's a little tricky because we

175
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,900
haven't typically after you know when we

176
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,879
when we go to do our rendering we

177
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:42,269
haven't typically figured out where a

178
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:46,439
particular entity is going to be packed

179
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:48,419
right but we certainly could meaning

180
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,600
after we do our move entity call we

181
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:54,389
could do the the packing here where we

182
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,210
say okay let's determine

183
00:08:54,389 --> 00:09:01,139
we're in packing space you would be

184
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:03,990
right similarly we could also just take

185
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:08,009
just that z value and figure out what

186
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:10,049
that Z value implies because we only

187
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:12,210
need to really do basically a flooring

188
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,490
operation on Z and then we could assume

189
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:19,170
that you were in that tranch just from

190
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:21,840
that piece of information right so if we

191
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:23,519
have that piece of information then we

192
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,920
should be able to assign numbers to

193
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,350
these things and I feel like we just

194
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,620
wanted to sign numbers in a very

195
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,420
straightforward ways such as 0 is the

196
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,679
floor that the player is looking at

197
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:40,889
right and then negative numbers go down

198
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,589
floors so floors that are you know two

199
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:46,649
floors behind below us is floor negative

200
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:50,009
2 and floors that are above us would be

201
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:52,529
for like 1 2 3 4 and really we only

202
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:55,019
track one floor above us before it alpha

203
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:57,209
fades out so we really only need to

204
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,309
worry about there's floor one is the one

205
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,800
above us that's alpha fading out there's

206
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:04,049
40 which is the one we're on and there's

207
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,909
floral ex- one two three four that we

208
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:08,669
can kind of see off below us in the

209
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:15,600
distance if we look down any kind of

210
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:18,929
holes in the floor so if I if I want to

211
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,879
go that route then here in the entity

212
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:24,209
transform right I've already got this

213
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:26,490
notion of the offset p which has a

214
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,450
z-value baked into it right I can also

215
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:32,970
say okay well you know entity transforms

216
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:35,550
can certainly also have that notion of

217
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,500
what the floor is right so I could have

218
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:39,809
something like you know a slice index in

219
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,120
here and the slice index could get set

220
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:44,789
now similarly you know we've got this

221
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,679
u16 here that's a type I could easily

222
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:52,559
slip that into a you ate for the type

223
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:54,899
right something like this where wherever

224
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:58,409
you wait for the type and I have a you

225
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:01,110
wait for the slice index and that way we

226
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:02,850
can you know sort of keep again that

227
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,519
header to be very minimal if we want to

228
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,899
be it's still only 32 bytes long but it

229
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,919
would store which clip wrecked we were

230
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,958
using in which

231
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:14,309
slice index are using so if we want to

232
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:17,489
we could assign the slices i purely

233
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:19,379
without the clip Rex at all right and we

234
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,019
could have them be a separate thing the

235
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:24,448
other option like i said before would be

236
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:27,149
to go and do it more this way where we

237
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:30,389
say all right inside the render entry

238
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:32,698
clip wrecked that itself would have the

239
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:34,709
information about like the global color

240
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:38,870
and all those sorts of things right and

241
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:46,518
it would have what its slice index was

242
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:49,828
right yeah so something like this and

243
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,470
you know that that clip record also keep

244
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:55,979
in in it the information that this is a

245
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:58,079
proper slice it wants to be rendered as

246
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,089
a separate piece and then composited in

247
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:06,719
potentially blah blah blah blah blah

248
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:08,459
okay so yeah so who knows where we're

249
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,509
going to pack that if we wanted to do

250
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:16,078
something like where we would have the

251
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:19,019
clip Rex be that piece of information

252
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,448
then what we would do at the outset is

253
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,820
we would figure out how many things deep

254
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:28,828
we want to draw and we would just create

255
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:30,390
that many clip Rex so if we look at the

256
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:33,208
clip wreck that we've got here you can

257
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:36,120
see well that's not the one I'm talking

258
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:37,768
about risk my clip wrecked so I guess I

259
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,940
guess we're just using the default clip

260
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:42,600
wrecked at the moment in fact we're not

261
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,740
even assigning any clip Rex so yep so

262
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,079
this would be the first time we'd be

263
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,490
doing it but at the top we would just

264
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,899
say all right how many of these are we

265
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,000
going to do how many clip Rex are we

266
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:55,230
going to have and that's what we would

267
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:01,698
make so let's take a look at what that

268
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,699
would look like so what wrecked

269
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:10,740
so here is our push clip rock so up here

270
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:13,320
at the top before well I don't even know

271
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,730
before I guess it could be after that we

272
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,350
would do something where we'd say okay

273
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:22,350
how many of these clip Rex do we want to

274
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:25,610
have and we would push them all on onto

275
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,610
the render group that we're working with

276
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:33,269
and each one of these would get stored

277
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:36,659
in some array that we could look up into

278
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:39,000
later right so we'd say something like

279
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:41,149
okay there's our cliff Brecht indices

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,629
clip brick index or something like this

281
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:51,120
and each clip wrecked index is going to

282
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:54,059
be based on the maximum number of levels

283
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,169
we want to draw right so we'd say

284
00:13:54,059 --> 00:14:01,889
something like I don't know minimum

285
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:04,679
level index and maybe the minimal level

286
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:09,750
indexes for and the maximum level index

287
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:11,909
is one look I sang before and so if we

288
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:15,679
wanted to know how many of these slices

289
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:19,769
we would need right we'd have the

290
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:21,719
maximum or you know total level index is

291
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:26,000
going to be the maximum level index

292
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,050
minus the minimum level index right and

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,269
so then we'd have something like this

294
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:32,009
now of course I'm not allowed to use

295
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:36,090
that value even though the compiler

296
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:38,669
could trivially tell that it's known at

297
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:40,800
compile time I would have to put a

298
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,829
concert why you would have to put a

299
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,870
Const to specify that an obviously

300
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,660
constant value is constant I have no

301
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:52,919
idea that's just the minds of the C++

302
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:56,279
people they are unfathomable to a normal

303
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:59,339
programmer certainly but I could do this

304
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:03,240
or something similar if I wanted to

305
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:08,460
right and that would give me the correct

306
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,799
information so oak like I said you need

307
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,420
to do plus one

308
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,429
so that's how many levels we would need

309
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,379
and so if we want to initialize those

310
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:19,409
levels right we can just say like level

311
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:25,470
index equals zero level index is less

312
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:26,879
than however many there were in here and

313
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,350
you'll notice that I could have used

314
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,539
total level index but I don't really

315
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,920
want to in fact I might even say let's

316
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:36,899
do that because I don't really want to i

317
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,120
always like to just refer to the actual

318
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:41,819
thing I'm iterating if possible rather

319
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,029
than use the constant that I know it was

320
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:48,030
set to so I think it just it it reduces

321
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:49,589
the possibility for error so if I loop

322
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,329
through each of these level indices I

323
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:55,519
could then say like oh let's get a clip

324
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:58,590
direct index for each of these levels

325
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,019
and what I'm going to push on here for

326
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:04,100
the the 0 Y and then width and the

327
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:08,129
height is just whatever we started our

328
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,870
our render group doing right so we're

329
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:12,899
getting a render group passed into us

330
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,490
obviously but when we do our perspective

331
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,879
you know we know the draw buffer width

332
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,560
and height so we pretty much know what

333
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,759
the clip region is going to be for this

334
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:26,189
thing it's going to be passed in

335
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,740
directly as as that width height and

336
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:35,010
we're not because we're not sub clipping

337
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:37,589
it at all so we would just generate that

338
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:41,370
miniclip regions and then we would just

339
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:45,330
set each of our clip Rex to be whenever

340
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:47,820
we're sort of rendering any individual

341
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:51,470
entity we would just make sure that the

342
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:54,390
clip wreck that we were going to use is

343
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:57,480
is the one that corresponds to the slice

344
00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:01,319
that entity goes into so you can see

345
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,990
that we have the clip wrecked here the

346
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,390
current clip wrecked index and right now

347
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:11,039
if I remember correctly current clip

348
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:13,140
wrecked index we just set that directly

349
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,659
right so current clip wreck index is

350
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:20,040
just something reset so we would say

351
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:22,699
like okay the render group current clip

352
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,699
wrecked index

353
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,019
we just save whatever that was and then

354
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,609
later we would restore it and that's

355
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:39,379
probably something we should have a

356
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:52,398
utility for and I don't know that we do

357
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:52,399
I don't see one do you I don't see one

358
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:57,000
so I'm just going to say okay let's make

359
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:59,639
one so we don't do this all over the

360
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,349
place for no reason anytime we need to

361
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,830
put your clip rep we could use this so

362
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:09,990
we could say like a temporary clip

363
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:15,058
wrecked or something like this or click

364
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:17,490
direct restore I don't know what it

365
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:24,928
should be called I don't really care

366
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:26,548
what it's called but here we have a

367
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:28,250
constructor and destructor pair for it

368
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:31,908
and we'll just say that okay this thing

369
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,909
stores the render group

370
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,440
and we're just going to do exactly this

371
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:56,839
so there's that old flip wrecked we save

372
00:18:50,789 --> 00:19:05,519
it maybe you know what i'll call it

373
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:12,720
transient flip correct that seems

374
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:16,379
reasonable so here's what would happen

375
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,660
on transient clip entry we would take a

376
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:23,100
new clip wrecked index and that new clip

377
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:28,440
repped index is what we would set and

378
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:31,019
then when we close will reset it and of

379
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:38,820
course because you can't refer to outer

380
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:44,609
scopes again the majesty of c++ i have

381
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:48,210
to copy this in for no reason it's

382
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:50,009
fabulous isn't it anyway so here we go

383
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:56,069
we'll just say there's a transient clip

384
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:57,750
wrecked and we can also say here that if

385
00:19:56,069 --> 00:20:00,210
you don't specify anything then all it's

386
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,789
doing essentially is saving whatever the

387
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,460
clip wrecked was and it's assuming

388
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:08,700
you're going to set it in here to

389
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,529
whatever you want to set it to right and

390
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,900
in fact we could even do something a

391
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:18,349
little bit snappier here not a real word

392
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:22,580
where we say oh yeah if you wanted to

393
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:27,990
you could just do the exact same thing

394
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:32,329
right but make it so that you don't ever

395
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:36,710
actually execute that override right

396
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:36,710
don't ask me why I put team next there

397
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,509
make sense so here I can just say well

398
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:47,329
I'm going to make a transient clip

399
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:49,849
wrecked it's going to restore the old to

400
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:53,658
pick for me so now i can kind of you

401
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:58,428
know with reckless abandon i can go in

402
00:20:53,659 --> 00:21:00,860
and say oh let's just let's just assign

403
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:02,538
whatever clip brecht we want to whomever

404
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:05,719
we want and so what i could do here is

405
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:08,658
say well alright temporarily let's just

406
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,419
see if this works at all by picking

407
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:18,278
three different clip wrecks up here

408
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:18,278
alright so I'll do clip wrecked zero

409
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,450
printer group alright collecting next I

410
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:36,230
will just say ok there's clip bricks

411
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,119
there's a clip wrecked one what are

412
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:43,399
these called is a clip back to index or

413
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:48,168
click click right click something clip

414
00:21:43,398 --> 00:21:51,579
clip clip clip rectangle x yeah so I can

415
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:51,580
just say ok there's clip acting necks

416
00:21:53,259 --> 00:22:05,339
and each of these will go into a

417
00:21:56,538 --> 00:22:15,990
different one right ok

418
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:21,569
sup oops we need to pass the render

419
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:24,120
project so in this particular case right

420
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:25,379
we come into the trip we come into the

421
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,389
stranding typically will save the old

422
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,510
one for us so that anyone who's on the

423
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:32,370
outside of this will have the clip

424
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:33,750
breakfast toward which is you know

425
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:39,000
something we would obviously want to

426
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:42,509
have happen and you know in order to

427
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,609
make this work I need to make sure that

428
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:47,009
there's nothing here that needs that

429
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:49,339
clip wrecked so this is kind of

430
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:53,299
something that probably wants to be part

431
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:57,179
you know of of this sort of entire

432
00:22:53,299 --> 00:23:03,049
render operation right meaning this

433
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:06,240
block is where this wants to happen

434
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:11,039
since simulate entities is relatively

435
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,509
heavy weight here as well and you know

436
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,879
we go through those and do this the

437
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:18,329
simulation render kind of a thing in a

438
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,370
in one batch air that I think probably

439
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:24,539
wants to be broken out to a new function

440
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:27,799
now that's just my my gut feeling so I'm

441
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,799
going to go ahead and move that here

442
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,700
that's going to take a bunch of

443
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,548
parameters so we're going to have to

444
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:47,250
figure out what all those are and so I'm

445
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:54,778
going to go ahead and just call that

446
00:23:47,250 --> 00:24:04,769
here update and render entities and grab

447
00:23:54,778 --> 00:24:06,269
all this stuff okay so you know first

448
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:14,250
things first obviously we're going to

449
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:19,859
need a render group we're going to need

450
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:23,339
sim region probably need a lot else time

451
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:34,878
function we're going to need the camera

452
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:34,878
key is that so where is the canopy

453
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:50,240
so just who does anyone actually use

454
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:53,180
this piece of information anywhere so

455
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,880
sort of is the answer it gets used by

456
00:24:53,180 --> 00:25:01,370
this dude here so i guess for now we

457
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:05,210
could say let's pass it fade top starts

458
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:09,349
z so those guys i guess are specified in

459
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:22,429
the world mode somewhere else slicked up

460
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:29,079
in here world mode i think that is

461
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:31,550
actually called like game mode world and

462
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:33,859
then these clip Rex can be generated in

463
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:39,019
here for now we might want to move them

464
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:40,459
out later but we'll see for now we can

465
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:43,190
actually just us in here while we get

466
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:50,390
this working so here's that clip rekt

467
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:51,920
information and then of course we need

468
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,880
that draw buffer width and height now

469
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,470
actually I suppose technically we don't

470
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,170
because we could just say that we want

471
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:04,429
to clone the existing clip wrecked that

472
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:05,570
we were using right and that's kind of

473
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,660
something that we would like to have

474
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:13,939
happen anyway so if you take a look at

475
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:16,130
current clip rekt index that is actually

476
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,600
something that in the game render

477
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:23,920
commands we could look up what that

478
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:30,009
actual clip rekt was and push it right

479
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:30,009
so in platform

480
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:40,220
you can see in here that we've kind of

481
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:43,590
got this array of clip Rex right and I

482
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:46,019
assume that that hasn't been filled out

483
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:49,619
yet and that that will only get filled

484
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:52,710
out later but maybe that's not true like

485
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:57,089
I said I don't really remember how that

486
00:26:52,710 --> 00:27:01,079
code was going does it know what the

487
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:03,619
clip rekt is normally ooh I'll down

488
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:09,869
three key there let's find out let's

489
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:19,439
find out so let's say I do a push clip

490
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:22,759
group clip right push clip rep says okay

491
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,620
here's the commands we're going to push

492
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:30,079
when I here and we daisy chain them

493
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:30,079
looks like right

494
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:41,410
you can see the like first wreck last

495
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:48,670
wrecked so they just get kind of daisy

496
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:51,040
chained daisy chain through so that

497
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:55,200
means it's not really that easy for us

498
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:58,058
if we want to look up a clip wrecked

499
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,220
right we so whatever the current clip

500
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:01,509
wrecked is is actually relatively tricky

501
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,660
for us to look up because we haven't

502
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:06,609
linearized those anywhere right so

503
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:11,230
whatever the current clip wrecked index

504
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:17,949
thing is you know it would probably be

505
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:19,509
who've us to save what they save with

506
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:23,860
that clip wreck was so that we could use

507
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:25,799
it again I don't know that all seems to

508
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:28,569
add up to me to be a little bit too much

509
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:31,000
so I think what I would rather do is

510
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:33,789
just say okay let's go ahead and just

511
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,410
pass this piece of information in so

512
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:39,609
i'll pass the draw buffer and just let

513
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,320
that continue working the way it was

514
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:43,389
working because i don't really want to

515
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:47,259
go down that particular rat hole at the

516
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,910
moment and i feel like there's a lot of

517
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:53,890
stuff we could potentially do there

518
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:58,210
right alright so let's see loaded bitmap

519
00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:01,270
draw buffer so in this case we'll just

520
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,370
pass that in there and then background

521
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:09,250
color is what we cleared to and we do

522
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:13,149
need to know that as well although

523
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:17,009
that'll probably come from a more you

524
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,009
know reasonable place in the future

525
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:24,130
so dt4 frame is already being passed

526
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,480
here it doesn't need to be passed that

527
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:40,990
way and translate assets is definitely

528
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:59,980
necessary draw hit points can be moved

529
00:29:40,990 --> 00:30:01,750
in here as well and mouse the mouse p we

530
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,630
can pass but we're not really using that

531
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:10,179
at the moment that was really a

532
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:23,350
debugging thing right alright so we'll

533
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:24,909
go ahead and pass that here and these

534
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:26,648
are all named exactly the same things as

535
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:29,110
they were named so in theory if we just

536
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:31,739
literally delete the definition of the

537
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:36,099
variable type we've got the right call

538
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:41,890
presumably oops don't know why that's

539
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:45,009
still there all right so now in theory

540
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:48,149
we're actually we are actually doing

541
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:50,829
that clipping and we could test this

542
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:53,439
potentially as well by actually

543
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:55,778
shrinking one of the clip Rex so for

544
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:05,070
example if we go into the bush clip

545
00:30:55,778 --> 00:31:05,069
wrecked stuff in entity now see here

546
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:11,960
we could choose to say well all right

547
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:14,899
you know here's the code for the normal

548
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,269
one but if you're on the zeroeth level

549
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,430
which is actually in this case because

550
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:22,660
we're going you know it's it's negative

551
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:27,410
4 negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1

552
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:30,950
right it's actually going to be the

553
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:36,590
maximum level index minus the minimum

554
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:41,049
level index right it's kind of really

555
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:47,599
think about it it's actually going to be

556
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:52,309
this right it's going to be this minus 1

557
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:55,369
because it's going to be this span which

558
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:57,799
is like I want to be the maximum but I

559
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:59,149
want to be back by one another way to

560
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:00,879
think of it would just be you know we

561
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,590
could actually even just hard code it

562
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:09,470
where we just say like okay so these

563
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:11,809
correspond this way well the night I

564
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:13,910
think about it we were kind of at the

565
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,440
moment we're shoving them in this way so

566
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,730
I should probably use this temporarily

567
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,580
since that's what we actually care about

568
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:23,150
so here is the the default is to that's

569
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:25,399
stuff that's completely in view so I'm

570
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:31,220
just going to say like if level index

571
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:34,550
equals to do one thing otherwise do the

572
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,839
other so here you know when we've got

573
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:39,230
the width I'm just going to say like

574
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:42,409
okay just let's let's pretend that we

575
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:46,089
only had half the screen and since this

576
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:46,090
one since we'll just divide by two

577
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,720
and so now we should get a thing where

578
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:57,579
yeah you can kind of see we're entirely

579
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:00,860
clipped to that lower part of the screen

580
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:02,720
but because we're only doing it to one

581
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:06,589
you can see the layer above us doesn't

582
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,288
have that restriction right so if I take

583
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:12,288
it back you can even make this a little

584
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:14,950
bit more explicit so if I kind of come

585
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:14,950
up here oops

586
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:28,939
if I jump up to a level where things

587
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:34,639
start to fog fade those wouldn't be

588
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:38,529
clipped either I know why I continue

589
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,530
jumping there it was not smart

590
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:53,450
there we go so those guys are starting

591
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,690
to fog fog fade out so if i restore that

592
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,460
clipping you can now see like nothing

593
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,960
gets clipped that's on the fogging out

594
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,240
layers nothing gets clipped it's on the

595
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,250
Alpha layers but that mid ground stuff

596
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,940
is clipped so we do know that these are

597
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:10,039
sorting into the correct buckets now if

598
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,289
we were just bucketing based on whether

599
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:17,570
or not you were going to get fogged

600
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:18,889
right alright so now we have to kind of

601
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,380
think this through a little bit more

602
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:23,359
carefully right now we have to actually

603
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,010
start assigning floor numbers to these

604
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,289
things and obviously we don't actually

605
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,580
want to do any kind of different

606
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:33,199
clipping we want the clipping to stay

607
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:34,969
the same but this information here where

608
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,969
we sort of have the camera relative

609
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:41,119
ground PZ and all that stuff that

610
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:45,319
information now kind of wants to be with

611
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:49,009
the clip wrecked right or you know if

612
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,409
again or if we create a non clip rec

613
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:55,490
thing for storing it it wants to be with

614
00:34:51,409 --> 00:35:02,210
whatever that other thing is so we want

615
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:06,109
to say something like camera relative

616
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:10,360
ground p is now going to be computed per

617
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:12,620
level right / like individual slice and

618
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,269
in order to figure out where those

619
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:15,920
slices are we're going to start to need

620
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:20,289
to be more rigorous about the rules

621
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:23,840
about where a slices in the Z range

622
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:27,500
right so let's pause for a second and

623
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:31,519
just if0 this out and just make sure

624
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:34,010
that no one cares right what that value

625
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,150
is and they don't right so if we run it

626
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,920
now everyone just going through the

627
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,420
default clip wrecked and you can also

628
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,030
see that of course we've got the issue

629
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,639
of if we aren't going to run through

630
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:49,870
that then nobody gets alpha blended out

631
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:54,579
at all right so there's that

632
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:56,230
so coming back to this let's say that we

633
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:57,789
wanted to do this computation but we

634
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:00,099
want to do this computation per level

635
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:02,079
index well then what we would need is we

636
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:05,739
would still need to know what the camera

637
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,929
relative ground point is right so we

638
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:14,049
would need to know camera relative

639
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:15,549
ground Z and that's not something we

640
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:20,890
really would know how to compute just

641
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:23,110
yet that's okay we can figure it out and

642
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:25,509
what we would do here is just use

643
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:30,550
exactly the same logic that we were

644
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:32,920
using before but now instead of setting

645
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:35,140
it per item we would just set it per

646
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,820
clip wrecked and then whatever clip

647
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:39,129
rector you went into that would be what

648
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:42,460
would determine what was going on right

649
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,960
so when we do push clip wrecked here we

650
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,809
would now be able to specify this

651
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,240
additional color info and maybe we would

652
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:51,579
call this like you know this year would

653
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:54,129
be like a clip wrecked blending or

654
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:57,719
something like this or clip clip direct

655
00:36:54,130 --> 00:37:02,380
effects I don't know something like this

656
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:07,000
and that clip rep wrecked effects clip

657
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:11,320
wrecked F X would be the thing that

658
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,510
stores this information so we would

659
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,210
basically say that that global color

660
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:20,490
goes away and we just have a color and a

661
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,490
tee color for the effects the moment

662
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:36,019
and oh and we got to do this one here so

663
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:39,619
and then when we do push clip rekt we

664
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:44,030
would say oh and by the way we want you

665
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:51,200
to use this special effects thing that

666
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:53,480
we set up right so that's really all I'm

667
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,469
thinking and I guess this one doesn't

668
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:03,530
have to be initialized at all it's just

669
00:37:54,469 --> 00:38:06,108
the null effect same with here so that's

670
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,790
really all I'm talking about right this

671
00:38:06,108 --> 00:38:09,829
would be the entirety of it we just have

672
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:11,949
to know with the relative camera see

673
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:14,799
what you know what that was but

674
00:38:11,949 --> 00:38:17,649
otherwise this would all work just fine

675
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,289
provided that we were able to figure out

676
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:23,180
where the entity actually went so what

677
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:26,059
we would have to do here is we have to

678
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:30,019
figure out for any given Z what level

679
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:33,259
index it was actually in right and

680
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:34,699
that's a you know again easier said than

681
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,950
done because we have to do sort of a

682
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:39,379
careful analysis of how to truncate Z

683
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:42,858
values down to the correct sort of

684
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:48,260
bucket if you will but hey nobody said

685
00:38:42,858 --> 00:38:52,819
it was easy so you just gotta just gotta

686
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:55,849
you know bite the bullet okay so for

687
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:58,670
every entity we know what its Z value is

688
00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:00,650
relative to the camera right so we can

689
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,480
still use this part which we're not

690
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,760
using up there anymore you can still use

691
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:11,240
this down here and camera relative

692
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:13,280
ground pz gives us the information that

693
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:17,299
we would need to create those buckets

694
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,640
now what I don't know is why we would

695
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,960
still do it up at the top right because

696
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:23,480
that's the wrong place to do it we

697
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,550
should move the end we can now fix the

698
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,338
bug we had before basically and I think

699
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,320
we even had to do there at one point

700
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:32,449
where what we would like to do is do it

701
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,250
here when we're about to render so that

702
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:38,529
the objects been transformed already

703
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:38,530
right that would be much preferable

704
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:44,719
so here our camera left of ground p get

705
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:46,190
ground point right Kim relative pz is

706
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,109
the information we need we're not gonna

707
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:50,000
set that equal to anything so what i

708
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:52,280
need to do now is figure out what is the

709
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,679
z layer that this thing is in in our

710
00:39:52,280 --> 00:40:00,290
system right so i want to say something

711
00:39:54,679 --> 00:40:01,759
like you know clip rekt index and i

712
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:09,619
probably wanna do something like if get

713
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:11,210
clip rec for something uh although now i

714
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:12,920
think about it i may want to phrase this

715
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:16,670
a little bit differently i may want to

716
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,039
phrase this more like well let's take

717
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:21,619
the camera relative ground PZ and do

718
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:28,599
whatever the truncation thing is or

719
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:38,659
whatever to it so relative layer from

720
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:40,039
kind of a thing right so that would

721
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:41,449
produce one of those numbers negative 4

722
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:45,369
21 or whatever and then we could say

723
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:47,689
well alright if the relative layer is

724
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:49,389
and I don't know I called those levels

725
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:54,010
up at the top and calling the layers now

726
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:59,509
can you tell I can tell I'm overworked

727
00:40:54,010 --> 00:41:02,090
it's true you know it's weird I don't

728
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:05,330
mind being overworked programming wise

729
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:09,410
at all it's really only the stress of

730
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:11,779
not having the time to do things right

731
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:14,420
and worrying about what will happen that

732
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,920
ever really gets to me I kind of really

733
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:21,320
like having lots of programming to do

734
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:24,619
it's very nice probably when I'm a

735
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,780
programmer anyway so yeah I don't even

736
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:28,639
know why I did that it's really just

737
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,100
this that I want I want to say that this

738
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:34,190
thing has to be between those two I

739
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:36,349
don't want to render anything that's not

740
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,750
because if it's not between those two

741
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:41,179
why clog up the renderer why even bother

742
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,599
looking for the bitmaps when we know

743
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:46,730
that they're simply not relevant right

744
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,730
so all of this stuff doesn't have to

745
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:52,789
happen really because it's not on the

746
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:57,829
screen so we can just go ahead and

747
00:41:52,789 --> 00:42:06,329
kind of truncate that part off right

748
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:09,509
yeah so let's go ahead and move to sort

749
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:13,440
of the the money part of this here which

750
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:17,010
is that when we oh hey look the offset p

751
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,829
is already computing this exact value so

752
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:24,750
really all we needed to do here with say

753
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:27,210
well whatever the offset p was that

754
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:31,019
offset pz is the piece of information we

755
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:32,730
actually needed right uh and that's

756
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:38,400
going to need to get broken up into two

757
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:40,829
pieces basically that right because

758
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,410
we're now going to be trying to

759
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:46,909
bifurcate the concept of z into two

760
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:53,489
things one is what slice it goes into

761
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:55,710
and the other is is the Z in that slice

762
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:59,459
and the reason that we need those to be

763
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:01,920
two separate pieces of information is

764
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,070
because one of them is going to displace

765
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:09,180
the object and why but not produce any

766
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:11,880
scaling or perspective artifacts whereas

767
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:14,819
the other one which is what slice it's

768
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,039
in is going to do those things so we

769
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:19,550
need to know that information right we

770
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:23,369
need to have that sort of additional

771
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:27,810
data if you will and so we want to kind

772
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:30,179
of be aware of that so when we do entity

773
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:32,219
transform offset p what we're going to

774
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:37,319
want to do is something probably like

775
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:42,719
this we're probably going to want to say

776
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:47,600
hey here's a z-value i want to get back

777
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:51,569
the relative layer and i want you to

778
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:55,289
take out the layer part and just leave

779
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:59,960
me the remainder you know I'm saying so

780
00:43:55,289 --> 00:43:59,960
we'd say like a you know

781
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:09,190
convert to layer relative something like

782
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,899
that and then when it does that it's

783
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,548
going to give me back the layer in terms

784
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,389
that I understand here and it will

785
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:19,599
update this Z value that it gets passed

786
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:21,670
so that that Z value can then be used as

787
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,019
a proper y offset which is the thing

788
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:26,650
that we really wanted to get to

789
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:27,699
eventually can sort it can you see how

790
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:29,798
this is sort of starting to come

791
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:30,879
together finally right the the you know

792
00:44:29,798 --> 00:44:32,858
because we've had it in there a long

793
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,750
time we were never really sure and now

794
00:44:32,858 --> 00:44:37,358
we kind of finally have a path towards

795
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:39,190
handling Z in a way that I think will be

796
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,500
mostly constructive most of the time

797
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:44,019
which is that we have this notion of

798
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,179
slices which can do the scaling and then

799
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:48,578
we have Z inside the slices that does

800
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:53,108
the displacement and I'm hoping that

801
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:56,680
that will be the best sort of compromise

802
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:59,230
since we're not since our artwork is 2d

803
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:02,318
and we want to and we don't want to do

804
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:04,329
3d stuff because we don't have actual

805
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,308
solid geometry started to back that up

806
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:16,210
right we need everything to be sort of a

807
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:18,910
little faux mmm all right so really

808
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:21,190
that's all we would need because if we

809
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:26,710
had that magic function we could do a

810
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:29,710
lot of good stuff with it and and we

811
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:32,259
would just in here set the current clip

812
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,480
rekt index equal to our clip breath

813
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:36,699
index looked up by that relative layer

814
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,349
right the relative layer needs to be

815
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:39,368
rebased to fit into this array but

816
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:40,960
that's not particularly difficult

817
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:42,608
because we know that if we just subtract

818
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,818
the minimum from it we will get one

819
00:45:42,608 --> 00:45:48,328
that's relatively indexed into it right

820
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:48,329
so that's it

821
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:56,409
not a lot of confusion there so now

822
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:57,640
let's get to the what I said I said it

823
00:45:56,409 --> 00:45:59,259
was going to be tricky obviously that's

824
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:02,170
not tricky the tricky part is in here

825
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:04,960
making sure anytime discrete math rears

826
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,280
its ugly head you know that it's going

827
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,710
to get a little finicky right it's just

828
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,210
going to get a little tweaky because you

829
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,250
got to be rut you got to be just right

830
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:14,079
and whenever you got to be just right

831
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:16,719
it's a lot harder than just having to be

832
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,730
sort of right so here we go there's our

833
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:23,949
convert layer to relative and I think

834
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,539
before we write it we want to start

835
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:29,429
thinking about this part right here

836
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:33,610
which is to say that these floor levels

837
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:35,559
the camera relative ground Z is going to

838
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:38,230
have to have some kind of a notion of

839
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:41,789
where the camera is relative to where

840
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:47,440
the absolute ground slices are right and

841
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:51,429
so what that would actually mean is you

842
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:55,450
gyming if we were to take the cameras

843
00:46:51,429 --> 00:46:57,699
location we would want the cameras

844
00:46:55,449 --> 00:47:03,489
location in world in the actual world

845
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:09,069
space right so if i go into sim region

846
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:12,399
here i think we have the origin in as a

847
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:17,370
world position right now that origin as

848
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,369
a world position tells us

849
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:31,390
two things it has the absolute tiles II

850
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:35,019
and it has the offset from that absolute

851
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:38,949
tiles II right and the camera relative

852
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:41,559
ground Z is just going to be whatever

853
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:44,409
that Z offset is right because the

854
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:48,340
closest ground round tile would it be it

855
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:50,529
offset 0 right so the relative ground Z

856
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:58,210
is going to be displaced by whatever the

857
00:47:50,530 --> 00:48:01,470
offset is it gets like that right all

858
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:04,000
right we gotta go do this part as well

859
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:06,639
but it's going to be displaced by

860
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,440
whatever this offset is and then it's

861
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:12,250
going to be displaced by one entire

862
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:14,440
floor height for every one I go up or

863
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,179
down right so what I'm looking at like

864
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,059
minimum level index or that sort of

865
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:22,029
stuff right if I'm down four levels well

866
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:24,820
that's minus four entire floor heights

867
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,080
so typical floor height for example and

868
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,780
that sort of stuff is what we would want

869
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:42,069
to know here so I'm going to go ahead

870
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:43,930
and look to see ya and you can see that

871
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:46,510
right there that's our world div

872
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:49,599
invaders so basically we can just say

873
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:52,150
well our typical floor height is where

874
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:55,000
we're making these slices at so we would

875
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:57,430
say that the typical floor height is

876
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,849
just going to be multiplied by the floor

877
00:48:57,429 --> 00:48:59,849
index

878
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:11,349
and our relative layer index is you know

879
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:14,019
whatever the level index is it's plus

880
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:19,210
that minimum level index so it starts at

881
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:20,920
negative 4 runs up to 1 and that's how

882
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:26,500
we would know how much typical floor

883
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:29,559
height to add in right so that's pretty

884
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:32,409
straightforward when we do convert to

885
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:37,570
layer relative here we have this notion

886
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:40,349
that the same thing should be happening

887
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:44,140
we want to bucket into the exact same

888
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:48,250
set of possibilities here right and so

889
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:51,460
this is essentially we can do this exact

890
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:55,719
thing using the code we already have in

891
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:58,030
world I believe right so if we want to

892
00:49:55,719 --> 00:50:03,689
we could say like well all right let's

893
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:09,519
just where is that guy let's just use

894
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:12,340
map into chunks face right or something

895
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:15,070
similar we can use that to do the

896
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:21,490
operation that we actually wanted to do

897
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:24,640
right because if we get a z-value that's

898
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:27,609
relative to the camera we know that we

899
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:30,609
could just use the cameras base pose

900
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:33,070
base position and that offset to give us

901
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:35,380
back as e value that's the exact same

902
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:39,280
kind that we were doing here right so it

903
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:43,059
would have it would have an ABS tiles e

904
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,830
right that would tell us what that what

905
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:50,320
that slice should be what that actual

906
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:55,869
index is relative to to the camera that

907
00:50:50,320 --> 00:51:00,820
makes sense so yeah so what I'm saying

908
00:50:55,869 --> 00:51:02,920
is if we were to call this it would give

909
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:05,200
us the the right thing but map in the

910
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,420
trunk space obviously just calls rican

911
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:09,369
annika lies coordinate right and so what

912
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,619
we could say here is well let's just use

913
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:13,239
the Wrekin Annika lies coordinate call

914
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:15,940
directly since we only have to do this

915
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:16,179
on z now we know the chunk dimension

916
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,880
that

917
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:21,308
talking about right it's this typical

918
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,420
floor height and that typical floor

919
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:24,160
height is going to have to be renamed

920
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:25,960
because that's actually a literal thing

921
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:27,969
now that's like how high is one floor

922
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,318
they're always the same so if you wanted

923
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:30,549
to make things that were skipped to

924
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:33,099
floor you could do that but you can't

925
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:35,109
change the floor arbitrarily anymore and

926
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:38,559
the reason for that of course is that

927
00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:41,230
our concept of how we slice things into

928
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:46,300
layers is based entirely on this piece

929
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:50,230
of information right so when we reach a

930
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:58,450
comic canonicalize the coordinates we

931
00:51:50,230 --> 00:52:00,849
need to specify that game world mode and

932
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:02,858
then for our tile and our tile relative

933
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:05,650
well we want to know what we are

934
00:52:02,858 --> 00:52:09,130
relative to where the camera was right

935
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:12,460
and furthermore we kind of want to know

936
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:14,680
here is not just relative to where the

937
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:19,108
camera was but relative to where the

938
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:19,108
floor that we would be looking at was

939
00:52:26,909 --> 00:52:39,879
if that makes sense uh yeah I'm gonna

940
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:47,250
have to think this through a little more

941
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:47,250
carefully but you get the basic idea so

942
00:52:49,800 --> 00:53:03,039
here's the relative index here's the

943
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:06,250
tile relative value we're going to

944
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:14,550
return that relative index and it will

945
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:14,550
truncate the Z value for us right and

946
00:53:15,389 --> 00:53:20,190
only thing I'm not 100% sure about

947
00:53:24,449 --> 00:53:30,639
is whether those two things line up

948
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:31,750
exactly but no matter we'll tackle that

949
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,239
in a second because we're going to debug

950
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:36,280
this anyway so let's finish the other

951
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:39,099
part here which is giving these render

952
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:47,410
groups a piece of important information

953
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:49,719
right which is the clip rekt effects so

954
00:53:47,409 --> 00:53:55,299
there's the render unto clip wrecked and

955
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:59,259
here's the clip rekt affects the clip

956
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:04,060
rectify really just a removal of these

957
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:07,150
global values from the render group and

958
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:10,179
a placing of them into the clip wrecked

959
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:12,250
now this is going to cause some

960
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:14,169
consternation for us in the renderer

961
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:17,139
we're going to have to do a little bit

962
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:20,079
of extra work here and the reason for

963
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:23,859
that is because the clip wrecked now has

964
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:29,710
to have that information merged in at

965
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:34,650
the end right but that's okay we can

966
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:37,150
handle it we're professionals ostensibly

967
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:41,380
so you can see here when we do store

968
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:43,210
color right we're producing you know we

969
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,700
sort of did this nicely so that it gets

970
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:46,960
stored the pepperoni do it and

971
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:49,719
unfortunately now what we're fact it

972
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,630
going to have to do is undo this right

973
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:53,919
we're going to have to say don't when

974
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,809
you start color just throw them directly

975
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,490
and then what we'll do is when we

976
00:54:55,809 --> 00:55:01,269
actually use these things in the

977
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:03,909
renderer at that time when you look up

978
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:06,369
the clip wrecked you'll you'll do the

979
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:09,339
operation and now you may say isn't this

980
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:13,509
a bad idea because the whole point of

981
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:16,030
this was we were supposed to be you know

982
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,870
having these things alpha out or we're

983
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:18,940
supposed to be like doing this

984
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:20,980
efficiently well what we're going to

985
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,780
have to do is probably render at least

986
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:26,079
the Alpha fading one has to be rendered

987
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:29,140
as a separate plate anyway so the this

988
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,309
effect has to be applied separate from

989
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:32,500
the entities the enemies would get

990
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:34,480
rendered themselves and then this effect

991
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:38,090
would get applied after the fact right

992
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:40,590
now for fog

993
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:43,170
we can put everything in the same clip

994
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:45,390
rekt eventually so to be honest we

995
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:47,940
probably don't have to be as fancy as I

996
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:49,980
was being because I don't think for fog

997
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:53,010
layers we really need to separate things

998
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:55,800
into those layers we really just need

999
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:59,190
three layers or possibly even just to

1000
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:01,950
just the one above us and the one that's

1001
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:03,240
below the one that's like everything

1002
00:56:01,949 --> 00:56:07,439
going out into the distance that's not

1003
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:11,119
being alpha faded right so actually

1004
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:14,099
storing it in each one and separate

1005
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:17,119
thing is really just an exercise at this

1006
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:21,839
point and we can probably get it simpler

1007
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:25,349
afterwards yeah and and really it's just

1008
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:28,019
to make sure like I guess the way I

1009
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:29,759
would say it is I need to make sure that

1010
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:32,190
I actually can do this operation

1011
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,350
accurately like I need to make sure that

1012
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:38,519
we verify that i can put them into

1013
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:40,170
slices because the offset Z needs to

1014
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:43,139
make sure that you've put it into the

1015
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:46,139
right slice correctly so the reason I'm

1016
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:47,819
doing all of them first pass through

1017
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:51,989
which I didn't quite explain originally

1018
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:53,370
is I want to then color by slice to

1019
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:55,949
guarantee that everything is getting

1020
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:57,869
assigned to the right slice and then

1021
00:56:55,949 --> 00:57:00,389
later I think we can actually back out

1022
00:56:57,869 --> 00:57:02,639
the number of slices and probably just

1023
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:04,769
have to because I think we're only going

1024
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:07,739
to need the Alpha fade slice and then

1025
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:13,530
the other slices so even though we will

1026
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:15,809
know what flights things are right we

1027
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:18,269
won't actually have to assign it to a

1028
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:20,460
slice because all that is going to

1029
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:24,329
matter is that that slice index is used

1030
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:27,480
for the perspective effect and we can do

1031
00:57:24,329 --> 00:57:30,539
that in line we don't have to wait till

1032
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:36,539
at render correlation if that makes

1033
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:38,489
sense so so yeah so it's it's a little

1034
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:40,710
dicey like it's a little hat six of one

1035
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:43,349
half dozen the other I'm not sure what

1036
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:45,329
we want to do with that global color

1037
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:49,259
thing in some sense because you know we

1038
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:50,670
may still want the notion that you're

1039
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:53,550
going to use this this

1040
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:55,530
store color to do fogging effects on

1041
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:57,450
people that are all in the same layer

1042
00:57:55,530 --> 00:58:01,019
that are getting different fog values

1043
00:57:57,449 --> 00:58:05,129
you know that that is plausible it's not

1044
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:07,500
entirely out of the question but at the

1045
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,940
same time I don't know that might not be

1046
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,949
the most efficient way to do the fog

1047
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:14,130
anyway it might be that we want to do Z

1048
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:16,409
based fog or who knows what else instead

1049
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:18,720
of doing it per slice anyway so I'm just

1050
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:22,889
not sure but what I do know is that the

1051
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:25,049
store color definitely has to at least

1052
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:28,739
be flexible enough to allow us to store

1053
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:31,860
stuff in the FX as well right and so

1054
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:34,409
that probably means we could make this

1055
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:36,090
be a fogging only kind of effect store

1056
00:58:34,409 --> 00:58:37,799
color but I guess now that I think about

1057
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:39,930
it we probably should leave it in the

1058
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,910
global because as I talk that through I

1059
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:45,000
was remembering yeah we we can go back

1060
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:48,989
to having those other layers can fog

1061
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
themselves just just fine and they don't

1062
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:55,709
need to be broken up into slices as far

1063
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:59,400
as the render is concerned so all right

1064
00:58:55,710 --> 00:59:01,920
so I'll leave these two in here for the

1065
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:08,760
moment but then eventually we might get

1066
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:10,680
rid of them oops all right so let's see

1067
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:15,510
here these values just need to get moved

1068
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:18,289
up there we go push flip wrecked

1069
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:22,230
obviously we haven't modified to take

1070
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:26,279
one of these you know calls so let's

1071
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:28,170
take a look here's push clip wrecked and

1072
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:31,670
I'll just say that you know push clip

1073
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:36,329
wrecked can take a clip direct effects

1074
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:38,159
and that can be a pointer there and so

1075
00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:41,940
what we'll do is when we actually do

1076
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:44,549
this push we can just say well the

1077
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:45,750
effects will either be 0 for the push

1078
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:48,380
and you know what I could just do it

1079
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,380
this way I suppose

1080
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:08,060
convert to layer relative needs to take

1081
00:59:58,369 --> 01:00:11,380
the world mode and so nothing in

1082
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:11,380
particular should be happening now

1083
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:20,510
although you can see that we do have a

1084
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:22,460
problem with how we're drawing these and

1085
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:25,280
I guess I shouldn't say we have a

1086
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:28,730
problem we're doing what we wanted to do

1087
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:33,170
which is to say that we are taking the

1088
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:36,079
indices and we're flooring them but

1089
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:37,820
since we now aren't actually obeying the

1090
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:42,139
perspective since we don't put the

1091
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:44,570
prospective transform anywhere we aren't

1092
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:46,699
drawing the world that those slices

1093
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:49,880
aren't actually doing their sort of

1094
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:55,699
perspective duty if that makes sense but

1095
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:58,840
we're out of time so i will go to QA and

1096
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:58,839
we'll tackle that tomorrow

1097
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,280
huh

1098
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:32,489
and by the way while i'm waiting for Q&amp;A

1099
01:01:29,309 --> 01:01:35,789
i would i would ask the question in so

1100
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:39,809
far as is in sabah ready to to be made a

1101
01:01:35,789 --> 01:01:42,570
moderator yet or not I didn't know when

1102
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:43,710
that was supposed to happen because I

1103
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:52,350
need to remember to go do that on a

1104
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:56,480
machine that where I can assign mod ops

1105
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:59,219
in fact let me rephrase that insofar s

1106
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:04,710
when you are ready for in so bot to have

1107
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:10,219
moderator privileges email me and when I

1108
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:10,220
see that email i will add mod privileges

1109
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:10,650
looks like there are no questions I can

1110
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:10,650
do to bed early

1111
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,240
pig in a it's been a while did I see you

1112
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:35,260
programming without wrist braces are you

1113
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:40,069
not affected anymore um so you know uh

1114
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:47,000
it's it's been an ongoing issue and it's

1115
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:48,950
been a little weird I have I have a lot

1116
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,480
to say on that topic but i don't know

1117
01:03:48,949 --> 01:03:53,689
that i have anything particularly

1118
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:56,079
definitive to say my physical therapist

1119
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:59,570
who i trust she's one of the only

1120
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:05,659
medical professionals I know who is very

1121
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:07,340
very like I don't want to say smart

1122
01:04:05,659 --> 01:04:11,839
because obviously I knew plenty of smart

1123
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:16,850
medical professionals but she has that

1124
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:18,650
sort of a functional approach like like

1125
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:22,239
sort of mechanical approach to problem

1126
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:24,440
solving that's like she really does

1127
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,899
actual debugging work to a certain

1128
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:28,429
degree which I almost never see in

1129
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,869
medical professionals like like I have

1130
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:31,099
no idea where to go to a doctor in

1131
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:33,589
seattle where they're actually like a

1132
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:36,199
good debugger you know for a hard

1133
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:37,490
medical problem and she said that she

1134
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:41,289
doesn't think the wrist braces are a

1135
01:04:37,489 --> 01:04:47,569
good idea so I tried not using them and

1136
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:49,369
what I found in general is that with and

1137
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:55,940
without the wrist braces tend to have

1138
01:04:49,369 --> 01:05:02,509
different sorts of like wrist or or i

1139
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:03,740
should say hand problems and i don't so

1140
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:05,600
i don't know that they really are

1141
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:09,169
necessary at least not for me i don't

1142
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:14,989
know if they really helped or hurt what

1143
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:18,380
i have found that is like perhaps not

1144
01:05:14,989 --> 01:05:21,939
that surprising but it's a little early

1145
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:25,849
to tell is i started rock climbing again

1146
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:26,869
because i felt like in you know Emily

1147
01:05:25,849 --> 01:05:29,449
the physical therapist I was talking

1148
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:32,779
about you know would say the same thing

1149
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:35,539
I felt like I just don't get enough arm

1150
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:36,869
exercise that's you know regular arm

1151
01:05:35,539 --> 01:05:38,940
exercise and like

1152
01:05:36,869 --> 01:05:42,210
the building and stuff like that in a

1153
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:47,278
given day anyway I get like almost none

1154
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:51,358
and so I started doing rock climbing

1155
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:54,568
again and I like my wrists and hands

1156
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:59,009
feel much better than they have for a

1157
01:05:54,568 --> 01:06:00,989
long time like much much better and so I

1158
01:05:59,009 --> 01:06:03,269
don't know that's just you know take it

1159
01:06:00,989 --> 01:06:09,179
with a grain of salt so far but I would

1160
01:06:03,268 --> 01:06:13,919
say that I would say that it's kind of

1161
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:16,879
like been the most improvement I've seen

1162
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:24,568
in terms of how my arms and hands feel

1163
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:28,170
is is just rock climbing he's Jeff

1164
01:06:24,568 --> 01:06:31,170
Atwood a good programmer like I have no

1165
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:36,749
idea I don't even think I know who Jeff

1166
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:40,470
Atwood is I think I maybe I mean I know

1167
01:06:36,748 --> 01:06:42,209
I've heard the name but I have no idea

1168
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:49,488
and I said never worked with them so I

1169
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:51,630
have no idea how I would even know I

1170
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:53,940
mean maybe if he says something

1171
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:55,140
obviously stupid or something we're just

1172
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,759
like wow this person was really not

1173
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:58,288
another program you know then you could

1174
01:06:56,759 --> 01:07:00,599
say that someone's probably not a good

1175
01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:02,940
programmer just from you know cursory

1176
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:04,380
glance but most of the time if you

1177
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,460
really want to know if someone's a good

1178
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:09,119
program right now you kind of have to

1179
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:10,470
work with them and you know see how they

1180
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,749
attack problems how much work they get

1181
01:07:10,469 --> 01:07:14,969
done or how are they handle new things

1182
01:07:12,748 --> 01:07:17,038
are they efficient and how maintainable

1183
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:18,689
zar code and blah blah blah and that's

1184
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,329
not you know I mean you read someone's

1185
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:23,909
blog or something and you can't you

1186
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:25,528
don't know some people may come across

1187
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:27,480
is not particularly good but they're

1188
01:07:25,528 --> 01:07:28,798
actually very effective in practice some

1189
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,969
people may come across as very very

1190
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,068
smart you think they're great but

1191
01:07:29,969 --> 01:07:34,469
actually getting a work done and they're

1192
01:07:32,068 --> 01:07:36,150
very bad the actual like act of getting

1193
01:07:34,469 --> 01:07:38,548
code together and working and

1194
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:41,759
maintaining it right and so I feel like

1195
01:07:38,548 --> 01:07:42,960
it's really hard to ever say whether you

1196
01:07:41,759 --> 01:07:44,909
think someone is a good program or not

1197
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,190
honestly and have any kind of a chance

1198
01:07:44,909 --> 01:07:49,099
of being right if you haven't worked

1199
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:52,860
with them

1200
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:55,710
hmm even looking at their code isn't a

1201
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:57,570
good example right because you know I

1202
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:59,460
have plenty of things I've written that

1203
01:07:57,570 --> 01:08:02,190
are just awful right and if you happen

1204
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:03,900
to look at that or something you know

1205
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:05,940
maybe you think I program really poorly

1206
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:07,349
or maybe you pick something really good

1207
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:10,200
that I did and you look and you think oh

1208
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:11,400
my God he's amazing right and the truth

1209
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:13,949
is that you're neither of those things

1210
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:16,050
it's like you know you have high points

1211
01:08:13,949 --> 01:08:22,409
and you have low points and so you kind

1212
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:28,680
of got to see you kind of got to see

1213
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:29,789
what happens when you were working on

1214
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,170
switching between the software and

1215
01:08:29,789 --> 01:08:32,489
hardware under yesterday why did it look

1216
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:36,539
like there was a skill a very slight

1217
01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:38,909
color difference um so we don't know

1218
01:08:36,539 --> 01:08:40,380
specifically why there is a very slight

1219
01:08:38,909 --> 01:08:44,550
color difference because we have not

1220
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:46,739
investigated that exactly but we expect

1221
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:48,869
to see a very slight color difference

1222
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:50,969
and the reason for that is we are just

1223
01:08:48,869 --> 01:08:53,479
using an approximation to gamma which is

1224
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:57,390
squaring and square rooting the values

1225
01:08:53,479 --> 01:09:01,250
whereas OpenGL is using an exact gamma

1226
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:06,450
or at least a very close to exact gamma

1227
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:08,489
in the hardware so they're like a 2.2

1228
01:09:06,449 --> 01:09:11,489
curve or something close to it right and

1229
01:09:08,489 --> 01:09:12,869
we're a 2 point 0 curve and so we know

1230
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:14,909
that our software renderer will have a

1231
01:09:12,869 --> 01:09:20,250
slight color difference from open jail

1232
01:09:14,909 --> 01:09:22,380
and that's expected so if we wanted to

1233
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:23,970
verify that that was what the color

1234
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:25,710
difference is we'd still have to do some

1235
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:27,030
more work but since that really wasn't

1236
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,529
what I was doing I didn't feel it was

1237
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:30,569
necessary but I knew when the color

1238
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:32,279
difference was drastic I knew there was

1239
01:09:30,569 --> 01:09:33,689
no way that was right because the

1240
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:36,599
difference between a gamma 2 curve in a

1241
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:39,119
game a 2.2 curve while it's visible is

1242
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:42,030
not all that visible right it's not

1243
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:45,960
drastic and it was clearly drastic right

1244
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:48,929
in that in that context so I wanted to

1245
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:50,789
make sure that that we found what the

1246
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:53,159
real bug was and we did now that doesn't

1247
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:54,930
mean that there isn't some other bug in

1248
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:57,800
there but the slight color difference is

1249
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:57,800
absolutely expected

1250
01:09:58,948 --> 01:10:03,009
what would you say are the top three

1251
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:05,049
things that have made Molly rocket

1252
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:07,840
successful in your eyes from a startup

1253
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:14,889
business perspective Molly rocket isn't

1254
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:16,809
successful we don't make money right

1255
01:10:14,889 --> 01:10:20,769
we're working on to game projects right

1256
01:10:16,809 --> 01:10:24,159
now and we have nothing to sell so we're

1257
01:10:20,769 --> 01:10:27,099
definitely not successful whether or not

1258
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:30,638
we're successful will basically be

1259
01:10:27,099 --> 01:10:33,248
determined by when we finish handmade

1260
01:10:30,639 --> 01:10:37,269
hero which is obviously kind of not

1261
01:10:33,248 --> 01:10:39,698
really a product as much because I have

1262
01:10:37,269 --> 01:10:42,760
to do it on stream so it's slow and we

1263
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:46,178
can't you know it's a community thing

1264
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:49,179
that can't I can't just go burn you know

1265
01:10:46,179 --> 01:10:52,090
hard on it for a month and finish or you

1266
01:10:49,179 --> 01:10:57,730
know the game or whatever I have to do

1267
01:10:52,090 --> 01:11:00,998
it in piecemeal on specific way but when

1268
01:10:57,729 --> 01:11:04,209
handmade hero in 1935 or both you know

1269
01:11:00,998 --> 01:11:09,849
out did they make back their investment

1270
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:14,460
right and so you know where we have very

1271
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:19,029
nice financing right which is because

1272
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:22,359
jeff was willing to you know take a bet

1273
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:23,859
on us we probably won't go out of

1274
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:26,078
business because we run out of time

1275
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:28,859
because we can you know take an extra

1276
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:33,189
six months or something if we need to

1277
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:36,308
but you know when we when we actually

1278
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:39,848
put a product out there we're in Seattle

1279
01:11:36,309 --> 01:11:41,860
so our costs are high you know we we

1280
01:11:39,849 --> 01:11:44,050
don't have the luxury of paying people

1281
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:45,729
you know forty thousand dollars a year

1282
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:48,429
expecting them to be able to get by

1283
01:11:45,729 --> 01:11:50,379
right it's not Seattle is a very bad

1284
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:54,519
cost of living town it's very expensive

1285
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:56,710
it costs a lot to run a studio here so

1286
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:58,119
you know when those games come out they

1287
01:11:56,710 --> 01:12:00,279
have to make back a substantial amount

1288
01:11:58,118 --> 01:12:03,598
of money and if they don't then then we

1289
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:03,599
read just go out of business basically

1290
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:13,439
and and we would try to find some place

1291
01:12:08,819 --> 01:12:16,559
that would hire Anna and myself to to do

1292
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:18,059
something for them which I really hope

1293
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:22,470
we don't have hope it doesn't come to

1294
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:24,510
that but you know that's that's the the

1295
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:26,310
truth of the matter so so I definitely

1296
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,150
wouldn't call Molly rocket successful I

1297
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:29,300
wouldn't necessarily call it

1298
01:12:27,149 --> 01:12:32,039
unsuccessful but it's definitely not

1299
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:37,230
unknown quantity so I feel like it would

1300
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:39,840
be you know really really premature to

1301
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:43,399
suggest that there are our top three

1302
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,400
things that make it successful because

1303
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:52,729
got to be successful for you can

1304
01:12:49,409 --> 01:12:52,729
identify things that make you successful

1305
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:11,359
piggin 00 do you mind name dropping her

1306
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,730
I live in Seattle too and have a new

1307
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:16,309
wrist issue with programming I do not

1308
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:22,689
mind name dropping her at all in fact I

1309
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:26,150
am a spoiler alert probably going to

1310
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:27,529
like it's highly likely but don't take

1311
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:33,039
it as an official announcement but it's

1312
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:33,039
highly likely that i will also be

1313
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:40,129
working with her at handmade con to get

1314
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:42,949
people more information about wrist

1315
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:45,680
issues and talk to people about risk

1316
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:47,899
issues perhaps at the conference and

1317
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:51,260
maybe give like you know a quick

1318
01:13:47,899 --> 01:13:52,429
presentation sort of thing or we're

1319
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,350
we're probably going to try to do

1320
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:57,110
something at the conference related to

1321
01:13:54,350 --> 01:14:00,140
wrist issues because it is so prevalent

1322
01:13:57,109 --> 01:14:03,139
I've asked by so many people so often

1323
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:05,150
about wrist pain and hand pain problems

1324
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:07,369
that they have and she's like the only

1325
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:09,829
person I know who seems to be at all

1326
01:14:07,369 --> 01:14:11,989
good at trying that stuff out and

1327
01:14:09,829 --> 01:14:15,500
actually working through issues that

1328
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:19,309
people have so I do not mind name

1329
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:23,600
dropping her at all and I I will

1330
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:27,620
probably be actively sort of asking her

1331
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:30,410
to to help people in the community get

1332
01:14:27,619 --> 01:14:38,449
the resources they need to have a bit

1333
01:14:30,409 --> 01:14:39,829
have less pain when they work so I don't

1334
01:14:38,449 --> 01:14:41,119
know what the quickest way to do it is

1335
01:14:39,829 --> 01:14:46,750
but if you can remember PUREMOTION

1336
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:53,210
physical therapy this is the site and I

1337
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:55,939
you can go to like it's on westlake so

1338
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:58,250
if you know where that is it's it's kind

1339
01:14:55,939 --> 01:14:59,899
of there's a giant weird building called

1340
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:02,449
the china harbor which is this weird

1341
01:14:59,899 --> 01:15:05,679
like it's half community center and a

1342
01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:08,809
half chinese restaurant don't ask me

1343
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:11,510
it's been there forever she's like right

1344
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:15,189
next to that in like this sort of you

1345
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:19,610
know storefront area that's got

1346
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:24,168
like yachts yacht salesman and all sorts

1347
01:15:19,609 --> 01:15:26,029
of things in it and you can email oh I

1348
01:15:24,168 --> 01:15:28,760
guess you can just use this to submit a

1349
01:15:26,029 --> 01:15:31,759
request if you want to be seen and in

1350
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:33,829
the comments just put Casey sent me I'm

1351
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:39,199
a programmer who has risked problems and

1352
01:15:33,828 --> 01:15:41,658
she'll know what that means so there you

1353
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:43,969
go and she takes most insurance that's

1354
01:15:41,658 --> 01:15:46,698
any good so if you have any reasonable

1355
01:15:43,969 --> 01:15:50,378
inference it you'd probably just pay you

1356
01:15:46,698 --> 01:15:50,378
know 20 bucks or some copay

1357
01:15:56,829 --> 01:16:05,180
as someone back at episode 54 how far

1358
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:07,390
gone am I well you know it's not as bad

1359
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:10,100
as you might think right I mean an

1360
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:13,340
episodes only an hour so although they

1361
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:16,730
say day 54 day 56 whatever it's like oh

1362
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:20,090
my god day 54 today 300 must be forever

1363
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:22,189
but it's like well if it's ours 300

1364
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:25,369
hours is nothing it's like less than 10

1365
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:32,469
weeks of programming time right or

1366
01:16:25,369 --> 01:16:32,470
something so you can do it it's not much

1367
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:41,989
need sir do you find that your hands

1368
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:44,780
shake when holding a drinking glass that

1369
01:16:41,989 --> 01:16:51,050
is the only time my hands shake at all I

1370
01:16:44,779 --> 01:16:56,559
don't find my hands shake that is not

1371
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:56,560

so i i i don't i don't know really

1373

a long web web web site address but

1377
01:17:28,198 --> 01:17:33,639
PUREMOTION physical therapy that's the

1378
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:35,710
place it's just her own it's her own

1379

her it's her and she has her own you

1381
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:48,520
know shop basically so yeah I would I

kind of got that in place we got to

1389
01:18:05,738 --> 01:18:08,409
figure out how that's going to flow

1390
01:18:06,729 --> 01:18:10,509
through the pipeline which is a little

1391
01:18:08,409 --> 01:18:13,359
tricky so we gotta we're going to have
