1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,910
okay I think we are ready to go here

2
00:00:03,048 --> 00:00:11,339
this is sort of a a inclusion of

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,949
handmade Con 2015 inside handmade con

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,780
2016 Messiah sort of mentioned on the

5
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:18,210
schedule so those of you who are at

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,710
handmade Con 2015 know that that these

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,240
are the speakers - Mike Acton he

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,429
couldn't make it but everyone else is

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,649
here who was at the original conference

10
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,089
and what I wanted to do was just kind of

11
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,368
take the opportunity to do sort of

12
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,140
questions and answers because that

13
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:33,329
wasn't something that as you know as you

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,799
saw even in this conference during 90

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,259
minutes we typically take the entire

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,328
time to really get all of the stuff that

17
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:42,359
we want to talk about just that I'm

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,009
asking so what I wanted to do was have a

19
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,238
session that was just kind of free forum

20
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:47,099
where we could go through a lot of the

21
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,199
questions that people had that they

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,160
maybe would have asked if we do audience

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,129
Q&amp;A so as I said on the mailing

24
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,750
basically I collated on the forums all

25
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:59,939
the questions that people submitted and

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,308
I'm just gonna kind of go through them

27
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,228
and ask questions of various people on

28
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,459
the panel who the questions were

29
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:06,750
directed at some of we're directed

30
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,089
everyone's in the director filming one

31
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,159
but the idea here is just that it's you

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,049
know much like the rest of the sessions

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,790
anything goes so anyone who wants to

34
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,170
talk about any topic is welcome to jump

35
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,729
in at any time

36
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,409
you don't have to keep it to just like

37
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:21,868
oh this said that this question was

38
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,670
directed at Tommy so only Tommy you can

39
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:27,299
talk or anything like that just it's

40
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,670
totally totally free for all so anyway

41
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,200
for those of you who are not at handmade

42
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,219
Conti 15 let me just do brief

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,769
introductions

44
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,590
we've got Ron Gilbert Pat Wyatt Tommy

45
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,090
referenced and Jonathan Blow you know

46
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,740
each of whom you probably saw their

47
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,450
talks online so let's give them a warm

48
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,528
welcome

49
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,528
[Applause]

50
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,549
so before I ask the first question I

51
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,978
just wanted to go quickly through and

52
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,890
just go like hey what's what's going on

53
00:01:56,978 --> 00:02:01,569
so let's touch the end run

54
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,549
what do you been doing since handmade

55
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:05,709
Con 2015 how's it go it's just working

56
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:08,199
on my game so if then but we part and

57
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,849
stressing about it panicking about it

58
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,318
all those normal things you do when

59
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:12,969
you're developing the game what's the

60
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:16,659
panic level right now oh it's really

61
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:18,068
high really high yeah no it's it's it's

62
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:19,659
really high because you know we're gonna

63
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:22,479
probably ship the game sometime in

64
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:25,750
February okay and you know everything's

65
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,159
going great with the game and we had we

66
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,560
were getting ready to do all the voice

67
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,299
recording there's like 15,000 lines of

68
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,620
dialogue in the game and we were getting

69
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,290
ready to do the voice coding and then

70
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,530
all the actors went on strike right

71
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:40,568
right and so we kind of had to scrap all

72
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,640
of the casting that we had done and

73
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:44,859
we've started over with the casting and

74
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,289
we're gonna record it in Vancouver next

75
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:52,420
week okay so it's yeah it's like super

76
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:56,560
stressful right wait you don't think no

77
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:58,869
it's no it's not limited okay so the

78
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,269
strike is universal across well it's for

79
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,219
interactive titles and it started out a

80
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,170
little bit more limited but then a lot

81
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:07,239
more actors kind of went into it and

82
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:09,879
there was this thing that you could do

83
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,289
if you if you wanted to record during

84
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,659
the strike where you could basically

85
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:16,599
agree to the new contract that the

86
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:18,159
actors are and record outside of it but

87
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,780
then a lot of the people that do the

88
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,509
signatory type stuff

89
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,209
we're very leery about signing the

90
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:26,979
contract so it just it just made more

91
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,109
sense to just get out of it and go to

92
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,789
bank so basically the situation is right

93
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,500
now if you're doing voice credit for a

94
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:34,389
game and you do want to do it here it's

95
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:41,349
somewhat in limbo like you don't even

96
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:45,328
really know if you want well thank you

97
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,329
for coming even at panic level 17

98
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,830
so Pat how about you so very shortly

99
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,289
after Kahn last year I started to Amazon

100
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,900
so I've been there about a year game

101
00:03:55,289 --> 00:04:00,179
studios and we're working towards the

102
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,709
release of the first game first PC game

103
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,260
which is called breakaway we just got a

104
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,700
an internal test about a week ago

105
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:06,689
actually I guess there was friends and

106
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,639
family would be the best way to describe

107
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:11,129
it folks and in December we'll be doing

108
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,098
a full-on alpha test Oh time to sign up

109
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:16,829
if you like play breakaway calm this is

110
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:18,149
this is an open test you do not have to

111
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,280
have any kind of special invitation to

112
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,478
do so well what they're gonna do is you

113
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,559
know like lots of people sign up and

114
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,029
then they'll pick a subset of those

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,069
people to play in the alpha test okay

116
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:27,599
can people like come up up to you after

117
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:30,360
sharing be like hey can you put me on

118
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,370
the secret can you bias me into the sea

119
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,370
sure I can try

120
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:41,990
Tommy how about you just stuff all right

121
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:45,389
yeah I wrote a scripting language fun

122
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:53,728
anything else well what kind of

123
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:57,710
scripting my ugh because Ron the whole

124
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:57,709
thing mine was just like

125
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,040
I needed something where people that

126
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,560
were afraid of C++ could do stuff in my

127
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,910
engine and I don't like using other

128
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,350
stuff so I was like well I don't have

129
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,920
anything else to do I'm just gonna write

130
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:15,220
a how to come out very well oh yeah yeah

131
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,140
no it's it was the the the reason it

132
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,650
came out very well is I had a ton of fun

133
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:22,180
doing it and I just enjoyed it and every

134
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:23,799
time I would be like oh I want to add

135
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,920
this thing I'd be like yeah I'm

136
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,750
gonna had that thing be awesome so and

137
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:34,120
then I did and then and now it's over

138
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:34,930
now I'm sad because it's done start

139
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,560
started another one

140
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,560
I might problem solved templates

141
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:47,500
[Laughter]

142
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,810
compiler so is this something that

143
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,000
you're ever going to release they're

144
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,800
gonna be like dot TRS files like or

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,949
something like this it's called Tom you

146
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:03,550
script yeah are we so creative with the

147
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:05,709
naming it's such a broad yes

148
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,168
no I probably won't release it cuz it's

149
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:09,159
it's just in my engine so okay so it's

150
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,870
not necessarily a scripting language

151
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,640
that might become something people would

152
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,310
be interested in using outside no I

153
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,599
don't think so like it's yeah it's

154
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,550
haizen the stuff in my engine

155
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,260
specifically so I mean you could because

156
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,650
it's all separate from the engine but

157
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:27,300
you know why I just use blue but you I

158
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,299
don't want to support it but you didn't

159
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:37,599
[Laughter]

160
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,229
John how about you what level of

161
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:45,098
involvement counts eyes worth mentioning

162
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:46,839
I feel like this is a speaker discretion

163
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:50,288
level of involvement so you can actually

164
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,779
said this dynamically okay I'll just

165
00:06:50,288 --> 00:07:04,089
cover all the things all right so so we

166
00:06:52,779 --> 00:07:06,878
released a game this year in January so

167
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:08,978
we've been doing ports of that to

168
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:15,520
various platforms and then we just this

169
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:17,139
week put live our ps4 Pro Plus HDR patch

170
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,799
so we're going back and doing support

171
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,340
for other things

172
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,740
HDR was pretty fun I didn't do any of

173
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,750
the programming specifically for HDR but

174
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,490
it was more like you know high-level

175
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,348
discussions and decision-making and

176
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,129
stuff because some of it a lot of the

177
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:35,079
things that you do in an engine you know

178
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,639
for efficiency purposes because you

179
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,109
didn't you know you could do them

180
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,668
multiple ways one of the ways you do

181
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,210
them is sort of like maybe after tone

182
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:46,810
mapping or whatnot none of that stuff

183
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:48,068
works if you need your output to be HDR

184
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,319
and some of those things don't even make

185
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:52,389
sense you know one of the cool tricks we

186
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,218
did was the I forget what game it came

187
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,629
from but you know there's a thing where

188
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:57,218
you take a screenshot and then you put

189
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:59,949
it in Photoshop and like you tweak all

190
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:01,658
the hues and like any control you have

191
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:03,968
in Photoshop like transforms the image

192
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:06,218
but also a stamp in the corner that

193
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:07,870
that's like every RGB color or none of

194
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:10,478
them that you can interpolate right yeah

195
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,668
make any sense an HDR at all right so

196
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,430
you have to like completely like all the

197
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:17,528
all the color correction in your the

198
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,939
live color correction in your engine has

199
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:22,209
to get rewritten and stuff and so I

200
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:24,449
didn't do that but did did Annie do Andy

201
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:28,478
are you in the audience did you do this

202
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:29,500
yeah so Andy did that okay but no I

203
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,129
don't know who did it

204
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:40,299
so we we had discussions about that so

205
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:42,549
that's been fun and then so more

206
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,339
personally what we're doing or what I'm

207
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,379
doing more

208
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:50,240
these days is sort of starting stuff on

209
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:55,039
the next game which is an interesting

210
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:58,580
project because part of the well there's

211
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,709
two next games what one of them is going

212
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,690
to be in the engine and code base that

213
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,980
we've already spent so much effort like

214
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,780
the witness the witness on James yeah

215
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,490
yeah but it'll hopefully be a project

216
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,829
that's smaller and more tractable than

217
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,200
that and stuff which is always what

218
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,930
people say we're gonna try to really do

219
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,790
it and then you know the other one so so

220
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:21,709
I'm also building a programming language

221
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:24,969
and as a test that that's a real thing

222
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:27,500
we're also making a game in that okay so

223
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,960
it's a little bit yeah you know it's

224
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,000
maybe not the smartest decision to do

225
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,490
multiple things yes just what is

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,259
happening so okay so this is one of

227
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:40,610
those cases where we do know ahead of

228
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:42,919
time that this is a bad idea yeah we

229
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,110
have decided to accept that feeling as a

230
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:47,899
feeling and move ahead if people never

231
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,399
did things that were bad ideas like like

232
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:54,100
starting a rocket companies are pretty

233
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:57,980
bad yeah but but that works out so yeah

234
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,750
alright well let me let me move on to

235
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,070
questions then and I I don't have any

236
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,289
particular order for these because

237
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,350
they're not super theme based like

238
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:08,120
people had some pretty I guess

239
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,980
the questions that were asked ranged all

240
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,810
all over the map from things that are

241
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,279
relatively specific code kinds of

242
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:15,259
questions to things that were like just

243
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,419
purely psychological like dealing with

244
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:21,319
you know burnout or things like this so

245
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:25,459
I'll just kind of jump around in it I'll

246
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,610
start with so I'll also should say some

247
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,990
people sent in here's my name like you

248
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,360
know you can attribute the question

249
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,129
other people didn't so I don't know if

250
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,529
that was cuz they missed the part in the

251
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:38,299
submission thing that said if you would

252
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,709
like me to read your name when you do it

253
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:42,139
please put the name in there and how to

254
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,910
pronounce it so I can pronounce it or if

255
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:45,439
they really didn't want me to say their

256
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,939
name so I apologize anyone who wanted me

257
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,270
to say their name and just didn't see

258
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,920
that notice but here we go so we'll

259
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:55,639
start off with one that's that's sort of

260
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,669
I guess a non not really a code question

261
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,110
it's from

262
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:01,319
I think I'm gonna pronounce this right

263
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:04,500
but Dean Siegel the handle is the eighth

264
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,620
mage on the twitch chat and it's from

265
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,259
Israel so the question is Tommy you

266
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,370
tweeted about impostor syndrome

267
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:12,149
specifically in relation to handmade con

268
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,830
2015

269
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:16,049
can you talk a little bit about it and

270
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,280
if and how it influences your day-to-day

271
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,809
work and feelings and this is

272
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,579
interesting to me because people ask me

273
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:23,669
about this on the stream too and my

274
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,500
answer briefly there was just like we

275
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:26,909
never had a name for this thing but I

276
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,769
would be pretty shocked if programmers

277
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:29,699
in general it didn't typically feel like

278
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:30,720
they'd really just don't know what

279
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,300
they're doing because it's such a vast

280
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,759
topic so I am kind of interested to hear

281
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,979
what you had to say on it as someone

282
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,069
who's you know totally different

283
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:47,430
perspectives perhaps on it yeah I did a

284
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:49,350
GDC talk like the little soapbox and my

285
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:49,889
whole thing was I have a whole bunch of

286
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,690
friends

287
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:56,639
that's not bracketing I have I have a

288
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,680
bunch of friends people I work with and

289
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,799
around and stuff and they all they all

290
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,439
like make these amazing things and they

291
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:07,849
think that they're garbage okay and I

292
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,460
think that about stuff that I do too and

293
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:14,129
for me what I talked about in relation

294
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,490
to handmade con last year is I was up

295
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:19,409
here with no you you you and Mike Acton

296
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,379
and all these really really accomplished

297
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:22,949
people and I just felt like I sort of

298
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,220
belonged

299
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:39,120
even though right before I came to hand

300
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:40,620
make on him like oh yeah I try not to

301
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,600
cuss on the mainstream because those

302
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,769
videos I thought could maybe be used for

303
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:50,540
something educational I didn't even want

304
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,539
to try to keep especially this

305
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:58,610
yeah there has been several squares

306
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,070
we've already burned that bridge good it

307
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,360
wasn't me I'm not you not you're just

308
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:16,160
bringing it you're just bringing it home

309
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:17,870
you're closer yeah okay hello so I was

310
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,629
up here and I just I just felt like I

311
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,490
belonged and the whole point of that

312
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:25,039
talk was to just sort of tell everybody

313
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,560
that those feelings are natural there

314
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:31,159
are something that I feel like it's a

315
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:33,469
mechanism to keep challenging and

316
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:37,219
understanding what you're good at so for

317
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:40,460
me I don't think I'm really good at well

318
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:43,129
much of anything but I am though because

319
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:45,139
you know I've made a video game sold

320
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:46,189
well people like the controls I feel

321
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,230
like I know what I'm doing with

322
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,850
programming but it doesn't matter every

323
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,620
time I do something like this this can't

324
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,290
possibly be the right way to do this

325
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,350
okay you know but you know it keeps

326
00:13:54,289 --> 00:14:00,740
working out and yeah I mean it inspired

327
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,050
me to just sort of take other leaps like

328
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,560
I just recently like made a comic book

329
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:11,359
okay okay well the reason was I didn't

330
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:15,159
have anything else to do you had nothing

331
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:21,320
else to do yeah it's been a weird year

332
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:23,629
okay so yeah the whole point was like

333
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,330
everybody feels it's not something to be

334
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,939
like ashamed of and you know if you if

335
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,410
you realize that other people have it

336
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,910
maybe people that you look up to because

337
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:34,219
I know there are some people look up to

338
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:36,529
me I don't know why but I do and if they

339
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,870
know that hey I kind of feel this way

340
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:40,579
too maybe they'll be like hey it's not

341
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,590
it's not bad for me to feel this way so

342
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,200
yeah because I feel like it's some level

343
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,580
that's the sort of thing that can can

344
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,440
you know be like a self-fulfilling

345
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,090
prophecy if you're constantly thinking

346
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,070
that I'm not good enough to do this

347
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,480
thing then you probably won't be able to

348
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,920
do that thing because that's what you're

349
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,220
focused on rather than just going like

350
00:14:54,919 --> 00:15:00,409
look we all are really bad at this big

351
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,710
like game development is just difficult

352
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:03,600
and error-prone and it

353
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,400
not a science and it's like there is no

354
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,170
such thing as like oh I learned to play

355
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,309
the piano and here's the notes and it

356
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:10,889
came out great or something it's like

357
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:12,929
nope it's like very fuzzy and weird so

358
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:15,360
at some point you just have to maybe say

359
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:17,429
like I just got to try you know try and

360
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,210
and failure is part of this profession

361
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:22,620
on a daily basis it is yes yes did

362
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:26,910
anyone else have anything they wanted to

363
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:29,519
add on that one at all or before I find

364
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:31,379
that you know impostor syndrome at least

365
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,350
for me personally is it's highly

366
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:36,809
motivational because I often you know

367
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,029
feel like well what I'm doing just isn't

368
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:40,769
any good or other people are doing stuff

369
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:41,669
that's a lot better and that that really

370
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:43,649
motivates me

371
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:45,240
I think I'm somebody and I did a whole

372
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:48,059
talk on this I think I'm somebody I'm

373
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,820
I'm very much motivated by fear it's

374
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:52,500
like I get I I become afraid that

375
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,750
something else is better than what I'm

376
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:58,049
doing I've become afraid that my thing

377
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,850
is crap and that really pushes me pushes

378
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:02,189
me forward to kind of be better and do

379
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,050
better stuff so at least for me I find

380
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,870
it very motivational some people do not

381
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:09,750
but then for me I do so in some sense if

382
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:12,389
you know people who maybe struggle with

383
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,039
this a little bit can change their

384
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,779
thinking around you know maybe try to

385
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,659
think of it a little bit as like look

386
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:20,279
the the fear part of impostor syndrome

387
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:21,600
is like I think it's like okay well let

388
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,819
that fear mode but you'll run away from

389
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,560
that thing by doing you know challenging

390
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,360
yourself or doing work that allows you

391
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,459
to sort of demonstrate to yourself that

392
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,529
you can do it sort of as a more

393
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,360
motivational tactic rather than a just a

394
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:35,539
you know a cowering sort of sort of

395
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,519
thing yeah that's the way I'm treating

396
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:41,279
so let me let me move on to the next

397
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,230
question here this one well actually

398
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,659
this person submitted a couple different

399
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,909
questions so I'm going to pronounce this

400
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:50,100
incorrectly because they included a note

401
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:52,350
and this is probably for the best that

402
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,259
said I don't care how you pronounce the

403
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,790
name and they're from Shenzhen China so

404
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,980
like you know my ability to speak

405
00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:02,009
Chinese would be laughably bad so that's

406
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,389
good pan Fang Zhang is the the person's

407
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,119
name and their handle on the Twitter

408
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:08,549
chat is ebola bond and his first

409
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:10,139
question was from john he said the

410
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:12,750
development period of the witness is

411
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,790
much longer than braid like how did you

412
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,680
come through the deed

413
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:20,119
motivation and self-doubt part I guess

414
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,259
he's assuming that there was one I mean

415
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,939
although I guess you did in the

416
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:24,980
attempting deep work talk probably

417
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,870
talked about bit about that but yeah and

418
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,490
then they kind of asked the broader

419
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,929
question is there a general method for

420
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,720
everybody so I think mostly just what

421
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,070
they're trying to get out there is like

422
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,670
psychologically how do you deal with

423
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:37,990
this

424
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:40,670
well braid was not a short development

425
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,740
you know it was like three and a half

426
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,560
years from beginning to end which is for

427
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,599
most people would be a long project it

428
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,970
maybe even not so much these days

429
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,379
because everybody's projects have gotten

430
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,089
longer and longer so three and a half

431
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,300
years is less long today than it was in

432
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:59,449
2008 or whatever came out but it was

433
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:05,210
still unusually long but but that was I

434
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:07,519
mean you know if you if you're a runner

435
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,289
and you run some short distances and

436
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,879
then you can run some medium distances

437
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,559
and you can run some marathons then you

438
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,080
can run some ultra marathons or whatever

439
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:21,309
right you just build it up you build up

440
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:21,309
the muscle there's sort of two things

441
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:30,289
there's at least two things that that

442
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:33,230
are skills that you can deliberately

443
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:35,329
well one of them is deliberate so the

444
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,610
one that's very deliberate is just

445
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:42,349
learning how to pay attention to your

446
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:44,629
own mental state and regardless of what

447
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:46,009
you have to do about your mental state

448
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,190
because that's a hard question to answer

449
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:51,019
like oh I feel really a certain way

450
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,789
today what why is that and what do I do

451
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:55,940
about that well the answer to why is

452
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:57,500
that is actually usually too complicated

453
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,240
to even understand it because people are

454
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,950
complicated right but you develop the

455
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,009
habit of at least looking at that and

456
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,509
then taking care of yourself right okay

457
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:07,069
similarly to the way you might like look

458
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:08,690
at your posture as we were talking about

459
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:11,539
everything and like move around a little

460
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,299
bit you just like yeah you know I'm not

461
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:16,339
having a good time right now and you

462
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:18,440
just at least you notice it and then

463
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:20,359
maybe you do change something a little

464
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,250
bit and even if you don't know what to

465
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:26,289
do about that the fact that you're

466
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:29,230
paying attention to what is going on is

467
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:32,859
I think at least two-thirds of the

468
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,779
battle like a lot of people you know

469
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:38,829
don't notice that something bad is

470
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:40,359
happening until it's really late and

471
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:43,589
like their life sucks

472
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:50,319
and they just want to quit their job and

473
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:52,709
divorce or whatever so but but I think

474
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,179
there's a there's a lot to be said about

475
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,160
yeah just constant attention just taking

476
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:04,000
care of yourself right but but the other

477
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:05,440
one yeah so like if you assume or at

478
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,009
least sort of implicit in that was that

479
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,750
like okay so normally when somebody

480
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:12,519
eventually sort of gets to that point

481
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,920
where it's gotten too bad right and

482
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,869
that's it's too late or whatever what do

483
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,140
you what do you suggest in terms of

484
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:21,819
learning to sort of figure out how your

485
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,190
mental state is developing much earlier

486
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:25,210
on from that like are there specific do

487
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,559
you think it's different for everybody

488
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,059
so you're just gonna have to kind of

489
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,259
work it out on your own or do you get

490
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,609
some kind of thing it's like no no like

491
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:31,900
hey spend five minutes the morning every

492
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:33,250
day going like how am I feeling today

493
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,990
about some various things just actually

494
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,450
pause and think about it is there any

495
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,829
kind of a like an actual thing there is

496
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,410
it just like who knows see it's really

497
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:44,289
hard because I think it's so when you

498
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:47,200
say when I say notice how you're yes

499
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:48,639
going on right now right away that is

500
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,470
actually very difficult because yeah all

501
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,480
tied up with with notions of identity

502
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,299
and stuff so so you actually have known

503
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,670
me for a long time right you you knew me

504
00:20:55,299 --> 00:21:02,559
like sometime in the late 90s when I was

505
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:04,210
still doing my first yeah which I'm glad

506
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,279
I did it because I became a much better

507
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:10,079
programmer through that but man it was

508
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:12,490
it was not a very fun experience or

509
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,079
whatever right and and I definitely

510
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,930
didn't have this kind of attention to my

511
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:19,149
own you know mental state or whatever

512
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:21,100
and I became really depressed by the end

513
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:24,310
of that and I I burned myself out enough

514
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:25,959
that I couldn't program effectively and

515
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:29,769
I couldn't program it a hundred percent

516
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,170
until like a few years ago yeah and and

517
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:35,109
I was I was at like 20% for a couple

518
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:37,390
years and then it came out 30% 40% it

519
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:39,159
took a long time to get better right so

520
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,940
it was like a physical injury

521
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:46,470
okay but so when I go back to that time

522
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:49,000
right one of the reasons why I didn't

523
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,860
have a good eye on what was going on was

524
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,109
because it was partially like my

525
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:59,799
identity was like I had a little bit of

526
00:21:53,109 --> 00:22:01,059
a the the exact word is not hitting me

527
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:02,409
right now but it's like when when you

528
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:04,929
don't have that great of an opinion of

529
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:08,620
yourself right so this team yeah

530
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:10,509
self-esteem right and and then and then

531
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:14,169
if you're not happy today you're like of

532
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:15,730
course right I say so but that may not

533
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:18,400
be true for somebody else somebody else

534
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,140
has a very different relationship to how

535
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,810
they feel about themselves so I don't

536
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,240
know if there's a general statement that

537
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:28,179
can be said about that but but just

538
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,370
noticing and and the other reason I say

539
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,080
just noticing is because conclusions

540
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:34,509
that you come to I guess I said this but

541
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,429
they're usually wrong so but then the

542
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:38,769
second thing is just once you've had a

543
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,570
successful project this is why I

544
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:41,889
recommend people maybe do shorter things

545
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:44,859
first because you do something

546
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,420
successfully and you went through maybe

547
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:48,759
a little bit of that period of like oh

548
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,230
man I couldn't handle this right it felt

549
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,210
so terrible but then you actually come

550
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,059
to the end I see and your brain actually

551
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,559
sees that there was an end right that

552
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,259
you got a bit I mean hopefully your

553
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,639
project didn't totally fail right one of

554
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:02,470
the reasons I think why a state burned

555
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,780
out after the first time was our project

556
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,069
was not successful right we got a few

557
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:07,750
players but it was successful in the

558
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:10,029
sense that I learned but he was not

559
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,309
financially successful nobody played it

560
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:13,980
I got no external validation from the

561
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:17,019
world right

562
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,210
but with braids I did and then it was

563
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:20,710
easier to get up and do a longer thing

564
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,660
because of that point your brain knows

565
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,950
it's like okay there there I'm gonna

566
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,140
have to go through a bunch of stuff do

567
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,970
this but I believe now that there is a

568
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,640
light dinner somewhat you you Sam I

569
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,930
believe right what are the properties of

570
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,490
being and I don't know you're probably a

571
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,350
little further than this right now but

572
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,329
when you're in the middle of development

573
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:38,740
and like that we talked about this last

574
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:39,939
year so don't go too far into is the

575
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,500
discussion of it last year but you're in

576
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,910
the middle of development and the to-do

577
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,630
list just gets longer and longer and

578
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:48,790
longer right so the if you extrapolate

579
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,790
that it goes to infinity right your game

580
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:55,649
will never be finished right in reality

581
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:56,940
that'll collapse down eventually but at

582
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,110
some point it's like wandering through

583
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,850
the desert and your brain doesn't

584
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:01,319
believe it's ever going to end but if

585
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:03,599
you have the past experience of like no

586
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,669
this is just like last time and it did

587
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,409
end you can at least remind yourself of

588
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,300
that at a rational level and then maybe

589
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,160
you can invoke some imagery to like help

590
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,019
with this right so just any kind of

591
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,630
standard mental things that you find

592
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:17,129
work well just use those to try and get

593
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,300
that association and be able to kind of

594
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:21,030
pull yourself out of it a little better

595
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:22,710
you know connect yourself back to the

596
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:24,930
time when you're like I did feel this

597
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,519
way in the past and it got better like I

598
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,560
don't need to despair kind of thing but

599
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:30,569
of course that advice is limited to the

600
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,980
portion of people who have had a success

601
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:37,169
yes first time through good yeah okay so

602
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,640
I guess I'll open that up to anyone else

603
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,080
too because I mean everyone here has had

604
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,020
to go through long projects so does

605
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,970
anyone have any kind of I think there's

606
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:46,319
a the problem is that most games and

607
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:50,579
game companies are started with a sense

608
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:52,200
of optimism that is you just have this

609
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,309
belief that like you're gonna get

610
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,890
something done in a certain period of

611
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:57,299
time and and as John mentioned the the

612
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,370
task list grows longer and longer and

613
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,659
it's the discovered work that you didn't

614
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:02,429
think about until you got to that point

615
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,940
in the project you realized oh we don't

616
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,890
have a solution

617
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,180
we haven't thought about that yet well

618
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,310
that's more people and you know you've

619
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,440
already got a budget and you see the

620
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:11,460
money dwindling and the scope increasing

621
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,710
and it's hard to figure out how to get

622
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,720
through that and so even if you want to

623
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,220
do things like oh maybe if I just took a

624
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,529
little bit more time off or if I just

625
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,350
gave really a week off well we had money

626
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:23,849
to do that that'd be great but we can't

627
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:25,469
so I do think I actually want to tell

628
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:26,789
you one story where that did happen now

629
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,860
I mean I was three years into Guild Wars

630
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,359
and that happened where it was it just

631
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,799
seemed like we would never be able to

632
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,619
release the project and ultimately took

633
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,909
us five years so I mean I think it's

634
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:37,259
really common in game development and I

635
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,820
think the thing you really have to do is

636
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,410
figure out ways to get yourself out of

637
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:42,569
the headspace of what you're working on

638
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,670
and do something else so that you're not

639
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:46,349
just keep you know grinding away against

640
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,480
the problem your brain needs time to

641
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:50,429
actually do other things and in fact I

642
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,079
mentioned this during the last talk but

643
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,250
if you spend too much time doing one

644
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,259
thing and you don't get enough sleep

645
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:57,210
then you're actually are preventing that

646
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:59,099
your your brain from performing properly

647
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,809
you won't generate the chemicals you

648
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,219
need to remember things for example and

649
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,609
so it's important to actually have some

650
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,400
space away from what you're working on

651
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:07,479
your mind can actually rest so you have

652
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,580
a better chance to go back at those

653
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,870
things I think need to triage I figure I

654
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:12,909
like okay well we can't do everything

655
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:16,389
and that's the way that you ship games

656
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:18,250
is by triage so is is it generally the

657
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,259
case that or I mean I shouldn't say

658
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,359
Chandler case but does it sometimes

659
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:24,190
serve as an indicator that like if I'm

660
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,839
having sort of absolutely crushing

661
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,420
feeling of like this is not gonna good

662
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:30,279
like it's just epically messed up or

663
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,950
whatever that that maybe is also a good

664
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:35,440
indication go okay maybe step back take

665
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,200
a little time but then maybe let's think

666
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,759
about can we you know break this up can

667
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,529
we do something like can we can we pull

668
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,298
back a little bit I mean when you say

669
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:45,548
triage is that do those things tend to

670
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:46,929
go together meaning is the time for

671
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:48,490
triage when you're when you're just like

672
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:50,950
in that headspace and can't see a way

673
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,990
out of it or not well I think you you

674
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,669
probably have to because it's hard to

675
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,519
just sort of step away and like well I'm

676
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,840
just gonna not do this right you you're

677
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,429
you know the people that you're working

678
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,949
with they're depending on you to keep

679
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:04,750
money flowing into the studio and so you

680
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,640
can't stop for too long so you do have

681
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,160
to be capable of doing this even when

682
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,690
you're feeling badly about but I mean

683
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,040
there's great examples of teams that

684
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,240
have done this I mean Blizzard obviously

685
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,980
has enormous amounts of money that they

686
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,900
can spend right but they had a project

687
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,250
where they spent many movie dollars like

688
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,750
40 or 60 million dollars or the

689
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,819
estimates for Titan and and like they

690
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,960
had nothing at the end and but they they

691
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:24,039
step back and they thought about it and

692
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,390
they said you know we really want to

693
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,649
prove ourselves and they went back and

694
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,210
they did overwatch and it really short

695
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,740
period of time by thinking about what

696
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:33,850
they had and what assets they're they're

697
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:35,798
able to put together and so in some

698
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:37,359
sense it's like hey maybe we can't

699
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:39,369
actually succeed down this path but

700
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,229
maybe we can pick a path that we could

701
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:43,239
succeed down but isn't that far away

702
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,130
from where we are right now kind of

703
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,669
thing that's producing I think when

704
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:50,470
you're doing triage to I don't think you

705
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:53,049
want to do triage kind of at the height

706
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,829
of your panic and paranoia you want to

707
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:59,230
do it the next morning it's like get out

708
00:27:56,829 --> 00:28:00,819
of that out of that headspace where

709
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,919
everything is doomed and is totally

710
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:04,599
up because if you do that you'll

711
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,179
just start hacking stuff out of your

712
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,649
triage until you feel back but ok if you

713
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,009
kind of wait till the next morning you

714
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,750
mean metaphorically the next morning

715
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:14,480
that is your you're in a better

716
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:16,460
headspace so now go okay let's triage

717
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,349
let's look realistically at how much

718
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,650
time we have mom which money we have and

719
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:23,689
the list of things to do all right so I

720
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:26,269
think that's actually really good I

721
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,470
believe that is well beyond what I was

722
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:28,670
thinking there's your answer to that

723
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:35,240
question because it's kind of a tough

724
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:38,779
one I let me grab one here see so this

725
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,940
one is for Pat and it's on like it

726
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:44,750
actually uses two acronyms that I don't

727
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,430
know so I'm not sure I wasn't sure about

728
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,019
them but I'll give you the first part

729
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:52,039
first of /li two parts and this is more

730
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:53,690
of a code question the question is are

731
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:56,529
there any differences between debugging

732
00:28:53,690 --> 00:29:00,920
an on net game like a non networked game

733
00:28:56,529 --> 00:29:02,839
and an MMORPG game meaning the approach

734
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,750
to debugging that you take is it just

735
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,459
the same kind of debugging that you

736
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,779
would normally be doing just now there

737
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,190
happens to be network involved or is it

738
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:13,609
like the fundamental approach to

739
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:15,890
debugging changes in some way and sort

740
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:17,719
of the chaser on that was are there any

741
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,940
like silver bullets for debugging in

742
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,250
MMORPG like techniques you would employ

743
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,750
for these that you know might you might

744
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,980
not have think thought of are come

745
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,650
across because they are really only

746
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,880
applicable in this sort of scenario so I

747
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,220
do think that there is a silver bullet

748
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,720
which is rare and software and that is

749
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,490
that if you can figure out how to make

750
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,380
your game replayable from the same set

751
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,720
of inputs then you can reproduce the

752
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,220
same set of bugs and so the trick would

753
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,589
be you know you're recording every input

754
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,880
and the timestamps and it's actually

755
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:45,559
pretty easy to do in single-player games

756
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,180
because they're not jittering that much

757
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:48,470
input and you've got you know giant

758
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,110
disks that you can store everything on

759
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,819
and so like just write everything and

760
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:54,500
then you should be able to play that

761
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:55,609
simulation back into your game in it if

762
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,259
you did everything right then it should

763
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:58,189
crash the same way right and that's

764
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:59,960
something that you have to put the work

765
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,180
in upfront to make sure that your engine

766
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,680
is capable of doing that but then it's

767
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,360
real easy to debug and that really

768
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,730
naturally extends to multiplayer as well

769
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,059
and in fact we built Guild Wars that way

770
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:12,110
so it was game recording for crash

771
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:13,429
discovery and it turns out it actually

772
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:15,559
has some additional features which is

773
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,299
you can do load testing just from lots

774
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:18,649
of streams at the same time and then

775
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:20,029
also it ended up being a user feature

776
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,530
and that you can play recordings back

777
00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:22,200
for players you can stream it out to

778
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:24,059
other people

779
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,769
clients they can watch the game so I

780
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,539
think it is it's super useful if you're

781
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:29,670
if you're architect your engine like

782
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:32,279
that is it possible to architect an

783
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:33,779
engine that way with multi-threading

784
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:36,930
these days though because at some level

785
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:38,339
recording inputs only works if those are

786
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,990
the only inputs or with multi-threading

787
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:41,459
the scheduler or the OS scheduler is

788
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,579
kind of a separate input which is kind

789
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,009
of hard to record have you worked on any

790
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:48,960
projects since that jump kind of

791
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:52,470
happened or is that like kind of a thing

792
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,910
that's like well yeah you could I mean

793
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,519
run the game single threaded or

794
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,440
something or I don't know well if you

795
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:01,259
look at each of the the agents in your

796
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,250
game as like an actor right actor model

797
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,720
program and then each one of those

798
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,849
things can be played back independently

799
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,680
yeah and so you can just record their

800
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:08,879
own input streams so they're isolated

801
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,259
from other components now as soon as you

802
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,870
start sharing memory then it becomes

803
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:15,539
really problematic and often times you

804
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:16,949
know what looks like an actor simulation

805
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:22,049
is only a global variable bashing

806
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:23,039
simulation like if you had at some point

807
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:25,409
assuming that the thing is

808
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,089
multi-threaded in you know sufficiently

809
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:29,310
you're going to have shared resources

810
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:31,379
that are contended in some way and the

811
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:33,539
order in which people hit them is not

812
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,730
going to be deterministic necessarily so

813
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:37,559
I I'm only bringing this up now because

814
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,630
this is something that I thought about a

815
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,859
bunch like I've you know worked on code

816
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,440
bases in the past where it did have

817
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:44,579
input recording and code base I'm

818
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,500
working out now I would love to have

819
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:48,659
been pouring could not really figure out

820
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,779
a way to do it at least not the way that

821
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,070
I used to do it given the fact that all

822
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:55,349
kinds of things are multi-threaded

823
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:57,149
internally now it seemed like you would

824
00:31:55,349 --> 00:32:00,299
have to start recording the multi

825
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:02,370
threads like when people were taking you

826
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:03,839
know mutexes or something would have to

827
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:05,969
be part of the recording or something

828
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,259
like that I never really quite got to

829
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,640
the point where something about that

830
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,710
please do because it seems to me there's

831
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,930
two different classes of bugs right

832
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:16,110
there's one class of bug that's like

833
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:19,049
some kind of thread related bug yeah in

834
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:21,869
which case yeah that's that's always

835
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:24,210
that kind of situation yeah if it's a

836
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:26,489
kind of bug where it's like something

837
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,079
about the actual logic independent of

838
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,180
the implementation and the timing and

839
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,679
stuff then the way that you tend to

840
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,830
think about input recording is like it

841
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,690
happens on frame boundaries or something

842
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:40,220
and then if you're if you're threading

843
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:42,860
causes results that are gonna differ

844
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,230
inch differ beyond one frame anyway then

845
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:47,119
maybe that's about like like if the

846
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,680
coordinate of your object ends up

847
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:53,349
slightly different if this job runs

848
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:56,390
before this job then that's a little bit

849
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:57,829
you at least want to know that right

850
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,660
like I don't know if you do anything

851
00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:00,949
about it but and in some cases that

852
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,570
might be intractable I guess for

853
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,039
performance reasons like I don't want to

854
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:06,319
get super picky about the order edge

855
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:08,119
collision resolves but well I'm more

856
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,409
thinking of it because this is not a

857
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,239
thing we're not talking about something

858
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:13,850
that we ship to end-users necessarily oh

859
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,650
man you made for the point is this is

860
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:17,119
not something that's used necessarily in

861
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,740
the course of actually doing so in the

862
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,229
game this is strictly for debugging and

863
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,059
so one of the most common bugs you can

864
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,339
have in a multi-threaded engine is a

865
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:27,679
threading bug so it seemed like it was

866
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:29,209
like well if I'm you know if my idea

867
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,460
here is that this is for debugging the

868
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,170
system saying that a whole class of bugs

869
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,750
which are bugs were very likely to have

870
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,360
in any kind you know in the kind of code

871
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,950
that it cares about this seemed like a

872
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:43,969
problem it doesn't mean you can't still

873
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:46,250
use the system for once it is multi

874
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,450
thread bug free now you can still play

875
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,099
it back in the same way but I was just

876
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,420
curious because you know it wouldn't

877
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:52,669
surprise me if someone said oh no no

878
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:54,710
just just do this they have changed all

879
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,630
your mutexes into this thing which logs

880
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,519
who took the mutex win or something and

881
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,620
then we just replayed them in that order

882
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:03,079
which you know theory might work but I

883
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:04,489
don't know it's really if you think

884
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:07,549
about processors getting more and more

885
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,869
cores than what's right than is the kind

886
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,579
of solution is going to be more and more

887
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:11,929
difficult to debug and so what you

888
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:13,309
really need is a system that looks at

889
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:15,168
the work you have to do more like a job

890
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:16,820
system yeah and so jobs you know it's

891
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,839
like here's a set of inputs go off and

892
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,220
do something and then there's a set of

893
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,590
outputs and so that's eminently

894
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:23,629
recordable is it though I mean because

895
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,000
you don't know you mean recordable in

896
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,980
the sense that just record which Cora's

897
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,239
got which jobs and then just do that

898
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,760
again when we come through so the

899
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:35,418
basically the job system now will record

900
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,770
that order and play it back so right now

901
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:38,029
so there are certain types of bugs that

902
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:39,849
you can't stop right like memory

903
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:43,870
corruption bugs are just nasty because

904
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:45,190
anywhere yeah so I've often found this

905
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:47,409
is now going totally off with this

906
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:52,659
person's question I've hijacked the

907
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:54,579
thread so on that topic I would be

908
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:58,329
interested to know your opinion on this

909
00:34:54,579 --> 00:35:01,509
so I find oftentimes that the job system

910
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:04,799
model is less good than I like it to be

911
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,640
for the reason that often times things

912
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,870
you know the parts of the

913
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,299
multi-threading that I care about in

914
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:12,670
terms of performance stuff tend to want

915
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,390
to do just very grief access to a shared

916
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,980
structure rather than reserving that

917
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:20,799
access for the entire length of their

918
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:22,269
job and that's the kind of bug that I

919
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,010
tend to be worried about in this

920
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:25,509
scenario because you know it's typically

921
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,650
like a little hand coded thing that

922
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:30,010
maybe you made because this is a

923
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:32,889
critical component or whatever would you

924
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:35,200
say the same thing or are you more of

925
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:37,449
the opinion that no generally there

926
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,189
should just be job system and that sort

927
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:40,569
of manages resource locking in you

928
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,670
really shouldn't have much in the way of

929
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:46,180
custom kinds of multi-threaded stuff

930
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:48,010
happening yeah well I mean well you get

931
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:49,329
into claim rendering and stuff it can be

932
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,740
really complicated but in general I

933
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:52,239
think that it's better to try and use

934
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:54,250
job systems where you have larger blocks

935
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,899
that you can separate off and okay so in

936
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,179
a way I supposed to like here's a loop

937
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,980
I'm gonna have ten threads all run in

938
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:02,109
the same loop and do different parts of

939
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,119
it at the same time and so do you

940
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,980
usually see job systems as having sort

941
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,929
of that locking happen sort of at the

942
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,360
head end basically like okay this person

943
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:12,909
needs to access the database or

944
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,410
something like this so we will just not

945
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:16,329
let any of the other threads access the

946
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:18,039
database at that time or something so

947
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:19,389
that we don't have to have some kind of

948
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:22,179
a fine-grained locking mechanism in

949
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:24,460
there just doing an example out you

950
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:26,440
would prefer to generally say one thread

951
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,760
gets one resource and then you just try

952
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,309
to architect your resources so that's

953
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,320
not too bad or yeah or you would use

954
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:33,699
something like this is a much more

955
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,930
complicated solution but something like

956
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:39,189
post crests MVCC which is sure I can

957
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:41,379
actually pull out what the acronym

958
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,880
stands for but the idea multi-version

959
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,349
concurrency control I think is you have

960
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,970
lots of different versions of the thing

961
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:47,469
and you when you lock it the version

962
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:49,089
that you have stays constant for the

963
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:50,349
duration and the job even though other

964
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,350
people are getting later versions are

965
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:54,920
the same

966
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:57,380
data so then like your your job system

967
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,059
has version 34 of the data and can use

968
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,440
it and not worry about it changing out

969
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:02,779
from underneath it during the course of

970
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,280
the operation so that's assuming that

971
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,710
you have a system where that particular

972
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,800
piece of data doesn't have to be sort of

973
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,510
meaning the access to it is mostly

974
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,490
read-only I assume because rights will

975
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,720
now possibly collide with each other or

976
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:16,669
something like this or maybe you resolve

977
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,399
those after the fact yeah you're just

978
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:22,309
using a stale version that I feel like

979
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,690
that's a very domain-specific right and

980
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:26,659
there's some cases when you can't do

981
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:28,670
that like hypothetical situation really

982
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:33,649
say you were dumb enough to try and

983
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:35,869
multi thread a compiler and you've got a

984
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,519
job system right so you've got a basic

985
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:39,650
job system that goes off and does things

986
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,170
and one of the jobs is like walk the

987
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,730
syntax tree and figure out the types of

988
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,400
all the expressions in the syntax tree

989
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,380
right

990
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,720
well if you lock the syntax tree as a

991
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,780
resource now you're not parallel anymore

992
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,339
right even if you lock a subtree of the

993
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,980
syntax tree you're gonna in that way

994
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,900
that like locks pile up really fast yes

995
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:03,289
that's just gonna happen right so what

996
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:05,720
you really want to do is you know some

997
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:07,250
kind of like lock free thing that uses a

998
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:09,049
very small amount of data that may be

999
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,570
like that data lives in the node and you

1000
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:15,590
do compare exchanges or whatever you do

1001
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:20,660
to like just atomically change that one

1002
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:22,640
value right and I don't not having

1003
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:29,750
completed that part of things yet

1004
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:31,759
because it's full I don't I don't see on

1005
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,159
the one hand I don't see another way to

1006
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,420
possibly do it I mean there are like you

1007
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,730
could okay

1008
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,470
the syntax tree is laid out somehow flat

1009
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:42,829
in memory and we've got a read-only copy

1010
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:45,339
and occasionally we like blitt parts of

1011
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:47,989
it to the new copy to try and update but

1012
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,670
that seems almost as complicated and it

1013
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:51,139
has performance penalties that you're

1014
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,110
making multiple copies of this thing

1015
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:56,139
that you'd rather only have one of but I

1016
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:58,309
don't I don't see another way to do it

1017
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:59,599
well in that particular circumstance

1018
00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:01,610
it's definitely one of the things we're

1019
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,349
like in a game in general you've got

1020
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,200
lots of different work that you could be

1021
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:07,029
doing so then job systems

1022
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:08,859
to be things that can sort of be more

1023
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,330
effective because hey there's all this

1024
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,380
different stuff to do chances are they

1025
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:13,509
don't all need to do the same data

1026
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,400
whereas the compilers like look we're

1027
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,050
just doing the syntax pad that's all we

1028
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,150
can be doing right now so there's not

1029
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,530
like a lot of opportunity to say go do

1030
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,940
those other things you were going to do

1031
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,650
and let me just play with sentence you

1032
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,210
to bring it back more to mainstream

1033
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,210
games a little bit I feel like it's if

1034
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,619
you wanted to parallelize your AI

1035
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,059
without taking performance hits of

1036
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:33,190
duplicating your knowledge base all the

1037
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:35,650
time right like what how do you do that

1038
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,269
it's just gonna get hairy unless

1039
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:41,260
somebody comes up with something that

1040
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:42,670
I've never heard of right so maybe part

1041
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,850
of what you do as an engineer is like

1042
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:47,800
don't do that or you make your system

1043
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:52,659
fast in other ways or you buy I don't

1044
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:56,110
know yeah I mean I feel like if you can

1045
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:57,879
just have a job system and serialize at

1046
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,630
the job level to reproduce the work that

1047
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,670
sounds great

1048
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,200
yeah I mean if you can get to that point

1049
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:06,490
it does sound pretty good because then

1050
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:08,289
you know the other I suppose aspect of

1051
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:10,479
that is that if you do have a job system

1052
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:12,130
that you can record you can also look at

1053
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,949
your efficiency that way you can look at

1054
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:17,380
the job systems records and say how much

1055
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:19,359
how many longer jobs waiting how you

1056
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,160
know when did jobs go in and now it's a

1057
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,390
it could be a useful debugging tool for

1058
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:24,849
things that had nothing to do with

1059
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:26,829
catching you know breaking bugs it could

1060
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:28,269
be stuff for I just wanted to know how

1061
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:29,380
my scheduler was working maybe there's

1062
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:31,090
things I could do to make my schedule or

1063
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,769
better like where are the bubbles and so

1064
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,630
the recording of a job system could have

1065
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:40,059
another benefit I suppose in that way

1066
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:41,500
but all right that was a I I thought we

1067
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:43,179
were going to have like I was worried if

1068
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,619
we ran out of questions before the time

1069
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:50,379
that's not going to happen and there's

1070
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:51,789
zero chance of that so I'm gonna ask the

1071
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,349
part of the question now that had the

1072
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:54,759
acronyms I don't understand so you can

1073
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:56,019
either skip this one if nobody knows

1074
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,620
what they are or someone could tell me

1075
00:40:56,019 --> 00:41:05,559
what they mean the question was for data

1076
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:07,869
analysis such as da you or ARP you daily

1077
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:08,820
active users and OH Everage revenue per

1078
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:12,599
user okay

1079
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,600
the single-player game

1080
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:21,360
okay do you have separate systems for

1081
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,089
game manager or operation department

1082
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,039
access did the data come does the data

1083
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:29,610
typically come directly from reading the

1084
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:31,380
database and they sort of had a little

1085
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,910
explanation here about why they're

1086
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,610
interested in this they're saying the

1087
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:37,739
former company they worked for accessing

1088
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:39,690
the database affects players who are

1089
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:42,299
online so they had to wait for them to

1090
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,639
go to sleep typically to do this sort of

1091
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,070
thing then read daily reports about the

1092
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,989
money that they spent and so on and so

1093
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:51,210
they were just saying like how does this

1094
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:52,709
sort of thing work and I guess implicit

1095
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,809
the question is a more well working

1096
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,090
system than the one that this company

1097
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:58,590
that has not named has yeah well so the

1098
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:01,860
first thing is that you want to have

1099
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:03,750
multiple databases you have a you know a

1100
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:06,300
transactional database what's called

1101
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,650
OLTP online transaction processing which

1102
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,360
is sort of like your bank of knowledge

1103
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,180
that players are using and then you have

1104
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:15,539
want to have a I think it's ap which is

1105
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,829
your analytics database and there they

1106
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:18,480
could be optimized to be different types

1107
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:20,069
of databases right like ones a

1108
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,320
traditional sequel database there is a

1109
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,600
column store database because you need

1110
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,890
to roll up columns and that is that

1111
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,500
you're replicating your data from your

1112
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:29,969
your you know store of true knowledge

1113
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,519
about what players have in their

1114
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:35,129
accounts to your other database you do

1115
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:36,449
it like every four eight hours once a

1116
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,519
day something like that so your

1117
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:40,139
analytics are gonna be out of date but

1118
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:42,599
it's not as essential right you don't

1119
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:43,949
need five minute interval on most of the

1120
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,569
data that you're looking at you know

1121
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:47,819
like getting a report in the morning

1122
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,720
what happened yesterday is is you know

1123
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,289
can be very useful

1124
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,569
and so yeah you should have basis for

1125
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:56,130
that problem and so when you have

1126
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:58,830
multiple databases for these things is

1127
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:01,320
there is the structure always the same

1128
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:02,699
for these or is like is there a I write

1129
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,960
through one database and then it writes

1130
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:05,759
out to another database kind of a

1131
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,260
pattern for it or is it always like the

1132
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,730
game writes to both databases or the

1133
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,440
server rather writes about databases or

1134
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,760
like what's the is there anything tricky

1135
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,470
about that or just like it doesn't

1136
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,030
matter that's not relevant yeah there's

1137
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:16,709
lots of different ways to do it one is

1138
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:18,220
just you're replicating to a slave

1139
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,108
database okay and then

1140
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:21,819
you know it's it's capable of answering

1141
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:25,539
different set of queries because they're

1142
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,859
all read queries okay like also the you

1143
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:28,509
know I say database right like there's

1144
00:43:26,858 --> 00:43:29,529
only two of them but one thing is you're

1145
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,640
taking in all this data and you've got

1146
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:32,019
your master database and you've got all

1147
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:35,559
these events and then you've got like a

1148
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:37,690
slew of like third party tools you know

1149
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:39,699
like your own internal databases and

1150
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,019
external companies that analyze your

1151
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:42,250
data and so you want to think about it

1152
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:43,929
not as there's a central point of

1153
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,400
knowledge but rather there's a stream of

1154
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,598
events that goes wherever you need to go

1155
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,340
in order to be able to answer different

1156
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:50,200
types of questions whether it's the

1157
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,530
operations team looking at you know

1158
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:56,500
player behavior for security purposes to

1159
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:58,690
identify bot players or you know the the

1160
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,550
marketing team looking at analytics to

1161
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,450
discover whether the things the offers

1162
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:06,670
that they're making are working

1163
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:11,618
effectively did anyone I assume but I

1164
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:15,460
think the only single single player okay

1165
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:19,720
I think that was all from from that

1166
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:24,190
question set so let's go to question 4

1167
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:27,389
this was Tommy and John and this was an

1168
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:29,588
anonymous submitted question so it was

1169
00:44:27,389 --> 00:44:31,420
both braid and super meatboy were

1170
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:32,980
extremely successful games I'm wondering

1171
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,170
if there are parts of the game

1172
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,240
that you weren't quite happy with and

1173
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:40,030
that you would have liked to spend more

1174
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:42,779
time on or is everything exactly the way

1175
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,780
that you wanted it

1176
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,940
I asked this question not because I'm at

1177
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,889
all wondering what the answer is but

1178
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,510
more just because I feel like the fact

1179
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:54,429
that it was asked kind of means maybe we

1180
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:56,320
should talk a little bit here about the

1181
00:44:54,429 --> 00:45:04,118
reality of what you achieve when you're

1182
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:06,670
programming a game yeah there was a lot

1183
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:19,420
of stuff that I don't I don't like

1184
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:21,430
playing because I just like they're like

1185
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:23,680
content wise there was there was a lot

1186
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:25,000
of stuff that we wanted to add that it

1187
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,069
just came down to it and it was like

1188
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,969
well we can either add all that stuff

1189
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:33,609
and not come out on xbox or we can cut

1190
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:35,829
it all and be done with it and have it

1191
00:45:33,608 --> 00:45:40,000
come out on xbox and then you know go on

1192
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:42,069
with our lives so yeah there were there

1193
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,329
were several things I don't think I

1194
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,980
should name all of them because maybe

1195
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:49,900
they'll be in another one but probably

1196
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:53,230
not but you know yeah of course okay I I

1197
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:55,510
don't and maybe John had put everything

1198
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:57,670
in braids that he wanted yeah I have a

1199
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:02,950
different right so so the the triage

1200
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:04,869
discussion that was happy Riley's I've

1201
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:06,699
been fortunate enough to never be in

1202
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:08,769
that position like it was always a

1203
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:10,569
possibility to just keep working on the

1204
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:13,090
game so that's why the witness took a

1205
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:15,490
long time for example is because you

1206
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:17,619
know we could have said well we have to

1207
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:25,779
ship this you know in years where n is

1208
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:28,720
less than you know but but you know I

1209
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:31,230
always feel like well if you if you put

1210
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,519
some amount of time into something and

1211
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,230
you're really close to making something

1212
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:37,659
really great but it's gonna take more

1213
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:39,219
time if that's her goal of making

1214
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:41,500
something that's as good as you can make

1215
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:43,000
it then by shipping the thing that's not

1216
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,739
as good as you can make it and starting

1217
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,170
over you're just increasing your time to

1218
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:49,899
that goal okay right so if you don't

1219
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:51,460
have a financial forcing function like

1220
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,750
forcing you to ship and if you don't

1221
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:57,039
have a you know I'm gonna go insane if I

1222
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:59,840
ship is here or something right then

1223
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:02,449
like if your goal is to do good work you

1224
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,680
can do good work more good work in one

1225
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:04,969
game or you could split it among

1226
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:09,529
multiple games but it's still all good

1227
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:13,059
work right so neither braid nor the

1228
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:16,670
witness shipped with anything that I am

1229
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:17,719
you know it's sad about like the we kept

1230
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,369
working on the teeth there's always

1231
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:22,009
things that you didn't get to do right

1232
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:23,840
but you know if you start and the things

1233
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,070
are this big and you keep splitting the

1234
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,809
boulders or something and they get

1235
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,550
smaller and smaller the to-do list

1236
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:30,949
always gets longer but the items on the

1237
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:33,800
to-do list get smaller so the some of

1238
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:36,139
them in some calculus way eventually

1239
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:42,080
starts adding up to very small amounts

1240
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:43,940
right and you know you're summing a

1241
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,429
larger number of things like that where

1242
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:52,340
the number of things grows smaller than

1243
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:55,069
the size decreases anyway so there's

1244
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:57,590
stuff in both games that I didn't

1245
00:47:55,070 --> 00:48:01,010
totally you know that are not ideally

1246
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:02,329
perfect but there there are both games

1247
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:05,300
are way better than I thought they were

1248
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:08,088
going to be when we started okay great

1249
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,619
so you can't beat that I mean I mean

1250
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:10,820
with the witness the biggest problems we

1251
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:12,619
had our stuff that was beyond our

1252
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:15,109
control anyway like shipping an

1253
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:16,970
ambitious 3d game on the PC right now is

1254
00:48:15,108 --> 00:48:21,130
a nightmare we spent like two months

1255
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:26,929
just dealing with graphics driver things

1256
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:28,338
you know so then I don't even know what

1257
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:30,019
you do to prepare for I mean if we had a

1258
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:33,519
much larger budget we could have like

1259
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:36,579
giant testing a giant testing yeah but

1260
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:39,858
you know like the you know the Radeon

1261
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:47,059
3770 has a problem but the 37 90 and 60

1262
00:48:39,858 --> 00:48:48,409
don't right so that was really our

1263
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:50,059
biggest problem with the witness and it

1264
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:51,440
wasn't a problem with the game right it

1265
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:55,159
was just the environment that we read

1266
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,829
but you know Tommy where is the

1267
00:48:55,159 --> 00:49:01,259
crowd-sourced system configuration bug

1268
00:48:57,829 --> 00:49:03,989
database that we were promised last year

1269
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:07,230
okay so I'm wrong about a misremembering

1270
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:09,359
this no no my parts done except for the

1271
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:12,679
Linux and the Mac version I just don't

1272
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:21,420
have a web guy that's it's pretty much

1273
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:24,089
but you've got all the spare time it is

1274
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,800
very hard to find and I'm very sorry I

1275
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:27,780
don't mean this in the way that it's

1276
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:31,860
gonna sound it's very hard to famous

1277
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:34,200
last words tough finding a good web guy

1278
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:36,539
is difficult alright

1279
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:38,549
and I know this because I used to be a

1280
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:41,070
web guy and I consider myself one of the

1281
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:42,990
good guys because I wasn't a web guy I

1282
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:44,760
was just a software guy okay it's very

1283
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:49,250
hard to find a software guy that does

1284
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,250
web stuff because they're just doing not

1285
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:58,470
it's very painful because the thing I

1286
00:49:55,139 --> 00:50:00,329
wrote is simple but people just want to

1287
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:02,730
make it so complicated okay

1288
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:05,400
they put like 13,000 little systems is

1289
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:08,550
one thing so basically you're looking

1290
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:12,869
for somebody who can do the minimal

1291
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:17,269
amount of necessary web over 15

1292
00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:17,269
frameworks to serve five pages

1293
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:26,959
that's only three frameworks of page

1294
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,910
yeah okay but that is what you're

1295
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:36,000
actually waiting for is somebody who

1296
00:50:32,909 --> 00:50:37,920
would would do a good minimal job of a

1297
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,889
layer that could put this thing on the

1298
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:48,150
web basically yeah I'm trying to push

1299
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:54,299
matthew wagner it's like a web to finish

1300
00:50:48,150 --> 00:51:01,019
his game so we can do stuff okay I mean

1301
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:03,810
he's trying to fill a maybe once maybe

1302
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:05,550
once I have like a good dependable web

1303
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:08,969
person cuz I'm not doing that again

1304
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:11,310
okay I did I did my crappy PHP version

1305
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:13,769
of it okay it worked it looked like

1306
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:14,969
garbage okay I need I need something

1307
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:16,469
that's functional it doesn't look like

1308
00:51:14,969 --> 00:51:18,469
garbage and then and then yeah then

1309
00:51:16,469 --> 00:51:26,608
everybody can use it

1310
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:29,099
oh god okay so let's let's move on

1311
00:51:26,608 --> 00:51:35,130
before anyone says another jQuery from

1312
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:37,079
the audience okay so we're mostly down

1313
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,608
now let me see you got it we'll ask I'll

1314
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,130
ask a couple of we're mostly going to be

1315
00:51:38,608 --> 00:51:42,779
down to questions that were not directed

1316
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,730
at anyone they were just questions for

1317
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,940
everyone basically but I got a couple

1318
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:50,400
more here so Ron this question is from

1319
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,210
tomash I'm not gonna pronounce this one

1320
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,889
right either but even though they

1321
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:56,730
spelled it phonetically I'm gonna try

1322
00:51:52,889 --> 00:51:59,129
Tomas ruse Hahn ski ruse on ski I think

1323
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:01,230
if I'm getting that correct but they

1324
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:03,720
didn't list a city that they lived in so

1325
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:06,510
I'm not sure where they're from the

1326
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:09,029
question was was using pixel art in

1327
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:10,740
thimble we'd park your very first choice

1328
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:13,830
or did you consider some kind of

1329
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:15,959
stylized 3d like in the cave and they

1330
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:19,909
said what are the pros and cons of each

1331
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:22,949
approach in the project like this

1332
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:27,750
presumably part pixel art was our first

1333
00:52:22,949 --> 00:52:29,279
choice for that because we were the kind

1334
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,269
of the whole images of the Kickstarter

1335
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,920
it was real

1336
00:52:30,269 --> 00:52:34,110
you're kind of going back to what was

1337
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,630
the charm of maniac mansion in Monkey

1338
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:38,160
Island and you know my kind of thesis on

1339
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:41,550
that is it really has to do with the

1340
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:43,019
pixel art and so you know we kind of

1341
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,930
wanted to go back and look at that and

1342
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:49,199
go right is-is-is pixel art a key

1343
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:50,969
component in that in that charm and and

1344
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:54,029
I do happen to think it is because I

1345
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:55,559
think pixel art the you know the objects

1346
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:58,740
in the game or the actors in the game

1347
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:00,750
they're more they're more icons then

1348
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:03,599
they are actual things right it's like

1349
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:05,940
this is not a toaster it's an icon of a

1350
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,860
toaster right this is not a secret agent

1351
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,590
this is an icon of a secret agent

1352
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:13,380
because the pixel art just removed so

1353
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:14,670
much fidelity and that and I guess it's

1354
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,710
like the difference is reading a book

1355
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:19,349
versus watching a movie right players

1356
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:21,269
can fill in you know so much more about

1357
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:24,509
things where if you're doing these

1358
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:27,000
really nice like high-end you know even

1359
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:29,460
to the very high end 2d stuff you filled

1360
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,429
in so many blanks for the player so that

1361
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:35,820
was kind of you know our original idea

1362
00:53:32,429 --> 00:53:38,750
and so it really so that's very

1363
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:41,630
interesting so so essentially what what

1364
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:45,119
you're saying there is that like if you

1365
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:47,608
go high fidelity it's not simply the

1366
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,630
case that going high fidelity is you

1367
00:53:47,608 --> 00:53:49,469
know more difficult to write ever

1368
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,690
because it means you have to spend more

1369
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:54,059
art resources or more time optimizing it

1370
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:56,820
engine or something like this it

1371
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:58,858
actually fundamentally means that people

1372
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:00,390
lose the ability to apply a certain

1373
00:53:58,858 --> 00:54:02,670
amount of animation absolutely that's

1374
00:54:00,389 --> 00:54:04,379
going to manage the imagination to what

1375
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:07,170
they're seeing so you're sort of saying

1376
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:08,220
like literally they cannot have the same

1377
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:09,990
experience that they would have had

1378
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:11,909
because in one case we're telling them

1379
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:13,649
exactly what the experience is and

1380
00:54:11,909 --> 00:54:15,480
another one we're kind of saying here's

1381
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,369
a suggestion of what is in the

1382
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,800
experience and you're going to fill in

1383
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:23,010
what you sort of have in the background

1384
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,630
that's fascinating and and it doesn't

1385
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,550
mean that the pixel art is just you know

1386
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:28,410
crude and ugly and you know I stuff

1387
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,539
pixel art can still be incredibly

1388
00:54:28,409 --> 00:54:33,269
beautiful and you know artistically

1389
00:54:30,539 --> 00:54:35,730
drawn you know pixel art to me is not

1390
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:37,920
drawing high-res art and then going into

1391
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:41,039
Photoshop and then you know reducing the

1392
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:45,599
resolution right the pixel art is like

1393
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:47,400
hand placing every pixel you know where

1394
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,409
you want it to be for the scene so I

1395
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,740
think there is a real you know artistry

1396
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:56,460
to really really good pixel art and so

1397
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:58,649
there's a follow up to this question but

1398
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:01,500
I guess I'll I just want to sort of ask

1399
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:03,690
the part of the first one that it kind

1400
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,108
of I'm sure I'll say this they kind of

1401
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:08,700
alluded to which was they mentioned the

1402
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:10,710
cave and thimble Reed Park and then they

1403
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:12,358
sort of said are there pros and cons of

1404
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,070
each of the protis I'm stepping away

1405
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:15,960
from thimble we park which obviously

1406
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:17,460
just already like you said it's like no

1407
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,320
the goal of this was to have the screen

1408
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,050
so obviously we wouldn't consider doing

1409
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,769
some okay is there anything else in the

1410
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,600
pro's and con's

1411
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:26,159
other than the one we just sort of

1412
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:28,559
talked about which is that you lose that

1413
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:30,000
imagination part you know can you maybe

1414
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,949
say if there's anything else to mention

1415
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,059
there before we go yeah there are a lot

1416
00:55:31,949 --> 00:55:38,549
of pros and cons I mean just memory it's

1417
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:40,139
like you know the entire background for

1418
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:41,760
you know a background in thimble weed

1419
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:45,509
Park is you know less than a lot of

1420
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,869
icons people's desktop so you you

1421
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:50,580
certainly you know doing doing you know

1422
00:55:48,869 --> 00:55:52,470
really good pixel art you do save a lot

1423
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:54,299
you know intrusive memory I think the

1424
00:55:52,469 --> 00:55:55,858
other thing that's kind of a little bit

1425
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:58,320
advantage and it gets back a little bit

1426
00:55:55,858 --> 00:56:00,329
to the imagination thing is when you're

1427
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,000
kind of doing like characters the way we

1428
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:06,599
do into Bowie Park things don't have to

1429
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,639
work precisely and your mind kind of

1430
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:11,519
fills it in that's right a character

1431
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:14,069
kind of reach for a doorknob and they

1432
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:16,259
can really kind of not really touch the

1433
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,550
doorknob right right and because you're

1434
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:20,670
filling in so much of the same

1435
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:22,710
imagination you accept that we're if

1436
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:25,289
you're dealing with like really high end

1437
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:26,789
you know 2d art you start to notice that

1438
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:29,608
this person didn't touch the doorknob

1439
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:33,389
when right now for so there's a lot of a

1440
00:56:29,608 --> 00:56:35,369
lot of things that we can do because

1441
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:37,799
it's pixel art like that you know a lot

1442
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:40,650
of shortcuts that we can get away with

1443
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,180
it speed up development so it kind of

1444
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:43,500
keeps you away from having to deal with

1445
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:45,210
a lot of these sort of corner cases

1446
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,639
sorts of stuff that would come up yeah

1447
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,320
it's it's kind of like it's almost like

1448
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:51,989
the uncanny valley in a way

1449
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,940
right that the nicer your art becomes

1450
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:56,250
the more people expect everything to

1451
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:59,550
actually work correctly

1452
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:01,050
I see where if it isn't then so you

1453
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:03,090
kinda need to be on either side of that

1454
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,530
value like either we go pixel art and

1455
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,910
then people just kind of understand that

1456
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:08,100
this is a representational thing that

1457
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:10,500
they're seeing and you know they will

1458
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:12,420
fill in the gaps or we had better get

1459
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,920
all the way to the hand actually turns

1460
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:16,289
on the door otherwise people are gonna

1461
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:22,250
kind of notice the janky mists of that

1462
00:57:16,289 --> 00:57:25,230
yeah okay all right so same questioner

1463
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:27,900
also asked what was more important while

1464
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:29,670
designing the thimble we'd Park to

1465
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,440
innovate and push the genre forward or

1466
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:33,750
to preserve the warm fuzzy feeling of

1467
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,579
nostalgia how hard is it to resist the

1468
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:37,559
sweet taste of member Perry's they said

1469
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:38,880
I think you've kind of already answered

1470
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:41,849
this but I thought I'd just read it so

1471
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:45,150
you can answer it definitively that was

1472
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:47,219
a really really hard line right because

1473
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:50,639
you know we were trying to build a game

1474
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:52,919
that again captured the charm of those

1475
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:55,230
old games and I think a lot of what

1476
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,139
those games did is a part of that charm

1477
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:59,309
but on the other hand I think that you

1478
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:01,199
know if you look back at point-and-click

1479
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:03,779
adventures made around you know McGowen

1480
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:05,909
maniac mansion time there were a lot of

1481
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,920
flaws in them right I mean we are much

1482
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:10,409
better game designers than we were back

1483
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,150
then and and so there's just a lot of

1484
00:58:10,409 --> 00:58:13,679
stuff into Bowie Park where it's like

1485
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,970
you know what we want we want to kind of

1486
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:17,069
capture that charm thing but on the

1487
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:19,409
other hand we just want to get rid of

1488
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:21,510
all the stupid stuff right right and so

1489
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:23,489
we have spent a lot of time you know

1490
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:24,990
learning over the years and learning

1491
00:58:23,489 --> 00:58:26,459
from what other games have done games

1492
00:58:24,989 --> 00:58:27,929
you know like Firewatch and all this

1493
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,599
other stuff and how they approach things

1494
00:58:27,929 --> 00:58:32,399
you know you know what those same things

1495
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,969
can be applied to this point you click

1496
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,920
game so so it's like you know we kind of

1497
00:58:35,969 --> 00:58:39,869
describe it as we don't want the buiid

1498
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,750
part to look like an old point and click

1499
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:45,449
game we wanted to look like you remember

1500
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:46,619
those old games looking you know so it's

1501
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:48,299
like we're going to kind of take that

1502
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:50,219
aesthetic but we're just we're just

1503
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,080
going to kind of move it forward in a

1504
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:53,879
lot of design ways you mean Plus that we

1505
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,279
use shaders and all this other stuff in

1506
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,410
the pixel art that it's just it's more

1507
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,990
of what you're imagining

1508
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:01,940
imagine that Monkey Island actually

1509
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:05,000
looked like when you played it as a kid

1510
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:07,700
so you're kind of you know the person's

1511
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,989
brain has sort of completely painted

1512
00:59:07,699 --> 00:59:10,849
with a new brush what Monkey Island

1513
00:59:08,989 --> 00:59:12,439
looked like back then and the sort of

1514
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:13,670
thinking oh I love the artwork for Macau

1515
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,110
and whereas if we showed it to now they

1516
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:16,250
might be like oh that's not what I

1517
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:18,620
remember so you're kind of going for the

1518
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:20,329
more like this looks like your brains

1519
00:59:18,619 --> 00:59:21,859
image of Monkey Island even though this

1520
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:23,960
might not really be what monkey looks

1521
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:26,120
like and you know Marc Ferrari did all

1522
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,070
the art I think he put it best is like

1523
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:30,230
you know people want to go live in the

1524
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:40,460
Renaissance Faire they don't want to

1525
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:44,000
live in the Renaissance that's great all

1526
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:47,990
right well let's let's pick one of the

1527
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,969
other questions for everyone here this

1528
00:59:47,989 --> 00:59:54,369
question comes from William Bundy Bundy

1529
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:54,369
from Redlands California I think is here

1530
00:59:56,530 --> 01:00:03,290
he's in the booth there he is

1531
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:05,900
the question is how do you approach

1532
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:07,730
making and designing in-house tools do

1533
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,950
you devote time to designing workflows

1534
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:12,079
for them and what do you want from

1535
01:00:09,949 --> 01:00:13,579
third-party tools other than fundamental

1536
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,750
things like stability speed and

1537
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:16,009
functionality those are kind two

1538
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:18,469
separate questions so we'll just start

1539
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:21,940
with the beginning one which is just

1540
01:00:18,469 --> 01:00:24,139
like how do you approach in-house tools

1541
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:28,030
sounds like Tommy approaches them by if

1542
01:00:24,139 --> 01:00:31,670
he had nothing else to do dot-dot-dot

1543
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:33,800
honestly yeah that's kind of he makes an

1544
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:35,119
in-house tool it really is so does

1545
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,200
anyone want to start on that one I don't

1546
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,250
know it's clear like how do you approach

1547
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:39,019
making them or how do you approach

1548
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:42,110
deciding whether you're going to make

1549
01:00:39,019 --> 01:00:44,960
one I to be honest I'd like to hear the

1550
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:47,269
answer to that first one for sure I was

1551
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,610
sorry the second one like how do you

1552
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:52,070
know because you always there's always

1553
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:54,079
some jankier solution you can do that

1554
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:56,570
doesn't involve making a tool right like

1555
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,639
some weird I type self ode to win but is

1556
01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:00,740
that Excel files for the win Excel a

1557
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:02,719
sell files for the way so there's always

1558
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:04,219
something you could do that doesn't

1559
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:05,929
involve making your own tool so the

1560
01:01:04,219 --> 01:01:08,809
question is yeah I'd like I'd like to

1561
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:09,608
know how do you figure out when to make

1562
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:12,338
them win not that

1563
01:01:09,608 --> 01:01:14,558
that'd be pretty well for my stuff I

1564
01:01:12,338 --> 01:01:16,358
usually spend a lot of time looking

1565
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:19,509
around and see if I can find a tool that

1566
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:22,150
would do what I need okay and if I can't

1567
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:24,309
find that tool then you all kind of go

1568
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:26,499
in to doing them and obviously I mean

1569
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:30,039
even doing pixel art I really don't want

1570
01:01:26,498 --> 01:01:31,538
to build a you know a graphical editor

1571
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:32,829
that can do pixel stuff I look at

1572
01:01:31,539 --> 01:01:34,420
Photoshop and I go you know what this

1573
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:36,430
can do what we need okay

1574
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:38,710
so it's like I don't need to rebuild

1575
01:01:36,429 --> 01:01:40,088
this whole for that but other things you

1576
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:42,548
know I really felt I need to build this

1577
01:01:40,088 --> 01:01:45,130
tool for this right I can hand edit text

1578
01:01:42,548 --> 01:01:47,079
files or I can find some off-the-shelf

1579
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:49,239
thing that we're gonna fight with the

1580
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:50,380
entire project and you just kind of said

1581
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:53,559
you know what this is worth my

1582
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:55,539
investment you know to spend your time

1583
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:57,220
and in thimble we park you know we had a

1584
01:01:55,539 --> 01:01:58,630
tool that laid out all the rooms you

1585
01:01:57,219 --> 01:02:00,219
know where you kind of put all the

1586
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:02,259
images in position and tagged all the

1587
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:04,929
hotspots and lay down all the lock boxes

1588
01:02:02,259 --> 01:02:06,400
and you know I kind of decided early on

1589
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:08,048
you know it's gonna take me probably two

1590
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,450
months to build this tool that's

1591
01:02:08,048 --> 01:02:12,759
probably worth it okay and I just

1592
01:02:10,449 --> 01:02:14,768
decided upfront okay two months I'm

1593
01:02:12,759 --> 01:02:16,568
gonna build this tool because it's such

1594
01:02:14,768 --> 01:02:18,399
a workhorse on the project and there

1595
01:02:16,568 --> 01:02:21,068
just is nothing else out there that is

1596
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,858
like this which I guess kind of tends to

1597
01:02:21,068 --> 01:02:26,230
tends to be what you do see in a lot of

1598
01:02:23,858 --> 01:02:28,150
game engines is that like are the map

1599
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:29,469
construction process or whatever you

1600
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:31,568
will where you're kind of pulling assets

1601
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:33,368
together and making and I think I think

1602
01:02:31,568 --> 01:02:35,199
that's the only custom tool on the

1603
01:02:33,369 --> 01:02:37,960
project everything else is off-the-shelf

1604
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:39,848
stuff and so is that something that you

1605
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:42,278
it sounds like that was entirely

1606
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:44,289
foresight I guess in the sense that you

1607
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:46,568
did not start doing this thing without

1608
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:47,980
the tool and then realize that this was

1609
01:02:46,568 --> 01:02:50,108
a bottleneck in production or something

1610
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:52,150
like this and then go do it you were

1611
01:02:50,108 --> 01:02:53,498
more just like and this may be because

1612
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:55,329
you've had so much experience with these

1613
01:02:53,498 --> 01:02:57,730
kinds of games though but you were just

1614
01:02:55,329 --> 01:02:59,650
like I just know this is gonna be a

1615
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:01,358
problem so I'm just gonna do it right up

1616
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:03,309
front yeah cuz we had a very similar

1617
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:05,348
tool in this come system that kind of

1618
01:03:03,309 --> 01:03:08,798
did the exact same thing and I just knew

1619
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:11,798
how important it was and how much people

1620
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:14,199
use that thing that I just knew doing

1621
01:03:11,798 --> 01:03:16,119
this I need a tool like this when you

1622
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:18,669
were doing it on scum how did that tool

1623
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:20,140
come about was it you know wet when did

1624
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:22,030
people figure out we should probably

1625
01:03:20,139 --> 01:03:24,519
build one of these well that was very

1626
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:26,230
ganic because you know what we're doing

1627
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:28,480
the first version and maniac mention in

1628
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:30,849
the Commodore 64 I mean it literally was

1629
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,949
hand editing text files to get

1630
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:35,980
everything positioned and that just kind

1631
01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:39,759
of grew slowly over time to get that

1632
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:41,260
tool okay I think when the equation

1633
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,030
comes down to how big your game is gonna

1634
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:45,130
be and so how many people you envision

1635
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:47,500
working on it and the fidelity of

1636
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:50,050
execution that you need okay right so if

1637
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,820
something like an you know animation

1638
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:54,010
right animation people really care about

1639
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:55,600
it's got to look good and so if your

1640
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:56,830
animators have to go and edit text files

1641
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,920
which is the way that some games

1642
01:03:56,829 --> 01:04:01,569
actually worked in the old days then you

1643
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,800
know the iteration cycle is really slow

1644
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:05,080
for the artists and they're not going to

1645
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,280
get that fidelity and so and especially

1646
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:07,480
if you've got a whole bunch of animators

1647
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,070
they're gonna be working on the project

1648
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,949
and it would make sense to invest in the

1649
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:13,510
tools for that if that is like a key

1650
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:15,339
criteria for the success of your game

1651
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,780
because we rate everything you implement

1652
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:18,010
is something else you didn't implement

1653
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:20,380
somewhere else because you've only got

1654
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:23,410
so many hours where dollars until your

1655
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:25,390
company goes out of business so yeah

1656
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:26,980
thinking about what tools you can reuse

1657
01:04:25,389 --> 01:04:28,599
and then if you're gonna do something

1658
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,740
that nobody has done before then you

1659
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:31,839
almost certainly have to build tools

1660
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:32,799
right if you if you're making outdoor

1661
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,210
game and you don't have an outdoor

1662
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,160
engine then you're gonna write an

1663
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:38,829
outdoor editor or you know you're gonna

1664
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:40,629
have a problem I would say one thing

1665
01:04:38,829 --> 01:04:42,400
about tool welcome to is the most

1666
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:43,720
important thing like stability was

1667
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,769
mentioned but I would say it's not just

1668
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:46,329
stability because everything's gonna

1669
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:49,449
crash once a while it's can you recover

1670
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:50,799
after the crash okay saving every 30

1671
01:04:49,449 --> 01:04:52,089
seconds would be great or alternately

1672
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,500
it's like it writes out everything at

1673
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:54,610
the point that crashes and so that you

1674
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,019
might have some chance of recovery

1675
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:58,030
that's really important for internal

1676
01:04:56,019 --> 01:04:59,289
tools because you just know hey these

1677
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,760
are things that are in flux so we're

1678
01:04:59,289 --> 01:05:02,019
gonna have crashes we're not gonna have

1679
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,900
perfected it by the time it's in

1680
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:07,420
production certainly so prepare for

1681
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:13,720
crash like make crash preparation of a

1682
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:17,000
thing so John did you know is

1683
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:18,679
it's complicated right because you know

1684
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,019
you can easily spend a lot of effort

1685
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:22,730
making your own tool and then it still

1686
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:24,050
kind of sucks to use because it doesn't

1687
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:25,610
have all this iteration professional

1688
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:26,960
tool right you have to keep in mind

1689
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:29,480
though that when you license a

1690
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,400
professional tool it's not or a

1691
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,559
commercial tool it's not really gonna do

1692
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,410
exactly what you want and so you take a

1693
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:38,900
loss from putting up with it right and

1694
01:05:36,409 --> 01:05:41,779
there's a cost there's an ongoing cost

1695
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:43,130
to like dealing with it the fact that

1696
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,790
you don't have control over this thing

1697
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:46,309
right

1698
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:48,529
there's a cost to the fact that that

1699
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:50,659
tool has an end of life that is not in

1700
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:54,710
your control so if you want your game to

1701
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:57,079
be released 20 years from now because

1702
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:59,800
that's just what you want to do right

1703
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:02,960
you don't want to make perishable goods

1704
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:05,240
then which I guess is a single player

1705
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,800
concern more because with multiplayer

1706
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:12,229
your player bases just go on adventures

1707
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:13,940
yes you know that has to be considered

1708
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:15,110
right is this tool gonna block me you

1709
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:17,150
know if it's something like an animation

1710
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:19,250
created tool probably not right but

1711
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:21,440
whatever of course if you're gonna build

1712
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:23,210
your own then it takes longer than you

1713
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,360
thought and it's gonna have little bugs

1714
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:29,150
that you're dealing with in the workflow

1715
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,890
and so that's friction right so I kind

1716
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:33,740
of just take a Jeff Roberts attitude

1717
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:38,659
which is just like if I want to do it

1718
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:41,449
that way then yeah yeah like I mean Jeff

1719
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:46,159
is like you know there's quality of life

1720
01:06:41,449 --> 01:06:48,949
issues that sometimes supersede making

1721
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:50,509
the intellectually tactically best

1722
01:06:48,949 --> 01:06:52,669
decision okay right

1723
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:54,950
like if it's kind of close either way

1724
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:58,070
and you would have more fun building

1725
01:06:54,949 --> 01:07:00,349
your tools or you would feel like like

1726
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:02,150
you did something nicer or you just want

1727
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:03,909
to try something someone on the team

1728
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:06,920
who's interested in trying something

1729
01:07:03,909 --> 01:07:09,079
then that's evidence to do it that way

1730
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,880
right because because people I mean take

1731
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:14,869
games take a long time and it's like

1732
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,700
people's lives right so the working part

1733
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:18,199
of their life and so you you just want

1734
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:21,109
to make that as good as possible and

1735
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:23,029
sometimes that means don't make people

1736
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:24,430
suffer through the terrible thing that

1737
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:26,080
you would build and instead

1738
01:07:24,429 --> 01:07:29,379
spend some money but but sometimes it

1739
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,329
means let people do their thing right so

1740
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:33,610
it sort of it's very contextual I think

1741
01:07:31,329 --> 01:07:34,690
maybe you know you just happen to be

1742
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:35,980
interested in this thing and you know

1743
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:40,179
that you're going to have fun doing it

1744
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:41,949
so the extra time is actually gets paid

1745
01:07:40,179 --> 01:07:43,690
off in morale in some sense right it's

1746
01:07:41,949 --> 01:07:46,149
like you are happier and you're more

1747
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:48,190
motor even if the game took longer to

1748
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:54,820
ship and cost more I mean that guy had a

1749
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:57,070
good time yeah so I mean and that's I

1750
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:59,410
mean that's that's not completely a joke

1751
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:02,410
right like when when you're in a in a

1752
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:04,750
position where it's like well I'm paying

1753
01:08:02,409 --> 01:08:06,969
people right like you don't want that to

1754
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:10,420
be an extractive position where like I

1755
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:13,419
am using money as a manipulator to

1756
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:15,900
coerce people to produce the product

1757
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:18,670
that I want I mean that's a very

1758
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:21,569
antiseptic mechanical way to think about

1759
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:24,220
it right well I don't know him but sure

1760
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:25,599
but it's more like okay you you need to

1761
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:27,100
have a little bit of that because

1762
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,810
otherwise a game is never gonna be right

1763
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,700
used but at the same time it's like well

1764
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:33,340
these are this is how people are

1765
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:35,109
spending their working hours and you

1766
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,890
actually at some degree have to be

1767
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:38,859
grateful for that

1768
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:40,270
because they could just leave especially

1769
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:42,009
with a small company like mine there's

1770
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:43,750
not like an influx of people coming in

1771
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:45,130
the door people are not beating down the

1772
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:47,050
door to work for a company they've never

1773
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:50,859
heard of right they all want to go work

1774
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:52,800
on overwatch right so you know you have

1775
01:08:50,859 --> 01:08:55,449
to be a little bit happy that people

1776
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,369
there's a give-and-take right like if

1777
01:08:55,449 --> 01:08:59,139
someone wants to do this thing then and

1778
01:08:57,369 --> 01:09:01,149
I don't think it's exactly the best if

1779
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:03,430
it's not going to ruin the game then

1780
01:09:01,149 --> 01:09:05,019
we'll do it you know even if and that

1781
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:07,270
even comes down to smaller technical

1782
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:10,090
decisions like should part of the

1783
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:12,400
renderer be a certain way right I don't

1784
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:15,670
see how that's gonna really be faster

1785
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:17,649
but he thinks it will be and he's you

1786
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:19,210
know the reason he the reason he's in

1787
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:22,179
that programming position is because

1788
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:26,199
he's supposed to decisions right so you

1789
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:29,110
let people make decisions I guess that

1790
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:30,970
didn't really answer anything it sort of

1791
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:33,159
did though I mean it is that is a

1792
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:34,360
additional metric you can use if you're

1793
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:35,769
trying to make one of these decisions

1794
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:37,509
about like should we do this tool should

1795
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:39,400
we not do this tool one is

1796
01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:41,109
anyone actually gonna enjoy making this

1797
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:43,088
tool does it what I mean I mean does

1798
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:45,370
anyone ever predict things with high

1799
01:09:43,088 --> 01:09:47,229
accuracy about whether something is

1800
01:09:45,369 --> 01:09:49,449
going to be right or not right it's I

1801
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:51,429
think in general we all even the best of

1802
01:09:49,449 --> 01:09:53,259
us have a relatively poor track record

1803
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:55,150
yeah like if you were to actually go

1804
01:09:53,259 --> 01:09:57,729
back and audit your decisions right and

1805
01:09:55,149 --> 01:10:01,629
so just have that knowledge off priori

1806
01:09:57,729 --> 01:10:04,299
like okay I think we should license this

1807
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:07,239
tool but I have about 30 percent

1808
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:14,170
confidence in that choice so really

1809
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:16,329
whatever right so but of course I'm the

1810
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:24,699
guy who takes it forever to ship games

1811
01:10:16,329 --> 01:10:25,930
so so here's a question to follow that

1812
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:28,720
up because you happen to sort of be

1813
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:30,430
right there at the end of it what was

1814
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:33,039
the process for getting a new puzzle

1815
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:34,570
into the witness did the edge engine

1816
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:38,829
have a line puzzle editor because we're

1817
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:41,319
talking the process there was that I

1818
01:10:38,829 --> 01:10:42,850
type lines into a CPP file and compile

1819
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:44,710
the game and we run the game

1820
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:47,560
not even with incremental rebuild

1821
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:49,119
because the does that even like I guess

1822
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,650
that works the playstation guys were

1823
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:53,349
over at one point and they said it works

1824
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:55,569
on the ps4 but I never even tried it

1825
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:57,190
there I don't work directly in the ps4

1826
01:10:55,569 --> 01:10:59,319
but it never worked on PC correctly

1827
01:10:57,189 --> 01:11:01,179
enough it would like fail one time out

1828
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:05,079
of six which is often enough to just

1829
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:08,950
like throw it away no so and the reason

1830
01:11:05,079 --> 01:11:10,000
that happened was just you know if

1831
01:11:08,949 --> 01:11:11,529
you're making a game where you don't

1832
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,090
exactly know what it is in the beginning

1833
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:16,090
then you can't really know what the

1834
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:17,650
tools have to be right especially if

1835
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:18,940
it's a very core gameplay thing like oh

1836
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:20,349
there's these puzzles like I didn't know

1837
01:11:18,939 --> 01:11:21,579
what the rules of the puzzles were gonna

1838
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:23,200
be I didn't know what kind of things

1839
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:25,510
could be in them right there's a lot of

1840
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:27,639
and there's a lot and and it's very easy

1841
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:29,320
if you want a prototype a new idea like

1842
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,720
maybe the length of what I'm tracing is

1843
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:33,789
like constrained in some weird way I can

1844
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:36,310
program that pretty fast programming a

1845
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,960
tool for that takes a lot longer yes

1846
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:42,160
right even if it's a crappy tool right

1847
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:44,529
right so by the time I knew what the

1848
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:46,960
game was like two-thirds of the puzzles

1849
01:11:44,529 --> 01:11:49,449
were just already in C++ and like why at

1850
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,130
that point would you change it there

1851
01:11:49,449 --> 01:11:53,409
were some issues like that like

1852
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:54,609
hey I mean I was very laissez-faire

1853
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,899
about the whole thing so like I'm gonna

1854
01:11:54,609 --> 01:11:56,949
put symbols into puzzles so there's

1855
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:59,139
gonna be a thing where you just like

1856
01:11:56,949 --> 01:12:01,000
allocate and array and then you like

1857
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:03,430
poke them I take the graph paper and

1858
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,170
like count the squares and put it in I'd

1859
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:07,090
say like you know three times I plus

1860
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:08,289
four or whatever to like put and

1861
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,970
sometimes the array wasn't big enough

1862
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:12,279
and you get some memory right errors but

1863
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:13,690
you do a little bit of like safeguarding

1864
01:12:12,279 --> 01:12:19,599
to make sure that doesn't happen and

1865
01:12:13,689 --> 01:12:28,949
it's fine so yeah I'm suspecting that

1866
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:31,780
was not the answer I mean that's and

1867
01:12:28,949 --> 01:12:35,199
okay let's let's see here we've got

1868
01:12:31,779 --> 01:12:37,929
about eight minutes left nine minutes

1869
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:40,539
left until we should take a break

1870
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:45,150
if I'm correct so let's see what would

1871
01:12:40,539 --> 01:12:48,489
be a good thing to end on here how about

1872
01:12:45,149 --> 01:12:56,379
what has been your happiest moment with

1873
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:59,159
programming I think my happiest moment

1874
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:03,069
in programming was I wrote this

1875
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:09,399
incredibly complex piece of code to do

1876
01:13:03,069 --> 01:13:12,460
something and I just kind of remember

1877
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:15,729
being shocked at that it's like okay I'm

1878
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:18,100
done for the day I'm out of here cuz

1879
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:20,139
this worked the very first time what was

1880
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:22,960
the code you remember I don't I don't

1881
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:25,090
remember exactly exactly what the code

1882
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,039
was but it involved like a whole bunch

1883
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:29,260
of like math and like getting all

1884
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:31,210
everything all these I think it was it

1885
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:32,619
was the animation system oh that's right

1886
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:34,659
it was the animation system I was

1887
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:36,489
getting all of the you know the pieces

1888
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:37,689
of the animation are all running on

1889
01:13:36,489 --> 01:13:40,029
these kind of you know threaded

1890
01:13:37,689 --> 01:13:41,949
animation chains and and it's like I

1891
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:44,289
just I work on this thing for you know

1892
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:46,389
probably the entire afternoon I remember

1893
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:50,220
you know hitting compile and eating run

1894
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:50,220
and the guy walked across the screen

1895
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:56,860
[Laughter]

1896
01:13:54,550 --> 01:14:00,970
well I blogged about one of them which

1897
01:13:56,859 --> 01:14:02,769
was like in the first multiplayer game

1898
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:04,240
of Warcraft 1 working so I'll mention a

1899
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:06,280
different one instead I was actually

1900
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:08,199
doing the fog of war for StarCraft ok

1901
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:10,569
there another programmer had gone in

1902
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:12,399
dead fog of war and it was cell-based

1903
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:14,949
and so as a unit would move around the

1904
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:16,989
screen you see this map of cells around

1905
01:14:14,949 --> 01:14:18,550
it which are 8x8 tiles and and they'd

1906
01:14:16,989 --> 01:14:20,380
all sort of shiver around as the unit

1907
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:21,850
like moved pixel by pixel and it's

1908
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:23,980
trying to recalculate what the light map

1909
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:25,660
would look like and it was just it

1910
01:14:23,979 --> 01:14:27,339
wasn't very scalable for the number of

1911
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:29,199
units we wanted to have and so did you

1912
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,489
written and so I just sort of step back

1913
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:33,010
and said you know what could I do

1914
01:14:30,489 --> 01:14:34,899
differently and so I did Goro shading

1915
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,699
with filter algorithm to sort of soften

1916
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:38,199
all the edges and then I actually added

1917
01:14:36,699 --> 01:14:40,569
line-of-sight as well so if you had a

1918
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:43,300
something it was blocking your view then

1919
01:14:40,569 --> 01:14:45,069
the fog of war would be filled in so if

1920
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:47,500
you're here at the bottom of a cliff you

1921
01:14:45,069 --> 01:14:50,170
can't see up here and so this area would

1922
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,640
still be fogged and ended being about

1923
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:53,680
the last assembly code I ever really

1924
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,869
wrote I mean maybe a couple of

1925
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,550
instructions after that but like that

1926
01:14:55,869 --> 01:14:59,050
was the last serious block of assembly

1927
01:14:57,550 --> 01:15:02,020
code cuz you know so you got to be

1928
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:03,489
better and like you know it took a while

1929
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,140
to get it nailed down but it worked and

1930
01:15:03,489 --> 01:15:07,210
it's beautiful you know in line of sight

1931
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:10,210
works and it really makes the game work

1932
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:15,119
well it was a lot of fun to do so how

1933
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:17,199
long did that take three weeks my god

1934
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:19,899
I'd already done a lot of far the worst

1935
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:29,710
death so I really wanted the two

1936
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:31,000
previous work rafts like so right at the

1937
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:36,430
end of meatboy I was losing my mind

1938
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,170
because you know and throughout

1939
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:41,409
development we always had problems with

1940
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:42,819
the replay system it was it was like you

1941
01:15:41,409 --> 01:15:45,099
know there would be like a block that

1942
01:15:42,819 --> 01:15:48,189
broke and it was all input based in the

1943
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:50,079
beginning and you know it worked well

1944
01:15:48,189 --> 01:15:52,839
but it always had these times where I

1945
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:56,829
would just totally mess up and it was

1946
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:59,829
two days either a day or two days before

1947
01:15:56,829 --> 01:16:00,948
our Xbox gold submission and I'm like I

1948
01:15:59,829 --> 01:16:04,159
have to

1949
01:16:00,948 --> 01:16:07,219
and what I did is I had I was on like

1950
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:09,319
four hours of sleep and I get up out of

1951
01:16:07,219 --> 01:16:11,180
my desk and I go and I sit with my back

1952
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:12,319
against the wall cause it sucks sitting

1953
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,789
on the floor with nothing and I didn't

1954
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:15,500
have a couch and I didn't want to sit in

1955
01:16:13,789 --> 01:16:17,539
the computer chair so I sit on the floor

1956
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:19,579
back against the wall I just closed my

1957
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:22,909
eyes for like 30 minutes and I just

1958
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:25,609
thought about how I was gonna recode the

1959
01:16:22,909 --> 01:16:28,099
entire replay system and after 30

1960
01:16:25,609 --> 01:16:32,979
minutes I was like okay and I did it and

1961
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:32,980
first time and that's the one so

1962
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:38,449
[Applause]

1963
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:46,340
that was some weird superhuman like well

1964
01:16:38,448 --> 01:16:47,710
you're lifting the car off the baby yeah

1965
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:50,900
pretty much

1966
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:53,119
John I'm thinking of two and it's about

1967
01:16:50,899 --> 01:16:54,799
a tie between them you've got you've got

1968
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:58,579
at least four minutes alright you could

1969
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:00,170
do both so the the they're both kind of

1970
01:16:58,579 --> 01:17:02,119
recent one of them is probably from

1971
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:04,819
about two or three years ago and it's

1972
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:07,399
from a side-project game that I was

1973
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:10,909
working on during the witness and you

1974
01:17:07,399 --> 01:17:12,019
know this game but most people do not so

1975
01:17:10,909 --> 01:17:14,059
I won't go into that much detail about

1976
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:15,560
what it is but it was still in the

1977
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:17,030
relatively early stages where you're not

1978
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,370
trying that hard on the graphics or

1979
01:17:17,029 --> 01:17:23,269
whatever so it's very easy to create

1980
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:26,149
results and I had a period of just like

1981
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:29,510
three to five weeks when I was working

1982
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:31,099
on the witness during the day I go to a

1983
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:33,230
cafe or go home after work and I was

1984
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:34,489
just then working on this all the way

1985
01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:36,889
until it was time to go to sleep

1986
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:38,599
I'd eat whatever was fast I'd fall

1987
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:40,010
asleep I'd wake up I'd go right back to

1988
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,300
working on the side project and I'd go

1989
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:47,199
do the witness during the day and

1990
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:47,199
something about there's just this

1991
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:54,710
juxtapose do and you go and you can make

1992
01:17:51,738 --> 01:17:56,269
something happen very quickly and it was

1993
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:57,859
coming out really great right there's

1994
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:00,170
this joy of like when when you're a

1995
01:17:57,859 --> 01:18:02,960
program or designer and you have ideas

1996
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:04,819
and can make the ideas happen and they

1997
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,159
really work it's just really nice and so

1998
01:18:04,819 --> 01:18:08,630
there was this this time of like where I

1999
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:11,719
was just completely content to do

2000
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:13,010
nothing else in life but like wake up

2001
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:13,359
and first thing in the morning I was

2002
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:15,100
doing

2003
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:17,109
this right and then I then I killed you

2004
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:19,120
witness stuff so I can't even explain

2005
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:22,779
why that was it's just you have to take

2006
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:25,090
my word for it if it's really nice and

2007
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:27,670
then the second one is more recent even

2008
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:31,060
is on the compiler that I was working on

2009
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:33,130
and maybe toward the end of 2014

2010
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:35,950
beginning of 2015 when that first

2011
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:39,550
started coming online even in the first

2012
01:18:35,949 --> 01:18:41,289
few months of development of that it's

2013
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:42,970
again from compilers are another area

2014
01:18:41,289 --> 01:18:45,880
where it's easy to make a great deal of

2015
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:47,409
progress relatively quickly before you

2016
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,970
start getting bogged down later with

2017
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:50,889
implementation details and I have enough

2018
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:52,420
programming experience there's a way

2019
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:54,430
that you can capitalize on that effect

2020
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:57,520
right and structure your code to not bog

2021
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:58,869
you down for a while right and that's

2022
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,460
one thing that I feel like is my

2023
01:18:58,869 --> 01:19:06,159
personal style is about thinking about

2024
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:08,770
that so like I got the compile time

2025
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:10,539
compilation working and I did this demo

2026
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:14,320
where I just you can run the same

2027
01:19:10,539 --> 01:19:16,810
program at compile time in and release

2028
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:20,139
time or whatever and I was just super

2029
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:21,820
happy with that and it was not that

2030
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:23,560
complicated of a system and I knew like

2031
01:19:21,819 --> 01:19:25,840
if I already can do this and it's not

2032
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:28,000
very complicated then then the rest of

2033
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,640
it is going to be tractable right and

2034
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,560
and I was again I was a case then when I

2035
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:35,140
just kept jamming on it and and new

2036
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:38,350
results came in and worked well and and

2037
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:41,410
progress was fast so because of that

2038
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:44,890
because of all of my experiences of when

2039
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:46,420
programming is the best is when progress

2040
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:47,920
doesn't take forever when it's not like

2041
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:50,319
pulling teeth to get anything done right

2042
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,270
but that's so much of like what current

2043
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:54,099
day programming is you know even down to

2044
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:57,520
compile times or whatever right

2045
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:59,170
so that's that's well well the other

2046
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,220
aspect of that psychology was like

2047
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:01,720
looking at all that looking at the

2048
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:04,900
misery of like programming in C++

2049
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:06,880
everyday and being like oh my god I

2050
01:20:04,899 --> 01:20:10,448
really do have a way out of this it was

2051
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:12,670
like I see a I see a light up there

2052
01:20:10,448 --> 01:20:15,428
and I'm actually managing to get towards

2053
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:17,319
right and it like there was this release

2054
01:20:15,429 --> 01:20:19,748
of all this dread that I'd had like

2055
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:21,009
because otherwise I was gonna I had

2056
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:22,269
already convinced myself that I was just

2057
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:23,979
gonna have to put up with that for the

2058
01:20:22,269 --> 01:20:26,229
rest of my life right right and get what

2059
01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:28,360
I was get done what I was doing despite

2060
01:20:26,229 --> 01:20:29,889
that right right I was like oh games are

2061
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:37,328
hard enough but I've also got to do them

2062
01:20:29,889 --> 01:20:39,760
while holding this like 50 pounds oh my

2063
01:20:37,328 --> 01:20:41,380
god I don't have to do that so we'll see

2064
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,998
if that part actually comes true and I

2065
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:45,699
finished your thing but like the the

2066
01:20:42,998 --> 01:20:53,738
feeling of that was amazing the hope is

2067
01:20:45,698 --> 01:21:05,198
amazing when you can have it that's like

2068
01:20:53,738 --> 01:21:07,658
one of those books you can alright well

2069
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:09,679
we're gonna take a break here thank you

2070
01:21:07,658 --> 01:21:13,458
all for sharing we'll be back

2071
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:13,459
[Applause]
