00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,509
all right hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:09,388
a special stream I'm doing this is not

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,769
the normal handmade here are programming

4
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:14,308
strings we do this is actually going to

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:17,368
be kind of a technical walk through the

6
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:19,919
graphic novel pre-press process from

7
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:22,350
possibly the opposite side of what it

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,630
would normally be so I'm assuming that

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,480
there's probably technical materials out

10
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,849
there in trade magazines or publications

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,589
or something for people who actually do

12
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,469
the printing like the printing presses

13
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,479
and stuff like that but this is for the

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,230
opposite side so this is for people who

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,750
are going to have something printed and

16
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:45,209
you know in starting this process back

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,909
in you know it was December or January

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,590
it might have been December actually

19
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:52,529
when we were going to start figuring out

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,770
how to do a print version of our graphic

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,870
novel meow the infinite I started to

22
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,579
start you know I started to kind of dig

23
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:01,439
into all the materials on this to

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,149
educate myself on like how this process

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,768
worked because I wanted to make sure

26
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,989
that we're gonna do a good job and get

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,978
like a good quality you know result if

28
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:12,719
we did a printing of it and so I kind of

29
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,509
wanted to walk through like all the

30
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,368
stuff that's you know kind of I pieced

31
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,739
together some of it's all stuff that I

32
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,109
already knew since if you work with

33
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,459
programming in you know in the graphic

34
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:25,409
sphere there's a bunch of this stuff

35
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,029
that I already knew obviously and stuff

36
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,799
we've even covered on handmade hero or

37
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,228
at least you know tangentially covered

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,939
on handmade hero but then there's a ton

39
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:35,578
of other stuff that's just specific to

40
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,949
printing that you would never know or

41
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:41,250
never need to know if you didn't

42
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,920
actually want to print a graphic novel

43
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,438
or at least no understand like how you

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,659
get like high quality high volume kind

45
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,758
of prints like the thing that you get if

46
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,270
you go pick up a graphic novel at a

47
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,390
bookstore so anyway let me start with

48
00:01:54,269 --> 00:02:00,718
some sort of slightly unintuitive stuff

49
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,859
for people who probably you know this is

50
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,669
something that you may never have even

51
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:08,159
seen some people who work in art for a

52
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,050
living and probably most artists will

53
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,030
have you know seen some of this at some

54
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,990
point but a lot of partners may not have

55
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,430
seen it at all

56
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,860
and so let me just start with this so we

57
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,629
can have a baseline when you actually

58
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,000
make something in a program like

59
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:23,819
Photoshop right you're typically going

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,629
to end up with something let's say that

61
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:31,079
looks maybe like this right so this is a

62
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:33,479
shot from now the infinite and what you

63
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,900
can see is this is what Anna would draw

64
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:40,619
on her actual like on her Cintiq tablet

65
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,420
and she draws it in RGB like we normally

66
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,250
would and the reason that she does that

67
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:46,859
is because it's a comic that does get

68
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,810
posted online and the primary thing that

69
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,310
you could buy on our website if you went

70
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,870
there was actually the digital deluxe

71
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,000
edition that's the like you know

72
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,830
downloadable PDFs of the chapters and

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,469
you know avatar packs all that sort of

74
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,390
thing not a print version because until

75
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:03,629
we got enough issues we weren't going to

76
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:06,539
do a print version so it's made for

77
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:08,340
display on the screen and this is what

78
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,739
you might draw and what you're actually

79
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,689
doing right when you draw in Photoshop

80
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,159
and this is something that you know a

81
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:15,900
lot of people don't even think about off

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,460
the bat especially not if they haven't

83
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,840
ever worked in like triple-a game

84
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,939
development or something like this or in

85
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,009
movies or film or whatever or in print

86
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,359
if you're actually just you know used to

87
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:26,009
booting up Photoshop and painting

88
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,860
something or working in any image

89
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:30,539
program really then what you forget is

90
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,970
what you're actually making on the

91
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:35,849
screen doesn't correspond to anything

92
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:39,629
it's completely fictitious right

93
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:42,689
all you were doing is on in Photoshop

94
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:45,389
you were dialing some RGB sliders around

95
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:48,389
right and you were getting a color that

96
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,149
looks right to your eye coming out of

97
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:54,929
your monitor and that's all you knew

98
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,460
right and you may have actually had this

99
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,830
experience before if you've never

100
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,120
thought about that part of it you may

101
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,160
have sort of had a rude awakening at

102
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,050
some point where you made an image that

103
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,370
you thought looked really good or you

104
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,620
you know even were just looking at some

105
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,659
image someone else made and you looked

106
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,310
at it on two different devices and it

107
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,840
looks really different like you looked

108
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,610
at it on your monitor and it looked one

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,730
way and you looked at it on your phone

110
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,900
and it looks like totally like

111
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,280
oversaturated or maybe the one your

112
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,779
monitor looked under saturated or

113
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,449
something like this like the colors just

114
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,679
look totally different and it's not like

115
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,459
they're bizarre like it's not like

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,430
something that was

117
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,750
is now pink right but they're just you

118
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,250
can tell there's a qualitative

119
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,699
difference when you look at the two

120
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,490
versions right and so obviously the

121
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,470
reason for that is because monitors by

122
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,269
default with you just by a monitor

123
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,910
randomly and you don't think about it

124
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:47,758
they aren't calibrated to anything so

125
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,310
when you feed it an image like an RGB

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,770
image the RG and B channels are

127
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,410
basically just taken by the monitor and

128
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:57,180
map to some arbitrary curve you know

129
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,919
it's it's it's sort of like a if it's

130
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,978
not a line it's like a curved output

131
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,348
function and it's not gonna correspond

132
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:06,538
to anything actually real in the real

133
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:08,788
world in terms of light it doesn't

134
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:13,050
there's no guarantees and no standard

135
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:15,538
there and so one of the things that you

136
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,889
know you learn very quickly in print is

137
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:18,089
that's not good enough and you learn

138
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:19,620
this very quickly in triplicate a

139
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,939
game-development - because you have a

140
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,759
lot of reference lighting scenarios and

141
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:26,399
all that sort of stuff so the first

142
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,750
thing that we didn't have to learn at

143
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,250
Mohawk because we already knew but that

144
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,329
someone who might not be familiar with

145
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,430
it needs to know is when you're looking

146
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:37,379
at one of these things and when you're

147
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,000
doing art that needs to get moved into

148
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,098
some other medium or needs to be

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,899
reference quality on multiple people's

150
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:44,908
monitors you need a color calibrated

151
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,679
monitor and that's just a basic thing

152
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:47,969
anyone out there on the stream who's a

153
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,800
game developer probably already knows

154
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,210
this but a lot of people are just aren't

155
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,939
aware of it right because if it's never

156
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:56,189
come up you might not know and what a

157
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,139
color calibrated monitor is is it's just

158
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,209
a monitor that came from the factory

159
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,530
usually you want to get a come from the

160
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:02,879
factory calibrated because then you

161
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,038
don't have to do it there are ways of

162
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,509
color calibrating monitor yourself so

163
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,969
some you know there's there's a whole

164
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,348
sort of you know side thing we can go

165
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,840
down for that but I wouldn't recommend

166
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:14,430
that nowadays you can buy monitors that

167
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,049
are factory color calibrated when they

168
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,908
came out of a production line they

169
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,840
calibrated it there and then they sent

170
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:21,149
it to you so you know it's color

171
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,908
calibrated and their color calibrated to

172
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:25,859
something called an ICC color profile or

173
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:27,569
more specifically they're calibrated to

174
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,180
a certain set of light emission

175
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:33,509
standards and those standards are mapped

176
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,269
so there's like if you search on Google

177
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,400
you can actually see there's like a

178
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,839
database of these for example right and

179
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,989
what they are

180
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:48,060
is there literally you know reference

181
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,740
standards for how all of the all of the

182
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,439
numbers that you see like in Photoshop

183
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,210
like those are G&amp;B numbers when you put

184
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,730
those out to a monitor what will they

185
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:58,888
actually do like how much light will

186
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,509
that will that actually result in to you

187
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:04,280
know what color will you actually see

188
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:07,500
when you look at the monitor okay and

189
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,119
that brings us to the you know the first

190
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,470
thing that you want to know for

191
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,610
pre-press which I'll kind of try to

192
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,870
mention as I go through just to

193
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,000
highlight the things that you want to

194
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,228
know and this is true of any graphic

195
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,779
work in my opinion and not just

196
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:20,310
pre-press I'd do this for anything but

197
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:23,459
the big thing that you want to make sure

198
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,350
that you always do is get that set up

199
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:26,879
working properly so there's two things

200
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,030
you need to do one is buy a factory

201
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,589
color calibrated monitor two is you know

202
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:33,299
when you get these monitors they've got

203
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:34,529
all these little knobs and buttons and

204
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,120
dials on them and all that right to

205
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:37,289
bring up those on-screen menus this is

206
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,939
the one time you actually want that

207
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,439
on-screen menu you need to go into that

208
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:43,110
on-screen menu and you need to select

209
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:46,620
the color profile and you select one

210
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:49,800
that has an actual ICC color profile for

211
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,680
it and typical ones will be like srgb or

212
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,020
Adobe srgb there's also some D dot

213
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,759
standards and so on and you're gonna

214
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:58,560
want to set your monitor to one of those

215
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,560
standards because then you know what

216
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,259
it's actually going to be displaying and

217
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,879
then inside Photoshop there's or

218
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,978
whatever art tool you're using - it

219
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,350
doesn't have to be Photoshop you can go

220
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:13,228
into the preferences and you pick that

221
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:15,629
setting on your working space so this

222
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:18,839
RGB here you pick that setting and

223
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,969
that's like the crucial two-step process

224
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,069
you got to do well three if you count

225
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,900
picking it from the menu that's the

226
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:28,019
crucial process you got to do if you

227
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:30,120
want to be able to see some kind of a

228
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,579
realistic preview of what you actually

229
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,229
made and again if all you're ever doing

230
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,270
is just making something on your monitor

231
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,500
for you it doesn't much matter but if

232
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:38,939
you're trying to ship to other people's

233
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,190
monitors or if you're trying to make a

234
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,750
print edition worst of all because

235
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,630
that's fixed soon as you print it it's

236
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,610
over you can't fix it you really want to

237
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:49,350
get that color calibration correct

238
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,490
because if you don't have that color

239
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,070
collaboration correct you don't even

240
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:57,180
know what you're making right all right

241
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,950
so then come step 2 assuming that you

242
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:00,769
got that right so now you know your

243
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,320
monitor is at least displaying correctly

244
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:07,079
then you've got the part that applies

245
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,930
really only to print and that is that

246
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,700
printing doesn't print RGB now this is

247
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:13,199
probably not news to anyone like I said

248
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,150
who's worked in the graphic arts before

249
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,730
but for people who've never had an

250
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:20,009
exposure to that world you may just

251
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,080
never have thought of it right and so

252
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:23,939
what actually happens is if you have an

253
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,530
RGB image or even if you're just

254
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,780
creating a new image from scratch and

255
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,240
you want it to go to print you have to

256
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:34,139
do it in what's called CMYK and CMYK

257
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,570
like RGB is a color space and let me

258
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,039
just briefly say because this is a text

259
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,900
stream here where I'm gonna try and go

260
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,809
over all of the technical things you

261
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,029
should know let me just say a little bit

262
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,159
about why this is the case and where

263
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:49,199
this comes from so if you go on

264
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,509
Wikipedia and you read a little bit

265
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,129
about the human visual system which you

266
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:56,399
may or may not have ever really thought

267
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:58,769
about or even seen you can start to

268
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,539
appreciate why things are built the way

269
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:03,090
that they're built and if you look over

270
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:05,399
here on the right side what you can see

271
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,649
are some weight light wavelength

272
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,079
response curves and they're the response

273
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,129
curves of your eye I mean roughly

274
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,200
everyone's eye is probably a little

275
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:15,779
different but you know roughly this is

276
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,200
what your eye responds to and what does

277
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:21,389
this mean well in the real world right

278
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,070
you know I ain't a physicist so don't

279
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:24,360
ask me how light works because my

280
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,550
understanding is this is the kind of

281
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,800
thing that physicists are always grumpy

282
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:31,289
about and they never quite seem to know

283
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,769
how light works but for those of us who

284
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:36,719
only care about artistic results light

285
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:39,179
is something that carries color

286
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,889
information and so light has a

287
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,889
particular wavelength it's oscillating

288
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:48,240
or something again ask a physicist not

289
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:51,240
my expertise and that wavelength so how

290
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,399
the the light is sort of vibrating as it

291
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,220
reaches our eye is what makes us

292
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:59,129
perceive color so if you have a

293
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,250
particular oscillation of wavelength and

294
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:03,570
it's our eye then it stimulates one type

295
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,519
of receptor in our eye if it has a

296
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,390
different wavelength it simulates

297
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,519
another receptor

298
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:11,699
and that's how we distinguish colors but

299
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:14,009
if we really wanted to be able to

300
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,900
distinguish all of the colors we would

301
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,860
need lots of receptors for lots of

302
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,439
different wavelengths because there's

303
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,289
all these wavelengths of light it's a

304
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,850
continuous spectrum of light and you we

305
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:26,009
would need to be able to determine those

306
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,220
right that's not how the system actually

307
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:32,039
works instead what we have are receptors

308
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,200
who like who respond to kind of a wide

309
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,149
range and that's what this is meant to

310
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,960
show it's like sort of a wide response

311
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:42,389
rage that spans many colors each and so

312
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,550
when you are trying to imagine how your

313
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:46,199
eyes are working even though you're

314
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:49,409
seeing specific colors like you're

315
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,440
seeing yellow there was no yellow

316
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:54,629
receptor in your actual eye what there

317
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,230
are our receptors sort of that have

318
00:11:54,629 --> 00:12:01,470
blurry kind of you know sort of fall

319
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:05,670
offs of reception yellow was somewhere

320
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:08,070
in here and your m and L receptors both

321
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:11,610
responded to it and then your brain

322
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:14,730
merged those responses together it

323
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:17,879
actually was like combining those two

324
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:20,519
stimuli and guessing that the light was

325
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,370
yellow so like when you see yellow light

326
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,110
it's just a guess right you don't really

327
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,970
know if you were looking at yellow light

328
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,710
because all you know is that two

329
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,330
receptors in your brain were firing and

330
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,970
it might have been because of yellow

331
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,790
light but and here's where we get to the

332
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,430
RGB color model it may just have been

333
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:41,610
because you saw a green light and a red

334
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:45,269
light shining at the same time right and

335
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:47,759
so that's how we started building you

336
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,379
know sort of monitors like you know CRTs

337
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,220
that had color or stuff like that or now

338
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:55,169
LCDs and OLEDs because what we could do

339
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,330
is just say well look if the human eye

340
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:59,129
just has like a strong response on blue

341
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,960
a strong response like centered around

342
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:03,480
green and a strong response centered

343
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,790
around sort of like a red what if we

344
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,310
just had emitters for red green and blue

345
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:10,589
and we'll just like emit more or less of

346
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:12,059
them to fool the eye into thinking that

347
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,220
the wavelength was actually in the

348
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,439
middle because it doesn't know right it

349
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,290
just doesn't have any idea a little bit

350
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,839
of green and a little bit of red is

351
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:23,689
hello I don't need to put a yellow in

352
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,730
there right so this was a really

353
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,589
efficient thing actually like it's

354
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,480
pretty great for technology that we only

355
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:31,190
have these three receptors for color

356
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,320
because it meant that we didn't have to

357
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,480
do any better right we don't have to

358
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,370
have more than three types of emission

359
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,220
on our monitors and we can make all the

360
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,720
colors that humans can actually perceive

361
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:45,290
this wouldn't work for some other

362
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,670
animals amusingly right again not my

363
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:49,429
expertise so my understanding is like

364
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:52,729
birds for example can have like five

365
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:55,489
sometimes more color receptors so they

366
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:58,069
would know like if you try that renin

367
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,930
red green makes yellow trick on a bird

368
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:02,240
they might be like what he would that's

369
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:04,778
it's not yellow that's red and green

370
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,068
what's what are you talking about right

371
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:08,778
so it's pretty interesting when you

372
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:12,500
think about it that the only reason we

373
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:16,639
were able to get away with CRTs LCDs and

374
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,399
OLED displays being only three emitters

375
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:23,060
is because of this you know way that the

376
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,620
eye works so now the question is well

377
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:26,448
what's the deal with print like why

378
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,448
can't we just use the same trick and the

379
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:30,439
answer is we can use the same trick but

380
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,969
it's got a little look a little

381
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,399
different why does it look a little

382
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,860
different well if you think about what

383
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,629
happens when you print something you're

384
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,000
effectively taking like you know say a

385
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:43,068
piece of paper and you want to print

386
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,169
something on it well a piece of paper is

387
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:47,838
just a neutral reflector it reflects

388
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:49,639
like most wavelengths just back as best

389
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,620
it can right and the better the paper

390
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,829
the more light it reflects usually right

391
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,568
it's kind of a nice bright well is a

392
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:58,129
white but like slightly tans usually not

393
00:14:56,568 --> 00:15:01,969
like pure white necessarily but you know

394
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:03,980
it gets close sometimes and so what

395
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,800
that's doing is it's creating a blank

396
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,230
canvas that reflects light off of it but

397
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,088
it doesn't emit any light right a piece

398
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,420
of paper is not an emitter in a darkroom

399
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:17,509
you see nothing so in order to print a

400
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:19,698
picture on it we need to do the opposite

401
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:22,490
thing that we do with a monitor a

402
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:24,458
monitor starts off dark in like a

403
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,959
darkroom right or something like this

404
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:31,129
let's say an OLED display because this

405
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,989
is a straight emitter and it wants to

406
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:35,179
red green and blue light to the

407
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,039
environment it's shining it out there

408
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:38,989
it's not reflecting light in fact you

409
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,759
don't want a monitor to reflect things

410
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,490
you intentionally coat them to try to

411
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,960
avoid that right and so what it's doing

412
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,399
is it's increasing the amount of red

413
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,230
light increasing the amount of green

414
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,870
light increasing the amount of blue

415
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,850
light but what you're doing with a page

416
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,159
it's already just reflecting as much

417
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,700
light as it can so if you want that page

418
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:03,019
to start to look say red what you need

419
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:06,650
to do is stop it from reflecting all the

420
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:09,309
other wavelengths right so when you

421
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:13,759
print what you're trying to do is remove

422
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:17,689
reflection not add light and that's

423
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:22,639
where we go from RGB to see my what's

424
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:23,540
see my it's cyan ink magenta ink and a

425
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,049
yellow ink

426
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:29,029
what are those colors well cyan is the

427
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:32,990
color you get if you reflect everything

428
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:35,299
but red right magenta is the color you

429
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,759
get if you reflect everything but green

430
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:40,969
and yellow is the color you get if you

431
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,909
reflect everything but blue so if you

432
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:47,600
have three inks that each allow you to

433
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:50,000
effectively block out to subtract the

434
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,340
reflection of one of the RGB color

435
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,830
channels now we can do the exact same

436
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:58,370
trick we did with the monitor on the

437
00:16:54,830 --> 00:17:01,129
page so we just put as much cyan ink as

438
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,799
we want to knock out the red component

439
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:05,869
right we put as much magenta ink as we

440
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,700
want to knock out green and we put as

441
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:09,769
much yellow ink as we want to knock out

442
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,410
blue and those inks mixed together to

443
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:14,389
form something that knocks out exactly

444
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,930
the right ratio of those things to

445
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:20,990
bounce the light containing only the

446
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:23,330
color wavelengths that will trick the

447
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,700
human eye into thinking it sees whatever

448
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:28,129
color we wanted exactly the same way a

449
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:32,559
monitor does just by subtracting bounce

450
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,560
light rather than adding emitted light
