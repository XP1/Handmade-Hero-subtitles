00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:08,550
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,789
hero I you know today we're gonna have

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,870
to cover the patreon situation because

4
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:14,459
and if people who are watching this

5
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:16,320
video on demand quite a bit later you

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,880
may have forgotten about this incident

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,679
and now we're just recalling oh hey

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,419
remember that time when patreon was a

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,948
thing and then over one weekend the

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,840
entire thing collapsed and then they all

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:30,000
went out of business basically for those

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,130
of you who aren't aware of the situation

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,619
regarding patreon or perhaps don't even

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,010
know what patreon is patreon is a

15
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:42,238
service that allowed people to create an

16
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:45,000
account and solicit contributions for

17
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,369
projects they were working on and people

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,600
could go on there and pledge small money

19
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,250
amounts or large limits they could

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,600
pledge a thousand dollars to this person

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,429
or they could pledge one dollar to this

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,189
person didn't matter

23
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:59,369
and then the person could optionally

24
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:02,429
also offer rewards like with Kickstarter

25
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:04,948
or those kinds of project funding models

26
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,118
do but that's all it was right so it's

27
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:09,719
just a site where you could go and

28
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,859
create a essentially like it's not

29
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,658
really a donation cuz you're not a

30
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:13,890
charity but it's basically that it's

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,140
basically saying hey I'm working on this

32
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,299
project if you'd like to donate money to

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,239
it it's much appreciated you don't have

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,650
to write and occasionally depending on

35
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,509
the patreon it might also be that if you

36
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,820
donate money to it you get a bonus right

37
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,519
look maybe maybe this project is

38
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,339
creating a comic strip and if you donate

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:35,188
to it you will get access to our special

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,719
like you know art book PDF or something

41
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:38,158
right that you wouldn't have gotten

42
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,780
otherwise or I've seen people like they

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,040
give out the comic one day early from

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,719
when they post it online so you know you

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,030
get some benefits for being a donor

46
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:50,849
those sorts of things and so that is

47
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,129
what patreon was and handmade hero is

48
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,618
you know it's a commercial project it's

49
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:57,688
like half and half it's making a game

50
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:58,950
and the game in the source code still

51
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:01,289
cost fifteen dollars to buy it's

52
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,490
commercial project but it does have a

53
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,670
free side which is we give away all the

54
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,140
videos for free and we put up all the

55
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,659
programming resources for free

56
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,860
that we do however we created a patreon

57
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,240
a while back not

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,830
to long after start a series because

59
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,370
people were requesting a way to donate

60
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,719
money to the project and so we did and

61
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,879
we've happened for a long time and it

62
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,750
created it's generated quite a bit of

63
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,000
money cuz it's been running for like

64
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,710
three three years or so and it probably

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,530
collected I think somewhere around sixty

66
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,820
thousand dollars which is a lot of money

67
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,300
and what we've been doing with that

68
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,979
money is actually giving giving it away

69
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,950
most of the time I would turn around and

70
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:43,829
give away the the vast majority of the

71
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:45,629
money that came in on the patreon to

72
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,490
other projects that where people had

73
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,229
started based on handmade hero because

74
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,629
this seemed like the most fair way to

75
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:53,009
deal with the money and there's been a

76
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,259
lot of great stuff that has been

77
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:57,709
supported by this money in the past the

78
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,729
annotated episode guide is one of them

79
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,289
that's one that probably a lot of you're

80
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:03,959
familiar with and that's just it here at

81
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:06,989
handmade network slash episodes and this

82
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,840
is an amazing resource done by midlow

83
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,750
from the chat and by Asif Gartner he

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,640
made the search engine and it's

85
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,979
basically a thing where you can just

86
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:21,029
type in anything you want like you know

87
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:23,250
cube or something and it will tell you

88
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,409
anytime I did a major thing on that at

89
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,030
all right and this is just an amazing

90
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:28,709
resource because handmade here is not

91
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,419
really meant to be concise project by

92
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,280
default it's just me doing a bunch of

93
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,780
programming and showing what comes up

94
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,209
when you do it and so it's very hard to

95
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,979
access it in a random access fashion but

96
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,289
this resource is amazing and it's helped

97
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:42,780
so many people and that is what we gave

98
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:44,060
a significant portion of the patreon

99
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,009
money to over the years

100
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,289
similarly this entire site right which

101
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,870
is handmade Network this was all made by

102
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,969
volunteers

103
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,670
abner coimbra basically took it upon

104
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:59,310
himself to organize a bunch of people to

105
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:01,409
create this site and then like and

106
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,500
requester and I can never pronounce his

107
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,479
name but calamy on on the on the chat

108
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,870
his name is Gerren i think is how you

109
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,768
pronounce it but they like and a bunch

110
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,420
of other people I don't even know all

111
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,670
people who are involved built this

112
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,529
entire site which hosts that episode

113
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:17,819
guide not to mention all these other

114
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,349
wonderful products that people are

115
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,599
baking see handmade hero is just one of

116
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,689
several projects on here

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,099
that have been awesome and that are just

118
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,189
I mean like there's just so much great

119
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:30,250
stuff going on here

120
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:32,350
and it supports forums for them news for

121
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,139
them and of course stuff like that

122
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,310
episode guide has now has a place to

123
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,379
live

124
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,819
and so that was another thing that we

125
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,319
sent a bunch of money to so we tried to

126
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,389
let cover their hosting costs and we

127
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,920
would send quite a bit of money out of

128
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,899
our take every month to them in in

129
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,550
addition we also supported a number of

130
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:51,009
projects that we use on the stream we

131
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,389
sent money to Alan Webster's awesome for

132
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,670
coder project which of course is the

133
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,289
editor we use on stream I mean it's

134
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,100
literally we replace the editor we were

135
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,600
using buy one written by someone who was

136
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,550
a viewer of the series originally right

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,850
and the same was true of our drawing

138
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,319
program Sergio created the Milton

139
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,460
drawing package and that's the drawing

140
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,170
package that we use on streaming out to

141
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:14,589
replace mischief which is what we used

142
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,270
originally and so this money that came

143
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:18,339
in for the patreon even though it was

144
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:22,089
not the thing that we were using to make

145
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:23,889
money for like for Molly rocket it was

146
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,750
making money for a lot of people and

147
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,569
those people were doing amazing work so

148
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,000
I definitely am happy with how the

149
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:32,620
patreon thing worked out it got money

150
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,680
from people who wanted to donate -

151
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,750
project to people who did great stuff

152
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,579
right it did exactly what it was

153
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:44,079
supposed to do in my mind in terms of

154
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:47,229
contributors supporting volunteers on a

155
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:50,199
project right and I'll be honest

156
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,840
patrons kind of a janky system it didn't

157
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,610
make it easy to do this I basically had

158
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,379
to like make these pledges and pay for

159
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,930
the pledges first and then it would like

160
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,939
recover the pledges the next month and I

161
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,860
had to like reimburse myself or it was

162
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:05,439
even they didn't make it as easy as it

163
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,939
should have been but he worked right I

164
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,379
mean hey it got the money to the right

165
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,240
place eventually so that people who

166
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:12,219
wanted to to contribute money to the

167
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,699
project could contribute money and it

168
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,260
went somewhere good right and that never

169
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,779
would have happened without patreon so

170
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:23,529
you know I feel like they deserve some

171
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:25,418
credit for that on the other hand they

172
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:29,500
definitely have been having kind of a

173
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:33,549
streak if you will of really bad sort of

174
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,680
public facing issues happening and while

175
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,759
none of these issues have been I would

176
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,720
say you know really catastrophic ly

177
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,860
underhanded or

178
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,510
weird in and of themselves perhaps it is

179
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,370
kind of getting to the point now where

180
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:51,039
it's really not a very comfortable

181
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,170
platform to encourage people to support

182
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,939
and it's really not a platform that I

183
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,850
want to be associated with anymore if

184
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:59,560
for no other reason even if we take out

185
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,580
any of the decisions or my personal

186
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,730
opinions about them or any of that stuff

187
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:06,039
just the general public perception of

188
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:09,460
patreon amongst people who use the

189
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,379
service is rapidly declining and I don't

190
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:16,689
really want to be associated with a

191
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:19,300
platform that is that its own users are

192
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:21,310
feeling like is mistreating them right I

193
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,540
mean that's just not a company and it's

194
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,519
not a product that you want to be

195
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,590
associated with especially not when

196
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:30,129
you're talking about a generally a

197
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:31,929
goodwill activity right the commercial

198
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:33,639
side of handmade hero is one thing but

199
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,560
the volunteer side of handmade here is

200
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,229
quite the other and when you're talking

201
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,810
about people who are voluntarily for

202
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:43,240
nothing in return giving some money to

203
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,100
support a project it's pretty important

204
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,800
that that happened in a way that people

205
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,540
feel good about because by and large

206
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,639
they are doing it just because they are

207
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,680
trying to do a good thing right it is a

208
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,599
purely altruistic gesture on the airport

209
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,370
to try and support volunteers who are

210
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,910
making something that they like right

211
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:04,329
and so I feel like even more so than

212
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,890
with a commercial project and you know

213
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:07,329
for example the purchase of handmade

214
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:09,849
here on the source code right which goes

215
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:12,009
through send owl even more so than

216
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,680
something like that something that's

217
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,779
entirely altruistic or voluntary based

218
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,000
or whatever that's you know generally

219
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:21,250
based on goodwill I really don't feel

220
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,779
like you can afford to have sort of the

221
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:27,490
cloud of question ability you know

222
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:29,949
hanging over it that's not gonna give

223
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,660
people who contribute money a good

224
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:35,080
feeling about their contribution and

225
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,279
it's also not gonna give the people who

226
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,900
are just volunteering who are just

227
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,750
trying to get paid for hard work that

228
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,908
they're doing you know a good sort of

229
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,110
Sheen right it's not it's not painting

230
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:46,179
them with a flattering brush that

231
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,129
they're going through this service that

232
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:50,799
is fundamentally pissing people off I

233
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:53,080
mean let's just cut to the chase so

234
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,349
again taking out any sort of ideological

235
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,270
or

236
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,730
[Music]

237
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,259
economic disagreements you might have or

238
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,300
I might have with how they've been doing

239
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,950
things or how you specifically feel

240
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:05,179
about these things I do think that at

241
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,340
this point unfortunately it's gotten to

242
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:09,500
the point where regardless of anything

243
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,500
it's just not a great service to be a

244
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,850
part of so this letter here that I've

245
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,159
got up on the screen is something that I

246
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,290
wrote to everyone who has contributed to

247
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,029
the patreon or I guess who's still

248
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:23,179
contributing I don't know exactly how

249
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:25,730
patreon decides who gets a post to a

250
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:26,809
patrons mailing list but I believe it

251
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,600
just goes to anyone who's currently

252
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:32,059
subscribed and basically what I said was

253
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,889
you know sort of what I just said to you

254
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:37,549
here's all the great stuff that this is

255
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:40,429
enabled and hey patreon seems like

256
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:41,389
they're imploding right now and so I'm

257
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,949
gonna try and figure out an alternative

258
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:46,250
and that's exactly what we're doing

259
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,410
right now many of the projects that we

260
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,590
have supported have already closed their

261
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:53,329
patreon so this is rapidly becoming an

262
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,790
issue that we'll probably have to get

263
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,340
resolved this this weekend for example

264
00:09:55,789 --> 00:10:02,289
for coder Allen Webster said he is

265
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:04,340
closing his patreon remedy dbg the

266
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:05,659
debugger project we were starting to

267
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,070
support with the handmade hero money

268
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:08,539
because we want to replacement to butter

269
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:12,500
framing here as well so we can have all

270
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:14,029
open projects running that have like

271
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,559
been based on essentially like the

272
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:17,029
principles of the series

273
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:21,199
I guess open isn't really the important

274
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:23,839
part it's just based on C++ low-level

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,509
coding I guess what you would say I that

276
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,480
one closed Abner closed the handmade

277
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:33,200
networks patreon which was a big one we

278
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,670
gave money to and midlow I don't think

279
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,350
has closed his yet and that's the

280
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:38,449
episode guide one which was another

281
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:42,790
really big one in terms of contributions

282
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:45,890
for us but he might write and so

283
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:48,019
basically patreon has has imploded with

284
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:49,789
such speed that we have not gotten a

285
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,409
replacement in place yet but I am going

286
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:54,230
to try and get that up this weekend so

287
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:56,329
hopefully by Monday we will have an

288
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:59,120
alternative set up that you can go to if

289
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,620
you are a patreon pleasure or want to

290
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,269
support the series and are planning on

291
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,310
pledging we're going to open up

292
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:06,620
something else as soon as we possibly

293
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:09,079
can and we will be closing the handmade

294
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,970
hero patreon very shortly

295
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,050
much sooner even than I thought we were

296
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,420
going to close it when I wrote this

297
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:18,829
letter it probably won't be weeks it'll

298
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:21,679
probably be days so I don't have an

299
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,750
exact update about that yet come

300
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,539
tomorrow's handmade hero stream I may

301
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,610
have a more concrete solution in place

302
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:30,319
and I can put you to it but that is what

303
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,759
we're working on right now and so come

304
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,420
Monday I suspect we will have our

305
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,889
patreon closed and we will have another

306
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:38,120
option in place for those people who

307
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:45,199
wanted to continue supporting these

308
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:47,240
projects so yes long story short I

309
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,700
apologize to everyone who is affected by

310
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,639
this I apologize to the people who have

311
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:55,900
been doing great work to support the

312
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,309
many people who learn from handmade hero

313
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,569
making the episode guide making the

314
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,639
drawing package all of these things

315
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,470
hosting handmade Network these things

316
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,470
have made a difference to many many

317
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,720
people and they really made a difference

318
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,850
to how people are able to use handmade

319
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,800
hero as a learning resource and I

320
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,480
apologize to those people who will not

321
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,209
be getting this money now because we

322
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,889
have to close the patreon I apologize to

323
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,750
all the patrons who have to deal with

324
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:22,669
this stuff they were just trying to

325
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,470
donate money to do something they liked

326
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:26,929
and now they have to worry about this

327
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,279
and our is their pledge being handled

328
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:30,349
properly what's happening with this

329
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,929
service what's going right they don't

330
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:38,720
deserve that either so I apologize to

331
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:42,199
everybody and I will try to fix patreon

332
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,810
disaster as soon as humanly possible in

333
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,520
a way that continues to allow the people

334
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:49,579
who wanted to donate money to continue

335
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:53,659
donating it so that these other projects

336
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:56,780
can continue and be funded that's really

337
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:58,610
all there is to say I don't have much to

338
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:59,750
say about patreon actual problems

339
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,639
because I don't think they're super

340
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:05,659
relevant suffice to say my personal take

341
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,370
was just after reading their

342
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,620
explanations of what they were doing in

343
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,320
this latest round I was not particularly

344
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,169
convinced already going into it that

345
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,700
they were under good leadership after

346
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,799
reading their latest round of

347
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,230
explanations for this particular problem

348
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,429
and given how this particular problem

349
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,110
came up

350
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:26,028
I would say that I have like very little

351
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:29,300
confidence in their leadership in terms

352
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:30,559
of their ability to run a site that does

353
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:34,819
what it's supposed to do and keeps

354
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,199
people happy so I just think there's not

355
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,010
a lot of future there I think they're

356
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,990
probably going away and so even if I

357
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:44,120
thought all of the stuff they had done

358
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,870
was fine I probably would still bail on

359
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,639
them because I don't think they're gonna

360
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:55,759
be around much longer if that makes

361
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:58,939
sense so that's it if you have any

362
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:01,338
questions people have been commenting on

363
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,080
this thread you can go ahead and comment

364
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:06,410
on this thread if you are a patron you

365
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:09,200
of handmade hero patreon you have gotten

366
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:11,899
this email and it does have a link to

367
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,550
this webpage but I mean you can see the

368
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:17,600
URL right here if you want to type it in

369
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:19,338
directly so yeah one five seven eight

370
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,879
six eight four seven that is the post

371
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:24,290
number so you can go here and comment on

372
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:28,000
this if you'd like to discuss it with

373
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:30,349
other patreon you can also just go to

374
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,958
probably a better way as he rode on a

375
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:38,060
network and here at network of course

376
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,309
has our forums on it there's this forums

377
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:42,469
button right here you can click on and

378
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:44,689
if you're on if you want to comment you

379
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,459
can comment in here anywhere you want I

380
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,510
don't care where you comment on it we'll

381
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:52,609
move it somewhere reasonable either way

382
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:53,870
put it under game or something and we

383
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,000
can talk about it there as well but

384
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,970
either or I suspect there's not gonna

385
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,230
have to be much more discussion about it

386
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,700
because like I said by the end of the

387
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,620
weekend I should have something in place

388
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,329
even if it's only just a mailing list

389
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,589
that you can put your name on so that

390
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:12,789
when we have a solution come back online

391
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:15,170
you can come back and pledge if you want

392
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:16,730
because once we close the patreon which

393
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:19,969
will happen relatively soon there will

394
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:23,420
no longer be a way for you to direct

395
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:26,810
pledges towards these projects that's

396
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:28,278
about it so anyway if you have questions

397
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:30,349
about like I said you can come comment

398
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:31,970
here I will be watching it or you can

399
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,980
put in the forums and I'll try to log in

400
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,480
there and check them out but that's

401
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,490
about it

402
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,259
and it's a lot of people like I said it

403
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,180
says you can see right here it's 158

404
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:42,559
people so I'm hoping that everyone got

405
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,939
this and everyone understands what's

406
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,319
going on it was more there was probably

407
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,089
a hundred and seventy or something

408
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,110
before this lots of people have already

409
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:53,240
cancelled their pledges

410
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:55,639
and understandably so so you know we

411
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,600
will we'll go from here and hopefully

412
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:02,810
nobody is - nobody's project is hurt too

413
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,399
hard by this I feel worse for probably

414
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:07,669
other people out there who were relying

415
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,049
on patreon more for their entire thing

416
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:11,208
like a lot of the people who do the

417
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:14,269
handmade hero stuff at least have other

418
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,888
irons in the fire I know there's

419
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,600
probably people out there who were maybe

420
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:19,220
even living on their patreon I don't

421
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,079
know it doesn't tend to generate a huge

422
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,730
amount of revenue but it generates you

423
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:23,239
know for some people it generates quite

424
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,690
a bit

425
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,759
I hope those those people's products

426
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,470
aren't destroyed it's a really bad

427
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,120
situation and I feel like you know

428
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,620
especially maybe some of the higher

429
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,169
money patrons there's people who make

430
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,940
like 10 20 thousand dollars a month on

431
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:41,299
patreon and run an entire business out

432
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,279
of it it's not many people but I know

433
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:47,000
that you know there's there's plenty of

434
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:49,698
people like Jim sterling and David Rubin

435
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,129
there's there's just people out there

436
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:53,568
who you know when you read about patreon

437
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:55,698
they're like hey here's some people who

438
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:58,669
basically run a studio off of this thing

439
00:16:55,698 --> 00:17:00,289
and I don't know what's gonna happen to

440
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:01,849
those people I hope they're able to move

441
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:04,250
to something else because it seems like

442
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,929
this is going downhill quickly and it

443
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,140
won't have a significant effect on

444
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:10,759
handmade hero hopefully it won't have

445
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,549
too significant of an impact on the

446
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:14,959
handmade hero related projects but I

447
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:16,519
think there probably are some products

448
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,709
out there that are probably in real dire

449
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,150
straits because of this and I anyway my

450
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,919
heart goes out to those people because I

451
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,390
know how hard it is to be doing

452
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,059
something you really believe in and to

453
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,380
finally have it work out and then have

454
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:29,389
something like this happen and feel like

455
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,630
it's got to be really tough so hopefully

456
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,759
those people can find some other way to

457
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,620
get their patreon xand supporters moved

458
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:38,419
over and that not there's not too much

459
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:40,789
attrition during that process of people

460
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:42,200
just not wanting to have to bother

461
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,639
moving their stuff over somewhere else

462
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,000
or whatever so I don't know what

463
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:51,080
happened but it's really unfortunate

464
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,950
anyway moving off of that sad note on to

465
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:57,649
a neutral note I have been asked by none

466
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:00,230
other than midlow the maintainer of the

467
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:04,038
episode guide who I was just speaking so

468
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:07,069
highly of to please mention on stream my

469
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:09,140
chair apparently he gets a lot of people

470
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:10,879
asking about the chair or something and

471
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,070
he wanted to get it notated into the

472
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,320
episode guide and I think I've only ever

473
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:17,689
talked about the chair on the pre stream

474
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:20,149
before which of course is not kept and

475
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:24,529
is not entered into the video on-demand

476
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:26,600
archive so it cannot be notated the

477
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:28,609
chairs that we use at Mali rocket and

478
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,469
that I am sitting in right now is the

479
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:33,048
space seating professional eirGrid dark

480
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:35,230
back and padded black eco leather seat

481
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:38,599
two to one synchro tilt control

482
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:42,440
adjustable arms with tilt tension nylon

483
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:45,219
bass managers chair I do not know why

484
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,870
anyone would name a chair that I

485
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,360
probably would have just called it the

486
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:51,918
space eirGrid chair and then when I made

487
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,579
another chair I would name it something

488
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,710
else

489
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:56,149
but they did not decide to do that so

490
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,710
there you go and in case you're

491
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,990
wondering about whether you can afford

492
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,548
to forget the words space seating

493
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,620
professional eirGrid dark back and

494
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:05,179
padded black eco leather seat two to one

495
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:06,709
synchro tilt control adjustable arms

496
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:10,788
until attention with nylon based Madrid

497
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,440
chair chair you do have to because if

498
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:14,298
you accidentally get any of those words

499
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,909
wrong you will probably buy another

500
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:18,798
chair there are many of these chairs and

501
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:20,600
they are actually quite different so for

502
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,490
some reason you think you want to buy

503
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:25,849
the exact same chair that we are using

504
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:28,400
you have to actually buy this one not

505
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:32,048
one of the other ones also called a

506
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,850
space seating professional eirGrid chair

507
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:36,980
this is what we use I quite like them

508
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:39,500
but chairs are a matter of personal

509
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,940
preference so you may hate them also we

510
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,409
don't receive any money from eirGrid

511
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:47,659
this is a purely what we use and like

512
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:49,700
recommendation it's not a product

513
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:51,200
placement I'm just answering the

514
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,759
question of what we have in our

515
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,548
experience they're pretty cheap for

516
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,259
office chairs because $160 isn't free

517
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:59,089
there's definitely much cheaper office

518
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:00,710
chairs out there but there's much more

519
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:02,689
expensive office chairs out there

520
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,429
you can go buy a Herman Miller chair and

521
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,278
they can probably run you 1,400 dollars

522
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:08,929
or something like this these chairs on

523
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:10,460
the other hand I find are better than

524
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:11,778
those chairs I find them to be much more

525
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,360
comfortable much more supportive and

526
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:15,558
they're much cheaper so this is what we

527
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,178
use and we have a bunch of them here

528
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:19,038
we've been using them for several years

529
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:22,960
haven't had any problems we don't put

530
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:25,250
the arms on nobody here likes the arms

531
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,899
or I should say perhaps more

532
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,240
specifically nobody here likes having

533
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:32,028
arms on their chairs really so if

534
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,220
anything we either we don't mount the

535
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:36,140
arms at all most the time but other

536
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,850
times we mount the arms facing backwards

537
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,559
so there's just a place to lean back and

538
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:41,569
put your elbows if you want but when you

539
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:44,119
lean forward to work the arms are not in

540
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:46,189
your way at all because you can just

541
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,500
flip which the direction you can see

542
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,350
they're sort of tilted forwards so

543
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,179
that's what we use basically armless the

544
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:56,658
armless version we don't attach the arms

545
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:58,460
for this chair and hopefully that gives

546
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:02,330
me below everything he needs to notate

547
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:05,000
this for people who have questions about

548
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:06,109
the chair I think that's everything we

549
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,190
were supposed to cover at the beginning

550
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:12,908
of the series that's a lot of

551
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:12,909
frontmatter but hopefully it was useful

552
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:25,009
and now that we have taken up 30 minutes

553
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:28,129
with preamble let's go ahead and program

554
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:30,859
I believe if I did not reset the timer

555
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,230
incorrectly it is day 413 on handmade

556
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:34,329
hero I will well actually you know out

557
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,700
enough the episode guard has been

558
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:40,908
updated yet has it it has not let me

559
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:45,319
take a look at where we're at on the

560
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:46,850
YouTube archive we are at day 412 so day

561
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,990
413 is correct

562
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:50,418
oops I don't really need to get rid of

563
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:53,120
that do I just put it back there so we

564
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:55,669
are in day 413 so Dave 412 source code

565
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,619
if you are someone who pre-ordered the

566
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:00,710
game day 412 source code is what you

567
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:05,148
want to start with for today we are in

568
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:06,829
the middle of trying to debug our basic

569
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:10,459
lighting solution that we've been

570
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:12,558
working on so while we give Visual

571
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,930
Studio 17 years to start up I mean it's

572
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,329
a text editor after

573
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,430
it's gonna take a long time to load all

574
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:19,899
that important stuff let's go ahead and

575
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,850
run it and see where we are

576
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:27,310
I'll also build it first here just to

577
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:34,240
make sure we've got a fresh one all

578
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:36,639
right here we go so here you can see a

579
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,920
completely unlit level if I hit the f1

580
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,620
key it will run sort of our lighting

581
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:45,130
solution here and you can see our voxel

582
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:47,169
samples these are not actually the

583
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,420
samples of lighting they're just voxels

584
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,250
cells where we did compute lighting and

585
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,870
it just shows that I think the first or

586
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,250
maybe the average of the light in that

587
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:57,609
area but there's actually many lights

588
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,259
per voxel in the area anyway here is

589
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,509
what the interpolate idli ting solution

590
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:03,900
looks like as you can see it's actually

591
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:06,879
starting to get pretty good it's not

592
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,560
actually good yet it's just getting

593
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,570
pretty good because if you take a look

594
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,879
at what we're seeing here it's sort of

595
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:15,099
starting to look like an actual lighting

596
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,870
solution it's just not a good one yet

597
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:18,609
there's a lot of bugs I see in here a

598
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:21,159
lot of things that probably aren't quite

599
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:23,199
right and so our job over the next

600
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,550
couple sessions we already did some good

601
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,080
debugging we fixed the voxel

602
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,149
interpolation bugs that we had before

603
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,149
we're fetching outside the voxel would

604
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,590
do something stupid you already fixed

605
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,660
that and it made a huge difference and

606
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:35,500
now we just need to go through and check

607
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,910
a bunch of things

608
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,190
hey that we're doing reasonable lighting

609
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,840
calculations be that our ray casting is

610
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,820
actually working properly we've done no

611
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,409
debugging yet so far for all we know our

612
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:46,990
ray casting isn't even properly

613
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:49,630
intersecting with the boxes that we're

614
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,130
trying to intersect with and then we

615
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,750
have to also make sure that we're doing

616
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:56,770
stuff like handling our light transport

617
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,390
transmission properly are we over

618
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,160
sampling are we under sampling are we

619
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,750
waiting samples improperly like there's

620
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,830
so many things we could be drawn so

621
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,509
we're just gonna go through now and

622
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:06,069
start tightening up those screws and

623
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,690
once we have them all tightened

624
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,189
hopefully like I said this is already

625
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,779
kind of starting to look useable right

626
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,759
like there's some bugs in it but it's

627
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:14,079
starting to kind of look usable and if I

628
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,549
was walking around this game and saw a

629
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,839
real-time lighting doing this good of a

630
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:18,250
bouncing stuff where we had all this

631
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,049
sort of light play lost stuff I would be

632
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,789
pretty darn happy with that especially

633
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:23,440
for an indie game which honestly tends

634
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:25,690
to not have that much of that stuff in

635
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,610
it you know if anything they've got the

636
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,320
default unity screens

637
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:30,909
face nonsense going on where you got all

638
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:32,769
these weird halos all over the place and

639
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:35,110
and stuff looks weird

640
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:38,200
but anyway um so hopefully we'll be able

641
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:39,369
to get to a place that even that's much

642
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,350
significantly better than we're looking

643
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:43,869
at now and at that point what we'll do

644
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:46,379
is we'll move it into the GPU so that

645
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:48,789
all of the lighting is computed GPU side

646
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,140
after the sort of letting hierarchy is

647
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,720
built so we'll basically build a

648
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,950
Lionheart CPU drop it down let all the

649
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,470
letting computation happen on the GPU

650
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,840
side and that'll also let us do some

651
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,329
things like we can probably control just

652
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,399
how much lighting gets actually done for

653
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,779
example we could make a fast running

654
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,390
version of the game that really doesn't

655
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:09,250
have much lighting at all that we use on

656
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,509
platforms that don't have beefy graphics

657
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,980
cards right because basically what we

658
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,419
could do is just use all of the graphs

659
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,039
Clerk card horsepower which we don't

660
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:18,940
really need that much for other aspects

661
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:21,159
of the game we can just do crazy amounts

662
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,808
of lighting on there and then that way

663
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,259
we can always just dial it back and have

664
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:28,149
less good lighting in versions of the

665
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,160
game that are running on underpowered

666
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,809
systems right that aren't running on the

667
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,190
latest hardware which you know there's

668
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:36,178
plenty of people who might want to play

669
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,980
with handmade hero um so that's

670
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:40,660
basically it I would also point out I

671
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:44,079
don't know what's going on here but we

672
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:46,210
we seem to have some weird like I don't

673
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,428
know our our multi sample anti-aliasing

674
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,190
does oh is that because we're not full

675
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:53,710
screen or multi sample anti-aliasing

676
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,390
could look better I guess it still looks

677
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,519
pretty good multi sample anti-aliasing

678
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,650
isn't perfect I guess and we do have the

679
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,210
weird depth pass stuff happening so it's

680
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,480
still it's pretty good it's better than

681
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:06,880
nothing I guess anyway so that's our

682
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,029
goals and today like I said all I wanted

683
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,240
to really do is start drilling down into

684
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:15,599
the lighting and hunting for bugs so

685
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:20,980
that's what we're gonna do now all right

686
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:23,379
let's start by taking a look I in so

687
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:26,919
wait do that let's start by taking a

688
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:29,320
look at the shader because during the

689
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,299
pre streams someone was mentioning that

690
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,649
we forgot to clamp our direction of

691
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,179
lighting now normally you'll notice when

692
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,120
I have been doing direction lighting

693
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:39,429
I've been clamping it properly and I

694
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,199
guess I forgot to do that so let's take

695
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:43,480
a look yeah in fact here it is right

696
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,640
they're 100% right I don't know you

697
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,079
remember many times I've typed in this

698
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,180
equation where we do the inner product

699
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:51,669
here to do a directional fall-off and

700
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:54,130
you'll notice that almost every time

701
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:56,470
thereafter I did a clamp on it right and

702
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,700
there's no clamp here so this is

703
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,620
supposed to be clamped and isn't being

704
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:04,450
clamped so that was 100% correct

705
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:06,279
suggestion we want to clamp between 0

706
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,559
and 1 this fall off now why do I have to

707
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:09,849
clamp it there remember what we're doing

708
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,339
is we're taking a dot product of two

709
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:14,049
vectors to figure out what the angle

710
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,099
between them is and more civically what

711
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,259
the cosine of the angle between theirs

712
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:21,099
which is the result of the inner product

713
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:24,160
now when a vector starts going past 90

714
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:25,299
degrees its will go from you know at 90

715
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,190
degrees the inner product will be zero

716
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:28,809
then it will start becoming negative as

717
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,000
we're putting in opposite directions we

718
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:33,369
don't want to account from for any kind

719
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,769
of negative contribution of light once

720
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:36,939
it falls off to zero that's the end of

721
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:39,910
the possible competition that light

722
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:42,009
anything coming from behind should not

723
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,960
have any contribution at all it

724
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:45,869
shouldn't have a negative contribution

725
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,750
which is what we would be getting here

726
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:52,479
so that's a definite bug I don't know to

727
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:54,970
what extent that bug was contributing to

728
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,140
erroneous actual visible visible

729
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,350
artifacts but it certainly would have

730
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,750
right so it's very important to fix that

731
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:02,949
because you never want a contribution

732
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,450
there to be negative because you're

733
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,620
gonna get really nonsensical results

734
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,779
especially if you weren't trying to make

735
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:09,609
it be that way

736
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:11,829
so anyway here is in fact and you know

737
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:14,679
what that was a big part of it looks

738
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:17,409
like because we had much more erroneous

739
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,680
results down here and now we're getting

740
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:22,000
quite a bit better than we were right so

741
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,390
it looks like that was definitely a

742
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,089
problem that that now has been has been

743
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:29,380
improved dramatically and you know what

744
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:31,209
this is starting to look like I said

745
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,460
pretty good right I'm pretty happy with

746
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,440
this if we can get this running in real

747
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,069
time on the GPU I think that would be a

748
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,900
pretty nice situation like I feel like

749
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:43,089
that would look pretty darn good

750
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:47,320
again I'm just not sure yet though

751
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:48,939
whether or not we're getting reasonable

752
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:51,490
results from things like the Ray caster

753
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,690
now why do I say that well you know if

754
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,150
you take a look at what we're seeing

755
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,980
here light sample wise you can see that

756
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,059
maybe some light samples out here that

757
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,579
are showing that they're getting a

758
00:28:58,058 --> 00:29:02,558
fairly bright light contribution but I

759
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:03,879
don't feel like that's correct the

760
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:05,289
reason I don't feel like that's correct

761
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,970
is because if you take a look at where

762
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:08,379
our only light source is this is our

763
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:11,019
well we it's not our only light source

764
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,150
we have two light sources right now one

765
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:15,279
is just an ambient skylight and one is

766
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,230
this light right here now I can turn off

767
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,670
that ambient skylight for example I can

768
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:23,740
go into the render group and we we sort

769
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:28,840
of just hacked in that when we do our

770
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:30,579
ray cast here's our ray cast what we did

771
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:33,490
is anytime we were going to return

772
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:36,189
nothing no hit we still gave back a

773
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:38,740
color that was slightly you know a

774
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,240
slightly gray color right and so what I

775
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:44,410
wanted to do here was just get rid of

776
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,870
that right eye if I just nuke that out

777
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,519
instead give it nothing or I guess the

778
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:51,339
shorter hand way to do that would just

779
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:53,230
be initialized to all zeros like this if

780
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:56,529
I do that instead and now rerun the

781
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:59,230
lighting solution you can see just the

782
00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:00,940
contribution of just this one light and

783
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,440
when I see just the contribution of just

784
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,269
that one light I can see some things

785
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,850
that I don't really know how much I

786
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:08,769
believe whether they are accurate some

787
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:11,289
things look quite accurate such as this

788
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:12,730
back here this can't you know this light

789
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:17,710
source is not going to be contributing

790
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:21,880
to this here but if you look here you

791
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:23,679
can see like what is that you know where

792
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,170
is that light coming from because

793
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,470
there's really no conceivable even

794
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:31,570
erroneously sampled bounce that should

795
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,950
really be able to get here because in

796
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:34,659
order for something to get here

797
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,700
something over here would have had to

798
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,769
have been bright and it isn't so that

799
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,440
tells me that we have some bugs in our

800
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:43,480
ray caster because a lot of this looks

801
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,509
correct they're probably not major

802
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,700
glaring bugs but there's subtle bugs and

803
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:49,808
we need to fix them otherwise we're

804
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,860
classic gonna have these weird little

805
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:55,299
lighting artifacts right so that's you

806
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:57,039
know definitely something that Clues me

807
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:59,980
into the fact that that ray caster or

808
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,269
something similar to it where that

809
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,509
contribution is getting computed is

810
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:06,099
wrong another thing that I'm seeing here

811
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:08,740
that that makes me think that there's

812
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:12,639
you know some some issues of foot

813
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:15,359
is just that like now you know even just

814
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,670
just thinking about how this this

815
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,619
procedure was working in our in our

816
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,840
transmission the way that we were doing

817
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:26,469
our transmission for compute light

818
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:28,539
propagation I'm not sure whether I when

819
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,339
I was thinking about this this only

820
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:32,470
happens in the final gather so the

821
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:34,929
skylight part only happens in the final

822
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:37,779
gather that means our skylight wasn't

823
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:40,060
having bounced lighting before because

824
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:42,789
the skylight lit surface couldn't bounce

825
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:45,159
to another surface and that's also wrong

826
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:46,930
because if I remember correctly the way

827
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,790
that our light emission works you can

828
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:50,380
see here we do compute like propagation

829
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:53,619
what happens with the compute light

830
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:56,440
propagation is in here if the heat index

831
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:58,329
doesn't happen then it doesn't propagate

832
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,509
any light and so when it does that

833
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:03,490
raycast it's never going to sum in any

834
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:06,670
of this ambient lighting during the

835
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,710
initial bounces so I think what I'm

836
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:12,310
going to do here is fixin a this

837
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:15,940
particular version and say to do need a

838
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:21,809
skylight method that works with our

839
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:21,809
propagation and leave it at that

840
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,029
all right

841
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:38,160
if you'll excuse me for a moment okay so

842
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,720
that's what we're doing by the way I'm

843
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,720
having some delicious coffee right now I

844
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:45,470
love coffee

845
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:54,750
we bought a espresso machine for the

846
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:56,879
office because basically like if you buy

847
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,200
if you like to drink coffee and you buy

848
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,620
it from a coffee shop

849
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,640
it is crazy expensive like don't ever do

850
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:04,109
the math if you're someone who gets

851
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,980
coffee at a coffee shop don't ever do

852
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:10,819
the math but we determined that even a

853
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:14,099
relatively expensive coffee machine is

854
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:17,099
drastically cheaper than buying coffee

855
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:18,149
out and so we bought one and it's

856
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:20,549
awesome

857
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:23,519
like I just make coffee all the time now

858
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:24,750
like either decaf or regular depending

859
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,180
on like in the morning I make a regular

860
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:29,430
and after it's I make decaf and it's so

861
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,960
much cheaper it's like it turns coffee

862
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:33,299
into basically being free all of a

863
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,220
sudden because all you have to do is

864
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:36,869
find beans you can buy at a reasonable

865
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:42,600
price that you like and then you're done

866
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:45,149
right so yeah sorry Starbucks or other

867
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:47,519
folks who live off of the overpriced

868
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:49,259
coffee economy I gotta tell ya it's the

869
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,599
way to go plus you can tune it to your

870
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,099
own liking like you can make exactly

871
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,659
what you want over time which as

872
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:57,359
programmers you know we kind of like to

873
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:01,830
fixate on improvements to things it's

874
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:05,759
pretty darn good all right anyway so

875
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:08,190
yeah let's take a look here and think

876
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,250
about some stuff that we haven't really

877
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,769
addressed yet that we're probably gonna

878
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:20,250
need to address so what we're looking at

879
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:22,079
here right this is our raycast this this

880
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,679
is the code that does our red casting

881
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,059
right so we're calling this and it's

882
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,419
looping through all of the elements in

883
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:32,309
the system and it's skipping one person

884
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:37,170
who is generally the person that we're

885
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:39,299
looking at so if we're like okay this is

886
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,950
a surface we need to light and that's

887
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,960
the first we're looking at right now

888
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:45,000
now we want to go gather lighting we

889
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,440
skip intersections with that surface and

890
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,659
the reason that we skip intersections

891
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,280
with that surface is because we would

892
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,300
always intersect it we're on it we're

893
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,280
starting off on it

894
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,450
so floating-point precision why is we

895
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,710
would have to do something like offset

896
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:57,000
ourselves from the surface a little bit

897
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,380
to make sure that we don't hit it or

898
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,349
something like this and we'd really

899
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:05,539
rather not write like we'd really rather

900
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:08,700
not have to do that sort of thing so

901
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:10,889
anyway what we can see here is when we

902
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:13,588
do our intersections you'll notice that

903
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:15,480
one thing that we do is we don't hand we

904
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:17,849
don't intersect back faces and what I

905
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,909
mean by that is if the Ray direction is

906
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:23,910
pointing in the same direction as the

907
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:25,379
surface we don't test it and you know

908
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:28,879
what let me go ahead and bring up Milton

909
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:32,160
here it's been a while since we have

910
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:40,140
brought up Milton but I think now is the

911
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:43,769
time if I can get this cord untangled to

912
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:46,440
bring it up okay so let me go ahead and

913
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:49,440
fire up Milton here for you and then we

914
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:53,309
can discuss this aspect of it a little

915
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,440
bit Milton again one of those projects I

916
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:57,828
mentioned the beginning of a stream

917
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,000
written by viewer fan made hero who

918
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:02,068
wanted to replace the drawing package we

919
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,739
used ended up making something that's

920
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:06,568
actually significantly better than the

921
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:09,358
commercial project that we were using

922
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:12,750
originally which is nuts but nice job

923
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:15,869
Sergio anyway here we are on day four

924
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,869
thirteen Sergio by the way I think

925
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:19,200
recently said he was moving to Vancouver

926
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:21,269
I

927
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:27,539
that's pretty nearby I feel like that's

928
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:29,639
in on in just that the southwestern part

929
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:32,099
of Canada just not far from Seattle it's

930
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:36,719
like a three four-hour train ride up

931
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:44,700
there actually anyway Dave 4:13

932
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:46,919
here is our ray cast debugging in anyway

933
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:48,659
so what I've seen is you know we've got

934
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,068
a surface here and there's a point on

935
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:52,710
the surface we're starting to collect

936
00:36:50,068 --> 00:36:54,519
lighting by casting Ray's out right or

937
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,679
we have an emitter here

938
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,239
right so this is a light and it's

939
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:01,079
shining light out and it wants to see

940
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:04,089
where it should deposit that light right

941
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,789
either or when we're doing this ray

942
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:11,350
casting generally what we're assuming is

943
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:12,820
that our shapes are closed right so

944
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:14,949
we're assuming we have like a solid

945
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,170
shape like this and that what we're

946
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:20,559
doing is when we're a cast when we're a

947
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,190
cast out we don't need to look at this

948
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,579
face

949
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:26,349
or this face for intersections and the

950
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:28,630
reason that we don't need to is because

951
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:32,110
we know we couldn't have gotten to them

952
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:35,650
without passing through one of these non

953
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:38,740
back faces or I should say non same

954
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:41,470
direction facing and say that exactly

955
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:45,069
first so if we take a look at these

956
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:47,289
normals these surface normals right if

957
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:50,200
we take a look at those what we can see

958
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:52,929
is that this plane right I will always

959
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:56,199
hit here which is a normal that's facing

960
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:57,879
backwards towards me right before I can

961
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:00,368
hit any of these ones that are facing

962
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,260
away from me right and that's just

963
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:04,990
because if you take a look at how this

964
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:08,050
object is divided all of its faces that

965
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:10,449
are facing toward me form a wall of what

966
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,100
I can see and any face that's facing

967
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:15,250
away from me is something I couldn't

968
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:17,739
have gotten to unless I pass through the

969
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:20,108
object first and that's just a property

970
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:22,179
of closed solids if you have a

971
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:24,489
completely closed solid which is any

972
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:27,039
object generally in the real world you

973
00:38:24,489 --> 00:38:28,329
know there's no such thing even that

974
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,190
things that are open on the inside

975
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:31,659
they're actually not open right they

976
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,690
have a thickness and they have walls

977
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:37,569
going all around them right you can't

978
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,280
get to something that's on the backside

979
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,420
of something to you without going

980
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,650
through something that's on the front

981
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,840
side of something to you

982
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,940
right if you imagine just a ball or

983
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,059
something right I can never get to any

984
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,950
of this part of the ball right none of

985
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:52,210
this part of the surface without going

986
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:53,710
through this part of the surface first

987
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,849
right that's just a property of closed

988
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:59,800
solids so it's one way to eliminate the

989
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:02,049
number of triangles that you need to

990
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,390
test or in our cases quads that you need

991
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:08,260
to test you can eliminate it by a factor

992
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:10,420
of two right 50% of the surfaces to

993
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,370
we'll probably be back facing and 50%

994
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,170
will be front facing we only need to

995
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:19,960
test those 50% that our front face that

996
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:23,289
face towards us right now in case you're

997
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,720
wondering this is 100% exactly analogous

998
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:28,929
to the old hidden surface removal

999
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:30,329
removal algorithm or even just what we

1000
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:33,009
use nowadays to speed up rendering

1001
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:34,900
nowadays when we render services a lot

1002
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,970
of times we just don't render back faces

1003
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:41,410
so what happens is you know for example

1004
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:43,329
if we've got a solid object in the world

1005
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:45,519
right so we're drawing like a cube or

1006
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:47,349
something like this there's back faces

1007
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,480
to the cube right here's our front faces

1008
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:52,839
1 2 3 and then we've got our back faces

1009
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,639
1 2 3 right what we do when we render

1010
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,980
typically in a raster Iser is look to

1011
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:59,170
see how the polygons are wound and what

1012
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,690
we'll say is well okay we're gonna wind

1013
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,480
our polygons so that when we are looking

1014
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,320
from the front side like this we're

1015
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,199
gonna wind them so they're

1016
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:12,789
counterclockwise right so here's 0 1 2 3

1017
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:14,649
right that means that if you were to

1018
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:17,170
imagine this cube being spun all the way

1019
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:20,320
around so that now that was a back face

1020
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:22,000
right so imagine this cube being spun

1021
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,640
180 degrees so that now we've got sort

1022
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,010
of a back face there now they wouldn't

1023
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,779
be wound this way anymore right this

1024
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,070
this direction is not how they'd be

1025
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,960
wound because that's what it was when

1026
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:34,210
it's facing us instead they'll be wound

1027
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,639
this way they'll be one clockwise right

1028
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:38,949
because this vertex went here so there's

1029
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,719
zero right this vertex went here right

1030
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:42,699
because it's spun around right these

1031
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:45,099
were spinning around so this is one went

1032
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:49,899
over here the zero went over here right

1033
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:51,789
so now it's 0 1 2 3 clockwise so what we

1034
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,410
can then do is when we go to rasterize

1035
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:56,440
and we look at this quad we can go oh

1036
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:58,750
it's wound the wrong way it must be back

1037
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:02,050
facing just don't rasterize it at all

1038
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:06,489
and so again that's a 50% save right it

1039
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:08,710
saves half of the work because we never

1040
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:10,149
have to rafter eyes those right so this

1041
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,250
is the same technique that I'm using

1042
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,869
here during the raycast is the same

1043
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,820
thing you use in a raster eyes to save

1044
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:17,769
that work it's just a good 50% savings

1045
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,210
to realize that if you're only dealing

1046
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:21,989
with closed objects during this problem

1047
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:25,480
now we don't always have closed objects

1048
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:27,098
in handmade hero we've got sprites right

1049
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,010
and those sprites are just little sprite

1050
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:32,680
cards right that's all they are they

1051
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:35,680
don't have a solid shape and basically

1052
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:37,929
what I'm electing to do is I am electing

1053
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:39,098
to say when we send down the lighting

1054
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:41,049
for this because remember we're gonna

1055
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:43,750
send out lighting separately lighting is

1056
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:46,539
based on these light quads which are not

1057
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,530
the same as what we're drawing we don't

1058
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:48,969
they're come they can be completely

1059
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,099
separate because remember we're sampling

1060
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:53,799
lighting per pixel now we don't care

1061
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:55,599
what we draw we can draw completely

1062
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,339
different scene from the one-wheel it

1063
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,300
wouldn't make any sense

1064
00:41:57,338 --> 00:42:03,639
not a good idea but we could there's no

1065
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,410
coupling in the algorithm so we can

1066
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:07,239
generate a completely different lighting

1067
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:08,980
model as we do for render model and this

1068
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,409
was 100% intentional on my part because

1069
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:14,318
we probably want to send down much more

1070
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:15,940
simplified stuff to our lighting

1071
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,829
solution than we do to our render

1072
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,838
decision because we only need a course

1073
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:22,510
idea of what the lighting is for this

1074
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:24,068
game we don't need every last little

1075
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,990
detail to be respected in the lighting

1076
00:42:24,068 --> 00:42:28,269
we're just going for our general sort of

1077
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:30,669
light transmission lets us know how lit

1078
00:42:28,269 --> 00:42:32,588
things generally are this is not a game

1079
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,300
that's trying to stimulate little minut

1080
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:35,949
differences in the light based on little

1081
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,740
tiny crenellations in geometry or

1082
00:42:35,949 --> 00:42:40,389
something like this and in fact no games

1083
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:41,739
are because games can't do that yet we

1084
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:43,179
don't have the horsepower but that's

1085
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:44,318
neither here nor there that's more of a

1086
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:48,068
tracer land if you're going down that

1087
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:50,769
route but point being because of that

1088
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:53,588
I'm just saying look if we want an

1089
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:55,389
object to be sucking up light properly

1090
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:56,588
for being in a particular area what

1091
00:42:55,389 --> 00:42:58,480
we're gonna do is we're just gonna send

1092
00:42:56,588 --> 00:43:00,279
down two things I'm either side of the

1093
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,050
sprite card so if you imagine looking at

1094
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,609
the game from here here's the camera and

1095
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,289
we've got a sprite card here that's the

1096
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:08,259
hero it's facing that way we're just

1097
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:10,150
gonna send down to fake light things one

1098
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,760
this way one that way so it's like a

1099
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:14,680
sandwich where the hero's actual sprite

1100
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,530
would have been in between and that way

1101
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:20,108
we don't have to ever worry about dual

1102
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:21,460
sided surfaces I just decided it was too

1103
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:23,230
much of a pain in the butt to track them

1104
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,420
through and probably just gonna end up

1105
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:27,068
being more costly and slower to do so so

1106
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,900
we'll just for those things that are

1107
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:30,670
just flat cards we'll send down two

1108
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,530
things anything that's a real piece of

1109
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,269
geometry like the cubes they will just

1110
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:35,870
get sent down as actual clothes geometry

1111
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:37,159
and that way all

1112
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:39,049
whenever we're working with these things

1113
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:41,839
we can just understand the fact that we

1114
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:44,480
only care about front-facing stuff right

1115
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,970
and that should be sufficient for our

1116
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,800
purposes so here's that code right here

1117
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:50,389
and you can see that what it's doing is

1118
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,130
just taking that inner product and going

1119
00:43:50,389 --> 00:43:54,829
hey look if the normal is not pointing

1120
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:58,700
back towards me then I'm not going to

1121
00:43:54,829 --> 00:44:00,949
use it right now I don't really know why

1122
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:02,589
we necessarily picked this constant I

1123
00:44:00,949 --> 00:44:05,869
think we've probably just picked it

1124
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:07,579
randomly as something that would make

1125
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:09,799
our divide not blow up because you can

1126
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:11,449
kind of see that we have a divide here

1127
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,519
by that racehorse and we have to make

1128
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:16,099
sure that it doesn't blow up now why do

1129
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,719
we have to make sure of that right there

1130
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:20,000
well that's because when we do our

1131
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:22,399
raycast right if we're ray casting in

1132
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,889
this direction so here's our array

1133
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,240
origin and here's our ray direction if

1134
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:31,969
we're casting in this direction you have

1135
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:34,250
to remember there are services we cannot

1136
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:36,679
hit we can't hit anything that's

1137
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:38,719
perpendicular for example right this ray

1138
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:40,759
will just sail on by and no matter if it

1139
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:42,019
went infinity or negative infinity it

1140
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,910
doesn't matter it will never hit it

1141
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:45,860
that's what this is because the inner

1142
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:48,980
product of these two things will be zero

1143
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:51,920
and that means racehorse n will be zero

1144
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,719
and the math is telling us this right

1145
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,630
the math is telling us that is not

1146
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:58,609
allowed it's one of those nice places

1147
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:00,320
where the math works out to tell you

1148
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:02,000
things you should have known already but

1149
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,130
even if you forgot or didn't understand

1150
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,199
the math will then tell you and you let

1151
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:07,730
go there's a divide here that means

1152
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:09,859
there could be a divide by zero that

1153
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:11,929
means zero is not allowed that means

1154
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,550
almost universally when you have that in

1155
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:15,529
a geometric construction that there's

1156
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,390
some geometric scenario that literally

1157
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,930
can't happen and it's telling you that

1158
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:25,969
right and that is exactly what that is

1159
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:28,489
what it's kind of cool right all right

1160
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:30,259
so is so what we decided to do here was

1161
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:32,329
rather than just test for an epsilon

1162
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,830
which means hey let's see if it's close

1163
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,750
to zero and if it's close to zero we

1164
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:37,279
don't do it we actually said look we're

1165
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,710
gonna test for an entirely one-sided

1166
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,450
thing because again let's not bother

1167
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:43,369
testing those things because you could

1168
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:46,069
see if we were trying to just avoid just

1169
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:47,179
just a divide by zero right we would

1170
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,309
have something that would look more like

1171
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:51,440
this

1172
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:54,349
right we just want to make sure that it

1173
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,570
was within you know or that it wasn't

1174
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:57,559
within a certain range of zero but it's

1175
00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:00,080
say what we're doing is saying hey look

1176
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:01,730
positive values we just don't want ever

1177
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,319
right we don't want we don't care up

1178
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:05,119
closes early early this is their bad and

1179
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:08,210
the reason for that is again we would be

1180
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,980
testing services we know we can't hit so

1181
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,690
far from being a bug that's actually

1182
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,920
good

1183
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,869
that's what we want to see so that's

1184
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:18,590
fine

1185
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:21,109
so that is reasonably logical we then

1186
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:25,390
take our origin here we take the Ray

1187
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:29,570
origin and we we create essentially a

1188
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:31,730
thing which points from the thing we're

1189
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:34,039
checking the service we're checking back

1190
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:37,940
towards the Ray back towards the Rays

1191
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:39,980
origin right so what we're doing here is

1192
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:45,139
we're just saying okay here's my Ray

1193
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:47,150
Origin here is the surface we're calling

1194
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:50,299
the source I think that's because we

1195
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:52,550
just copied it it's just a thing we're

1196
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,050
trying to hit and what we're doing here

1197
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:56,840
is we're saying alright there's a point

1198
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:59,539
on this plane we know because we made

1199
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,760
one right and what we're gonna do is

1200
00:46:59,539 --> 00:47:03,829
we're gonna say alright let's create the

1201
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,840
vector that points back in this

1202
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:08,299
direction now you'll notice it's the

1203
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,309
actually the full vector so it's not a

1204
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,990
normal or anything it's a full vector

1205
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:15,769
going all the way from here to here

1206
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:20,119
right what we then do is say let's take

1207
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:23,900
the dot product of the normal that we do

1208
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:25,369
have from our surface and this or this

1209
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,400
this vector going this way right so

1210
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:31,929
we're taking this as a dot product right

1211
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:35,389
which means it's sort of computing this

1212
00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:36,649
cosine here right so it's computing the

1213
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:38,779
that's not right

1214
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,460
computing the cosine that's the sign

1215
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:43,040
that's the cross product right there

1216
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:46,039
this is the dot product so we're taking

1217
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:47,570
the cosine of this angle here and then

1218
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:50,300
we're multiplying it by the length of

1219
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:53,269
this vector right because remember I

1220
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,140
said there's so many times please tell

1221
00:47:53,269 --> 00:47:55,820
me you know what I'm gonna say right now

1222
00:47:54,139 --> 00:48:00,199
please tell me you know I'm gonna say

1223
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:03,050
tell me you know a transpose B equals

1224
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:05,599
length of a length of B cosine theta I

1225
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:07,730
if there is anyone who has been watching

1226
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,849
handmade hero the entire way through who

1227
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:12,860
doesn't know this equation I do not know

1228
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:15,589
what to say to you I am going to have to

1229
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:18,470
just get a white glove and slap it right

1230
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:19,730
across your face because this is so

1231
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:22,099
important and we've talked about so many

1232
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,719
times again that's exactly what's

1233
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:25,819
happening here we know we have one

1234
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:27,559
vector that's a normal where we're

1235
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,120
taking one thing out of the equation

1236
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:30,259
right because we know one of this this

1237
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,179
right here that's normal

1238
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,920
the length of the normal is one so one

1239
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:35,569
of these goes away that leaves us with

1240
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,030
the cosine of theta which is this right

1241
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:40,100
here times the length of B which is this

1242
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:41,780
vector right here so that's exactly what

1243
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:43,519
we're getting we're getting the cosine

1244
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:47,210
of this angle times the length of this

1245
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,460
vector right then what we're doing is

1246
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:52,760
we're taking whatever that was we're

1247
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:55,880
negating it and dividing it by this

1248
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:58,610
inner product that we got back here

1249
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:05,260
right and what that's doing is that's

1250
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:05,260
computing a ratio right between the two

1251
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,829
between the two directions it's creating

1252
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:14,840
a ratio between this and this right and

1253
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:17,360
what that's trying to do is figure out

1254
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,820
how long it will take for something

1255
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:22,190
going in this direction to cover

1256
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:25,700
something that needs to go all the that

1257
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:27,829
that to intersect with something that is

1258
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:29,449
going in this direction right it's like

1259
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:31,190
this plane depending on where you're

1260
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:32,659
going to be is gonna be a different

1261
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:35,570
place depending on how far you've gone

1262
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:37,699
this way right and so that ratio there

1263
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:39,740
is what we're competing with t-ray right

1264
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:41,659
and that's gonna tell us how far along

1265
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:47,149
this we have to go before we hit this

1266
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:49,549
place so then we say is our a if we got

1267
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:52,280
a intersection that's in front of us and

1268
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:55,070
remember the reason that in front of us

1269
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,180
is important is because when we solve

1270
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,980
these equations we're solving these

1271
00:49:56,179 --> 00:50:01,159
equations it could could continuously

1272
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:02,630
with regular continuous math and what

1273
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:03,920
continuous math does when you know

1274
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:05,480
everything that you ever did in grade

1275
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,590
school and high school and whatever else

1276
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:11,269
right probably most of college is always

1277
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,680
in continuous math it's not in discrete

1278
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:14,719
math and what that means is that when we

1279
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:16,819
solve an equation right T a plus B

1280
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:19,119
equals five or whatever right

1281
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:22,730
we solve equations that look like these

1282
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:25,849
what we end up doing is we end up

1283
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:29,150
solving for a real value or potentially

1284
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:32,150
even imaginary value of T right but it's

1285
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:35,660
a real or imaginary value continuous it

1286
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:38,119
doesn't have the notion of bounding

1287
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:40,399
planes or step functions or anything

1288
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,529
like this so what that means is when we

1289
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,570
solve this equation it's really not

1290
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:48,170
solving for array at solving for a line

1291
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:50,420
right so it may produce a T value that's

1292
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:53,690
representative of backwards T can be

1293
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:57,559
negative right so she could equal

1294
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:59,510
negative something right and we don't

1295
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,279
want to know that if there's something

1296
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:03,380
behind us that doesn't count we're

1297
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,540
trying to look in the forward direction

1298
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,180
only so this is the place where we clip

1299
00:51:05,539 --> 00:51:10,969
that out so we say all right if the

1300
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:13,759
intersection is going to be in front of

1301
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:15,649
us and it's closer than our closest hid

1302
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,780
so we don't have to go as far as the

1303
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:19,220
closest that we've recorded so far then

1304
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,200
what we're going to do is we're going to

1305
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:25,219
see whether or not we believe it to fall

1306
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:27,289
within the legal region of this

1307
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:29,119
particular hip right because remember

1308
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:32,000
we're not trying to just intersect

1309
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,099
planes we're trying to intersect squares

1310
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,639
like little like rectangular bounds

1311
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:39,710
right okay so the next thing we do is

1312
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:42,079
say all right let's find out where we

1313
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:46,280
actually are in the real world so we

1314
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:49,340
take this Ray position computation and

1315
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,470
we say start at the origin go out along

1316
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:54,380
the normal as far as you said you what

1317
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:54,769
needed to go to get to this hip we do

1318
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,750
that

1319
00:51:54,769 --> 00:52:00,259
right we then look and say all right

1320
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:04,070
take the inner product of this ray right

1321
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:05,510
whatever this this ray position take the

1322
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:09,710
inner product of that with our source

1323
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:11,930
axes okay and what you'll notice here is

1324
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:14,389
the relative origin part is pretty

1325
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:16,369
important because the relative origin

1326
00:52:14,389 --> 00:52:19,670
part means we've already centered

1327
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:23,299
ourselves around the source right that's

1328
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:25,670
why we're using this vector this

1329
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,860
relative origin here rather than the

1330
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:30,470
original ray origin is because we want

1331
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:34,280
the result of stepping along this ray to

1332
00:52:30,469 --> 00:52:35,989
still be in the space of this right we

1333
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,710
want to be centered around this why

1334
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:41,959
because our square is defined around

1335
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:45,440
there right if this is our source P

1336
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:48,079
right we've got a square that's defined

1337
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,869
by an x-axis and a y-axis emitting from

1338
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:53,630
that point and when we compute where the

1339
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:55,670
Ray ends up we want it to be relative to

1340
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:57,800
this we want a vector relative to this

1341
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:00,139
because only if it's relative to that

1342
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:03,140
can we then directly dot product it with

1343
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:06,559
our axes to find out where it is so here

1344
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:09,409
we go we do this we dot product with our

1345
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:12,320
x-axis and our y-axis that tells us

1346
00:53:09,409 --> 00:53:14,389
where it is relative to them why we do

1347
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:19,640
2.0 I believe is because of the way

1348
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:23,139
we've stored these right so if you think

1349
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:25,940
about what happens here this X check and

1350
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:28,549
Y check it's is it greater than or equal

1351
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:29,720
to the width greater than less less than

1352
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,119
or equal to the width you know negative

1353
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:34,669
with positive with well what happens

1354
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:36,800
here is the width it would really be

1355
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:38,900
half the width here so rather than

1356
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,089
divide the width by half in both cases I

1357
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:45,650
just multiply the X check by two once

1358
00:53:41,088 --> 00:53:47,299
right and that's it so that's all there

1359
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:49,490
is to it we check to see whether it's

1360
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,950
within those bounds and if it is within

1361
00:53:49,489 --> 00:53:53,000
those bounds we do consider it a hit and

1362
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:55,819
off we go

1363
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,199
right we recorded as the closest hit so

1364
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,430
far because we know we couldn't have

1365
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:01,159
gotten here unless we already determined

1366
00:53:58,429 --> 00:54:03,289
it was the closest set we then say which

1367
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:06,049
one it was and what its emission value

1368
00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:10,279
was like so so that it can go back to

1369
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:13,910
the calling code correctly and that's

1370
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:16,940
all she wrote so to me that looks like a

1371
00:54:13,909 --> 00:54:18,409
pretty stable ray cast there could be a

1372
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:26,409
bug lurking in there but it doesn't

1373
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:26,409
there's not an obvious one so basically

1374
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:35,240
I'm not super suspicious of that code

1375
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:36,920
particularly however just because I'm

1376
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:38,239
not supposed to have that specific code

1377
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,470
doesn't mean we couldn't still have a

1378
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:41,449
bug in the way that we're calling the

1379
00:54:39,469 --> 00:54:43,789
ray cast for example we don't know if

1380
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:44,419
all these values are set correctly so

1381
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:49,309
there could be a

1382
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:50,750
looking in here we don't know and we

1383
00:54:49,309 --> 00:54:52,070
don't know the other thing we don't know

1384
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,929
is is there a bug lurking in where we

1385
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:55,460
set these for example could the x-axis

1386
00:54:53,929 --> 00:54:57,730
and whacks have been set wrong could the

1387
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,990
width and height had been set wrong

1388
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:02,929
those are things that easily could

1389
00:54:59,989 --> 00:55:06,949
happen which would cause a bug in what

1390
00:55:02,929 --> 00:55:14,000
we are doing right so there's all that

1391
00:55:06,949 --> 00:55:15,259
now there's another there's another

1392
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,170
thing that we could be doing wrong here

1393
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,940
too right so when we say which thing to

1394
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:22,490
skip for example we could be saying that

1395
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:23,960
wrong when we call this right we could

1396
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:25,909
be calling it with the wrong information

1397
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,500
in terms of when we're trying to

1398
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:29,299
propagate that light you know are we

1399
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,250
passing the right index here or whatever

1400
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:33,200
I think we probably are pretty hard to

1401
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,489
get that wrong I think but again there's

1402
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:36,349
like all those sorts of things could be

1403
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:38,269
going wrong in the trappings of this

1404
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:40,190
code that would make it so even if our

1405
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:42,860
raycast was rock-solid and we determined

1406
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:46,309
there's no actual bugs that are really

1407
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:48,530
manifesting themselves here that doesn't

1408
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:51,349
mean that we don't have some kind of a

1409
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:53,960
problem with how we're using the code

1410
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:56,719
that is itself you know causing this

1411
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,730
issue right similarly we also don't know

1412
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:00,139
about how we generate our raycast so for

1413
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,320
example if you take a look at this code

1414
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:05,119
right here where we do compute light

1415
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,280
propagation or the same code here in

1416
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,480
gather final lighting this is a thing

1417
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,490
that's supposed to distribute stuff

1418
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:15,619
across the hemisphere it's a pretty

1419
00:56:10,489 --> 00:56:21,799
janky one right now but basically this

1420
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:24,199
thing which is generating after I says

1421
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,640
this piece of code is is trying to

1422
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:26,779
generate uniform samples about a

1423
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:27,980
hemisphere but it's just doing a

1424
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,600
horrible job at it what it does it

1425
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:31,730
starts up and normal and just adds a

1426
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:36,710
random negative 1 to 1 value in each of

1427
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:39,740
the various directions right and the

1428
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:41,000
thing about that is I feel like in fact

1429
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:48,309
just thinking about this this could be

1430
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:48,309
completely bogus right because

1431
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:59,780
there we go because let's suppose that

1432
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:02,760
we have a normal right in fact let's do

1433
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:04,410
yeah let's do this case so let's suppose

1434
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,450
we have a normal now we know that this

1435
00:57:04,409 --> 00:57:09,659
is our normal and this is you know a

1436
00:57:06,449 --> 00:57:10,949
normal of length one because that's what

1437
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:13,799
a normal yes and all of our normals are

1438
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:17,460
normalized so what that means is this

1439
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:20,880
here this length here is one but for

1440
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:25,980
example right if we were to take this

1441
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:33,300
axis like this right these would not be

1442
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:37,349
1 right so these would be less than one

1443
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:39,180
right and this right here in theory

1444
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:41,700
can't be more than one though because if

1445
00:57:39,179 --> 00:57:43,259
this I'm sorry this right here has to be

1446
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:46,019
more than one because if this we know is

1447
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,210
one right then by just principles basic

1448
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:49,530
principles of right triangles we know

1449
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:51,300
that this has to be longer than one

1450
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:54,660
because the hypotenuse of a triangle of

1451
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:57,869
a right triangle well if any triangle

1452
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:59,670
the hypotenuse you know is the longest

1453
00:57:57,869 --> 00:58:01,858
side that's the definition of hypotenuse

1454
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:05,190
right in a right triangle we know that

1455
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:08,400
neither of the two sides that are part

1456
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:10,380
of the right part of the 90 degree that

1457
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,910
connect to it those sides have to be

1458
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:15,000
both shorter than the hypothenuse

1459
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:17,940
hypotenuse right so we know that that's

1460
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,690
always going to be greater the same

1461
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:25,858
would be true on the other side right so

1462
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:28,619
I think trying to try to guess but I

1463
00:58:25,858 --> 00:58:31,679
think that means that if we were to add

1464
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:34,588
negative 1 in this direction or negative

1465
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:39,259
1 in this direction right we would not

1466
00:58:34,588 --> 00:58:43,759
risk moving our normal in an arrant way

1467
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:46,410
however let's suppose we added both

1468
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:50,069
because there's nothing in here that

1469
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:52,399
disallows that right well that would

1470
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:54,358
mean is that we would be pointing

1471
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,550
potentially negative 1 in this direction

1472
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:57,929
let's say that got us here and negative

1473
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:00,359
1 in this direction let's say that got

1474
00:58:57,929 --> 00:59:04,848
us here we would be pointing back out

1475
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:08,748
the backside of the surface right

1476
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:10,729
and that's simply erroneous so what will

1477
00:59:08,748 --> 00:59:13,009
end up happening is if we you know if we

1478
00:59:10,728 --> 00:59:16,189
look at something like this what will

1479
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:17,630
end up happening is we're only supposed

1480
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:19,068
to be casting this direction out of a

1481
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:21,410
surface we might end up guessing this

1482
00:59:19,068 --> 00:59:24,228
direction since we're not considering

1483
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:25,278
back faces which are these will sail

1484
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:26,989
right through the other side of the

1485
00:59:25,278 --> 00:59:28,190
object and pick up light that's

1486
00:59:26,989 --> 00:59:32,210
transmitting through the other side the

1487
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:35,989
object and hey by the way right that's

1488
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:37,880
exactly what looks like it's happening

1489
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:41,150
in the thing that I was complaining

1490
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,470
about right that that is the exact kind

1491
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:44,088
of thing that could be happening right

1492
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:45,738
there I don't know that that's what's

1493
00:59:44,088 --> 00:59:48,588
happening but it would be consistent

1494
00:59:45,739 --> 00:59:50,478
with it so that's starting to raise my

1495
00:59:48,588 --> 00:59:53,449
spidey senses which I don't have because

1496
00:59:50,478 --> 00:59:56,088
I'm not a I'm not a spider-man of any

1497
00:59:53,449 --> 01:00:00,588
kind but it's starting to just make me a

1498
00:59:56,088 --> 01:00:01,849
little bit you know nervous so I feel

1499
01:00:00,588 --> 01:00:03,920
like maybe the first order of business

1500
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:06,019
in this debugging process because we

1501
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,170
know that this is crappy right when we

1502
01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:11,298
put it in here we knew it was crappy so

1503
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:13,039
maybe the first sorta business is let's

1504
01:00:11,298 --> 01:00:15,759
improve this and try to make one that's

1505
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:18,049
actually not gonna be super puggy right

1506
01:00:15,759 --> 01:00:19,309
and we don't have to improve it much we

1507
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:20,659
don't need a really great lighting

1508
01:00:19,309 --> 01:00:22,460
solution here we're not trying to

1509
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:23,868
capture perfect light or anything we

1510
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:26,659
just need something that's going to do a

1511
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:28,430
good hemisphere sample without totally

1512
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:32,210
screwing it up which it might be doing

1513
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:34,728
at the moment so I'm gonna make an

1514
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:38,679
internal here and this is going to be

1515
01:00:34,728 --> 01:00:40,699
called like you know sample Hemisphere

1516
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:47,358
and I'm just going to give it a normal

1517
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:48,949
and and one of those random series and

1518
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:50,449
then I'm gonna just copy this code right

1519
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:54,578
here and the first I'm going to do is

1520
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:54,578
again just make literally the exact

1521
01:00:54,608 --> 01:01:01,130
function we were already using in both

1522
01:00:56,809 --> 01:01:03,499
places like so and then what I'm going

1523
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:05,150
to do is I'm going to take these two

1524
01:01:03,498 --> 01:01:08,058
places we were calling it and just

1525
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:10,068
replace them with that call right so

1526
01:01:08,059 --> 01:01:14,509
just prepare ourselves to replace this

1527
01:01:10,068 --> 01:01:15,800
function at C roots that series give me

1528
01:01:14,509 --> 01:01:29,159
n

1529
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:31,440
like so and that serious deathbed so

1530
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:33,119
those should basically do exactly the

1531
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,860
same thing so if we call it now we

1532
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:38,609
should get the exact same lighting

1533
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:40,559
solution we were getting before because

1534
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:42,360
again remember although these are random

1535
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,179
numbers they're pseudo random numbers

1536
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:46,800
we're using the same random series every

1537
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:48,899
time so we should get basically the same

1538
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,010
results unless something weird happened

1539
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,269
and you can see we're still getting that

1540
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,920
weird light bleed although it looks

1541
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:55,769
slightly different this time I don't

1542
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,059
know it could be that the way these

1543
01:01:55,769 --> 01:01:59,219
function compiled compile them in a

1544
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:03,619
different order as well so there is a

1545
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:03,619
little bit of that right but either way

1546
01:02:03,739 --> 01:02:10,469
so if we want to improve this function

1547
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:13,289
we were taking in normal and we want to

1548
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:14,519
sample a hemisphere around it there's a

1549
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:17,759
lot of different things we could do I'm

1550
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:22,679
not sure what we want to do in terms of

1551
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:24,720
improvements here but yeah like the very

1552
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:26,549
first thing we could do is just reduce

1553
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:28,679
the numbers that we're adding to make

1554
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:32,690
sure that it can never add more than a

1555
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:36,359
normalized amount right so for example

1556
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:39,570
hmm a really simple way to prevent the

1557
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:41,579
backwards-facing problem would be to say

1558
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:47,039
something like alright we know we've got

1559
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:49,849
an equation of the form x squared plus y

1560
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:52,110
squared plus Z squared Square rooted

1561
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:54,329
this is the length of the thing we're

1562
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:56,460
adding and we know that since we've got

1563
01:02:54,329 --> 01:02:58,380
a unit vector in a particular direction

1564
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:59,730
if we want to make sure that it can

1565
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:02,220
never point in the opposite direction

1566
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:06,179
ever we could just make sure that the

1567
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:09,269
vector we add to it can never be more

1568
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:12,480
than the amount that would get you to

1569
01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:14,820
like right here right so it always has

1570
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:19,849
to be sort of this direction now that's

1571
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:19,850
not great because it does mean as well

1572
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,889
that we would never be able to really

1573
01:03:22,769 --> 01:03:29,130
get really glancing angles but that's

1574
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:31,409
probably okay because we don't really

1575
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:33,838
want angles in that direction very much

1576
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:35,699
right because we're mostly concerned

1577
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:37,139
about light that's coming in from here

1578
01:03:35,699 --> 01:03:38,699
because as it gets coming into here

1579
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:41,489
since this is a diffuse reflectance

1580
01:03:38,699 --> 01:03:43,528
model this is not specular we really

1581
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:45,479
don't want to count these contributions

1582
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:49,909
because the cosine fall-off term will

1583
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:52,289
knock them out to a largest and right

1584
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:54,440
for specular that's not true

1585
01:03:52,289 --> 01:03:58,589
specular there's a high bounce rate at

1586
01:03:54,440 --> 01:04:01,170
glancing angles that's a kind of another

1587
01:03:58,588 --> 01:04:03,389
lighting thing we can go down at some

1588
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:06,450
point but that's not for this sort of

1589
01:04:03,389 --> 01:04:08,210
radiosity ish kind of feeling bounces so

1590
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:10,409
we know that we're basically doing this

1591
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:11,849
and so if we want to make sure that this

1592
01:04:10,409 --> 01:04:14,278
thing can never put us back in the wrong

1593
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:17,068
direction well we could say is we want

1594
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:18,929
it to equal some value like you know 0.9

1595
01:04:17,068 --> 01:04:21,119
right so we're always we never quite get

1596
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:22,858
all the way back so we could say we want

1597
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,410
you know the length of the vector we

1598
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:27,088
generate to look like this now how would

1599
01:04:25,409 --> 01:04:28,558
we solve this because you know we got

1600
01:04:27,088 --> 01:04:30,869
three unknowns and one equations not

1601
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,190
going to go very far right the answer is

1602
01:04:30,869 --> 01:04:34,380
yes it is going to go very far because

1603
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:36,450
we know that each of these is generated

1604
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:38,430
uniformly right we're treating each of

1605
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:40,078
them the same so really what we're doing

1606
01:04:38,429 --> 01:04:41,278
here is we're just creating three values

1607
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,230
that each could be of a certain

1608
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:45,329
magnitude so if they're all the max

1609
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:48,059
magnitude let's call that M what we

1610
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:50,519
would have is M squared plus M squared

1611
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:54,119
plus M squared right otherwise known as

1612
01:04:50,518 --> 01:04:57,179
3m squared so 3m squared Square rooted

1613
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:59,809
has to be you know 0.9 that would tell

1614
01:04:57,179 --> 01:05:02,308
us what our M could be what the maximum

1615
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:05,819
range is for the thing that we're

1616
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:09,000
putting in positive or negative right so

1617
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:13,889
we can solve this right point-9 equals

1618
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:16,318
root 3 Times root M Squared now that

1619
01:05:13,889 --> 01:05:20,578
simplifies pretty nicely right 0.9

1620
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:23,210
equals root 3 times M and that just

1621
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:27,298
means that 0.9 over root 3 equals M

1622
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:28,559
right unless it's you know it's a you

1623
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,210
know kind of a slow start today on

1624
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:32,940
handmade hero so you know I don't know

1625
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:37,278
maybe I'm getting too rusty there but it

1626
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:40,289
seems like we could do 3 Square rooted

1627
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:42,119
oops how do I commit I don't know how to

1628
01:05:40,289 --> 01:05:42,720
use this program at all I want to divide

1629
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:45,059
point

1630
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:48,779
by that well you know what I could do I

1631
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:51,779
could divide this by 0.9 and then invert

1632
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:54,090
it can it do that of course you can't of

1633
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:57,050
course you can't do that it's Microsoft

1634
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:57,050
if they don't do math there apparently

1635
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:03,150
no matter how big I make this I never

1636
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:05,608
get any buttons I actually want there it

1637
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:09,420
is there it is right there

1638
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:09,840
so it looks like around 0.5 you know I'm

1639
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,639
saying

1640
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:15,539
so let's find if that's true so let's

1641
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:16,920
try 0.5 times 0.5 right and so that

1642
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:21,300
would what we'd have under and if we

1643
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:22,740
times that by 3 we get 0.75 right and if

1644
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,200
we do the square root of that we get

1645
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:26,639
roughly 0.9 so that's pretty close so

1646
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:29,489
that that seems like basically what we

1647
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:34,500
want so we know here if we were to just

1648
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:37,079
set these all of these to only be able

1649
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:40,050
to take a max range of 0.5 we know we

1650
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:43,199
would be safe now is this great no right

1651
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:48,780
this is definitely to do you know better

1652
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:52,169
hemisphere sampling is this going to

1653
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:54,660
stop the bad back casting situation if

1654
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:57,690
this was the cause of it yes

1655
01:06:54,659 --> 01:07:01,920
hopefully so now let's take a letting

1656
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:04,440
sample and see where we're at let's take

1657
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,230
a look at those back surfaces and it

1658
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:10,380
looks to me like there's still a little

1659
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:14,880
bit of badness in there maybe it's hard

1660
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:17,190
to say we didn't have much of glaring

1661
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,160
errors necessarily we've kind of got

1662
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:22,829
some in here that doesn't look good to

1663
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:24,480
me although I don't know how much of

1664
01:07:22,829 --> 01:07:27,088
that is an interpolation error it's a

1665
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,980
little hard to say one thing it would be

1666
01:07:27,088 --> 01:07:32,779
nice to do is have better visualization

1667
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,780
here of these values

1668
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:44,558
trying to think if there's any way we

1669
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:46,630
could really do that because see one of

1670
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,369
the problems that we have is this is not

1671
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:50,289
a good this right here is not really

1672
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:52,088
useful visualization and the reason it's

1673
01:07:50,289 --> 01:07:53,890
not unusual voters because this is also

1674
01:07:52,088 --> 01:07:56,199
getting passed through the lighting

1675
01:07:53,889 --> 01:07:58,420
right so we need to set the lighting

1676
01:07:56,199 --> 01:08:01,828
equal to all ones in order to really

1677
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:01,829
make that work right

1678
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,818
but anyway so let me move I'm gonna move

1679
01:08:05,018 --> 01:08:08,169
the here around a little bit or more

1680
01:08:06,818 --> 01:08:10,690
importantly the light source that's

1681
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:12,880
attached to the hero at the moment and I

1682
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:15,909
just want to see what I get

1683
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,460
in terms of backlighting there or

1684
01:08:15,909 --> 01:08:20,259
lighting that that punches through and

1685
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:22,868
the other thing I could do is let's try

1686
01:08:20,259 --> 01:08:26,829
to increase that lighting intensity as

1687
01:08:22,868 --> 01:08:35,289
well so if I go into the world mode and

1688
01:08:26,829 --> 01:08:39,939
we set that lighting there I we've got

1689
01:08:35,289 --> 01:08:41,319
that add piece light situation I don't

1690
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:42,759
think we're actually using that there

1691
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:44,650
yeah for the snake segments we're not

1692
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:49,689
actually using that I believe we're just

1693
01:08:44,649 --> 01:08:53,158
adding a light manually me double check

1694
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:57,009
that that's true yeah it's right here

1695
01:08:53,158 --> 01:09:02,019
so here's that that light call that's

1696
01:08:57,009 --> 01:09:05,889
going into the render group and you can

1697
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:07,839
see hoops and you can see here where

1698
01:09:05,889 --> 01:09:10,420
that emission value it's that that final

1699
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:12,009
one so it's this guy right here so we

1700
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:13,329
can if we want to just crank that

1701
01:09:12,009 --> 01:09:14,649
emission value up these are unitless

1702
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:17,079
right now if we don't have a particular

1703
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:20,079
idea of what that unit is it's just a

1704
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:22,509
light strength so you can see if I if I

1705
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:26,198
Jack it up quite a bit you know it's

1706
01:09:22,509 --> 01:09:28,779
gonna bounce more light around from from

1707
01:09:26,198 --> 01:09:30,759
this particular position and so that can

1708
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:32,889
help us find bugs because if I just keep

1709
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:34,238
increasing that light I can really blow

1710
01:09:32,889 --> 01:09:35,529
out the amount of light that's going

1711
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:37,928
through there and hopefully we'll see

1712
01:09:35,529 --> 01:09:40,270
any errors will stand out more

1713
01:09:37,929 --> 01:09:41,980
significantly that doesn't really look

1714
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:47,069
like it increased the lighting values

1715
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:47,068
all that much though that's just me

1716
01:09:49,729 --> 01:09:53,789
correct me if I'm wrong but that just

1717
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:58,560
doesn't look that bright compared to

1718
01:09:53,789 --> 01:10:03,719
what it was what if we've got another

1719
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:05,400
bug in there it seems like we're kind of

1720
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:07,890
clamping out at a maximum brightness

1721
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:10,769
there right because the brightness value

1722
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:16,440
obviously is doing something like if we

1723
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:19,770
compare this value here to this value

1724
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:22,679
here it got brighter but it didn't get

1725
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:24,810
much brighter right so that value is

1726
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,930
definitely clamping out and I assume

1727
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:30,600
that's because when we send down those

1728
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:33,989
light values those must be the brightest

1729
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:37,640
light values we can send that doesn't

1730
01:10:33,988 --> 01:10:40,639
make sense though that's definitely not

1731
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,640
right

1732
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:49,710
although now that I think about it if

1733
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:51,449
our light values are always capped and

1734
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:53,460
this is kind of a problem

1735
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:55,348
that we would have to work out right

1736
01:10:53,460 --> 01:11:00,779
like if we take a look at how we're

1737
01:10:55,349 --> 01:11:08,760
sending these down our lighting values

1738
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:11,009
that we're sampling we do have a problem

1739
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:14,070
here which is that this is where our

1740
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:23,579
light value is coming in right it's it's

1741
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:25,259
a it's just gonna be an 8-bit value so I

1742
01:11:23,578 --> 01:11:27,689
feel like maybe what we would want to do

1743
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:30,030
there is use that extra parameter to

1744
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:34,319
encode of greater brightness amount or

1745
01:11:30,029 --> 01:11:36,149
something like this right I you know

1746
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:39,000
maybe something that's a multiplier on

1747
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:47,219
the values of the light after the fact

1748
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:49,020
or something like this trying to think

1749
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:56,520
of how we would do that in some way that

1750
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:59,070
made sense so let's take a look at what

1751
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:01,619
these values are actually saying I

1752
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:10,078
assume that lighting Texel which is this

1753
01:12:01,618 --> 01:12:15,839
D value right here is probably gonna be

1754
01:12:10,078 --> 01:12:19,559
fully encoded so looking at this value

1755
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:21,810
we've got RGB and a we're currently not

1756
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:24,300
using a so it would kind of be like a

1757
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:25,829
HDR encoding problem where it's like hey

1758
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:30,510
can you is there anything really all

1759
01:12:25,828 --> 01:12:33,658
that useful you can do with that final

1760
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:35,760
value and maybe we can like maybe we can

1761
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:40,408
make that be like it's an RGB and an

1762
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:44,400
exponent kind of thing I write like

1763
01:12:40,408 --> 01:12:46,379
that's something we could do but that

1764
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:48,089
that almost certainly is the problem so

1765
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:50,069
just to just to make that a little more

1766
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:51,360
concrete if we take a look at what

1767
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:52,738
happens in render group here when you

1768
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:54,118
compute all the lighting those lighting

1769
01:12:52,738 --> 01:12:57,029
samples I mean there are actually

1770
01:12:54,118 --> 01:12:57,779
samples of lighting values right which

1771
01:12:57,029 --> 01:12:59,579
can be Arbor

1772
01:12:57,779 --> 01:13:02,099
fairly high like there's no cap on the

1773
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:03,659
number of photons you know that there's

1774
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,460
probably some physical limit on the

1775
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:07,170
number of photons but it's gonna be in

1776
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:10,590
the like billions and blame it's a Sun

1777
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:14,489
right like you know like that's how

1778
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:16,140
bright you could be that's how much so

1779
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:18,029
it's certainly not like a zero to 1

1780
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,710
clamped range like that it doesn't make

1781
01:13:18,029 --> 01:13:22,170
a lot of intuitive sense there and you

1782
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:23,579
can see why so when we come through here

1783
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,810
and we're like taking the incident light

1784
01:13:23,579 --> 01:13:27,180
you can see this clamps here at a1

1785
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:29,820
that's where we're losing all that light

1786
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:31,440
information right and so what we might

1787
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:36,960
want to do is just figure out a way we

1788
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:40,799
can get that value to be more reasonable

1789
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,960
in terms of encoding the the information

1790
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,789
we care about now I don't know exactly

1791
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,100
how to do that but let's just take a

1792
01:13:44,789 --> 01:13:48,569
random crack at it what if instead when

1793
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:51,450
we encoded this lighting value what we

1794
01:13:48,569 --> 01:13:56,960
said was something more like alright

1795
01:13:51,449 --> 01:14:02,340
let's take the incident light RGB and

1796
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:04,470
we'll see how big it is right so we'll

1797
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:10,190
say all right let's take the length of

1798
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:12,539
the element incident light RGB right and

1799
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:14,729
that will tell us how much light power

1800
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:17,460
there is behind this particular light

1801
01:14:14,729 --> 01:14:20,339
sample then what we'll do is we'll

1802
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:21,930
normalize to that right so we'll say if

1803
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,279
light power is greater than zero because

1804
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:26,159
remember there might be no light power

1805
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:28,739
here at all but if light power is

1806
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:33,210
greater than zero and you know we can

1807
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:35,699
also say incident light equals nothing

1808
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:37,470
if the light power is greater than zero

1809
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:40,050
then what we'll do is say okay in that

1810
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:41,490
case the incident light we won't do the

1811
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:45,840
clamps are Oh to one instead what we'll

1812
01:14:41,489 --> 01:14:50,519
do is we'll do a clamp zero to one on

1813
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:55,949
the light power like so and then we'll

1814
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:58,470
use the normalized version of the light

1815
01:14:55,949 --> 01:15:04,729
itself so basically say like the light

1816
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:10,340
color equals the incident light RGB

1817
01:15:04,729 --> 01:15:14,549
divided by the light power right

1818
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:22,730
like that so then we can just say light

1819
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:25,350
color our flight color G light color B

1820
01:15:22,729 --> 01:15:27,029
and then we just need to clamp only the

1821
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:28,650
light power because we know that the

1822
01:15:27,029 --> 01:15:30,960
only the light power could really be out

1823
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:33,179
of range right now we could if we wanted

1824
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,699
to be safe we could do these anyway just

1825
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:37,440
to make sure they don't get a little

1826
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:40,800
over one after the normalization if

1827
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:42,119
there is a little bit of error right but

1828
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:46,039
otherwise you know we wouldn't really

1829
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:48,329
even have to do this theoretically right

1830
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:50,039
so then all we have to do is say well

1831
01:15:48,329 --> 01:15:51,930
this light power so now we know it could

1832
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:53,369
be from zero to one is one way to

1833
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:55,110
interpret it but now we could say we

1834
01:15:53,369 --> 01:15:57,989
want lights up to a much higher power

1835
01:15:55,109 --> 01:16:00,239
potentially than that right so maybe we

1836
01:15:57,989 --> 01:16:03,569
want lights up to a power of like 10 or

1837
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:05,609
something like this I'm not sure and so

1838
01:16:03,569 --> 01:16:08,489
if we want lights that go up to two much

1839
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:11,250
higher powers than one what we could do

1840
01:16:08,489 --> 01:16:13,739
here is say all right let's say that our

1841
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:16,140
light power can range up to ten so when

1842
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:18,689
we before we do the clamp here what

1843
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:21,060
we'll say is we'll just nuke it by light

1844
01:16:18,689 --> 01:16:23,119
power right and we could even make this

1845
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:26,580
be a thing that you could actually

1846
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:30,029
specify specifically such as max light

1847
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:32,010
power and you know it's ten right and in

1848
01:16:30,029 --> 01:16:33,359
that case if we specified it there what

1849
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:35,699
we could do is say well the light power

1850
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:38,009
is going to be divided by the max light

1851
01:16:35,699 --> 01:16:41,250
power and that's how it's going to be

1852
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:44,070
encoded later on when we actually

1853
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:46,140
specify these values and interpret them

1854
01:16:44,069 --> 01:16:49,889
in the shader what we will now get is

1855
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:52,770
when we fetch the light color we now

1856
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:55,829
have four values and when we actually

1857
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:58,080
get that light C RGB what we need to do

1858
01:16:55,829 --> 01:17:01,979
here is multiply by the power first

1859
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:09,659
right so that light color is now going

1860
01:17:01,979 --> 01:17:12,239
to be light C RGB x light color age but

1861
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:14,099
back in the power x the max light power

1862
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:17,130
because that's what amps that alpha

1863
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:19,020
value up to its correct value right

1864
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:20,940
and so in here then we would say all

1865
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:23,249
right when we're actually you know

1866
01:17:20,939 --> 01:17:25,408
putting this information down

1867
01:17:23,248 --> 01:17:27,988
we need to be able to specify here you

1868
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:30,388
know some of these constants right so we

1869
01:17:27,988 --> 01:17:31,888
also want a uniform here actually we

1870
01:17:30,389 --> 01:17:35,309
don't eat a uniform this can just be it

1871
01:17:31,889 --> 01:17:37,710
because this is fixed at compile time we

1872
01:17:35,309 --> 01:17:39,869
can actually just have here you know

1873
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:41,698
MaxLite power equals some floating-point

1874
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:47,248
value whatever that floating-point value

1875
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:54,359
is and then we can just say that'll get

1876
01:17:47,248 --> 01:17:55,408
included right not sure why RGB isn't in

1877
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:57,929
there Oh

1878
01:17:55,408 --> 01:18:03,569
because incident light I guess it's just

1879
01:17:57,929 --> 01:18:05,279
an RGB already yeah all right so you

1880
01:18:03,569 --> 01:18:07,439
know that's one way to encode this stuff

1881
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,748
we got to recompile the shaders as well

1882
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:15,448
so let's do a full build there instead

1883
01:18:09,748 --> 01:18:17,059
of leaving that open and so now if we

1884
01:18:15,448 --> 01:18:20,788
did that correctly

1885
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:22,050
doesn't look like we did if we get this

1886
01:18:20,788 --> 01:18:27,478
working correctly we should be able to

1887
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:30,139
have more light power involved that just

1888
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:30,139
looks weird

1889
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:42,430
probably because it's using it as an

1890
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:42,430
actual alpha value at that point right

1891
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:47,988
yeah that's because this is the the

1892
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:51,289
light power is the alpha value in this

1893
01:18:47,988 --> 01:18:53,389
scenario right so it looks like we're

1894
01:18:51,289 --> 01:19:00,199
doing the colors wrong there let me see

1895
01:18:53,390 --> 01:19:02,480
what I messed up so if I take a look at

1896
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:05,659
what's going on here I've got the light

1897
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:08,329
colors RGB it's divided by the light

1898
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:11,149
power which should be the length of the

1899
01:19:08,329 --> 01:19:14,180
incident light incoming

1900
01:19:11,149 --> 01:19:19,309
oh that's very simple

1901
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:20,989
it's element incident light we were not

1902
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:23,020
using the actual we're using the thing

1903
01:19:20,988 --> 01:19:27,738
that we were going to accumulate into

1904
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:30,040
it's not gonna work very well so now we

1905
01:19:27,738 --> 01:19:32,449
can have much more powerful lights

1906
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:34,039
illuminating our scene and you can see

1907
01:19:32,449 --> 01:19:37,309
they're the result of that is sort of

1908
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:39,229
already instantly noticeable now I don't

1909
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:40,700
know whether we're doing that correctly

1910
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:42,979
here but hey four in a thousand light

1911
01:19:40,699 --> 01:19:47,179
that's probably true let's go ahead and

1912
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:51,979
recompile back to a light of one and

1913
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:53,570
there you can kind of see you know it

1914
01:19:51,979 --> 01:19:54,889
honestly it's already sort of looking

1915
01:19:53,569 --> 01:19:56,269
like it's a little bit better at

1916
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:58,160
recording how much light was hitting

1917
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:59,720
that surface although I don't know if

1918
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:01,970
that's accurate or not

1919
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:06,280
but now if we up the light power to two

1920
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:10,220
we should be able again to sort of get a

1921
01:20:06,279 --> 01:20:11,689
yeah a more more light falling on that

1922
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:14,210
surface and that does look like what

1923
01:20:11,689 --> 01:20:15,710
we're getting so that's good that allows

1924
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:18,170
us to encode it and you can see that's

1925
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:20,630
doing exactly what I wanted we can see

1926
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:21,829
our light leaking here much more clearly

1927
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:23,630
now than we used to

1928
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:29,000
so now I can just blow this light out

1929
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:30,440
really violent right not something we'd

1930
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,229
ever want to happen in the actual game

1931
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:34,789
but perfect for looking for our lighting

1932
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:38,029
errors and we've got a lot of them you

1933
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:39,710
can kind of see here right we've got a

1934
01:20:38,029 --> 01:20:41,059
lot of different kinds of things that

1935
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:44,270
seem to be happening so you can see

1936
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:46,670
light leakage here not sure why light is

1937
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:47,489
able to get here so effectively right

1938
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:49,859
and more

1939
01:20:47,488 --> 01:20:54,149
only red light so I'm not sure why this

1940
01:20:49,859 --> 01:20:58,679
is able to see this so well similarly

1941
01:20:54,149 --> 01:21:00,179
you know you can see on the undersides

1942
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,100
of surfaces we've got a lot of light

1943
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:06,900
leaking through there and what's really

1944
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:10,469
interesting about that you can sort of

1945
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:12,750
see like well that's kind of cool anyway

1946
01:21:10,469 --> 01:21:15,060
you can sort of see that you know this

1947
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:17,880
may be a case of just the sampling being

1948
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:20,400
bad like for these surfaces right here

1949
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,869
you know is it just that it's picking up

1950
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:24,779
the light samples that were coming from

1951
01:21:21,869 --> 01:21:27,180
here is that where that's coming from

1952
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:28,710
you know and I don't know so a lot of

1953
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:30,960
that stuff is just really kind of a

1954
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:33,210
little bit confusing some of it may

1955
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,800
actually be right like you know some of

1956
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:36,239
this light made us be bounce light

1957
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,360
coming from here which is legitimately

1958
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:41,549
coming from there right so it's pretty

1959
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:42,960
hard to say what's definitively a bug

1960
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:44,850
that's one of the problems with lighting

1961
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,579
is some of the effects are pretty subtle

1962
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:50,190
so you don't always know that something

1963
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:52,409
is actually wrong or right you have to

1964
01:21:50,189 --> 01:21:56,189
just kind of construct test cases and

1965
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:57,569
guess right but what I'm doing now is

1966
01:21:56,189 --> 01:22:00,299
we're first just doing this debugging

1967
01:21:57,569 --> 01:22:02,219
what I'd like to do here is I'd like to

1968
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:05,250
focus on some things that look very

1969
01:22:02,219 --> 01:22:08,219
wrong now this right here looks very

1970
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:09,659
wrong to me that right there the reason

1971
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:13,550
that looks very wrong to me is there

1972
01:22:09,659 --> 01:22:16,529
should be all kinds of zero samples here

1973
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:22,159
you know I'm saying and in fact if I

1974
01:22:16,529 --> 01:22:25,289
look at I guess I we got to set those

1975
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:27,180
let's change that light interpolations

1976
01:22:25,289 --> 01:22:30,738
interpretation so I can actually see

1977
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:30,739
better what's going on there

1978
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:48,240
okay so let's go ahead and oh you know

1979
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,240
what else I should do while we're at it

1980
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:58,689
when we are sampling that hemisphere

1981
01:22:53,880 --> 01:23:03,369
let's just add an assertion so we can

1982
01:22:58,689 --> 01:23:05,649
double check that the direction we

1983
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:07,899
picked times the normal we started with

1984
01:23:05,649 --> 01:23:13,239
is always greater than zero because we

1985
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:14,319
never wanted to go backwards right and

1986
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:16,949
so that's an important thing that we

1987
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:19,420
just want to make sure we never do right

1988
01:23:16,949 --> 01:23:20,859
and so if I run this now we should get

1989
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:24,190
an assertion there if we ever head back

1990
01:23:20,859 --> 01:23:25,569
in the wrong direction okay so what I

1991
01:23:24,189 --> 01:23:28,409
wanted to say before is like okay so

1992
01:23:25,569 --> 01:23:34,869
when we output the debug lighting I

1993
01:23:28,409 --> 01:23:39,460
that's this code right here and no it's

1994
01:23:34,869 --> 01:23:41,949
not it's a lie if this this code right

1995
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:44,829
here you can kind of see what we're

1996
01:23:41,949 --> 01:23:46,539
doing is we go through here and we look

1997
01:23:44,829 --> 01:23:47,949
at the lighting texels and we see what

1998
01:23:46,539 --> 01:23:49,869
we've got for colors and we just

1999
01:23:47,949 --> 01:23:53,949
accumulate all of the light that's in

2000
01:23:49,869 --> 01:23:57,909
there right one of the things we do is

2001
01:23:53,949 --> 01:24:00,099
we then divide by the count so we're

2002
01:23:57,909 --> 01:24:04,599
taking an average of the light in that

2003
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:06,789
area which is fine what I would like to

2004
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:09,400
do however in this case yes I'd like to

2005
01:24:06,789 --> 01:24:12,399
say uh you know what let's make sure

2006
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:15,519
that when we do this let's interpret

2007
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:20,589
that alpha value correctly so when we do

2008
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:23,380
the RGB unpack here right where we do

2009
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:27,310
the RGB unpack 4x8 let's just take that

2010
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:30,100
unpack and before we actually do

2011
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:35,080
anything to it let's actually make sure

2012
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:41,350
we're undoing the power part right so

2013
01:24:35,079 --> 01:24:44,500
let's take a v3 color here I guess

2014
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:48,700
actually we could do a v4 color

2015
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:51,250
it just defaults to one alpha something

2016
01:24:48,699 --> 01:24:54,909
like that let's do that unpack and then

2017
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:57,520
let's do the unpack RGB x equals the max

2018
01:24:54,909 --> 01:25:00,849
light power times unpack a right just

2019
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:07,210
take that power back and just put it

2020
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:09,789
back in there right so now we can see

2021
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:11,560
those values a little bit better why are

2022
01:25:09,789 --> 01:25:12,579
we still getting alpha there that's

2023
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:14,320
weird

2024
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:18,309
oh because we're dividing by the count

2025
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:23,619
so we need to do this part only in terms

2026
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:29,140
of the RGB oops I didn't mean to

2027
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:32,109
actually close it doesn't matter um so

2028
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:35,440
here we can see our samples again right

2029
01:25:32,109 --> 01:25:39,880
so what I'd like to do is let's just

2030
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:41,379
take a look at for example this area

2031
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,650
back here but it's getting very strongly

2032
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:46,690
lit for like no reason at all that would

2033
01:25:44,649 --> 01:25:48,549
make sense in the actual scene and let's

2034
01:25:46,689 --> 01:25:52,629
take a look at what those values are in

2035
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:55,510
there right and what you can kind of see

2036
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:59,960
is that it does look like the lighting

2037
01:25:55,510 --> 01:26:03,060
sample in that area is heavily red right

2038
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:03,060
[Music]

2039
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:09,819
but those are the front side faces these

2040
01:26:06,939 --> 01:26:13,839
are the back side faces right here and

2041
01:26:09,819 --> 01:26:15,549
there's no light in them so I guess it's

2042
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:19,079
just a question of interpolating between

2043
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:21,310
the two that's the issue I'm not sure

2044
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:23,109
one question I do have is what would

2045
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:27,510
happen if we were to increase our voxel

2046
01:26:23,109 --> 01:26:31,359
size our voxel resolution at this point

2047
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:32,530
we had dropped it down pretty far just

2048
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:34,420
because we were trying to get more

2049
01:26:32,529 --> 01:26:35,800
interpolation but I think we've sort of

2050
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:37,420
addressed some of the reasons that we

2051
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,650
had wanted that I wish you didn't know

2052
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:46,140
if our lighting solution gets more

2053
01:26:38,649 --> 01:26:49,809
useful if we drop it back down right and

2054
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:52,210
you know what you can see here is we got

2055
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:54,160
rid of some of the artifacts that I like

2056
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:56,199
those back interpolation effects look

2057
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:57,769
like that is what they potentially were

2058
01:26:56,199 --> 01:27:02,090
I don't know about those

2059
01:26:57,770 --> 01:27:05,630
so Sara Lee but we get some really weird

2060
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:11,930
other artifacts there right which is

2061
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:14,300
these here are still seeing through to

2062
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:15,770
the blue light now there are some

2063
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:18,260
reasons why that could be happening

2064
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:21,740
legitimately but I think those are gonna

2065
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:23,270
be more excuses than anything else if

2066
01:27:21,739 --> 01:27:27,590
for example the lighting sample was

2067
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:29,210
taken in here and up to there and that's

2068
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:30,619
what was getting counted then maybe but

2069
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:36,590
let's take a look at where it actually

2070
01:27:30,619 --> 01:27:41,269
is yeah you can kind of see that the

2071
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:44,329
sample is right there and so I don't

2072
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:47,450
really know what let's just do an

2073
01:27:44,329 --> 01:27:51,019
experiment to figure out to what extent

2074
01:27:47,449 --> 01:27:53,329
the placement versus what it has to go

2075
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:56,260
through is affecting that ray cast

2076
01:27:53,329 --> 01:28:00,409
because what we can do is we can take

2077
01:27:56,260 --> 01:28:04,850
and make this two-sided so if Ray's

2078
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:08,539
source and is on either side of this

2079
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:12,590
right now we will collide against back

2080
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:15,409
faces as well and so we could see what

2081
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:17,869
ends up happening if we make the raycast

2082
01:28:15,409 --> 01:28:19,819
work in a two-sided fashion we can see

2083
01:28:17,869 --> 01:28:22,760
whether we still have that light leakage

2084
01:28:19,819 --> 01:28:24,799
and it looks like we do right

2085
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:26,720
oddly enough it looks like we have

2086
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:30,079
different likely light leakage though

2087
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:32,360
when we do that because like there was a

2088
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:36,199
very distinct blue light here before and

2089
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:39,139
there isn't now so yeah it's just it's a

2090
01:28:36,199 --> 01:28:40,460
little strange and I'm not super

2091
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:41,990
comfortable with what I'm seeing it

2092
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:44,239
don't really have a handle on what's

2093
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:46,010
going on what I can tell you is we

2094
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:49,579
definitely have some bugs in there or

2095
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:53,300
rather you know sometimes the word bug

2096
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:57,519
can be ambiguous in this case sometimes

2097
01:28:53,300 --> 01:29:00,020
a bug means a piece of code that is not

2098
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:01,630
that has an error in it which makes it

2099
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:04,010
not work the way it's supposed to work

2100
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:05,300
that's one kind of thing that you might

2101
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:06,850
meet my bug another thing you might mean

2102
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:09,320
by a bug and the one I mean this case is

2103
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:11,390
anything that just produces results

2104
01:29:09,319 --> 01:29:12,949
that's not what you wanted right the

2105
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:15,170
it could be that all of the code you

2106
01:29:12,949 --> 01:29:16,489
know for all we know the raycast is

2107
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:18,500
working fine but just the way we're

2108
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:20,059
using it is not gonna produce the right

2109
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,439
result right like we could just be

2110
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:25,130
making mistakes and how we're applying

2111
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:26,809
things and so there's you know in this

2112
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:31,310
case we're looking for either kind of

2113
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:34,550
bug a direct bug in the system and then

2114
01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:36,860
also you know just a bug of the form oh

2115
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:38,300
yeah you can't the light's not gonna

2116
01:29:36,859 --> 01:29:40,759
work if you do it that way or whatever

2117
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:42,949
right like that which is a separate sort

2118
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,869
of class of bug that isn't the same as

2119
01:29:42,949 --> 01:29:46,849
oh I had a negative in the wrong place

2120
01:29:44,869 --> 01:29:51,800
so I was doing the calculation slightly

2121
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:53,060
incorrectly and you know whatever so

2122
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,710
anyway that's really interesting to me

2123
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:57,920
because I would have expected more

2124
01:29:54,710 --> 01:30:00,020
coherent results to that change so again

2125
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,880
we really have some weird stuff going on

2126
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:05,150
here and I'm not sure what so what I

2127
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:09,560
would like to do next is I'd like to

2128
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:10,729
maybe get a way where we can sort of I'd

2129
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,770
like to have a way where we could

2130
01:30:10,729 --> 01:30:15,500
visualize the lighting elements more

2131
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:17,570
directly again so maybe let's try to

2132
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:21,310
reconstruct a path where that's gonna

2133
01:30:17,569 --> 01:30:21,309
happen in a more straightforward fashion

2134
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:35,449
so what I want to do here is say like

2135
01:30:24,109 --> 01:30:37,279
okay when we do output when we do output

2136
01:30:35,449 --> 01:30:38,689
lighting textures and output lighting

2137
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:40,189
quads and that sort of stuff is there a

2138
01:30:38,689 --> 01:30:47,149
way we can get just a visualization

2139
01:30:40,189 --> 01:30:53,509
instead of the voxel if we do output

2140
01:30:47,149 --> 01:30:57,460
lighting quads here right can we get a

2141
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:57,460
more direct piece of information

2142
01:31:04,519 --> 01:31:13,670
right so here's more information about

2143
01:31:08,448 --> 01:31:16,759
our liquids and what I'd like to do here

2144
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:19,969
is we we have this sort of double

2145
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:22,699
counting problem that I mentioned before

2146
01:31:19,969 --> 01:31:25,158
and what the double counting problem is

2147
01:31:22,698 --> 01:31:26,988
is that these things are still going

2148
01:31:25,158 --> 01:31:32,888
through the actual lighting solution

2149
01:31:26,988 --> 01:31:36,169
right so what I want to do is I want to

2150
01:31:32,889 --> 01:31:37,510
construct a scenario whereby I can look

2151
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:40,670
at the lighting solution directly

2152
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:43,940
without having the lighting actually get

2153
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:47,118
applied right and in order to do that I

2154
01:31:43,939 --> 01:31:54,109
can do one of two things either I can go

2155
01:31:47,118 --> 01:31:57,408
ahead and create a I can either go ahead

2156
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:59,538
and create a situation where I know that

2157
01:31:57,408 --> 01:32:02,388
the lighting that I send down is always

2158
01:31:59,538 --> 01:32:04,518
neutral so there's only one light ever

2159
01:32:02,389 --> 01:32:07,819
being referenced by any voxel and it's

2160
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:11,300
always just a uniform one one one I can

2161
01:32:07,819 --> 01:32:12,799
do that or I can do a mode that actually

2162
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:15,380
just turns off the lighting entirely

2163
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:18,739
right so we can toggle lighting by like

2164
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:20,659
pushing a key or something like this I'm

2165
01:32:18,738 --> 01:32:23,569
leaning towards toggling lighting by

2166
01:32:20,658 --> 01:32:27,319
pushing a key that seems a little bit

2167
01:32:23,569 --> 01:32:32,049
better to me because if we were to do

2168
01:32:27,319 --> 01:32:35,238
that then we should be able to you know

2169
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:38,029
always flip it on and off no matter what

2170
01:32:35,238 --> 01:32:41,209
we're looking at so I kind of feel like

2171
01:32:38,029 --> 01:32:44,689
that's more what I would like to do so

2172
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:47,448
inside the OpenGL renderer we already

2173
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:48,828
have the concept of settings that was

2174
01:32:47,448 --> 01:32:52,939
the thing that's that's been in there

2175
01:32:48,828 --> 01:32:54,408
for a while and you can kind of see in

2176
01:32:52,939 --> 01:32:59,808
here we've got game render settings

2177
01:32:54,408 --> 01:33:01,460
right and so if we look at the game

2178
01:32:59,809 --> 01:33:04,130
render settings you've got like

2179
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:05,179
pixelization hint and our pixelation

2180
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:07,400
hint and all these are those sorts of

2181
01:33:05,179 --> 01:33:09,859
things multi sampling debug multi

2182
01:33:07,399 --> 01:33:11,839
sampling hint right we can have a thing

2183
01:33:09,859 --> 01:33:14,748
that's this lighting disabled or

2184
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:16,159
something like this right and so we can

2185
01:33:14,748 --> 01:33:17,478
have a thing that would toggle lighting

2186
01:33:16,158 --> 01:33:17,988
disabled and if the lighting was

2187
01:33:17,479 --> 01:33:20,630
disabled

2188
01:33:17,988 --> 01:33:22,159
we just wouldn't do it and so when it

2189
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:24,190
comes through here what we could do is

2190
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:27,529
say all right we know that the setting

2191
01:33:24,189 --> 01:33:29,179
is something that we want to read so we

2192
01:33:27,529 --> 01:33:31,460
can just come in here and say all right

2193
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:35,119
pound fine

2194
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:38,840
lighting disabled and put it you know

2195
01:33:35,119 --> 01:33:40,729
whatever the value is there and then in

2196
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:43,610
here in addition to max like power we

2197
01:33:40,729 --> 01:33:46,218
would do is say okay when we compile the

2198
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:55,809
Z bias program we also need to know that

2199
01:33:46,219 --> 01:33:57,949
lighting disabled value oops

2200
01:33:55,810 --> 01:34:02,330
because this is the only place that we

2201
01:33:57,949 --> 01:34:03,769
do it so it should be pretty

2202
01:34:02,329 --> 01:34:06,199
straightforward and so what we would do

2203
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:08,780
there is we just say like our rights in

2204
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:10,789
this code here we've got all of this

2205
01:34:08,779 --> 01:34:13,009
nonsense that's designed to help us

2206
01:34:10,789 --> 01:34:14,569
create some kind of lighting it's a

2207
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:16,010
giant monstrosity that does all these

2208
01:34:14,569 --> 01:34:21,469
sorts of things instead what we'll do is

2209
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:28,670
we'll say if lighting disabled else do

2210
01:34:21,469 --> 01:34:30,859
the lighting and then what we can say as

2211
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:32,989
well service select RGB already equaled

2212
01:34:30,859 --> 01:34:35,089
this value let's not bother multiplying

2213
01:34:32,988 --> 01:34:38,779
it by the lighting at all we'll just use

2214
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:40,640
the value that we already got right and

2215
01:34:38,779 --> 01:34:42,199
that's all we would need to do so now

2216
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,579
the compiler will tell us that we

2217
01:34:42,199 --> 01:34:47,750
haven't passed that when we go to

2218
01:34:43,579 --> 01:34:51,500
compile this program right hello can I

2219
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:52,760
jump to my error here we go so we in

2220
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,859
here all we need to do is just take

2221
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:57,730
those settings right and you can see

2222
01:34:54,859 --> 01:34:59,869
we've got current settings here right

2223
01:34:57,729 --> 01:35:08,799
all we need to do is just take those

2224
01:34:59,869 --> 01:35:11,359
settings and bring them on through okay

2225
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,650
so now in theory if we run this it

2226
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:15,019
should run with the lighting still

2227
01:35:12,649 --> 01:35:17,539
correctly because we have not set

2228
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:19,310
letting disable to anything so then what

2229
01:35:17,539 --> 01:35:22,310
we could do is in those settings there

2230
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:24,920
we can actually check the value that

2231
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:28,160
we're talking about here I don't

2232
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:31,460
remember where we actually typically set

2233
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:35,449
those or where we set them

2234
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:36,920
I have no idea I don't remember but I

2235
01:35:35,449 --> 01:35:39,050
think where we set them is probably in

2236
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:42,500
the top of hand-made where we had a

2237
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:44,060
debug switch for them yeah

2238
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:46,250
so we inside the renderer here what we

2239
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:48,380
can do is just put in lighting say bold

2240
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:51,649
and and now it should be something that

2241
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:56,569
can be set right so if I come through

2242
01:35:51,649 --> 01:35:58,789
here and want to toggle the lighting on

2243
01:35:56,569 --> 01:36:01,939
and off so you know here's it with the

2244
01:35:58,789 --> 01:36:03,560
lighting on in theory probably should

2245
01:36:01,939 --> 01:36:06,829
figure out a way to turn the lighting

2246
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:08,270
off on that pass as well if I want to

2247
01:36:06,829 --> 01:36:12,819
set letting disabled I should be able to

2248
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:12,820
set it to true or so well we're not

2249
01:36:27,539 --> 01:36:37,630
interesting so all the rest of the stuff

2250
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:44,260
seems to be correctly recalculating but

2251
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:46,329
not lighting disabled do we don't we

2252
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:48,489
just do mm compare I guess we don't do

2253
01:36:46,329 --> 01:37:05,500
we actually manually do the mem compare

2254
01:36:48,488 --> 01:37:13,299
and we have to compare them all so we've

2255
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:15,789
gotten our equal function I guess we

2256
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:18,810
literally have yeah I'm not sure why we

2257
01:37:15,789 --> 01:37:21,609
don't just compare the memory directly

2258
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:26,860
are there stuff in there that we don't

2259
01:37:21,609 --> 01:37:32,529
want to set equal to I mean we what are

2260
01:37:26,859 --> 01:37:35,170
we checking I guess is my question with

2261
01:37:32,529 --> 01:37:39,670
life tip to account debug multi sampling

2262
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:41,800
hint yeah I mean we pretty much just

2263
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:43,300
check everything so I don't understand

2264
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:47,469
why we were doing it that way

2265
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:50,429
let's do it the other way round I think

2266
01:37:47,469 --> 01:37:50,429
is smarter right

2267
01:37:56,550 --> 01:38:03,270
I think that's just better right and I

2268
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:10,050
don't know if we have one of these I

2269
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:14,190
don't think we do but this is just

2270
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:21,150
saying hey we've got a count and to void

2271
01:38:14,189 --> 01:38:38,729
stars right and I just want to check

2272
01:38:21,149 --> 01:38:43,549
them so Wow count - - if our a + + is

2273
01:38:38,729 --> 01:38:49,009
not equal to star b + + return false

2274
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:49,010
return true something like that right

2275
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:56,100
let me just do what we'll say is alright

2276
01:38:54,149 --> 01:38:57,539
however much member you want to compare

2277
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:59,550
give me two pointers so I'll just go to

2278
01:38:57,539 --> 01:39:01,079
loop through it if at any point two of

2279
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:02,880
the bytes are not equal return false

2280
01:39:01,079 --> 01:39:08,970
otherwise we'll return true done deal

2281
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:11,970
no one else cares finished right all

2282
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:13,350
right so now in theory I should be able

2283
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:16,110
to come through and say okay

2284
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:23,610
sable the lighting and it actually

2285
01:39:16,109 --> 01:39:27,769
disables the lighting right don't ask me

2286
01:39:23,609 --> 01:39:27,769
why it clears the lighting afterwards

2287
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:35,000
probably because the lighting is a

2288
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:37,170
permanent texture or something like that

2289
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,310
we should probably fix that though I'd

2290
01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:40,230
like to be able to toggle the lighting

2291
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:41,610
and still have it be there I guess that

2292
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:47,639
won't matter as much later remember not

2293
01:39:41,609 --> 01:39:52,380
doing single submission but yeah all

2294
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:55,110
right so yeah if I was to go in here

2295
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:59,880
with lighting disabled I can now see the

2296
01:39:55,109 --> 01:40:03,079
lighting directly right and I have to go

2297
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:05,940
in and figure out the lighting power

2298
01:40:03,079 --> 01:40:08,100
more accurately because right now we're

2299
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:09,750
not taking that into account so what I

2300
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:10,140
should probably do since we have this

2301
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:12,090
lighting

2302
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:14,100
our concept now should probably make a

2303
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:16,289
function that encodes how we're encoding

2304
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:17,640
it and how we're decoding it so that we

2305
01:40:16,289 --> 01:40:20,939
don't have to constantly write it all

2306
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:23,579
the time right so this function

2307
01:40:20,939 --> 01:40:29,899
basically here which is like decode

2308
01:40:23,579 --> 01:40:32,729
power I basically want to say like hey I

2309
01:40:29,899 --> 01:40:37,219
want unpacked to be equal to the decode

2310
01:40:32,729 --> 01:40:37,219
power of unpack and that function right

2311
01:40:43,069 --> 01:41:09,239
or encoded light is just this I guess we

2312
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:12,600
leave the alpha value the same or we set

2313
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:20,719
the alpha value to one I don't know what

2314
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:22,920
we do there probably something like that

2315
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:28,710
so that we can call this anywhere that

2316
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:30,720
we want and have it work right so that

2317
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:33,689
way whenever we're doing anything here

2318
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:36,000
that involves that decode it'll be done

2319
01:41:33,689 --> 01:41:40,199
uniformly so for example in here when we

2320
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:46,260
do front emit for example we could call

2321
01:41:40,199 --> 01:41:49,649
the we call the decode similarly the

2322
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:50,909
encode part we could also do as a value

2323
01:41:49,649 --> 01:41:52,229
but I don't think we encode more than

2324
01:41:50,909 --> 01:41:53,699
one place so we don't really need to do

2325
01:41:52,229 --> 01:41:56,219
quite do that yet but this we probably

2326
01:41:53,699 --> 01:41:57,439
do so when we do output letting quads we

2327
01:41:56,220 --> 01:42:01,250
come through here and we get these

2328
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:01,250
emission values for example

2329
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:18,210
I guess I guess now that I think about

2330
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:26,109
it when we do output lighting clods here

2331
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:27,579
we're really just kind of saying these

2332
01:42:26,109 --> 01:42:31,409
are the light valves because that light

2333
01:42:27,579 --> 01:42:34,239
value is so high it's just gonna clap

2334
01:42:31,409 --> 01:42:36,630
clamp up to our anyway so this is not

2335
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:38,559
really a light power situation I guess

2336
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:40,300
so I guess we really don't have to

2337
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,910
encode it here maybe it was a little bit

2338
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:44,050
premature and that pulling that out not

2339
01:42:42,909 --> 01:42:46,449
that it matters it's a fine thing to

2340
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:51,190
pull out anyway but yeah it looks like

2341
01:42:46,449 --> 01:42:52,779
that really isn't that necessary because

2342
01:42:51,189 --> 01:42:56,139
we won't be we actually won't be

2343
01:42:52,779 --> 01:42:59,340
decoding the power because we're just

2344
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:59,340
reading it right out of the emitters

2345
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:08,390
yeah

2346
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:09,560
all right well I take it back so let's

2347
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:10,789
go ahead and just take a look at the

2348
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:14,539
lighting here which is what we want to

2349
01:43:10,789 --> 01:43:16,760
do in the first place so if I do f1 this

2350
01:43:14,539 --> 01:43:20,689
is the lighting solution but it's being

2351
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:22,489
itself lit by its own output right so

2352
01:43:20,689 --> 01:43:26,269
I'm gonna hit disable here so now we can

2353
01:43:22,489 --> 01:43:28,579
look at it more directly so here is what

2354
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:33,680
we're seeing as the lighting solution

2355
01:43:28,579 --> 01:43:36,140
right and in theory anyway I believe

2356
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:40,930
what I could do here is if I it should

2357
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:45,650
respond properly to the settings of how

2358
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:47,450
intense the light is so if we went down

2359
01:43:45,649 --> 01:43:49,489
here and set this light down to a

2360
01:43:47,449 --> 01:43:50,720
reasonable level we should see a

2361
01:43:49,489 --> 01:43:53,119
reasonable lighting solution not a

2362
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:57,350
blown-out lighting solution when I do

2363
01:43:53,119 --> 01:44:00,170
this right and let's see if we do so I

2364
01:43:57,350 --> 01:44:06,079
don't know we that still seems really

2365
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:09,199
aggressive right you know it's it's less

2366
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:13,460
blown out but it seems just a bit hot to

2367
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:15,260
me so I'm not sure what exactly is going

2368
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:17,960
on there because you look at how much

2369
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:20,210
light is in the scene here there's just

2370
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:23,079
not a lot of it right I mean it's it's

2371
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:23,079
pretty tame

2372
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:34,550
you know I don't see a lot of a lot of

2373
01:44:31,369 --> 01:44:36,590
brightness there really and then when I

2374
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:38,029
go to disable the lighting and I look at

2375
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:39,529
what that lighting solution supposedly

2376
01:44:38,029 --> 01:44:45,229
was I just see a lot I mean there's some

2377
01:44:39,529 --> 01:44:46,550
crazy bright emitters there I don't even

2378
01:44:45,229 --> 01:44:49,429
know how they're getting that such

2379
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:50,690
bright values doesn't really make a lot

2380
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:53,600
of sense that they could have such

2381
01:44:50,689 --> 01:44:56,569
bright values so something seems weird

2382
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:58,850
about that maybe this is just related to

2383
01:44:56,569 --> 01:45:01,489
bugs we have to fix in our lighting but

2384
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:03,230
just seems odd so don't know what I'm

2385
01:45:01,489 --> 01:45:05,289
seeing there and I want to know what's

2386
01:45:03,229 --> 01:45:09,319
going on because it doesn't feel right

2387
01:45:05,289 --> 01:45:12,710
it feels like there's a bug in that part

2388
01:45:09,319 --> 01:45:16,069
specifically so I bet you to know what

2389
01:45:12,710 --> 01:45:17,930
it is the output lighting quads function

2390
01:45:16,069 --> 01:45:18,679
doesn't do much like it just loops

2391
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:24,590
through here

2392
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:26,480
takes the emission color values and it

2393
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:30,980
just outputs them directly right

2394
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:33,349
and those emit C values are the actual

2395
01:45:30,979 --> 01:45:37,939
lighting that that's before the final

2396
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:39,650
gather right so we could also output the

2397
01:45:37,939 --> 01:45:42,469
final gather color if we wanted to

2398
01:45:39,649 --> 01:45:46,699
and the final gather color would be if

2399
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:48,170
we used incident light instead what's

2400
01:45:46,699 --> 01:45:49,970
interesting about this is I wonder if

2401
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:56,510
our emission colors really are that

2402
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:59,810
broken and it'd be interesting to know

2403
01:45:56,510 --> 01:46:05,409
so one thing that we could do here is we

2404
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:05,410
could make the ability to set sort of a

2405
01:46:05,470 --> 01:46:16,820
dynamically set the config value here

2406
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:19,400
for the iteration count so this lighting

2407
01:46:16,819 --> 01:46:21,429
iteration count here right we could make

2408
01:46:19,399 --> 01:46:26,359
this be something we can set dynamically

2409
01:46:21,430 --> 01:46:28,700
so for example and that will show up

2410
01:46:26,359 --> 01:46:33,199
probably I don't know if we actually

2411
01:46:28,699 --> 01:46:35,349
expose that in the UI let me see if we

2412
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:35,349
do

2413
01:46:43,699 --> 01:46:49,439
should probably put these this in

2414
01:46:45,869 --> 01:46:50,849
lighting yeah we do so there's this

2415
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:52,679
iteration cameras actually here we don't

2416
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:55,130
have ways to modify you inch right now

2417
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:58,380
the debug system we should but we don't

2418
01:46:55,130 --> 01:47:01,800
and so what we'd want to do here is is

2419
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:03,630
actually set this guy equal to something

2420
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:08,789
dynamically so we can see like on each

2421
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:11,069
bounce how much there is right that

2422
01:47:08,789 --> 01:47:13,340
would be kind of useful to us so we

2423
01:47:11,069 --> 01:47:16,229
could kind of step through those bounces

2424
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:22,289
and see what happens on each iteration

2425
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:24,989
count right so I'm kind of interested in

2426
01:47:22,289 --> 01:47:37,260
looking at that so let's let's do that

2427
01:47:24,989 --> 01:47:39,059
real quick so if we take a look at the f

2428
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:41,340
key pressed situation here I'm just

2429
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:47,580
going to hack in a thing that's like you

2430
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:50,569
know totally random so I'll make it will

2431
01:47:47,579 --> 01:47:50,569
be like five and six

2432
01:48:05,109 --> 01:48:09,949
so that we can just update that by just

2433
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:10,729
pushing the F keys and set it to

2434
01:48:09,949 --> 01:48:12,289
whatever we want

2435
01:48:10,729 --> 01:48:14,769
right and then we can look at what

2436
01:48:12,289 --> 01:48:16,850
happens to the emitters as they go

2437
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:19,030
because this will let us see on each

2438
01:48:16,850 --> 01:48:24,350
iteration where our light actually went

2439
01:48:19,029 --> 01:48:25,789
which is handy right so what I should be

2440
01:48:24,350 --> 01:48:29,840
able to do here oops

2441
01:48:25,789 --> 01:48:33,800
do that is if I just go ahead and set

2442
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:37,610
the lighting off should probably set

2443
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:41,390
that to disabled by default at the

2444
01:48:37,609 --> 01:48:43,489
moment but anyway if we set that and

2445
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:46,730
then set this right so I should be able

2446
01:48:43,489 --> 01:48:48,199
to decrease that now right so if I have

2447
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:49,429
no lighting iterations we should

2448
01:48:48,199 --> 01:48:52,519
literally have no light in the scene

2449
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:55,010
right so when I do my f1 I should get

2450
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:56,510
nothing and that is what I get so you

2451
01:48:55,010 --> 01:48:59,140
can see that only the things that were

2452
01:48:56,510 --> 01:49:03,500
set as emitters in the first place are

2453
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:10,100
still emitters right so now if I

2454
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:13,069
increase my light step by one now you

2455
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:15,020
can see I have sent light around the

2456
01:49:13,069 --> 01:49:18,769
scene and you can see where I sent it

2457
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:20,840
right it got sent to these guys out here

2458
01:49:18,770 --> 01:49:22,990
it got sent to these guys out here it

2459
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:25,970
got sent to these guys here and so on

2460
01:49:22,989 --> 01:49:28,569
now what I don't necessarily know is

2461
01:49:25,970 --> 01:49:32,060
whether it should really be that bright

2462
01:49:28,569 --> 01:49:35,210
probably it should not because since

2463
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:38,480
this is a radiative transfer if probably

2464
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:40,670
sampling wise has to be taken into

2465
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:42,919
account the fact that we're going

2466
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:45,440
outwards from the light source and not

2467
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:47,810
backwards from the surface so these

2468
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:50,569
services really aren't as bright as they

2469
01:49:47,810 --> 01:49:52,190
appear that's probably just something we

2470
01:49:50,569 --> 01:49:55,340
need to go improve in the way that we're

2471
01:49:52,189 --> 01:50:01,339
thinking about light so from there if I

2472
01:49:55,340 --> 01:50:03,230
then do one more step right you can see

2473
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:05,270
that now the lighting has spread you can

2474
01:50:03,229 --> 01:50:07,039
see where the red light is spread too

2475
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:09,290
and we have some really nonsensical

2476
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:09,769
results and this is this is revealing

2477
01:50:09,289 --> 01:50:11,539
some nice

2478
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:14,120
thugs so this is great we're getting a

2479
01:50:11,539 --> 01:50:15,979
lot of information here it should not

2480
01:50:14,119 --> 01:50:18,409
have been possible for something that

2481
01:50:15,979 --> 01:50:20,809
was already emitting light like that to

2482
01:50:18,409 --> 01:50:22,510
change to emitting less this was an

2483
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:26,510
emitter that had a certain amount of

2484
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:29,360
straight emission and loops and what

2485
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:32,409
we're seeing there is it's actually been

2486
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:39,529
overwritten with a new light color

2487
01:50:32,409 --> 01:50:40,729
because this bounce affected it so I

2488
01:50:39,529 --> 01:50:42,710
think we just want to like kind of

2489
01:50:40,729 --> 01:50:44,149
retune the way we're doing this in the

2490
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:45,380
first place these are some really this

2491
01:50:44,149 --> 01:50:48,049
is a really good thing to do I should've

2492
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:49,760
done this a long time ago and so we can

2493
01:50:48,050 --> 01:50:58,460
kind of see how that light is continuing

2494
01:50:49,760 --> 01:51:05,659
to propagate out right so I guess what

2495
01:50:58,460 --> 01:51:08,930
I'd say is maybe I want to see we need

2496
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:11,840
to kind of think this through because

2497
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:14,150
we're getting closer to 2 goodness here

2498
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:17,510
and so I kind of want to think this

2499
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:19,579
through a little bit more carefully but

2500
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:21,829
I think we've yep we should probably go

2501
01:51:19,579 --> 01:51:24,979
to the Q&amp;A we've we've done the time for

2502
01:51:21,829 --> 01:51:26,390
today obviously but I think we've

2503
01:51:24,979 --> 01:51:28,429
revealed some really good stuff to work

2504
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:29,900
on now so tomorrow I think we've clearly

2505
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:31,940
got a bunch of stuff we can do that will

2506
01:51:29,899 --> 01:51:33,859
make an immediate difference one let's

2507
01:51:31,939 --> 01:51:36,409
get this radiation steppin working

2508
01:51:33,859 --> 01:51:38,089
properly and I think we just need to

2509
01:51:36,409 --> 01:51:39,470
like get serious about our sampling and

2510
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:44,900
how we're recording that light and

2511
01:51:39,470 --> 01:51:47,420
tracking it and and then step two will

2512
01:51:44,899 --> 01:51:49,460
be once we have that radiative transfer

2513
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:50,659
working more correctly then we can start

2514
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:52,100
to figure out why we're getting these

2515
01:51:50,659 --> 01:51:53,149
sort of cross interpolation bugs is it

2516
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:54,920
just because we're putting too many

2517
01:51:53,149 --> 01:51:56,329
letting samples next to each other how

2518
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:57,649
are we gonna spread those out properly

2519
01:51:56,329 --> 01:51:58,970
like blah blah blah blah blah right so

2520
01:51:57,649 --> 01:52:00,799
we can really start to hone in on I

2521
01:51:58,970 --> 01:52:06,140
think this is good I'm gonna go ahead

2522
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:07,970
and go to the Q&amp;A now and I will take

2523
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:09,619
questions about the patreon situation as

2524
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:11,420
well because we did talk about that on

2525
01:52:09,619 --> 01:52:12,769
the actual stream today so even though

2526
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:14,829
normally we only take programming

2527
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:16,970
questions I'll take either question

2528
01:52:14,829 --> 01:52:18,439
because like I said on this stream we

2529
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:21,260
did actually talk about that

2530
01:52:18,439 --> 01:52:22,759
specifically so any programming

2531
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:23,420
questions you folks have or questions

2532
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:26,210
about the paper

2533
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:29,170
around situation I'm happy to field at

2534
01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:29,170
this point

2535
01:52:36,699 --> 01:52:38,760
ah

2536
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:44,650
flying Solomon says if you updated your

2537
01:52:42,699 --> 01:52:46,329
fur coat to let latest version you can

2538
01:52:44,649 --> 01:52:48,159
now and it strings yes I noticed that

2539
01:52:46,329 --> 01:52:50,140
I'm pretty excited about that

2540
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:52,239
I have not updated yet I tend to be a

2541
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:55,930
little bit slow on for coder updates

2542
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:59,380
just because I program everyday in for

2543
01:52:55,930 --> 01:53:02,110
coder all day and so I typically set

2544
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:03,520
aside a little time for every upgrade or

2545
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:05,439
do it over the weekend so I don't

2546
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,270
interrupt my programming with that

2547
01:53:05,439 --> 01:53:08,829
upgrade process cuz you know something

2548
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:10,920
might have changed in the config that I

2549
01:53:08,829 --> 01:53:13,510
have to go track down or whatever right

2550
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:15,159
so I tend to always do those updates in

2551
01:53:13,510 --> 01:53:17,050
a very staged fashion I am looking

2552
01:53:15,159 --> 01:53:19,529
forward to it though for that reason

2553
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:19,529
among others

2554
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:28,000
could the raycasting be bouncing off the

2555
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:30,130
bounds of the scene no we don't do any

2556
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,319
bouncing off bounds right now what we

2557
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:33,760
did do is we have an ambient light that

2558
01:53:32,319 --> 01:53:35,229
we could turn on which we did there but

2559
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:36,460
we've we've turned that off for now so

2560
01:53:35,229 --> 01:53:43,149
that's the only thing that comes in from

2561
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:46,800
the bounds of the scene speed crunch for

2562
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:46,799
a great replacement of wind calc

2563
01:54:28,819 --> 01:54:36,349
yeah I like it

2564
01:54:44,679 --> 01:54:51,609
deep blue v.7 said could libera PACOM

2565
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:53,800
about b replacement for patreon its

2566
01:54:51,609 --> 01:54:58,238
non-profit and paid for by donations to

2567
01:54:53,800 --> 01:55:05,380
its own liber libera pay account I'm not

2568
01:54:58,238 --> 01:55:07,238
sure yet so my first attempt and I'm

2569
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:10,119
trying to talk to send all about this

2570
01:55:07,238 --> 01:55:13,539
but the people who do the payment

2571
01:55:10,119 --> 01:55:15,939
processing and download for the handmade

2572
01:55:13,539 --> 01:55:17,859
hero source code have been really great

2573
01:55:15,939 --> 01:55:19,389
to work with they have never done

2574
01:55:17,859 --> 01:55:21,250
anything like this and have always

2575
01:55:19,390 --> 01:55:23,289
provided a really good service that has

2576
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:24,908
been very reliable and that I have

2577
01:55:23,289 --> 01:55:29,619
really not gotten any complaints about

2578
01:55:24,908 --> 01:55:31,210
the only time it ever fails is when

2579
01:55:29,619 --> 01:55:32,920
people miss enter their email address

2580
01:55:31,210 --> 01:55:34,270
when they buy the product that's about

2581
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:38,140
the only problem I've ever had with it

2582
01:55:34,270 --> 01:55:39,640
and it's that's really not ten dolls

2583
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:41,619
fault if people can't put in their

2584
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:43,449
actual email address correctly that's

2585
01:55:41,619 --> 01:55:44,649
not much you can do right but that's the

2586
01:55:43,448 --> 01:55:45,969
only failure case I've really

2587
01:55:44,649 --> 01:55:48,639
experienced with them honestly it's been

2588
01:55:45,969 --> 01:55:51,520
very good so my first thing that I'm

2589
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:52,960
gonna probably attempt this weekend is

2590
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:54,730
to try and work out something where you

2591
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:57,730
can just use send owl directly on

2592
01:55:54,729 --> 01:56:01,000
handmade here org to pledge a monthly or

2593
01:55:57,729 --> 01:56:03,809
yearly donation and then that will just

2594
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:06,310
get automatically deducted and sent to

2595
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:10,179
the projects that I listed in that

2596
01:56:06,310 --> 01:56:13,780
patreon email handmade Network the

2597
01:56:10,179 --> 01:56:18,489
annotations guide Milton for coder the

2598
01:56:13,779 --> 01:56:20,948
bugger projects right and that's the

2599
01:56:18,488 --> 01:56:24,039
first thing I'm gonna try and the reason

2600
01:56:20,948 --> 01:56:26,229
for that is because it's been around for

2601
01:56:24,039 --> 01:56:28,029
several years we've used it reliably we

2602
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:31,599
have no have had no problems they have

2603
01:56:28,029 --> 01:56:32,889
not pissed anybody off yet and it's a

2604
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:36,010
service we already have to maintain

2605
01:56:32,890 --> 01:56:37,060
anyway for the source code I kind of

2606
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:39,100
been leaning towards that because I'd

2607
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:41,620
rather do that then go with yet another

2608
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:44,170
service that might just implode or go

2609
01:56:41,619 --> 01:56:46,000
out of business or anything else so I

2610
01:56:44,170 --> 01:56:48,579
just feel like putting our eggs in one

2611
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,679
basket might be good because hey if send

2612
01:56:48,579 --> 01:56:53,350
owl went down or something bad happened

2613
01:56:50,679 --> 01:56:56,230
to it we would have to move the source

2614
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:57,970
code purchase away from it anyway and so

2615
01:56:56,229 --> 01:56:59,799
I'd rather just

2616
01:56:57,970 --> 01:57:01,810
not have two points of failure there

2617
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:03,760
like every additional one we use is

2618
01:57:01,810 --> 01:57:05,320
another thing I might have to deal with

2619
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,730
when that thing goes out of business

2620
01:57:05,319 --> 01:57:08,199
whereas if everything just at one place

2621
01:57:06,729 --> 01:57:10,239
we wouldn't have to just move everything

2622
01:57:08,199 --> 01:57:12,010
at that point which you know is really

2623
01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:15,579
no more costly than moving one thing

2624
01:57:12,010 --> 01:57:17,500
usually whereas having it spread out it

2625
01:57:15,579 --> 01:57:19,359
already did exactly thing that that I

2626
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:22,029
wouldn't want to do having a patreon an

2627
01:57:19,359 --> 01:57:24,159
to send out meant that now one of them

2628
01:57:22,029 --> 01:57:25,569
goes down it makes work for me if we had

2629
01:57:24,159 --> 01:57:26,889
had a way to do it all through send out

2630
01:57:25,569 --> 01:57:32,819
in the first place we would have never

2631
01:57:26,890 --> 01:57:32,820
had that so

2632
01:57:39,239 --> 01:57:42,250
just hopped into the stream are you

2633
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:47,590
working on a global illumination

2634
01:57:42,250 --> 01:57:50,020
approach specific for 2.5 D uh sort of

2635
01:57:47,590 --> 01:57:52,150
and sort of not the global illumination

2636
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:54,570
approach that we're using is fairly

2637
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:57,939
generic and would work in any scene

2638
01:57:54,569 --> 01:58:00,699
however it is specifically tuned to the

2639
01:57:57,939 --> 01:58:03,489
fact that there's just not a lot of

2640
01:58:00,699 --> 01:58:07,170
polygons in the scene right that things

2641
01:58:03,489 --> 01:58:14,710
are giant flat cubes or flat plates and

2642
01:58:07,170 --> 01:58:16,869
so if this were a real game well it's a

2643
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:20,590
real game if this were a real 3d game as

2644
01:58:16,869 --> 01:58:24,579
what I meant to say if this were a real

2645
01:58:20,590 --> 01:58:26,650
3d game that would not be true there

2646
01:58:24,579 --> 01:58:29,019
would be many many more millions of

2647
01:58:26,649 --> 01:58:30,609
polygons in it and you would not

2648
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:32,500
necessarily be able to use this same

2649
01:58:30,609 --> 01:58:35,639
kind of solution now they do use

2650
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:43,359
solutions like this anyway for example

2651
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:45,869
and and light darn I'm not gonna

2652
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:45,869
remember the name

2653
01:58:59,319 --> 01:59:12,219
I don't think this is the one boy where

2654
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:17,320
is it it's called like oh it is

2655
01:59:12,219 --> 01:59:19,750
enlightened so why didn't that find it I

2656
01:59:17,319 --> 01:59:26,078
guess it was just too many so enlighten

2657
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:28,569
is a is almost like a middleware I think

2658
01:59:26,078 --> 01:59:29,948
it's used in dice it's it's used in the

2659
01:59:28,569 --> 01:59:32,408
Frostbite engine and in the Unreal

2660
01:59:29,948 --> 01:59:37,000
Engine and I don't know if there's any

2661
01:59:32,408 --> 01:59:38,348
like demos of how it works but and I

2662
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,929
don't really know what there I have no

2663
01:59:38,349 --> 01:59:43,630
idea there algorithm is but it is a

2664
01:59:40,929 --> 01:59:45,730
bounce light around kind of a thing

2665
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:47,679
right I don't know exactly what they're

2666
01:59:45,729 --> 01:59:49,539
doing but it is sort of similar and I

2667
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:52,960
think it works on like point clouds kind

2668
01:59:49,539 --> 01:59:57,368
of so there are things that are sort of

2669
01:59:52,960 --> 02:00:00,250
like this and that do work with to

2670
01:59:57,368 --> 02:00:03,908
varying degrees of accuracy with full 3d

2671
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:05,770
games with lots of polygons but that's

2672
02:00:03,908 --> 02:00:07,479
like a whole other sort of set of things

2673
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:11,050
you have to worry about for us because

2674
02:00:07,479 --> 02:00:12,729
we have such low scene detail in terms

2675
02:00:11,050 --> 02:00:14,829
of geometry because most of the

2676
02:00:12,729 --> 02:00:16,928
geometries in bitmaps right

2677
02:00:14,828 --> 02:00:21,359
most of the geometry is what the artists

2678
02:00:16,929 --> 02:00:24,250
drew we don't have that problem of

2679
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:26,109
trying to capture radiosity on million

2680
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:28,800
polygons scenes 10 million polygons

2681
02:00:26,109 --> 02:00:32,109
scenes 100 million polygons scenes so

2682
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:35,849
while we are not doing anything specific

2683
02:00:32,109 --> 02:00:37,779
for 2.5 D we are doing a more

2684
02:00:35,849 --> 02:00:40,300
brute-force approach to global

2685
02:00:37,779 --> 02:00:45,009
illumination than would ever be feasible

2686
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:49,690
if you were doing a non 2.5 D game so

2687
02:00:45,010 --> 02:00:52,770
that part is more 2.5 D hopefully that

2688
02:00:49,689 --> 02:00:52,769
makes sense

2689
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:58,480
quick shift said I'm out of the loop

2690
02:00:55,779 --> 02:01:01,328
what's up with patreon patreon basically

2691
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:03,839
well they've done to think too big sort

2692
02:01:01,328 --> 02:01:07,479
of things now that made people unhappy

2693
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:09,849
one was they sort of started banning

2694
02:01:07,479 --> 02:01:12,189
people from the platform on ideological

2695
02:01:09,849 --> 02:01:13,300
grounds to a certain extent and there

2696
02:01:12,189 --> 02:01:15,098
was argument

2697
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:17,980
definitely on whether it was ideological

2698
02:01:15,099 --> 02:01:20,980
or not but people definitely interpreted

2699
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:22,509
it poorly and they didn't like the idea

2700
02:01:20,979 --> 02:01:26,919
of patreon banning people from a

2701
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:29,679
platform based on non illegal activity

2702
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:31,630
or something I mean I don't know what I

2703
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:32,949
can't summarize why people are upset

2704
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:34,449
because people are upset because they

2705
02:01:32,948 --> 02:01:37,569
were upset anyway they had a bad

2706
02:01:34,448 --> 02:01:38,979
situation with that and it ruffled some

2707
02:01:37,569 --> 02:01:40,299
feathers because people want to think of

2708
02:01:38,979 --> 02:01:42,968
patreon as a way of supporting people

2709
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:44,889
they agree with not as a way of

2710
02:01:42,969 --> 02:01:46,300
supporting people that patreon agrees

2711
02:01:44,889 --> 02:01:48,760
with right and you can understand why

2712
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:51,130
that ruffles some feathers that was okay

2713
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:53,619
to a certain extent they definitely lost

2714
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:57,250
some subscribers there but it wasn't

2715
02:01:53,618 --> 02:01:59,109
catastrophic literally two months later

2716
02:01:57,250 --> 02:02:00,698
a month later it has not been long since

2717
02:01:59,109 --> 02:02:03,819
that incident kind of flared up a little

2718
02:02:00,698 --> 02:02:05,078
bit and made some people upset then they

2719
02:02:03,819 --> 02:02:06,729
did something which upset almost

2720
02:02:05,078 --> 02:02:10,078
everybody like this was not even

2721
02:02:06,729 --> 02:02:12,368
ideological and wasn't really even

2722
02:02:10,078 --> 02:02:13,929
something that that formed really

2723
02:02:12,368 --> 02:02:16,960
pockets of people who agreed or disagree

2724
02:02:13,929 --> 02:02:18,639
with patron basically just a week or two

2725
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,689
ago they sent out an email saying that

2726
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:21,819
they're completely changing the way

2727
02:02:19,689 --> 02:02:23,828
pledges are counted and they tried to

2728
02:02:21,819 --> 02:02:25,599
make it sound like a positive change but

2729
02:02:23,828 --> 02:02:27,670
actually it's a very negative change for

2730
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:29,770
a lot of people use the system it's

2731
02:02:27,670 --> 02:02:31,719
going to mean that before when they were

2732
02:02:29,770 --> 02:02:33,040
pledging a dollar to something and

2733
02:02:31,719 --> 02:02:35,020
paying a dollar for the pledge they're

2734
02:02:33,039 --> 02:02:36,460
now gonna have to pay a dollar 38 cents

2735
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:38,320
for the pledge and things like this it's

2736
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:40,210
like and the amount that the paid that

2737
02:02:38,319 --> 02:02:41,979
the patrons receive is not necessarily

2738
02:02:40,210 --> 02:02:43,868
going up depending on the circumstances

2739
02:02:41,979 --> 02:02:46,959
and blah blah blah so it's like it's

2740
02:02:43,868 --> 02:02:49,058
basically a much worse way of doing

2741
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:50,500
pledges because previously what would

2742
02:02:49,059 --> 02:02:51,909
happen is all of your pledges would be

2743
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:54,880
aggregated together and you just have a

2744
02:02:51,908 --> 02:02:57,399
credit card bill let's say you pledged

2745
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:59,319
to 50 people and you only pledged $1 to

2746
02:02:57,399 --> 02:03:01,808
each of them so you're only pledging $1

2747
02:02:59,319 --> 02:03:03,250
to say the handmade hero patreon but you

2748
02:03:01,809 --> 02:03:06,099
pledge to a lot of people so it ends up

2749
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:08,408
being $50 a month that $50 charge might

2750
02:03:06,099 --> 02:03:10,270
encourage some credit card fees but it

2751
02:03:08,408 --> 02:03:12,219
would be print credit card fees related

2752
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:14,770
to that charts would be 2 percent or 3

2753
02:03:12,219 --> 02:03:16,239
percent of the 50/50 lower charge plus

2754
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:18,099
whatever the 25 cents are saying you

2755
02:03:16,238 --> 02:03:20,289
know whatever a credit card fee is you'd

2756
02:03:18,099 --> 02:03:22,569
end up paying 54 55 dollars or something

2757
02:03:20,289 --> 02:03:23,729
for a $50 worth of pledges this made

2758
02:03:22,569 --> 02:03:26,019
sense to people

2759
02:03:23,729 --> 02:03:26,948
now what patreon is doing is they're

2760
02:03:26,020 --> 02:03:28,510
disaggregating all

2761
02:03:26,948 --> 02:03:30,518
pledges in each pledge is an individual

2762
02:03:28,510 --> 02:03:32,679
charge in a weird way so what ends up

2763
02:03:30,519 --> 02:03:36,070
happening is if you do $51 pledges each

2764
02:03:32,679 --> 02:03:39,248
of those pledges incurs 25 cent or a 35

2765
02:03:36,069 --> 02:03:40,719
cent fee plus 2% on top of that or plus

2766
02:03:39,248 --> 02:03:42,578
3% I don't remember what it is but

2767
02:03:40,719 --> 02:03:44,380
basically long and short of it is if you

2768
02:03:42,578 --> 02:03:48,069
do 50 one-dollar pledges you pay 50

2769
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:49,389
times $1 and 38 cents roughly so you

2770
02:03:48,069 --> 02:03:51,488
know that ends up being something like

2771
02:03:49,389 --> 02:03:53,409
70 bucks or whatever right a big

2772
02:03:51,488 --> 02:03:55,058
difference and the creators aren't

2773
02:03:53,408 --> 02:03:56,679
taking home much more money in fact

2774
02:03:55,059 --> 02:03:58,748
they're in oftentimes taking home less

2775
02:03:56,679 --> 02:04:00,940
money potentially or equivalent money

2776
02:03:58,748 --> 02:04:03,158
but you're paying way more so the

2777
02:04:00,939 --> 02:04:04,808
percentage that the pay that the action

2778
02:04:03,158 --> 02:04:07,629
portion your plenty to actually receives

2779
02:04:04,809 --> 02:04:11,229
from these smaller dog donations plummet

2780
02:04:07,630 --> 02:04:13,029
plummets dramatically and they published

2781
02:04:11,229 --> 02:04:14,708
and extremely this was the thing that I

2782
02:04:13,029 --> 02:04:16,179
feel like I said a lot of things you

2783
02:04:14,708 --> 02:04:18,969
know the internet everyone's always

2784
02:04:16,179 --> 02:04:20,440
outraged about everything so before they

2785
02:04:18,969 --> 02:04:21,670
were sort of having more of that problem

2786
02:04:20,439 --> 02:04:23,078
where like people are upset because

2787
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:25,899
people are always upset and no matter

2788
02:04:23,078 --> 02:04:27,819
what you do they're upset and that's one

2789
02:04:25,899 --> 02:04:29,738
thing this was a lot different because

2790
02:04:27,819 --> 02:04:31,929
this one started to get into really bad

2791
02:04:29,738 --> 02:04:33,248
territory of just seeming like you were

2792
02:04:31,929 --> 02:04:35,498
kind of trying to pull a fast one on

2793
02:04:33,248 --> 02:04:37,420
people and nobody likes that even people

2794
02:04:35,498 --> 02:04:39,819
who don't get internet outraged about

2795
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:41,288
things and I'll kind of show you a

2796
02:04:39,819 --> 02:04:44,049
little bit of what I mean by that and

2797
02:04:41,288 --> 02:04:46,029
this this even to me trying to be fair

2798
02:04:44,050 --> 02:04:50,019
to them was really hard to see how this

2799
02:04:46,029 --> 02:04:51,819
happens in a realistic scenario so

2800
02:04:50,019 --> 02:04:54,630
here's the thing that they published you

2801
02:04:51,819 --> 02:04:57,759
know and this is this is like them

2802
02:04:54,630 --> 02:05:00,429
trying to convince you this was a good

2803
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:01,840
idea right and they printed a graph and

2804
02:05:00,429 --> 02:05:03,340
it looks like this and what you can see

2805
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:06,369
here is this is what they're saying here

2806
02:05:03,340 --> 02:05:08,229
was before the patreon pledge before

2807
02:05:06,368 --> 02:05:10,238
their change they're saying all right

2808
02:05:08,229 --> 02:05:11,829
creator stick tome eighty five to ninety

2809
02:05:10,238 --> 02:05:13,658
three percent because there's a

2810
02:05:11,828 --> 02:05:15,609
transaction fee of between two and ten

2811
02:05:13,658 --> 02:05:17,920
percent and then patreon takes their

2812
02:05:15,609 --> 02:05:20,439
five percent cut right now this is a

2813
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:22,059
legitimate graph it doesn't make a lot

2814
02:05:20,439 --> 02:05:23,799
of sense to make a graph that has ranges

2815
02:05:22,059 --> 02:05:25,929
in it without drawing those ranges but

2816
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:28,179
whatever they picked the max of this

2817
02:05:25,929 --> 02:05:31,719
right they took 10% stuck it here 5%

2818
02:05:28,179 --> 02:05:35,800
stuck it here and this was the 15% 85%

2819
02:05:31,719 --> 02:05:38,498
here right so that's whatever right this

2820
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:40,960
is a fair diagram it probably does sort

2821
02:05:38,498 --> 02:05:42,909
of represent what happened although I

2822
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:45,130
argue it's not it this is still not

2823
02:05:42,909 --> 02:05:47,380
accurate because vat moss and local

2824
02:05:45,130 --> 02:05:51,400
taxes get stuck on here as well so

2825
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:53,380
really it's more like you know there's

2826
02:05:51,399 --> 02:05:56,319
another percentage in here that has to

2827
02:05:53,380 --> 02:05:58,480
do with country taxes and that gets

2828
02:05:56,319 --> 02:06:00,039
added on top of this right so there

2829
02:05:58,479 --> 02:06:00,639
should be another percentage on here

2830
02:06:00,039 --> 02:06:02,829
drawn in

2831
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:04,119
that's an overage of the pledge amount

2832
02:06:02,829 --> 02:06:06,939
that you just had to pay because I'm

2833
02:06:04,119 --> 02:06:08,559
pretty sure VAT mas that mas by law has

2834
02:06:06,939 --> 02:06:12,039
to be tacked on so they must have been

2835
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:13,300
doing that in other countries because

2836
02:06:12,039 --> 02:06:15,039
they're required to and they would get

2837
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:19,630
sued if they didn't or not sued

2838
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:20,979
prosecuted right but anyway let's take

2839
02:06:19,630 --> 02:06:23,680
that moss and taxes out of it for a

2840
02:06:20,979 --> 02:06:25,479
second this if you take taxes out of the

2841
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:27,640
equation is a reasonable representation

2842
02:06:25,479 --> 02:06:31,329
about what was happening to your pre-tax

2843
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:33,369
contribution they then showed this

2844
02:06:31,329 --> 02:06:35,439
diagram and if you look at this diagram

2845
02:06:33,369 --> 02:06:36,729
you can see that what they've done is

2846
02:06:35,439 --> 02:06:37,779
they've taken the previous hundred

2847
02:06:36,729 --> 02:06:39,339
percent that was here and said look

2848
02:06:37,779 --> 02:06:40,750
creators now take home ninety five

2849
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:43,060
percent that's more than even the

2850
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:45,760
highest percent here patreon takes five

2851
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:47,680
percent that looks pretty good right but

2852
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:51,869
then there's like a service fee on here

2853
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:54,579
which is 2.9 percent plus BOE 0.35 cents

2854
02:06:51,869 --> 02:06:56,109
right now this at least starts to

2855
02:06:54,579 --> 02:06:58,119
correctly represent the fact that there

2856
02:06:56,109 --> 02:06:59,649
are charges above the pledge amount

2857
02:06:58,119 --> 02:07:00,939
right again this one probably should

2858
02:06:59,649 --> 02:07:02,549
have had it for taxes and they're not

2859
02:07:00,939 --> 02:07:04,719
going to represent it here but whatever

2860
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:06,130
so here the same would be true there

2861
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:07,869
should be taxed on here now they're also

2862
02:07:06,130 --> 02:07:09,940
showing that the service fee which is

2863
02:07:07,869 --> 02:07:12,489
previously this red bar here now don't

2864
02:07:09,939 --> 02:07:15,219
do not ask me why they changed which

2865
02:07:12,489 --> 02:07:16,689
color was which that's just again

2866
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:17,770
straight-up bizarre and tells me the

2867
02:07:16,689 --> 02:07:18,609
people who made these charts have no

2868
02:07:17,770 --> 02:07:20,080
idea what they're doing but that's

2869
02:07:18,609 --> 02:07:21,639
separate issue right you should the

2870
02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:23,739
colors should be constant here this

2871
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:26,410
should have been this color this should

2872
02:07:23,739 --> 02:07:28,960
have been this color or vice versa but

2873
02:07:26,409 --> 02:07:31,420
you get what's going on right so this

2874
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:33,670
makes it sound like and in all of the

2875
02:07:31,420 --> 02:07:37,270
text here is sounds like they're doing

2876
02:07:33,670 --> 02:07:39,100
you a favor right but what they neglect

2877
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:43,540
to mention here in the classic how to

2878
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:47,380
lie with statistics sense is 35 cents is

2879
02:07:43,539 --> 02:07:50,260
a not a percentage so you can't put it

2880
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:54,699
on a percentage graph what that means is

2881
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:56,650
this bar is 100% fictitious

2882
02:07:54,698 --> 02:07:59,589
we have no idea how big it should

2883
02:07:56,649 --> 02:08:02,229
actually be until we decide how much

2884
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:06,909
actual money is represented by this

2885
02:08:02,229 --> 02:08:09,519
graph right so what we actually have is

2886
02:08:06,909 --> 02:08:12,219
a situation where this black bar could

2887
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:16,510
be like enormous in fact let's say a

2888
02:08:12,219 --> 02:08:19,359
patron plays pledged only 20 cents right

2889
02:08:16,510 --> 02:08:21,969
if a patron pledged only 20 cents just

2890
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:25,238
the 35 cents alone would be longer than

2891
02:08:21,969 --> 02:08:29,829
this entire bar right on the other hand

2892
02:08:25,238 --> 02:08:32,738
if a patron pledged $10,000 then this 35

2893
02:08:29,829 --> 02:08:37,300
cent piece would be nothing it would be

2894
02:08:32,738 --> 02:08:39,698
invisible right and herein lies the

2895
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:42,070
problem so what you end up with is a

2896
02:08:39,698 --> 02:08:42,609
situation where whether this is good or

2897
02:08:42,069 --> 02:08:44,829
not

2898
02:08:42,609 --> 02:08:46,960
despite the graph trying to make it

2899
02:08:44,829 --> 02:08:49,779
appear like it is always good is in fact

2900
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:52,149
awful for anyone who makes a small

2901
02:08:49,779 --> 02:08:55,448
dollar pledge the smaller your pledge

2902
02:08:52,149 --> 02:08:57,488
the harder this a fine 35 cents kicks in

2903
02:08:55,448 --> 02:09:01,319
to make it so that most of what you're

2904
02:08:57,488 --> 02:09:06,639
paying actually goes to the service fee

2905
02:09:01,319 --> 02:09:09,250
right and so the problem here more so

2906
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:11,289
than the service fee charge which in and

2907
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:14,649
of itself was probably a bad decision

2908
02:09:11,289 --> 02:09:15,850
for anyone donating small amounts of

2909
02:09:14,649 --> 02:09:17,738
money it would not affect people

2910
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:20,610
donating largemont people giving $50

2911
02:09:17,738 --> 02:09:24,909
$100 this graph is pretty accurate

2912
02:09:20,609 --> 02:09:27,219
people giving $5 $2 $1 which is a lot of

2913
02:09:24,909 --> 02:09:29,260
people on patreon give a small amount

2914
02:09:27,219 --> 02:09:31,448
right they don't have a lot of money or

2915
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:33,340
they give to a lot of things so you know

2916
02:09:31,448 --> 02:09:35,229
maybe they're even giving $1,000 a month

2917
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:37,539
but they're giving to lots and lots of

2918
02:09:35,229 --> 02:09:39,069
patreon right so either way you might be

2919
02:09:37,539 --> 02:09:39,969
you might not have very much money

2920
02:09:39,069 --> 02:09:41,380
you're just trying to give what you can

2921
02:09:39,969 --> 02:09:43,230
or you might have a lot of money but

2922
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:47,619
you're giving to lots of people right

2923
02:09:43,229 --> 02:09:49,509
either case what happens now is your

2924
02:09:47,619 --> 02:09:53,859
donation amount gets clobbered by this

2925
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:56,890
fee right this 35 cent fee $1 $2

2926
02:09:53,859 --> 02:09:59,500
donations that 35 cent fee is a huge

2927
02:09:56,890 --> 02:10:03,070
percentage right 35 cents at the risk of

2928
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:05,948
stating the obvious is 35 percent of a

2929
02:10:03,069 --> 02:10:08,590
$1 pledged that's a massive amount going

2930
02:10:05,948 --> 02:10:10,329
to fees and they tried to slip

2931
02:10:08,590 --> 02:10:13,960
by everyone with graphs like this and

2932
02:10:10,329 --> 02:10:18,189
statements like 95% of every pledge goes

2933
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:21,639
to creators right I don't know what to

2934
02:10:18,189 --> 02:10:23,678
say it seems very disingenuous that they

2935
02:10:21,639 --> 02:10:25,659
decided to present it this way I don't

2936
02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:28,449
understand why someone would have said

2937
02:10:25,658 --> 02:10:30,339
these things or drawn this graph if they

2938
02:10:28,448 --> 02:10:32,829
weren't intentionally trying to

2939
02:10:30,340 --> 02:10:35,920
manipulate public opinion to think this

2940
02:10:32,829 --> 02:10:39,550
change was more universally good than it

2941
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:41,949
was right and I think that's what people

2942
02:10:39,550 --> 02:10:44,800
have really latched onto and why they're

2943
02:10:41,948 --> 02:10:46,629
getting angry because yes they are

2944
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:48,670
probably upset the people who are giving

2945
02:10:46,630 --> 02:10:50,859
$1 a month to various things they're

2946
02:10:48,670 --> 02:10:52,149
upset that this is gonna cost them a lot

2947
02:10:50,859 --> 02:10:53,289
more money now and then they can't give

2948
02:10:52,149 --> 02:10:55,269
as much money to the people they're

2949
02:10:53,289 --> 02:10:58,979
trying to support I am sure that's a big

2950
02:10:55,270 --> 02:11:04,510
part of it but I think the real sort of

2951
02:10:58,979 --> 02:11:06,968
anger and out the the lashing out at

2952
02:11:04,510 --> 02:11:08,650
them for this and cancelling patrons

2953
02:11:06,969 --> 02:11:10,719
canceling pledges all that stuff is

2954
02:11:08,649 --> 02:11:13,689
coming from the fact that they didn't

2955
02:11:10,719 --> 02:11:15,429
humbly apologize for this change and say

2956
02:11:13,689 --> 02:11:16,569
we had no choice we have to do this

2957
02:11:15,429 --> 02:11:19,029
because of credit-card companies making

2958
02:11:16,569 --> 02:11:22,899
us do this or we felt like we had to do

2959
02:11:19,029 --> 02:11:24,759
this because of X Y &amp; Z they sold it

2960
02:11:22,899 --> 02:11:27,368
like they said this was great for

2961
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:29,889
everybody they were trying to pull a

2962
02:11:27,368 --> 02:11:31,238
fast one on you it appears right so

2963
02:11:29,889 --> 02:11:33,279
whether they were or not I don't know

2964
02:11:31,238 --> 02:11:36,759
but that's what it came across as and

2965
02:11:33,279 --> 02:11:38,529
they haven't done anything to us wage

2966
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:40,090
people's fears that that was the case

2967
02:11:38,529 --> 02:11:42,069
they've just doubled down and said no

2968
02:11:40,090 --> 02:11:43,690
this is better they keep insisting it's

2969
02:11:42,069 --> 02:11:44,829
better and they don't seem to be

2970
02:11:43,689 --> 02:11:46,539
listening to people say like no it

2971
02:11:44,829 --> 02:11:51,149
really isn't

2972
02:11:46,539 --> 02:11:55,810
I don't and so I don't know what to say

2973
02:11:51,149 --> 02:11:57,698
and so that's the patreon flameout that

2974
02:11:55,810 --> 02:11:59,679
appears to be happening now and like I

2975
02:11:57,698 --> 02:12:03,098
said unlike the last time where they

2976
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:06,270
kind of had this sort of a thing I now

2977
02:12:03,099 --> 02:12:12,670
this seems to be a lot more dangerous

2978
02:12:06,270 --> 02:12:15,070
like this is this could be like a site

2979
02:12:12,670 --> 02:12:17,260
ending thing for them I know so many I

2980
02:12:15,069 --> 02:12:19,899
think just we're closing the hand-made

2981
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:22,110
here a patreon on Monday at the latest I

2982
02:12:19,899 --> 02:12:24,969
think

2983
02:12:22,109 --> 02:12:26,859
but after that's closed that plus the

2984
02:12:24,969 --> 02:12:28,538
other people I know who have closed

2985
02:12:26,859 --> 02:12:30,189
their patreon 'he's you're probably

2986
02:12:28,538 --> 02:12:33,368
talking about three four thousand

2987
02:12:30,189 --> 02:12:36,578
dollars worth of contributions just from

2988
02:12:33,368 --> 02:12:38,229
my friends who aren't big patreon you

2989
02:12:36,578 --> 02:12:40,210
like I don't know anyone who's making

2990
02:12:38,229 --> 02:12:42,189
$10,000 off a patreon right

2991
02:12:40,210 --> 02:12:43,920
I know only people who are making a few

2992
02:12:42,189 --> 02:12:46,689
hundred dollars off the patreon right

2993
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:48,578
just out of the people I know which is

2994
02:12:46,689 --> 02:12:51,578
four or five people or something that's

2995
02:12:48,578 --> 02:12:53,170
not very many six eight I don't know the

2996
02:12:51,578 --> 02:12:55,179
number that have closed of taking out

2997
02:12:53,170 --> 02:12:58,538
several thousand dollars just from that

2998
02:12:55,179 --> 02:13:01,118
small group and so assuming the wider

2999
02:12:58,538 --> 02:13:05,018
internet looks similarly there this is

3000
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:08,558
gonna like cut in half their net value

3001
02:13:05,019 --> 02:13:11,559
or more just just this one weekend this

3002
02:13:08,559 --> 02:13:15,360
one mistake will literally half the size

3003
02:13:11,559 --> 02:13:15,360
of their thing if that's any indication

3004
02:13:16,408 --> 02:13:25,359
so they messed up I don't know what to

3005
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:27,400
say it's in the world of the Internet

3006
02:13:25,359 --> 02:13:29,589
the bonus is you can become an overnight

3007
02:13:27,399 --> 02:13:31,058
sensation really quick I mean hey

3008
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:32,739
handmade here was a good example of

3009
02:13:31,059 --> 02:13:34,389
something that I never thought would

3010
02:13:32,738 --> 02:13:35,709
have so many people watching every day

3011
02:13:34,389 --> 02:13:37,090
and so many people watching videos on

3012
02:13:35,710 --> 02:13:38,319
the mail set that's the power of the

3013
02:13:37,090 --> 02:13:39,730
Internet for you it happened almost

3014
02:13:38,319 --> 02:13:43,149
overnight just right when we started

3015
02:13:39,729 --> 02:13:45,129
right the Internet can do that it can

3016
02:13:43,149 --> 02:13:46,868
also punish you incredibly harshly

3017
02:13:45,130 --> 02:13:51,730
perhaps more harshly than you deserve

3018
02:13:46,868 --> 02:13:52,359
right that's the reality of the world we

3019
02:13:51,729 --> 02:13:56,288
live in

3020
02:13:52,359 --> 02:13:57,549
I'm sorry patreon like you know maybe

3021
02:13:56,288 --> 02:14:00,518
you were just trying to do a good thing

3022
02:13:57,550 --> 02:14:02,590
I don't know maybe you're unscrupulous I

3023
02:14:00,519 --> 02:14:04,030
don't know either I have no idea what

3024
02:14:02,590 --> 02:14:07,809
your deal is I don't know anyone at

3025
02:14:04,029 --> 02:14:10,210
patreon I have no idea what their morals

3026
02:14:07,809 --> 02:14:11,619
are ethics I don't know if they're

3027
02:14:10,210 --> 02:14:13,658
fundamentally trying to do good things

3028
02:14:11,618 --> 02:14:14,738
or if they're the types of people who

3029
02:14:13,658 --> 02:14:16,719
maybe started out trying to do good

3030
02:14:14,738 --> 02:14:19,419
things and is now like Silicon Valley VC

3031
02:14:16,719 --> 02:14:23,349
nastiness like you know rolling around

3032
02:14:19,420 --> 02:14:25,449
in in my Tesla like eating 12 dollar

3033
02:14:23,349 --> 02:14:27,610
toast and talking about like you know

3034
02:14:25,448 --> 02:14:28,839
who's in the c-suite kind of stuff like

3035
02:14:27,609 --> 02:14:29,889
I don't know what kind of people they

3036
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:31,989
are what kind of people they've become

3037
02:14:29,889 --> 02:14:33,578
and generally speaking I try not to make

3038
02:14:31,988 --> 02:14:35,439
that kind of value judgment I sometimes

3039
02:14:33,578 --> 02:14:36,729
I do and I've been trying lately

3040
02:14:35,439 --> 02:14:37,869
cuz I've seen how horrible it is when

3041
02:14:36,729 --> 02:14:39,939
people do the internet but trying not to

3042
02:14:37,869 --> 02:14:41,769
do that I just I try to like literally

3043
02:14:39,939 --> 02:14:44,109
take at face value like what is this

3044
02:14:41,770 --> 02:14:45,969
thing doing do I like it or not let me

3045
02:14:44,109 --> 02:14:48,039
not try to figure out whether someone

3046
02:14:45,969 --> 02:14:50,590
who once worked at the company maybe

3047
02:14:48,039 --> 02:14:52,448
someday made a comment on Twitter that I

3048
02:14:50,590 --> 02:14:54,310
wouldn't have liked right I've tried to

3049
02:14:52,448 --> 02:14:55,629
stop doing that because it seems awful

3050
02:14:54,310 --> 02:15:03,250
the way people do that on the internet

3051
02:14:55,630 --> 02:15:06,069
now so I don't know and I don't want to

3052
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:10,000
try to read behind the motives of this

3053
02:15:06,069 --> 02:15:13,599
change all I can say is yeah I'm

3054
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:16,988
uncomfortable about it too things like

3055
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:19,210
that chart make me really nervous those

3056
02:15:16,988 --> 02:15:21,339
look like the kinds of things people do

3057
02:15:19,210 --> 02:15:23,590
when either they're really really stupid

3058
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:25,829
like so stupid they can't even figure

3059
02:15:23,590 --> 02:15:28,480
out how to make the math for a chart or

3060
02:15:25,829 --> 02:15:29,890
they're just kind of unscrupulous and

3061
02:15:28,479 --> 02:15:30,579
are trying to make things look better

3062
02:15:29,890 --> 02:15:32,770
than they are

3063
02:15:30,579 --> 02:15:35,800
right I don't know a lot of other

3064
02:15:32,770 --> 02:15:40,180
explanations than manipulative or

3065
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:42,760
incredibly dumb either way don't really

3066
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:44,110
want to be relying on a platform by

3067
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:47,199
people who are either of those two

3068
02:15:44,109 --> 02:15:49,389
things so to me it's a good time to get

3069
02:15:47,198 --> 02:15:50,889
off of it it was never a source of

3070
02:15:49,390 --> 02:15:53,500
revenue for handmade hero anyway it was

3071
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:55,000
only a way to get donations into the

3072
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:57,729
project that we could then pay out to

3073
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:01,960
other projects who were on volunteer

3074
02:15:57,729 --> 02:16:04,000
support and so I'm just gonna figure out

3075
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:05,920
another way to get that done and close

3076
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,960
down the page and point everyone some

3077
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:10,239
other thing they can use hopefully a

3078
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:13,239
send owl page that will just work

3079
02:16:10,238 --> 02:16:15,009
that's fingers crossed but that's what

3080
02:16:13,238 --> 02:16:17,589
I'm gonna do so there will be no

3081
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:19,420
handmade hero patreon page very shortly

3082
02:16:17,590 --> 02:16:20,770
it will go away I already sent a message

3083
02:16:19,420 --> 02:16:22,810
out to all the patrons say hey stick

3084
02:16:20,770 --> 02:16:26,620
with it for a couple days we're gonna

3085
02:16:22,810 --> 02:16:29,590
try and and fix something here so so

3086
02:16:26,619 --> 02:16:31,599
that's what we're doing whether patreon

3087
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:33,069
itself survives this incident I have no

3088
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:35,260
idea I've never seen so many people

3089
02:16:33,069 --> 02:16:39,039
cancel their accounts that somewhere so

3090
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:41,860
quickly as this I don't have an

3091
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:45,219
explanation for that other than the fact

3092
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:48,250
that I feel like there's a difference

3093
02:16:45,218 --> 02:16:49,329
between commercial and altruistic

3094
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:52,270
funding model

3095
02:16:49,329 --> 02:16:54,670
that means you have less leeway here if

3096
02:16:52,270 --> 02:16:56,920
you are nice and you're selling someone

3097
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:59,139
sneakers that's a fundamentally

3098
02:16:56,920 --> 02:17:00,579
commercial venture and if people find

3099
02:16:59,139 --> 02:17:01,869
out that you're using sweatshop labor

3100
02:17:00,579 --> 02:17:04,059
and they don't like that

3101
02:17:01,870 --> 02:17:06,280
there may be a slight backlash against

3102
02:17:04,059 --> 02:17:10,180
you and you can respond to that backlash

3103
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:11,920
etc etc but it is fundamentally a

3104
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:14,680
commercial transaction with different

3105
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:16,989
rules and different expectations patreon

3106
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:18,760
is not that kind of a service patreon is

3107
02:17:16,989 --> 02:17:21,369
a service that exists solely because

3108
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:22,829
people are trying to feel like they're

3109
02:17:21,370 --> 02:17:26,079
doing a good thing

3110
02:17:22,829 --> 02:17:29,229
supporting projects they care about and

3111
02:17:26,079 --> 02:17:32,020
when you have a service I think that is

3112
02:17:29,229 --> 02:17:33,850
100% about goodwill like that is the

3113
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:36,370
only thing that they are training on

3114
02:17:33,850 --> 02:17:38,829
right it is not a commercially oriented

3115
02:17:36,370 --> 02:17:41,020
service people are not going there for

3116
02:17:38,829 --> 02:17:44,110
commercial transactions primarily I

3117
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:47,170
think what that means just again this is

3118
02:17:44,110 --> 02:17:50,260
data free this is just my gut take on it

3119
02:17:47,170 --> 02:17:54,270
because I don't know I think you

3120
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:57,190
probably just have a lot less rope right

3121
02:17:54,270 --> 02:18:01,210
you're fundamentally dealing with people

3122
02:17:57,190 --> 02:18:03,940
with creators who want to be portraying

3123
02:18:01,209 --> 02:18:05,589
themselves in a positive light to the

3124
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:09,250
people who are supporting them whatever

3125
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:10,960
that means right and you have patrons

3126
02:18:09,250 --> 02:18:13,420
who want to feel like they're doing a

3127
02:18:10,959 --> 02:18:15,399
good thing by using the site when that

3128
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:17,590
is the fundamental understanding and

3129
02:18:15,399 --> 02:18:22,449
there is no commercial part on top of it

3130
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:26,079
right or very little I think you just

3131
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:29,260
have so much less rope than a Starbucks

3132
02:18:26,079 --> 02:18:30,879
or a Nike or whoever who do still care

3133
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:34,809
about their image because it can affect

3134
02:18:30,879 --> 02:18:37,389
their sales or whatever right but it's

3135
02:18:34,809 --> 02:18:38,319
it's a lot less of it most of the time

3136
02:18:37,389 --> 02:18:40,840
you're going in to Starbucks because

3137
02:18:38,319 --> 02:18:42,520
it's the closed coffee shop and you're

3138
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:44,680
you think the coffee is fine or

3139
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:46,540
whatever right you're much less

3140
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:48,280
concerned about exactly how much is

3141
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:49,270
going to Fairtrade coffee and exactly

3142
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:51,370
how much environmentally-friendly

3143
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:53,140
building materials went into there so

3144
02:18:51,370 --> 02:18:55,960
far whatever there are people who care

3145
02:18:53,139 --> 02:18:58,750
about that to certain degrees but it's

3146
02:18:55,959 --> 02:19:01,500
not the it's not the main reason you

3147
02:18:58,750 --> 02:19:03,218
went into the to the Starbucks right

3148
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:05,829
it's just the things

3149
02:19:03,218 --> 02:19:07,388
Vox is trying to do either for them to

3150
02:19:05,829 --> 02:19:08,738
feel good about themselves as a company

3151
02:19:07,388 --> 02:19:10,119
or for you to feel better about

3152
02:19:08,738 --> 02:19:12,579
yourselves about buying the coffee but

3153
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:14,979
that's all whereas something like

3154
02:19:12,579 --> 02:19:16,750
patreon I think it's just it's a lot

3155
02:19:14,978 --> 02:19:19,510
higher risk of something like this

3156
02:19:16,750 --> 02:19:20,978
because the only reason you went there

3157
02:19:19,510 --> 02:19:22,478
was to feel like you were doing a good

3158
02:19:20,978 --> 02:19:23,888
thing to support somebody was making

3159
02:19:22,478 --> 02:19:27,188
something you cared about that's the

3160
02:19:23,888 --> 02:19:29,909
only reason you showed up so I feel like

3161
02:19:27,189 --> 02:19:32,318
they just don't have a lot of slack and

3162
02:19:29,909 --> 02:19:34,058
if they're gonna make a change like this

3163
02:19:32,318 --> 02:19:37,568
they have to really think it through a

3164
02:19:34,058 --> 02:19:39,369
lot harder than they did vet it a lot

3165
02:19:37,568 --> 02:19:42,818
harder than they did with their patrons

3166
02:19:39,370 --> 02:19:44,079
and their creators because it was a

3167
02:19:42,818 --> 02:19:47,289
two-week thing caught everyone by

3168
02:19:44,079 --> 02:19:48,939
surprise right they have to take it I

3169
02:19:47,290 --> 02:19:53,140
think a lot more seriously because they

3170
02:19:48,939 --> 02:19:55,930
are not the same as a standard

3171
02:19:53,139 --> 02:20:00,909
commercial company that it is not a

3172
02:19:55,930 --> 02:20:02,889
service first positive feeling second

3173
02:20:00,909 --> 02:20:05,350
which I think would be how you describe

3174
02:20:02,889 --> 02:20:07,148
most commercial ventures right it's not

3175
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:09,700
transaction first positive feeling

3176
02:20:07,148 --> 02:20:11,829
second it's the opposite it's positive

3177
02:20:09,700 --> 02:20:14,170
feeling first transaction second company

3178
02:20:11,829 --> 02:20:16,450
so if you do something to ruin that

3179
02:20:14,170 --> 02:20:18,879
positive feeling you are way more

3180
02:20:16,450 --> 02:20:21,359
exposed to backlash than I think anyone

3181
02:20:18,879 --> 02:20:27,068
else would be in the commercial sphere

3182
02:20:21,359 --> 02:20:29,890
for this kind of a thing right so again

3183
02:20:27,068 --> 02:20:32,049
not uninformed to take not a data based

3184
02:20:29,889 --> 02:20:33,728
analysis I have no idea of what I just

3185
02:20:32,049 --> 02:20:36,549
said is that all accurate but my like

3186
02:20:33,728 --> 02:20:39,219
kind of gut instinct is just that that

3187
02:20:36,549 --> 02:20:41,528
is a real problem for them and I think

3188
02:20:39,219 --> 02:20:44,409
what we're seeing now is an outsized

3189
02:20:41,529 --> 02:20:46,810
effect that this change has being as had

3190
02:20:44,409 --> 02:20:50,250
specifically because they are much more

3191
02:20:46,809 --> 02:20:55,059
susceptible I would suspect to negative

3192
02:20:50,250 --> 02:20:57,700
sentiment hurting their customer sort of

3193
02:20:55,059 --> 02:21:00,159
loyalty and engagement than what a

3194
02:20:57,700 --> 02:21:02,890
normal commercial adventure would hope

3195
02:21:00,159 --> 02:21:05,520
to experience right when they when they

3196
02:21:02,889 --> 02:21:05,519
have a misstep

3197
02:21:10,719 --> 02:21:14,078
Durov and i'm i've been having a lot of

3198
02:21:12,430 --> 02:21:15,520
trouble seeing motivated inspired for

3199
02:21:14,078 --> 02:21:17,020
new projects do you have any tips on how

3200
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:23,590
to take an idea and actually bring it

3201
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:25,539
fully into existence um not really

3202
02:21:23,590 --> 02:21:28,020
I mean I guess what I would say is

3203
02:21:25,539 --> 02:21:31,300
there's a couple ways you can do it

3204
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:32,498
number one is you have to make sure that

3205
02:21:31,299 --> 02:21:34,719
you're programming every day and you're

3206
02:21:32,498 --> 02:21:37,389
programming for like several hours every

3207
02:21:34,719 --> 02:21:39,849
day and that's the first thing to look

3208
02:21:37,389 --> 02:21:41,760
at separately if you find that it's hard

3209
02:21:39,850 --> 02:21:45,010
to program every day for several hours

3210
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:48,130
either a you need to do serious

3211
02:21:45,010 --> 02:21:50,949
behavioral work on yourself to make that

3212
02:21:48,129 --> 02:21:52,868
happen or you need to reassess whether

3213
02:21:50,949 --> 02:21:54,729
you wanted to be a programmer right not

3214
02:21:52,869 --> 02:21:56,050
everyone should be a programmer and not

3215
02:21:54,728 --> 02:21:57,818
everyone involved in software should be

3216
02:21:56,049 --> 02:21:59,648
a programmer right there's lots of other

3217
02:21:57,818 --> 02:22:02,648
things you can do there's management

3218
02:21:59,648 --> 02:22:04,958
there's art there's design there's all

3219
02:22:02,648 --> 02:22:06,099
sorts of other things that people do in

3220
02:22:04,959 --> 02:22:08,319
the software world that have nothing to

3221
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:11,859
do with actually coding every day so you

3222
02:22:08,318 --> 02:22:14,648
have to assess that right do I actually

3223
02:22:11,859 --> 02:22:16,899
like coding every day just the act of

3224
02:22:14,648 --> 02:22:20,049
programming right and if the answer to

3225
02:22:16,898 --> 02:22:21,969
that is yes then the next step is okay

3226
02:22:20,049 --> 02:22:23,318
is my main problem that I constantly

3227
02:22:21,969 --> 02:22:24,788
switch around when I'm programming on

3228
02:22:23,318 --> 02:22:26,769
and I never program long enough on

3229
02:22:24,789 --> 02:22:27,760
something to finish it if that's really

3230
02:22:26,770 --> 02:22:29,770
all you're talking about there's couple

3231
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:32,260
different things you can do one start

3232
02:22:29,770 --> 02:22:33,399
picking smaller projects sticking pick a

3233
02:22:32,260 --> 02:22:37,029
smaller product and work your way up

3234
02:22:33,398 --> 02:22:38,590
instead of picking you know I want to

3235
02:22:37,029 --> 02:22:41,168
make the next Call of Duty right which

3236
02:22:38,590 --> 02:22:43,209
is nuts and involve tons of tons and

3237
02:22:41,168 --> 02:22:44,619
tons and tons and tons of work how about

3238
02:22:43,209 --> 02:22:50,109
I want to make the next asteroids clone

3239
02:22:44,619 --> 02:22:52,109
right and that's it start smaller pick

3240
02:22:50,109 --> 02:22:55,418
smaller projects and work your way up

3241
02:22:52,109 --> 02:22:57,399
great way to start going gained some

3242
02:22:55,418 --> 02:22:59,529
confidence in shipping smaller things

3243
02:22:57,398 --> 02:23:04,028
before you try to ship bigger things is

3244
02:22:59,529 --> 02:23:05,619
a great thing to do to i spec things

3245
02:23:04,029 --> 02:23:09,100
specifically and only finish what you

3246
02:23:05,619 --> 02:23:11,350
spec right so that's not a great way to

3247
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:12,998
do real projects because real products

3248
02:23:11,350 --> 02:23:14,199
specially gain products take refinement

3249
02:23:12,998 --> 02:23:18,398
they take learning from your mistakes

3250
02:23:14,199 --> 02:23:20,260
they take revisions but again if you're

3251
02:23:18,398 --> 02:23:21,670
having trouble start with sangre like

3252
02:23:20,260 --> 02:23:22,989
I'm gonna write down on paper

3253
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:24,460
exactly what this thing is gonna do and

3254
02:23:22,989 --> 02:23:25,389
I'm gonna do exactly that and nothing

3255
02:23:24,459 --> 02:23:26,739
else is going in here no more

3256
02:23:25,389 --> 02:23:30,639
refinements I'm shipping that as version

3257
02:23:26,739 --> 02:23:31,780
one and a story right that can help cut

3258
02:23:30,639 --> 02:23:33,129
down on the feature creep and the

3259
02:23:31,780 --> 02:23:35,409
meandering and the worrying that the

3260
02:23:33,129 --> 02:23:36,279
thing isn't good so I can't finish it

3261
02:23:35,409 --> 02:23:38,200
because it's just not coming together

3262
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:40,210
and I need to do stuff to fix it know

3263
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:41,409
whatever is in the spec we ship it if

3264
02:23:40,209 --> 02:23:44,079
it's a turd it's a turd

3265
02:23:41,409 --> 02:23:46,450
even if I only ship it myself on github

3266
02:23:44,079 --> 02:23:47,559
whatever I'm finishing it so I can have

3267
02:23:46,450 --> 02:23:48,729
the experience of getting it done and

3268
02:23:47,559 --> 02:23:51,939
learning what that means right

3269
02:23:48,728 --> 02:23:55,029
that's not a good thing to do finally

3270
02:23:51,939 --> 02:23:57,760
the nuclear option get a loan take money

3271
02:23:55,030 --> 02:23:59,200
start a project over your head that you

3272
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:00,219
will have to finish because you're

3273
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:02,950
freaking out because you don't know how

3274
02:24:00,219 --> 02:24:09,250
to pay back the money right and that's

3275
02:24:02,950 --> 02:24:10,780
the way to do bigger projects having a

3276
02:24:09,250 --> 02:24:12,129
producer an investor or somebody

3277
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:13,600
breathing down your neck and expecting

3278
02:24:12,129 --> 02:24:17,019
demos is a real good way to force

3279
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:18,309
yourself to get work then right other

3280
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:20,590
than that I don't know a lot of options

3281
02:24:18,309 --> 02:24:22,478
and which option is right for you or

3282
02:24:20,590 --> 02:24:24,399
feasible for you depends on what your

3283
02:24:22,478 --> 02:24:27,099
situation is what your means are what

3284
02:24:24,399 --> 02:24:29,978
your said what you can do what you can

3285
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:34,319
afford to do what you can mentally take

3286
02:24:29,978 --> 02:24:36,849
for stress all that sort of stuff I

3287
02:24:34,319 --> 02:24:40,779
would obviously start start with the non

3288
02:24:36,850 --> 02:24:42,220
taking honey ones first and start to try

3289
02:24:40,780 --> 02:24:43,659
and get reasonably sure you can ship

3290
02:24:42,219 --> 02:24:46,119
things before you try to do something a

3291
02:24:43,659 --> 02:24:48,430
little more drastic like that but you

3292
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:49,780
know I couldn't tell you that's that's

3293
02:24:48,430 --> 02:24:51,309
all the options I know of there's no

3294
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:54,820
magic answer and you just got to find

3295
02:24:51,309 --> 02:24:56,049
out what works for you one other thing I

3296
02:24:54,819 --> 02:24:58,090
would mention is if you are always

3297
02:24:56,049 --> 02:24:59,139
working alone start working with

3298
02:24:58,090 --> 02:25:00,460
somebody else

3299
02:24:59,139 --> 02:25:02,199
it doesn't have to be another programmer

3300
02:25:00,459 --> 02:25:04,179
but somebody else who you're working

3301
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:05,350
with can help you stay motivated because

3302
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:07,420
if you're both working on something

3303
02:25:05,350 --> 02:25:09,729
that's like sort of mutually reinforcing

3304
02:25:07,420 --> 02:25:11,409
oftentimes find somebody else hopefully

3305
02:25:09,728 --> 02:25:12,969
maybe someone who's even more motivated

3306
02:25:11,409 --> 02:25:14,559
than you are on a typical daily basis

3307
02:25:12,969 --> 02:25:16,209
and hope that that will sort of bleed

3308
02:25:14,559 --> 02:25:17,529
over right into your motivation because

3309
02:25:16,209 --> 02:25:19,989
they'll be expecting deliverables from

3310
02:25:17,530 --> 02:25:23,439
you and that will reinforce your ability

3311
02:25:19,989 --> 02:25:25,270
to work did you ever get dependency to

3312
02:25:23,439 --> 02:25:26,739
work the new version I didn't I never

3313
02:25:25,270 --> 02:25:28,329
tried after that stream I just was like

3314
02:25:26,739 --> 02:25:30,420
well nope doesn't work and I'm out of

3315
02:25:28,329 --> 02:25:30,420
here

3316
02:25:33,969 --> 02:25:37,608
I'm fairly new to the series only on

3317
02:25:36,170 --> 02:25:38,809
episode 13 do you recommend coding along

3318
02:25:37,609 --> 02:25:40,430
with the series I personally like to

3319
02:25:38,809 --> 02:25:42,318
just watch and learn rather than copying

3320
02:25:40,430 --> 02:25:44,090
everything you type but I don't know I

3321
02:25:42,318 --> 02:25:45,170
would say that it depends on what you're

3322
02:25:44,090 --> 02:25:46,279
trying to learn from the series if

3323
02:25:45,170 --> 02:25:48,409
you're pretty new to program you're

3324
02:25:46,279 --> 02:25:50,000
pretty new to game programming I think

3325
02:25:48,409 --> 02:25:51,409
you may want to do some coding along

3326
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,659
with series it doesn't have to mean that

3327
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:55,219
you copy what I do but it maybe means

3328
02:25:53,659 --> 02:25:56,719
you should try to do some side products

3329
02:25:55,219 --> 02:25:58,969
or some side coding after you watch an

3330
02:25:56,719 --> 02:26:01,068
episode and do the same sorts of things

3331
02:25:58,969 --> 02:26:02,659
I'm doing just to cement that learning

3332
02:26:01,068 --> 02:26:04,010
in place because otherwise I feel like

3333
02:26:02,659 --> 02:26:05,600
it might be a little bit too ephemeral

3334
02:26:04,010 --> 02:26:07,279
if on the other hand you're a pretty

3335
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:09,170
accomplished programmer but maybe just

3336
02:26:07,279 --> 02:26:10,790
haven't done programming of the sorts of

3337
02:26:09,170 --> 02:26:13,040
things that I'm doing here and you just

3338
02:26:10,790 --> 02:26:15,410
want to kind of see some new techniques

3339
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:17,450
or learn some things that you're just

3340
02:26:15,409 --> 02:26:19,039
gonna apply like randomly on like that

3341
02:26:17,450 --> 02:26:20,300
sort of thing then I'd say just watching

3342
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:22,310
it seems fine because you already know

3343
02:26:20,299 --> 02:26:24,738
what you're doing you don't need me to

3344
02:26:22,309 --> 02:26:26,629
show you most stuff you're just kind of

3345
02:26:24,738 --> 02:26:28,398
picking up odds and ends along the way

3346
02:26:26,629 --> 02:26:30,108
that seems like it'll just kind of sink

3347
02:26:28,398 --> 02:26:31,099
in just fine so I would say it depends

3348
02:26:30,109 --> 02:26:33,409
on what kind of learning you're trying

3349
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:34,488
to do where you're at right now and only

3350
02:26:33,409 --> 02:26:38,568
you can really answer that question

3351
02:26:34,488 --> 02:26:40,039
probably have you considered applying

3352
02:26:38,568 --> 02:26:42,920
for a twitch partner I would subscribe

3353
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:45,050
we have not done that because in the

3354
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:48,500
past their contract has not allowed us

3355
02:26:45,049 --> 02:26:50,840
to post YouTube videos right away and we

3356
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:54,049
so we had that issue with their standard

3357
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:56,180
contract I might revisit it I don't

3358
02:26:54,049 --> 02:26:58,519
think the numbers of scrubbers we would

3359
02:26:56,180 --> 02:27:02,090
get would make a significant impact to

3360
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:05,479
us in terms of monetary in terms of

3361
02:27:02,090 --> 02:27:07,520
income for the project but you know it's

3362
02:27:05,478 --> 02:27:10,429
something people do ask about and I

3363
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:15,800
guess you'd maybe get benefits from it

3364
02:27:10,430 --> 02:27:17,750
I'm not sure but yeah you know I could

3365
02:27:15,799 --> 02:27:18,978
certainly look into it again but like I

3366
02:27:17,750 --> 02:27:22,850
said it's not a real high priority for

3367
02:27:18,978 --> 02:27:25,849
us consider getting a Bitcoin litecoin

3368
02:27:22,850 --> 02:27:27,470
and aetherium well it's an easy way for

3369
02:27:25,850 --> 02:27:29,029
people to donate it's hard to get your

3370
02:27:27,469 --> 02:27:29,769
money out of it though but I think it

3371
02:27:29,029 --> 02:27:33,790
could be worth it

3372
02:27:29,770 --> 02:27:33,790
descend I'll support Bitcoin

3373
02:27:47,959 --> 02:27:54,659
so you know I haven't really looked at

3374
02:27:50,398 --> 02:27:58,858
this but I I do think I can turn on

3375
02:27:54,659 --> 02:28:01,648
Bitcoin for purchases in Sandow I will

3376
02:27:58,859 --> 02:28:03,239
look at that and if so if we switch to a

3377
02:28:01,648 --> 02:28:04,439
send a donation system as well then

3378
02:28:03,239 --> 02:28:12,239
you'd be able to buy the source code

3379
02:28:04,439 --> 02:28:14,700
with Bitcoin or the or pledge so I will

3380
02:28:12,239 --> 02:28:26,340
add that to things I look at hopefully

3381
02:28:14,700 --> 02:28:28,500
as I get a send out system in place OCO

3382
02:28:26,340 --> 02:28:30,210
lumion posted a link colombian what what

3383
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:34,439
does this think blog post about patron

3384
02:28:30,209 --> 02:28:35,789
onboarding what's in the post can you

3385
02:28:34,439 --> 02:28:49,889
tell me what what should I be looking

3386
02:28:35,790 --> 02:28:51,540
for in there I'll bring it up first of

3387
02:28:49,889 --> 02:28:53,489
all anyone who says like onboarding

3388
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:54,960
growth I already don't like I mean

3389
02:28:53,489 --> 02:28:58,039
that's just a little bit of my prejudice

3390
02:28:54,959 --> 02:29:01,409
against Silicon Valley in general but I

3391
02:28:58,040 --> 02:29:03,090
mean I'll be honest if you use the term

3392
02:29:01,409 --> 02:29:06,079
onboarding growth I already probably

3393
02:29:03,090 --> 02:29:09,469
don't want to be in business with you

3394
02:29:06,079 --> 02:29:09,469
what can you say

3395
02:29:37,369 --> 02:29:43,909
yeah I mean I guess like this kind of

3396
02:29:39,139 --> 02:29:45,318
here like you know I suppose this year

3397
02:29:43,908 --> 02:29:47,719
kind of tells you what you need to know

3398
02:29:45,318 --> 02:29:50,359
about the way they look at paid at their

3399
02:29:47,719 --> 02:29:54,648
platform right they they're sort of

3400
02:29:50,359 --> 02:29:55,850
saying like hey unsuccessful patreon

3401
02:29:54,648 --> 02:29:59,539
which I guess we are probably

3402
02:29:55,850 --> 02:30:01,040
technically a successful patreon because

3403
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:03,229
we're like eight hundred nine hundred

3404
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:04,520
dollars something like that but you know

3405
02:30:03,228 --> 02:30:05,478
someone making fifty dollars a month I

3406
02:30:04,520 --> 02:30:07,399
guess they're kind of saying we don't

3407
02:30:05,478 --> 02:30:10,188
care about you because you're not

3408
02:30:07,398 --> 02:30:11,959
contributing to our viral loop and we're

3409
02:30:10,189 --> 02:30:14,260
you're not generating enough revenue I

3410
02:30:11,959 --> 02:30:14,259
don't know

3411
02:30:27,059 --> 02:30:29,118
you

3412
02:30:41,989 --> 02:30:46,170
the fundamental problem was that our

3413
02:30:44,189 --> 02:30:48,090
acquisition and activation funnel had a

3414
02:30:46,170 --> 02:30:49,530
higher ratio of people who were still

3415
02:30:48,090 --> 02:30:51,149
early in the process of building their

3416
02:30:49,530 --> 02:30:54,840
fan base meaning they were coming to the

3417
02:30:51,149 --> 02:30:56,430
site and not succeeding crews must have

3418
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:57,960
an established online following even as

3419
02:30:56,430 --> 02:30:59,520
small and posted a regular frequency

3420
02:30:57,959 --> 02:31:01,289
online this specific figured seeking

3421
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:02,700
verba creative exclusive right we were

3422
02:31:01,290 --> 02:31:04,020
tracking people who saw creators getting

3423
02:31:02,700 --> 02:31:06,000
paid and sustained in patreon and they

3424
02:31:04,020 --> 02:31:07,649
would misunderstand this and attribute a

3425
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:09,899
reverse causality they would think that

3426
02:31:07,649 --> 02:31:13,109
launching a patreon page okay that seems

3427
02:31:09,899 --> 02:31:18,659
fine though that's true it made our

3428
02:31:13,110 --> 02:31:19,950
funnels our funnels useless it's great

3429
02:31:18,659 --> 02:31:22,020
to see other creators launch and promote

3430
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:23,340
their pages and succeed financially as a

3431
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:24,840
result our virality is through

3432
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:26,489
visibility more than explicit

3433
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:29,090
invitations we receive Dropbox for our

3434
02:31:26,489 --> 02:31:29,090
social network

3435
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:44,680
project mondo and countering creative

3436
02:31:43,149 --> 02:31:46,709
growth experimentation the patron team

3437
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:54,280
took a hard look at their growth levers

3438
02:31:46,709 --> 02:31:56,679
and realized that to make it you know it

3439
02:31:54,280 --> 02:31:59,229
really sucks that Silicon Valley like

3440
02:31:56,680 --> 02:32:01,270
95% of it seems like what they think

3441
02:31:59,228 --> 02:32:03,609
about all day is like how to manipulate

3442
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:06,640
people into using their platform now I

3443
02:32:03,610 --> 02:32:08,710
can appreciate the fact that it's a

3444
02:32:06,639 --> 02:32:13,000
nuclear arms race right like it's kind

3445
02:32:08,709 --> 02:32:14,379
of like well because you know Google is

3446
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:16,600
spending all of their time figuring out

3447
02:32:14,379 --> 02:32:18,789
how to manipulate people into you know

3448
02:32:16,600 --> 02:32:20,319
looking at their ads or whatever we have

3449
02:32:18,790 --> 02:32:21,790
to spend all day thinking about how we

3450
02:32:20,319 --> 02:32:24,129
manipulate people into using our

3451
02:32:21,790 --> 02:32:25,479
platform and you know uber ëthe think

3452
02:32:24,129 --> 02:32:26,920
about all day how they manipulate people

3453
02:32:25,478 --> 02:32:29,260
into using their ride-sharing service

3454
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:32,110
and blah blah blah like I understand

3455
02:32:29,260 --> 02:32:34,300
that fact but it still it still sucks

3456
02:32:32,110 --> 02:32:36,520
like it still it's like it's not good

3457
02:32:34,299 --> 02:32:38,228
just because everyone it's kind of like

3458
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:40,239
nuclear weapons it's not great

3459
02:32:38,228 --> 02:32:41,920
that we all have them I understand why

3460
02:32:40,239 --> 02:32:45,100
everyone has to have them but it's not

3461
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:47,139
like I'm happy about the fact that all

3462
02:32:45,100 --> 02:32:48,700
of these bad things are existing and I

3463
02:32:47,139 --> 02:32:50,289
would say that this is the kind of thing

3464
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:53,560
that just leaves an awful feeling right

3465
02:32:50,290 --> 02:32:54,820
cuz you're just like a god like I can

3466
02:32:53,559 --> 02:32:56,680
tell you the amount of time we have

3467
02:32:54,819 --> 02:32:58,930
spent thinking about our handmade hero

3468
02:32:56,680 --> 02:33:01,540
purchasing funnel is exactly zero we

3469
02:32:58,930 --> 02:33:08,739
don't even have a funnel we just have a

3470
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:11,040
web page with a button on it let's see

3471
02:33:08,739 --> 02:33:11,039
here

3472
02:33:14,479 --> 02:33:28,520
- team of oh I thought that's a 2.1

3473
02:33:20,379 --> 02:33:31,339
engineers in fact doesn't that say 2.1

3474
02:33:28,521 --> 02:33:36,530
engineers it was implemented by a team

3475
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:38,540
of 2.1 engineers does that mean they

3476
02:33:36,530 --> 02:33:40,760
took somebody and cut him off at the

3477
02:33:38,540 --> 02:33:44,420
ankles and just put his feet on to the

3478
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:47,420
team or what what is a point one

3479
02:33:44,420 --> 02:33:49,659
engineer does anyone know what that

3480
02:33:47,420 --> 02:33:49,659
means

3481
02:33:50,469 --> 02:33:54,439
maybe that's just because the program is

3482
02:33:52,851 --> 02:33:56,810
a patron are so bad but they only count

3483
02:33:54,440 --> 02:33:59,540
for point one of an engineer or

3484
02:33:56,810 --> 02:34:03,829
something so two point one engineers is

3485
02:33:59,540 --> 02:34:06,710
is actually like twenty one engineers at

3486
02:34:03,829 --> 02:34:07,879
a company where people know what they

3487
02:34:06,709 --> 02:34:09,949
were doing or something I don't know

3488
02:34:07,879 --> 02:34:12,199
what that means that's a I don't know

3489
02:34:09,950 --> 02:34:14,181
what that means at all but maybe it's a

3490
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:16,790
looking Valley speak for people working

3491
02:34:14,181 --> 02:34:18,950
a tenth of the time on something like

3492
02:34:16,790 --> 02:34:23,380
one out of every one day out of every

3493
02:34:18,950 --> 02:34:23,380
two weeks is that a point one engineer

3494
02:34:23,950 --> 02:34:29,630
let's see it's called Project mondo by

3495
02:34:26,899 --> 02:34:32,750
the way it's like Monday dude oh here's

3496
02:34:29,629 --> 02:34:34,279
a diagram chain reaction the highest

3497
02:34:32,750 --> 02:34:35,870
leverage metric capacious growth model

3498
02:34:34,280 --> 02:34:37,880
is new financial Sissel creators who

3499
02:34:35,870 --> 02:34:39,021
trigger further creative virality as

3500
02:34:37,879 --> 02:34:41,989
well as help bring more patients to

3501
02:34:39,021 --> 02:34:43,460
countersign the service software as a

3502
02:34:41,989 --> 02:34:45,260
service side activation in the viral

3503
02:34:43,459 --> 02:34:52,729
funnel use as valuable as direct shares

3504
02:34:45,260 --> 02:34:56,719
okay so here's the loop I guess you guys

3505
02:34:52,729 --> 02:34:59,180
all got this there's a new creator that

3506
02:34:56,719 --> 02:35:02,539
crater launches a patreon page they

3507
02:34:59,181 --> 02:35:07,909
promote via multiple channels the

3508
02:35:02,540 --> 02:35:09,980
audience sees that page and then the the

3509
02:35:07,909 --> 02:35:11,569
percentage of the audience who also

3510
02:35:09,979 --> 02:35:13,760
creators click through enter their

3511
02:35:11,569 --> 02:35:15,379
credit flow so this is correct I mean

3512
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:18,649
this is what happened with handmade hero

3513
02:35:15,379 --> 02:35:22,279
right people asked me to create a page I

3514
02:35:18,649 --> 02:35:26,029
did other handmade hero related projects

3515
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:28,101
saw that page that was promoted by other

3516
02:35:26,030 --> 02:35:31,659
channels and then it create like we do

3517
02:35:28,101 --> 02:35:31,659
this exact loop so they're not wrong

3518
02:35:36,250 --> 02:35:39,398
[Music]

3519
02:35:45,039 --> 02:35:47,859
what if you kept the same amount of

3520
02:35:46,809 --> 02:35:50,769
shares but doubled your rate of

3521
02:35:47,859 --> 02:35:52,479
onboarding improving funnel conversion

3522
02:35:50,770 --> 02:35:54,369
is powerful a sharing happens out there

3523
02:35:52,478 --> 02:35:55,858
shank you remember product whatever um

3524
02:35:54,369 --> 02:35:58,180
versus radius expensive function

3525
02:35:55,859 --> 02:35:59,800
onboarding says affects all our metrics

3526
02:35:58,180 --> 02:36:01,658
ok defining friendships of creators in

3527
02:35:59,799 --> 02:36:03,038
order for the patreon onboarding spirit

3528
02:36:01,658 --> 02:36:04,180
to have a competitive effect the company

3529
02:36:03,039 --> 02:36:05,770
ID to be able to identify its single out

3530
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:07,210
the seminar creators that have the

3531
02:36:05,770 --> 02:36:09,010
greatest potential to achieve financial

3532
02:36:07,209 --> 02:36:10,629
success so basically they're kind of

3533
02:36:09,010 --> 02:36:11,889
like it's a winners outs thing that

3534
02:36:10,629 --> 02:36:14,078
we're kind of trying to help people who

3535
02:36:11,889 --> 02:36:16,238
already need the least help if you will

3536
02:36:14,078 --> 02:36:19,059
right it's kind of like a Donald Trump

3537
02:36:16,238 --> 02:36:22,148
tax plan or something right it's kind of

3538
02:36:19,059 --> 02:36:24,549
like a we want to find people who are

3539
02:36:22,148 --> 02:36:27,879
already winning and help them win more

3540
02:36:24,549 --> 02:36:30,429
or whatever the creator for having a

3541
02:36:27,879 --> 02:36:32,139
five screw the creator cars driven has

3542
02:36:30,430 --> 02:36:33,369
absolute numbers follows around so the

3543
02:36:32,139 --> 02:36:34,719
team looks for quality at how much of

3544
02:36:33,369 --> 02:36:37,979
engagement how consistently the people

3545
02:36:34,719 --> 02:36:37,978
who are engaging our engagement right

3546
02:36:38,039 --> 02:36:43,600
okay it's like the ultimate end

3547
02:36:41,350 --> 02:36:45,460
quantitative criteria of a certain level

3548
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:46,960
of monetary earnings because it's simple

3549
02:36:45,459 --> 02:36:53,408
and functional for the growth team to

3550
02:36:46,959 --> 02:36:55,089
optimize for that so then how do they so

3551
02:36:53,408 --> 02:36:57,248
how do they actually help those people

3552
02:36:55,090 --> 02:36:59,228
though I mean I understand how you might

3553
02:36:57,248 --> 02:37:00,850
go about identifying which people you

3554
02:36:59,228 --> 02:37:03,459
think could make more money than they

3555
02:37:00,850 --> 02:37:05,680
are making easily like without a lot of

3556
02:37:03,459 --> 02:37:08,879
work but I'm not sure how you help them

3557
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:08,880
so how did they help them

3558
02:37:17,790 --> 02:37:21,310
because to Emil the grass will use

3559
02:37:19,750 --> 02:37:24,809
patreon but with a few concrete examples

3560
02:37:21,309 --> 02:37:24,809
they come alive and totally get it

3561
02:37:38,440 --> 02:37:46,810
I'm not sure what this means in Category

3562
02:37:40,870 --> 02:37:47,801
comparables you can't do patreon doesn't

3563
02:37:46,810 --> 02:37:49,329
have X featured in Greta those

3564
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:50,739
complaints we're really just a

3565
02:37:49,329 --> 02:37:52,739
smokescreen for a more fertile fear of

3566
02:37:50,739 --> 02:37:54,789
having patrons expending a beggar's Bowl

3567
02:37:52,739 --> 02:37:58,899
the Christian only proposed sales and

3568
02:37:54,790 --> 02:38:00,431
asked their colleague it's easy I just

3569
02:37:58,899 --> 02:38:01,511
show someone on patron whom they respect

3570
02:38:00,431 --> 02:38:03,360
in their category and then they don't

3571
02:38:01,511 --> 02:38:07,329
care anymore okay so they say like look

3572
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:09,460
you know such and such a famous person

3573
02:38:07,329 --> 02:38:11,079
who you like is using patreon to beg for

3574
02:38:09,459 --> 02:38:12,119
money so you should beg for money - that

3575
02:38:11,079 --> 02:38:14,970
makes sense

3576
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:18,480
all of these seem fairly reasonable if

3577
02:38:14,970 --> 02:38:18,479
manipulative right

3578
02:38:35,469 --> 02:38:39,019
[Music]

3579
02:38:42,510 --> 02:38:54,869
we have creators here for the time they

3580
02:38:45,068 --> 02:38:54,868
meet our teams of CEO they what so what

3581
02:38:57,420 --> 02:39:02,728
I thought about B hmm but until we tried

3582
02:39:00,120 --> 02:39:04,140
we would rock through it with the fig

3583
02:39:02,728 --> 02:39:05,398
account to vet it does this feel

3584
02:39:04,139 --> 02:39:06,778
reliable is this going to make us look

3585
02:39:05,398 --> 02:39:07,920
amateur in front of our fans is this

3586
02:39:06,779 --> 02:39:10,290
something that serious careers reduce

3587
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:12,620
time to some guy who took his first

3588
02:39:10,290 --> 02:39:14,880
guitar lesson we encountered a lot of

3589
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:16,199
Opposition in the organization WYSIWYG

3590
02:39:14,879 --> 02:39:17,398
is the most common best rectus make it

3591
02:39:16,199 --> 02:39:19,109
easy make a frictionless most great

3592
02:39:17,398 --> 02:39:20,760
professionals efforts before some of

3593
02:39:19,109 --> 02:39:22,380
these people on the Internet are stupid

3594
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:24,800
and improved conversions Roisin mind we

3595
02:39:22,379 --> 02:39:24,799
have to dumb down

3596
02:39:30,949 --> 02:39:33,949
the team also stands that their tool is

3597
02:39:32,809 --> 02:39:35,389
to fling a use case that's highly

3598
02:39:33,949 --> 02:39:37,250
personal and very emotional there's a

3599
02:39:35,389 --> 02:39:39,769
lot of vulnerability they might fail in

3600
02:39:37,250 --> 02:39:40,969
front of their fans people on the

3601
02:39:39,770 --> 02:39:43,069
internet aren't always looking for a

3602
02:39:40,969 --> 02:39:44,319
low-friction areas and our functioning

3603
02:39:43,068 --> 02:39:47,500
perfectionist

3604
02:39:44,319 --> 02:39:47,500
[Music]

3605
02:39:55,250 --> 02:39:59,020
all right that doesn't really matter

3606
02:40:01,620 --> 02:40:05,470
so I guess I don't know I mean other

3607
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:14,709
than being kind of distasteful I'm not

3608
02:40:05,469 --> 02:40:18,119
really sure like like that's just like

3609
02:40:14,709 --> 02:40:21,339
yeah this is a Silicon Valley you know

3610
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:25,079
marketing kind of nonsense right it

3611
02:40:21,340 --> 02:40:25,079
seems like it's roughly accurate

3612
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:32,620
definitely you know double suggest that

3613
02:40:30,159 --> 02:40:33,909
patreon doesn't maybe care about low

3614
02:40:32,620 --> 02:40:36,130
dollar donations because they're not

3615
02:40:33,909 --> 02:40:38,709
gonna maybe comprise enough of their

3616
02:40:36,129 --> 02:40:41,228
income which would explain why they

3617
02:40:38,709 --> 02:40:42,639
don't you know maybe why they made this

3618
02:40:41,228 --> 02:40:43,929
fee change and thought it wouldn't be a

3619
02:40:42,639 --> 02:40:45,879
big deal because they're mostly thinking

3620
02:40:43,930 --> 02:40:47,470
about people who get $50 a month to a

3621
02:40:45,879 --> 02:40:49,238
project rather than people give $1 a

3622
02:40:47,469 --> 02:40:50,648
month maybe but I don't know it wasn't

3623
02:40:49,238 --> 02:40:54,250
that much stuff in here it's kind of

3624
02:40:50,648 --> 02:40:57,750
just a big old Silicon Valley standard

3625
02:40:54,250 --> 02:40:57,750
nonsense kind of a thing

3626
02:41:07,159 --> 02:41:18,510
okay Dragoon x6 what do you think of get

3627
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:20,159
large file storage or any other get

3628
02:41:18,510 --> 02:41:23,060
large asset plugins over centralized

3629
02:41:20,159 --> 02:41:26,850
search control such as SVN or perforce

3630
02:41:23,060 --> 02:41:29,489
I've been taking a look and for free as

3631
02:41:26,850 --> 02:41:31,290
in pay solution I actually came to

3632
02:41:29,489 --> 02:41:34,729
mercurial with its large asset plugin

3633
02:41:31,290 --> 02:41:37,500
what do you recommend we use a custom

3634
02:41:34,729 --> 02:41:39,779
stuff it Molly so I don't have a

3635
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:42,239
recommendation on if you don't have your

3636
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:44,730
own source code system I don't know what

3637
02:41:42,239 --> 02:41:50,389
you would use exactly

3638
02:41:44,729 --> 02:41:55,590
I don't think particularly highly of git

3639
02:41:50,389 --> 02:41:59,340
it's just not really stable to me it's a

3640
02:41:55,590 --> 02:42:03,510
giant collection of like Python scripts

3641
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:06,420
I think it is just not the kind of thing

3642
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:09,840
I would trust really anything - it's

3643
02:42:06,420 --> 02:42:11,819
just kind of way too sprawling and it's

3644
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:13,560
not concise enough for a system that's

3645
02:42:11,819 --> 02:42:16,229
handling like the most precious bits you

3646
02:42:13,560 --> 02:42:18,360
know I don't I don't so I wouldn't use

3647
02:42:16,229 --> 02:42:20,729
something like that but I mean I you

3648
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:22,170
know I wouldn't I don't so I don't know

3649
02:42:20,729 --> 02:42:27,409
if you're gonna have to use something

3650
02:42:22,170 --> 02:42:29,700
maybe gets the best thing I don't know I

3651
02:42:27,409 --> 02:42:32,039
know people have used

3652
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:36,870
oh sorry pearl yeah not Python Perl

3653
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:38,790
scripts I don't know if mercury is

3654
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:41,070
better than GUID or gets better than

3655
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:42,690
mercurial I don't know if you know I

3656
02:42:41,069 --> 02:42:44,069
know that the witness for example would

3657
02:42:42,690 --> 02:42:48,420
use subversion it didn't use either of

3658
02:42:44,069 --> 02:42:50,129
those two and was it fabulous maybe not

3659
02:42:48,420 --> 02:42:52,680
did it work yes did it ever lose

3660
02:42:50,129 --> 02:42:53,909
anything no so you know there's

3661
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:55,170
definitely products out there that are

3662
02:42:53,909 --> 02:42:58,260
really huge probably bigger than

3663
02:42:55,170 --> 02:43:04,340
whatever you're doing that used

3664
02:42:58,260 --> 02:43:04,340
subversion just fine so

3665
02:43:05,170 --> 02:43:07,889
you know

3666
02:43:12,790 --> 02:43:17,330
that's all that's all I could say about

3667
02:43:15,290 --> 02:43:19,250
that so I don't have a personal

3668
02:43:17,329 --> 02:43:22,159
recommendation I have worked on one

3669
02:43:19,250 --> 02:43:23,689
project namely the witness that did do

3670
02:43:22,159 --> 02:43:26,000
everything including the art assets

3671
02:43:23,689 --> 02:43:29,260
through subversion and it worked

3672
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:31,430
it did not pose too many problems

3673
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:33,978
although I do think they had to do a

3674
02:43:31,430 --> 02:43:37,159
little bit of work with it for certain

3675
02:43:33,978 --> 02:43:42,228
circumstances I think those things were

3676
02:43:37,159 --> 02:43:45,079
related more though to NTFS Oslo file

3677
02:43:42,228 --> 02:43:48,228
enumeration stuff maybe then they then

3678
02:43:45,079 --> 02:43:50,180
they had to actually do with subversion

3679
02:43:48,228 --> 02:43:53,090
so I'm not sure that I'm not sure if

3680
02:43:50,180 --> 02:44:04,790
they ever really had a problem with

3681
02:43:53,090 --> 02:44:06,318
subversion directly so I don't know but

3682
02:44:04,790 --> 02:44:08,149
what I can say is that you know they're

3683
02:44:06,318 --> 02:44:09,379
still using it as far as I know all of

3684
02:44:08,148 --> 02:44:12,199
John's projects still go through

3685
02:44:09,379 --> 02:44:13,728
subversion so he's not the kind of

3686
02:44:12,200 --> 02:44:16,189
person who would keep using a system if

3687
02:44:13,728 --> 02:44:17,420
it was completely intractable although

3688
02:44:16,189 --> 02:44:23,059
that said he's still using Emacs

3689
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:24,350
but generally speaking no and I think if

3690
02:44:23,059 --> 02:44:26,809
it was causing a lot of problems he

3691
02:44:24,350 --> 02:44:28,520
would have done something different so I

3692
02:44:26,809 --> 02:44:30,799
feel like subversions probably a pretty

3693
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:32,569
safe bet as well in there I don't know

3694
02:44:30,799 --> 02:44:33,709
if get her mercurial is like a better

3695
02:44:32,568 --> 02:44:35,420
choice in some way but I think

3696
02:44:33,709 --> 02:44:36,769
subversion would I would include that in

3697
02:44:35,420 --> 02:44:43,189
your list of things that maybe you would

3698
02:44:36,770 --> 02:44:49,370
use oh wait you did you said SVN or or

3699
02:44:43,189 --> 02:44:51,460
perforce not just perforce so I don't

3700
02:44:49,370 --> 02:44:51,460
know

3701
02:45:01,469 --> 02:45:07,148
alright let's go ahead and wrap it up I

3702
02:45:04,109 --> 02:45:11,199
think we have covered everything in the

3703
02:45:07,148 --> 02:45:17,168
queue colons and we talked about the

3704
02:45:11,199 --> 02:45:18,550
patreon fiasco as well all right thank

3705
02:45:17,168 --> 02:45:20,378
you everyone for joining me for another

3706
02:45:18,549 --> 02:45:22,988
episode of handmade hero it's been a

3707
02:45:20,379 --> 02:45:26,560
pleasure coding with you as always if

3708
02:45:22,988 --> 02:45:28,208
you want to support the series and you

3709
02:45:26,559 --> 02:45:29,648
would like access to the source code or

3710
02:45:28,209 --> 02:45:31,359
either of those two things you can

3711
02:45:29,648 --> 02:45:34,090
always pre-order the game on handmade

3712
02:45:31,359 --> 02:45:38,199
hero org don't click the patreon link

3713
02:45:34,090 --> 02:45:40,059
though cuz that's going away we will

3714
02:45:38,199 --> 02:45:41,498
have this button removed sometime

3715
02:45:40,059 --> 02:45:42,850
shortly but the other buttons they'll

3716
02:45:41,498 --> 02:45:43,988
still be there you will still be able to

3717
02:45:42,850 --> 02:45:45,220
preorder the source code through send

3718
02:45:43,988 --> 02:45:47,378
out obviously you'll still be able to go

3719
02:45:45,219 --> 02:45:48,549
to the forum site and ask questions you

3720
02:45:47,379 --> 02:45:50,470
will still be able to use the schedule

3721
02:45:48,549 --> 02:45:52,090
bot to find out when we're gonna be live

3722
02:45:50,469 --> 02:45:56,108
and you will still be able to look at

3723
02:45:52,090 --> 02:45:57,309
the episode guide until tomorrow when

3724
02:45:56,109 --> 02:46:00,248
hopefully I'll have a little bit more

3725
02:45:57,309 --> 02:46:03,878
information about what we will be

3726
02:46:00,248 --> 02:46:06,549
replacing patreon with please have fun

3727
02:46:03,879 --> 02:46:07,449
programming and I will see everyone on

3728
02:46:06,549 --> 02:46:10,498
the Internet

3729
02:46:07,449 --> 02:46:10,498
take it easy everybody
