1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,669
prepress files getting all that stuff

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:08,009
correct is about giving the printer the

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:11,519
best possible input materials from your

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:13,888
side to work with right but there's

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,528
another thing which is the printer also

6
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:19,969
has to get input from industry they have

7
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:24,868
to get paper they have to get ink right

8
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:25,618
and for the most part in my experience

9
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:29,879
so far

10
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:33,869
ink is not really something that you

11
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:37,320
have to think about much so from what

12
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:39,539
I've seen in again you know we are sort

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,159
of new to this because you know this

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,679
isn't our business so this is what I

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:47,788
learned going through this process once

16
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:51,299
maybe there's more that you would learn

17
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,010
if you did it all the time but the one

18
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,988
thing that never comes up in the

19
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,420
pre-press process as far as I've seen is

20
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:02,459
the printer asking you which inks you

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:05,040
want them to use for for CMY for CMYK so

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,170
from what I can tell you really don't

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,380
have to make decisions about the inks

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,490
the inks kind of just are the inks and

25
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:13,819
unless I guess you want something

26
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:19,140
special it just doesn't seem to come up

27
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:21,419
what comes up is paper so paper is more

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,759
or less non-standard it's not like you

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,560
go to a printer and with like the inks

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,299
they just these are the inks they use in

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,978
this press and it's like off you go

32
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,840
right and it was never asked it was

33
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,310
never discussed it wasn't even really

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,530
mentioned as an option or something you

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,600
might even care about but paper always

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,799
is and the reason for that is there's

37
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:44,969
different parameters of paper that

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,310
affect how the book like the interior of

39
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:50,569
the book and the cover of the book look

40
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,310
and you have to pick which ones you want

41
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:56,718
now I'm going to go ahead and go to our

42
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:00,118
actual Kickstarter page so if I go to

43
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:03,269
our Kickstarter page right now I

44
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:07,530
actually posted an update when we made

45
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:11,519
our stretch goal of spot UV I posted

46
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,699
this image I'm sorry this video and this

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,490
video is actually

48
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:19,369
the easiest way I can think of to show

49
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:23,210
you what I mean by these different

50
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,920
aspects of the paper so if you take a

51
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,400
look at what's happening here I'm

52
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:31,549
holding up this comic called oink this

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,510
is a mat cover so what does that mean

54
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,830
well when you get paper effectively the

55
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:38,389
way that it's made to a first

56
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,010
approximation or at least the way that

57
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:41,269
we have to understand how it's made

58
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,560
there's probably a lot more interesting

59
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,130
intricacy to it if you're actually

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,740
making paper paper stock can be

61
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:52,009
completely uncoated which means it's

62
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,650
literally just pulpy paper like you know

63
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:57,590
glue and wood or whatever I mean I make

64
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:03,020
paper now it can literally just be like

65
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:06,289
paper and that's it or it can be paper

66
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,980
that's treated with a coating and the

67
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:12,500
coating is sort of like a reflective

68
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:14,959
translucent material like that gets sort

69
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,769
of deposited onto it almost like an ink

70
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,949
but it doesn't have a color and you can

71
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:23,239
do one pass of that like or I should say

72
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:25,699
you can do like you know a certain

73
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,019
percentage covering of that or you can

74
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:31,069
do like a double coating of it and

75
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,280
depending on which of those you pick

76
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:36,739
uncoated a little bit of coding or a lot

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:41,090
of coating that's how you get uncoated

78
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:44,360
paper matte paper or glossy paper so

79
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,159
matte paper is not actually uncoated it

80
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,799
is coated it's just not coated with as

81
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,590
much glossy paper is coated with more

82
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,900
and when we say coated we actually mean

83
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,670
before the ink so it's literally the

84
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,090
paper stock when they made the paper

85
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:00,979
they put down that glossy material that

86
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,590
whatever you want to call it that's

87
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:06,099
substrate they put it down before the

88
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,719
ink ever got there so this first

89
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:11,090
reflectivity that you see as I'm sort of

90
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:14,299
tilting this the cover of this comic

91
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:16,189
that's matte and the way Matt works as

92
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,560
you can see the whole thing just kind of

93
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:21,379
uniformly gets more bright as you tilt

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,319
it and then it's sort of you can see it

95
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:27,110
doing there and it uniformly comes back

96
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:30,228
to - not bright as you tilt it forward

97
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,550
right and this corresponds like in the

98
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,500
game development world to more of a

99
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,360
diffuse surface right it sort of

100
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,389
reflects light evenly from all

101
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,150
directions to a certain extent not as

102
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:43,819
much as uncoated paper wood but it's

103
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:44,478
less specular right it's less like a

104
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:49,460
mirror

105
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:51,889
now glossy which is this right here is

106
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:54,019
more like a mirror and what you can see

107
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:57,110
is you can actually see the shape of the

108
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:59,718
light in it you see that and it doesn't

109
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,419
reflect as much light when it's just

110
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:04,158
being starting to tilt right so until it

111
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:08,718
actually reflects the whole light it

112
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:11,209
doesn't reflect much and again this is

113
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:13,759
because that highly reflective coating

114
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:14,899
we've like doubled probably I don't know

115
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,330
the exact numbers I'm not a paper

116
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:20,989
manufacture we've doubled the amount of

117
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:22,818
gloss that's in there right now these

118
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,908
are not the best examples of this

119
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:29,139
because they're actually this might

120
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:32,269
actually be even more gloss than that

121
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,650
and I want to talk about that right

122
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:35,568
after this but let me say a few more

123
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:36,978
things about matte and gloss but anyway

124
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,028
I just want to use those to illustrate

125
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:41,959
the difference between matte and gloss

126
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:43,728
the this may actually be gloss plus and

127
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:50,930
we'll talk about what that it is in a in

128
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:55,848
a second so when you're picking your

129
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:59,360
paper you have to decide which of those

130
00:05:55,848 --> 00:06:01,459
you want and you're gonna pick probably

131
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,020
different papers for the interior and

132
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:04,430
exterior of your book anyway and the

133
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:08,028
reason for that is typically the cover

134
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,709
is like thicker right it's a thicker

135
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:12,110
piece of paper because it takes more

136
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:14,508
wear and tear right

137
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,250
and so when you're picking you're

138
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:18,468
usually free it's usually not going to

139
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,269
cost you any more to pick a different

140
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:21,829
thing for your color as for the interior

141
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:24,019
of the book because you probably had to

142
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:25,699
do that already anyway it is obviously

143
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:27,019
probably a little cheaper if you could

144
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,939
just print everything on the same paper

145
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,500
stock because then you don't have to

146
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,729
have a separate pass to the press but

147
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,810
that's even that's not necessarily true

148
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:34,878
because it depends on how many you're

149
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,620
printing and so again all of those

150
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,660
things we're gonna get to in

151
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,160
after we finished talking about the

152
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,950
actual selection process we talked about

153
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,610
cost and shipping and stuff we'll get

154
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:48,379
into that a little more so what you need

155
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,000
to decide is for the interior of the

156
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,560
book what are you gonna have you're

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,180
gonna have matte paper you're gonna have

158
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,680
glossy paper and typically that's all

159
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,939
people really use I mean you couldn't go

160
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,230
more wild with it if you're making

161
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:59,810
something special but I'm a graphic

162
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,030
novel that's usually what they are matte

163
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,280
is probably the more common choice

164
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:06,709
because although it's less vibrant

165
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,809
because again it reflects a little more

166
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,728
light more uniformly which means that

167
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,728
you get a little duller effect of the

168
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:15,860
ink what it does do is it cuts down on

169
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:18,349
glare right so it's kind of like a matte

170
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,790
screen it's easier to use a matte screen

171
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,430
you know in the Sun because it's

172
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,590
reflecting less glare at you you know

173
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,560
what I mean if there's a bright light

174
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:31,250
nearby but on the other hand a glossy

175
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,750
cover it allows the inks to control more

176
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,839
of that reflection because you're not

177
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,720
washing it out unless you're right in a

178
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,219
reflection that's great except when

179
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,260
you're actually trying to read there

180
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,539
usually is a light there and now if it's

181
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,610
this mirror you're like accidentally

182
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:48,829
getting these big bright blotches right

183
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,270
so it can be actually worse for reading

184
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:52,129
because it creates this more narrow

185
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,560
mirror focus thing that can really

186
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,418
disrupt it just like a modern glossy

187
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,439
screen on the laptop sometimes we're

188
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:59,449
trying to use it and you're sitting

189
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,740
somewhere and there's just light behind

190
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:02,750
you you can't see anything there's a

191
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,160
giant glare right there you know and you

192
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,478
can't do anything about it without

193
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,110
tilting the screen like all the way

194
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:10,370
forward or something right so typically

195
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,770
you know people maybe pick a matte

196
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,810
finish on the interior but really the

197
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:18,349
main takeaway that I would give you for

198
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,759
this process is look at samples whatever

199
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,960
printer you pick they should have a

200
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,589
sample book or they should be able to

201
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,029
send you samples themselves and that

202
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,799
they've printed on their press with

203
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:30,679
their stock that they are going to be

204
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,839
using and you can feel it and see how it

205
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,908
looks that's what you want to do you

206
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,669
want to pick based on what you see and

207
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:39,708
feel don't just take my word for it or

208
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:40,728
guess or anything like that right so

209
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,259
when you're actually working with a

210
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,339
printer that should be trivial they

211
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:45,919
should have samples and you're going to

212
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,570
want samples from them anyway as we

213
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,969
talked about in the next section we're

214
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:54,780
gonna talk about picking a printer

215
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:57,580
okay so if you look at this last example

216
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:59,169
this is an example of something else

217
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,930
that can happen during the print process

218
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:05,889
now if you notice what happens here when

219
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:09,489
I tilt this ski journal you can see that

220
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:12,149
only part of the cover reflects right so

221
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:15,190
this part is dull and this part is shiny

222
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:17,769
that's because in addition to coating

223
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:20,920
the paper you can also coat the result

224
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:23,079
of the printing so the printer gets the

225
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:24,879
paper it's already been coated with a

226
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,860
certain amount of the glossy material

227
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,439
either a little bit in the case of matte

228
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,419
or a lot in the case of glossy but now

229
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,500
after you're done with the printing

230
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:37,539
process you can also choose to deposit

231
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,120
another layer of gloss over the top and

232
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:42,819
when you do that you can also choose

233
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,289
where you want that gloss so that's why

234
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,990
when I was here I was like I don't

235
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:49,659
really know this maybe double gloss

236
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,370
meaning it was glossy paper or I'm

237
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:53,889
cutting me a matte paper but then it was

238
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,779
glossed on top of the ink I don't know

239
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:58,870
because I don't really have a good

240
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:00,549
enough eye yet for it I bet a print pro

241
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,929
like someone who did a lot of printing

242
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:03,609
they would just know they'd be like oh

243
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:05,139
yeah that's gloss after or no that's

244
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,850
glass before or that's glossy paper with

245
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:11,470
glass after right they'd probably know

246
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:13,629
right so anyway that is the paper

247
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,750
picking process and the part that I

248
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:18,519
can't really communicate to you online

249
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,440
is there's a second parameter in

250
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,730
addition to matte or glossy for the

251
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,040
interior of the book that you need to

252
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:28,120
pick and that's the weight of the paper

253
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:30,969
now 80-pound I think you know is a

254
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,909
pretty standard weight they're measured

255
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,820
in pounds so 80 pound paper is a pretty

256
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:41,529
standard weight for like a graphic novel

257
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,420
but it varies so again this is where you

258
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:45,970
want to actually get samples from your

259
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:47,649
printer and actually play with them feel

260
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,779
what it's like see what it's like to

261
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,669
turn a page is it too thick is it too

262
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:55,629
thin is it too stiff to turn is it too

263
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:57,429
floppy right and so the weight of the

264
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:59,588
paper will affect all those things it'll

265
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:01,539
affect the feel of it it will affect how

266
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:02,290
hard it is to turn the page it'll affect

267
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:05,559
how thick the

268
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:07,719
book is even right so you need to kind

269
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,549
of get a handle on that as well and

270
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,589
that's mostly feel because like I said

271
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:15,269
you're probably not gonna go super high

272
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:18,040
on the pound on the on the paper pound

273
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:19,899
for the entry of the book anyway but you

274
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,759
know you've got some choices so that's

275
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:24,120
again something that you want to play

276
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,120
around with
