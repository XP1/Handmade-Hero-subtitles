00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,189
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,539
here are the show recode a complete game

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:12,960
live on stream what times it's 507 so

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:16,019
we'll go to about 607 I think is what we

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,300
will do today on handmade hero we are

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:20,850
going to implement some entity browsing

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,929
stuff that I wanted to do yesterday but

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,630
we well how can I say it we we hit a

9
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:31,230
quote-unquote bug in the in the

10
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:32,939
rendering stuff that took us like

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,920
seriously like 40 minutes to figure out

12
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:36,839
and in the end it turned out it was not

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,460
a bug it turned out it was like actually

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,110
the way the render was supposed to work

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,920
and I had forgotten

16
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:49,558
so that was yeah that was that was just

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:52,829
a little bit of a little bit of a old

18
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,000
neurons you know but I mean the good

19
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,020
news is meeting that to fix the bug

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,219
because it wasn't there and so that

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,160
takes a little bit effort oh my I

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,400
suppose always good point being here on

23
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,840
day 205 we are going to go ahead and try

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,060
to actually now implement the thing that

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,810
I said we're gonna implement yesterday

26
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,920
now that we have the bug the bug gone if

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,780
you would like to follow along at home

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,549
you can always pre-order the game on

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,290
Hammacher org it comes with the source

30
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,030
code so if you would like to follow

31
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,810
along with what I'm about to do you can

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,409
unpack day 204 's source code into a

33
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:32,909
directory and follow right along with me

34
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:36,960
if you so desire my friend so let's see

35
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,990
here like I you know like I said when we

36
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,699
ended we had it working fine the thing

37
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:43,890
that I had that the part that we thought

38
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,240
was broken so obviously it wasn't so

39
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,409
broken after all although there were

40
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,438
some things that we would have liked to

41
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,409
have cleaned up as well but anyway point

42
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,419
being what we were trying to do as you

43
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,009
can sort of see here we got this debug

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,239
thing what we were trying to do is we

45
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,228
want to be able to like pick one of

46
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,699
these entities you got a little

47
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:01,798
dismembered tourists over here and our

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,240
floating head and we've got the hero and

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,009
we've got these trees and stuff like

50
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,228
that we have our little yellow floating

51
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,030
obelisk thing and all of those things

52
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:10,830
are actually entities that have

53
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,000
properties and stuff on them and I just

54
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,680
wanted a way to kind of like

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,389
what the properties were right pretty

56
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,629
pretty basic thing we might want to do

57
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:21,250
to support our game and so if we want to

58
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,750
do something like that I was like well

59
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,430
I'd like to just be able to pick them

60
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,539
with the mouse so that I can just

61
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,210
quickly like you know I don't have to

62
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:29,979
think I can just move the mouse and hope

63
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,300
you know move it over some entity and

64
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:31,750
click or whatever and that would just

65
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,520
give me

66
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,729
you knows make it really free and easy

67
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,290
to inspect those things and so what we

68
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:40,379
wanted to do was first of all figure out

69
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:44,469
a way to check whether the mouse was

70
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,359
intersecting an entity and as I said in

71
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:49,150
order to do that since the game goes

72
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,040
through a projection of 3d projection we

73
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,739
have to basically take the mouse and

74
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,139
unprojected back into that world and so

75
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,360
we did that like I said on yesterday's

76
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:00,309
dream we did that and so now you can

77
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,110
kind of see as I move the mouse around

78
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,930
we've got this cursor that's like

79
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,530
matching the location and so that's a

80
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,360
start

81
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,590
that's what I was trying to do the rest

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,030
of it should actually be pretty easy

83
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,500
from there that actually should have

84
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,090
been easy as well and would have been

85
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:19,060
easy had we not had our little amusing

86
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,420
run-in with previous render decisions so

87
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,949
anyway what we want to do now is open

88
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:26,798
this back up to the way that it was

89
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:29,169
working before and sort of get back to

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,239
get back to doing something to doing

91
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:32,919
something reasonable here so we've got

92
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,140
this thing where we do this push rect

93
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,639
outline and so if I restore this code

94
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,159
like I said if I take the IFS out of it

95
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,039
and have it run over all the entities we

96
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,060
should be able to get back to a position

97
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,069
where I'm sorry to get back to a

98
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,620
situation where we're outlining all of

99
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,359
the entities themselves right and so

100
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,289
let's just undo so that we were kind of

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,200
playing around this code trying to

102
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:54,548
figure out what had gone wrong and so I

103
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,469
kind of got to undo some of those

104
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:59,620
changes here here we have a push rect

105
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:01,870
outline call right where we're trying to

106
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,579
to draw the outline stuff and remember

107
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,530
we had done this thing where we check

108
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:07,480
the offset peeing the scale and we reset

109
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,879
them we're not going to want to do that

110
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,409
anymore right so we're gonna want to

111
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,419
leave the render group with what it was

112
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:16,719
previously so that we can get all of

113
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:18,409
those outlines back to to lining up with

114
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,120
the oh and you know what

115
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,790
I got a I got a not change it anywhere

116
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,970
right you can against all of this stuff

117
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,430
would would change that that offset so

118
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,680
if I get rid of all of those touching

119
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,389
the the render state we can now kind of

120
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,879
see that we've got all of the entities

121
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:37,039
have their little sort of their bounding

122
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,980
air their collision rectangle basically

123
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,330
is being drawn on them right and so

124
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,430
that's the first thing that we wanted to

125
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:46,579
do before we had done it yesterday so we

126
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,319
know that that's fine and so now what we

127
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:50,329
have to do is kind of figure out how to

128
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,439
get the like I said the mouse into

129
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:54,469
something that's a little bit more

130
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,279
reasonable and again now we know that

131
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:00,890
the Z itself is not getting used at all

132
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:03,169
that's a that's kind of an amusing thing

133
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,750
the Z offset doesn't actually do

134
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,879
anything so if I want to actually do any

135
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,350
debug viewing here I have to kind of

136
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,370
think a little bit outside the box of

137
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,320
how we're going to do it which is one of

138
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,540
the reasons I was saying I feel like we

139
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,459
kind of want to make the renderer work

140
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,910
in maybe some way that's a little bit

141
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:21,859
more logical than how we're doing it I

142
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,140
guess it makes some sense I understand

143
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,879
why we did it the way we did it but it

144
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,110
does make certain things kind of a

145
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,170
little bit difficult when you consider

146
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,490
the ramifications of it but anyway you

147
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,410
know we've got the mouse here a

148
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,780
transforming Demeter's mouse and we've

149
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,030
got the unprojected that's happening

150
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:41,149
like i said that that sort of brings it

151
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:42,619
back into the real world there and what

152
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:45,739
we need to do now is we need to start

153
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,860
unprojected the mouse into the

154
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,360
effectively into the plane of the of the

155
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,879
thing that we're actually working with

156
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,210
right and we've kind of forgot this

157
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,639
nasty this nasty part of it where when

158
00:05:56,209 --> 00:06:01,099
we do that on projection right we sort

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,649
of have this problem where distance

160
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,300
above target is not actually being taken

161
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:08,329
into account during that on projection

162
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,060
right so we don't actually know since

163
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:13,189
the the Z values in the world

164
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,439
we don't actually necessarily get back a

165
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:17,418
real Z value in the world when we do

166
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,800
that on project because of that distance

167
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,289
above target and that was sort of the

168
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,000
thing that I was saying was a little bit

169
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,010
strange right that was that was part of

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,009
it that was a little bit weird and if we

171
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:31,468
go back over to the code in

172
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,770
render group code right where we do that

173
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:33,769
unprojected

174
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:40,860
that the wait look sort of the reason we

175
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,838
were doing it this way is all we were

176
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,119
using it for was to figure out at a

177
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:48,209
certain distance from the camera how big

178
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:49,770
would the camera balance be and that's

179
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:52,138
totally reasonable that we were doing it

180
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:55,649
that way at the time but it creates some

181
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,848
problems for us in the in the long run

182
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,860
to have it that way because other things

183
00:06:56,848 --> 00:07:01,139
we won't want to do are not exactly

184
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,689
reversed transforms right they're not

185
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,658
exactly going to be reversed in that way

186
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,729
and so now we have a sort of a

187
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:13,288
fundamental question here which is to

188
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:14,699
say that we need some way of we probably

189
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:15,838
want to do something that's going to

190
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,338
take those into account but we still

191
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:19,468
want some way of calling this old code

192
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:20,999
we could test this old code and make it

193
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:23,490
work with the new thing but I think I'm

194
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:24,719
gonna do just like I'm gonna do

195
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,759
something here just just to just to

196
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:29,908
shunt it where we call um project old

197
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,649
and I'm gonna make it unprotect here to

198
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,808
get that we could get working which

199
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:36,300
would which would literally do the exact

200
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:37,830
reversal of the transform right and so I

201
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,959
kind of want to make you know I want to

202
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:41,490
kind of get this thing into shape so

203
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,228
that we know that we could just push

204
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,309
something through it and it would

205
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:49,408
actually unprojected properly right that

206
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:51,120
seems like a little bit more of a good

207
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:55,588
idea to me that's more that's more what

208
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,699
I would like to see happen although you

209
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:58,439
know the other thing that that's

210
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,509
important to remember here too is we've

211
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,209
got kind of a wonky situation which is

212
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:06,088
we've pushed we sort of have this offset

213
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:08,759
P and the scale that are being used for

214
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:10,918
for everything in the world when we send

215
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,709
them down and it's kind of a little bit

216
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:16,139
odd to with that because it's like you

217
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:18,778
know do we want a way to do unprojected

218
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,309
that don't take those into account and a

219
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:23,158
way to do on projections that do take

220
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:25,110
them into account right and and other

221
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:27,569
stuff like this so it is also still a

222
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,769
little bit bizarre but point being what

223
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:31,289
I'm gonna do for now is I'm just gonna

224
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:33,810
like I'm just going to put this part I'm

225
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:37,500
gonna keep this part a little bit off

226
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:40,379
what I'm gonna keep this part off for a

227
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:46,350
second and then I'm gonna implement this

228
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:47,879
function right okay so this is

229
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,839
unprojected at the moment

230
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:53,820
oops and I'm gonna do it this way and

231
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,290
then we're gonna sort of work this until

232
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,700
it's out to something that I would

233
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:58,949
consider a little more reasonable a

234
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,629
little less janky so there's us doing

235
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,180
the projection the projection ton

236
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:04,500
projected the mouse right and it's

237
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:06,929
locked to the mouse which is what we

238
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,460
would expect and so now what we want to

239
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:11,939
do is we want to start getting this

240
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:15,330
stuff back you know we kind of want to

241
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,640
get this stuff a little bit more want to

242
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,110
get the stuff baked in so I want to do

243
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,210
this completely unproductive thing and

244
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,940
what I want to do in complete on project

245
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:27,629
will we'll make this via not implemented

246
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,279
for the moment but what I want to do and

247
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:31,110
complete on project is I want to take

248
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,730
care of all this stuff so you can see

249
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,320
here we've got the meters to pixels

250
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,159
transform that should actually be

251
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,260
happening in here right so when we do

252
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,579
this on project and we'll just call this

253
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:43,460
right this is the actual thing that I

254
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,050
wanted for unprojected

255
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:49,290
so when we do this on project we'll just

256
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:53,149
say you know I've got a sort of a screen

257
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:55,649
space point right a screen space point

258
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:58,799
and that's like good to be in pixels

259
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:01,588
right and and I guess you know the thing

260
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:06,120
I could do too is like pixels XY and our

261
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:08,190
32 you know Z like this is Z meters

262
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,980
because we never really transform meters

263
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,990
we never transform the Z into meters or

264
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,990
we never think of the Z as being in any

265
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,310
other space when we do that transform so

266
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,080
it might make sense to leave those out

267
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:21,059
and document them this way so that you

268
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,600
can clearly see what we're talking about

269
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:25,889
right in there and so if I do something

270
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,889
like that then assuming we're not in

271
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:30,059
orthographic transfer mode the first

272
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:32,278
thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take

273
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,109
whatever that that pixels XY is right

274
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:37,528
I'm going to subtract the screen Center

275
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,750
from it and because that would be what

276
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:41,700
we would be doing with the pixels XY I'm

277
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,370
gonna subtract that screen Center from

278
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,970
it and then I'm going to multiply it by

279
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,830
the meters to pixels transform right

280
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,050
the inverse of it so that I can get it

281
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,790
out of pixels and intimate errs then

282
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:54,439
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use

283
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:56,419
the distance from Target I'm gonna

284
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,820
subtract the PZ right so I'm gonna do

285
00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:01,819
essentially this the Z meters thing here

286
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,920
right I'm gonna go ahead and do that do

287
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,810
the reverse of that so that you no

288
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,219
longer before remember we were doing

289
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:09,679
this kind of crazy thing where we would

290
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,420
change the the offsets and stuff in here

291
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,309
right we would do this render group

292
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:14,659
transfrom just above target - local Z we

293
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:16,759
do that nonsense we're not gonna do that

294
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:18,709
anymore right so we're passing that

295
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,360
result down we do that subtraction we

296
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,790
divide by the focal length and then we

297
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,259
multiply that that basically gives us

298
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:26,929
whatever that the scaling factor would

299
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:29,149
be to put the the temporary thing that

300
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:31,939
we computed into the correct space and

301
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:33,500
now my goal here right is to sort of fix

302
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,730
this and make this now so that this

303
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,769
actually works properly we can always

304
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,080
just call it so at the end of this no

305
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:40,970
matter what we always are gonna do sort

306
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,830
of the transform and scale thing I'm

307
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,750
gonna take a quick look up at render

308
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,120
group and see what I don't really

309
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:51,230
remember what would happen with scale if

310
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,169
we even used it exactly you can see in

311
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:57,529
here right there's a transform and we

312
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:59,179
have transform scale but but transform

313
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:00,740
scale doesn't do anything so we never

314
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:02,299
actually use that in our projection so

315
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,820
for now I think we should probably just

316
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:06,529
not do anything with it now you can kind

317
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,770
of see what happens here right when we

318
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:11,839
come out with a 2d value which is what

319
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:14,419
we get here we're then gonna take

320
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,970
whatever that 2d value is we're gonna

321
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:18,349
assume that it's at this distance right

322
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,000
because that's we know that it's

323
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,440
actually at that distance that's the

324
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,460
distance they're telling us the point is

325
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,310
in the from the camera right and so the

326
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,960
actual P the actual you know position

327
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:33,469
for that guy

328
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,120
is actually going to be if the v3 which

329
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,830
is going to be and I and this should not

330
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,029
be in here right this is like

331
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:42,400
unprojected or something something like

332
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:45,709
that

333
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,990
when we compute that unprojected XY we

334
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,540
then know that the unprojected XY if we

335
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,509
just staple that Z on to it right that's

336
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:57,319
the distance from the camera and so in

337
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:59,179
here right we should be able to you know

338
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,920
determine that that actually would have

339
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,528
been the z

340
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:05,049
came in and I think that's correct right

341
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:07,838
because you can see distance to P Z this

342
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:11,319
is Z with P Z distance above target

343
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,510
minus P Z right and so whatever the

344
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,889
actual Z is that you tell us is actually

345
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,350
just gonna pass straight through I

346
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:19,839
believe because we don't we don't

347
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,490
transform like Z doesn't get modified in

348
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,589
any way so if you tell me this is how

349
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,629
far it was away from the camera that's

350
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:28,870
just how it far what the way it was from

351
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:32,649
the camera like . so i think that's

352
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,570
really all there is to it but at the end

353
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:37,240
so at the beginning of this function

354
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:39,519
right we added the offset whatever the

355
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,690
offset for the transform was and so at

356
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,370
the end of this when we have to subtract

357
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,320
that offset if we want to fully undo the

358
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,028
transform that was happening with the

359
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,490
you know with the get rendering entity

360
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:50,528
basis right and so that's that's all

361
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,778
that's happening there so then if i

362
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:53,889
return that result again we have to kind

363
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:55,990
of go through this step do this to make

364
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,889
sure we're doing everything just so but

365
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,560
that should give us the fully

366
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:02,049
unprotected thing no matter like

367
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:04,739
basically what the circumstance was in

368
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:09,458
terms of how it was was being handled

369
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,799
okay so that means in you know whatever

370
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:13,869
the actual pixel value of the thing is

371
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,009
now i shouldn't actually have to do any

372
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,948
of this stuff like i shouldn't have to

373
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:19,990
do meters Mouse right so i should be

374
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:21,729
able to just pass the mouse p now

375
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,070
there's a little bit of a weirdness here

376
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:27,100
which is that the mouse key comes in it

377
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,649
doesn't come in in pixels actually which

378
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,990
is a little bit strange and so I feel

379
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:32,889
like that may be like our output

380
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,459
coordinate system and our input

381
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:38,860
coordinate system maybe should be the

382
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:41,259
same so if you look at like Mouse X

383
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,870
Mouse why we do this global back buffer

384
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:47,679
width thing right we do we do this stuff

385
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:50,019
here and I do kind of think that maybe

386
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,509
that's not the way we should do it right

387
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,669
it may be that the better way to do it

388
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:58,778
would be to specify the X in pixels

389
00:14:54,669 --> 00:15:02,708
right and then specify the mouse Y as

390
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:04,149
being something you can shoot me and in

391
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:07,479
fact you know what I could do to here

392
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:09,080
save this just for one one second stick

393
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,730
that in there

394
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,600
just for future reference I will talk

395
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,490
about that in a second

396
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,320
so the mouse X would just be like in

397
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,389
pixels right it'd be there's the PX and

398
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,860
the mouse Y would be in pixels as well

399
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:25,909
so it would be like whatever the back

400
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:29,070
buffer height is - that that Mouse py

401
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:30,990
right because it still we still want it

402
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,270
going in the right direction because

403
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:37,009
that's the way the pixel values are

404
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:41,220
going right and and so yeah off you go

405
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:42,539
so that's that's kind of the idea right

406
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:47,240
that's what we're trying to accomplish

407
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:49,949
there and in this case if you imagine

408
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,440
the way this works we want to be able to

409
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,209
get to zero and you can never be on that

410
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,709
last pixel so I think technically we're

411
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:59,069
looking at something more like this

412
00:15:55,708 --> 00:16:01,349
right where you can only ever get to

413
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,839
like height minus one as moving the

414
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,060
mouse because there's only height pixels

415
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,980
and the first one zero so that would be

416
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:10,829
a more correct way of you know of

417
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,009
stating it yeah I'm saying

418
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,028
so anyway oops I know I just did that

419
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:18,240
that was not what I wanted to talk about

420
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:19,889
yet so anyway when we do this on

421
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,180
projection now we're passing things and

422
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,159
pick subordinates so now we can really

423
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:26,129
read we can actually legitimately just

424
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:29,990
undo the transform for reals which is

425
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:32,070
nice and so yes so now we just have to

426
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:35,220
actually debug that and make sure the

427
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,810
fat works properly and again we kind of

428
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,690
have to do we still have to do this

429
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:41,299
nonsense because and in fact now this is

430
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,830
a v3 so we should be able to do

431
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,750
literally this where we just pass them

432
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,950
at the world feedback as the thing we're

433
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,049
doing is the transform and it should

434
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,339
just work right so that's the thing that

435
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:54,449
we want to work now that's the thing

436
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:55,920
that we want to behave properly I gotta

437
00:16:54,450 --> 00:17:01,490
get the transform out of the group here

438
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:04,490
so this is actually let's see render

439
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,490
transform

440
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:16,310
and let's take a look here okay and what

441
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,890
is the problem transform offset P and

442
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:21,859
results

443
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:27,290
what is transform offset P render

444
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:32,599
transform offset P do we just not have a

445
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:34,940
- equals I guess we don't that's a bit

446
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:42,559
weird if we really did we really never

447
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:44,750
type in a - equals well fancy that so we

448
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,970
did a plus equals for everybody but no

449
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:51,700
minus equals and that seems kind of dumb

450
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:56,600
to be honest so I feel like that's just

451
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:59,410
something we should rectify right seems

452
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:59,409
reasonable

453
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:08,960
alright and that should probably go

454
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:11,089
below this thing as it will tell me

455
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,740
since I can't reference heaven forfend

456
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:15,559
you should be able to call something

457
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,539
that was below you in the file you know

458
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:22,159
how would you ever implement that

459
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:23,809
feature okay so let's see when we do

460
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,900
unprotect old now we want to change this

461
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:30,019
to doing regular unprotect and that's

462
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,850
good we want the offset P to be the

463
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:35,059
world mouse here and now we want to do

464
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:38,329
the full transform randomness we've got

465
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:41,419
our unpredicted XY potential initialize

466
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:43,369
local variable used you are correct we

467
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,529
don't actually do it here I'll do I

468
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:47,089
guess I'll do a little thing just for

469
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:51,259
you it kind of stubs it out there just

470
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:53,449
to make sure but off we go okay so now

471
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:56,990
we have to do our only goal now is to

472
00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:01,730
basically get our little get that that

473
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:03,559
little blue square back right that's all

474
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,539
we're trying to do and so I'm gonna go

475
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,700
ahead and step through here and see how

476
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:11,289
we're doing alright so the first things

477
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,289
first our mouse be

478
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,450
should be in pixels now and that does

479
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,919
look pixel II right so it shouldn't be

480
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,870
negative when it's up in the quadrant

481
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,610
right like if I'm if I'm up here this

482
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,649
would have been negative X before it

483
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:25,509
should just be always positive right

484
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,060
like we should never get negative values

485
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:30,730
for the most part in there and it's not

486
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:33,039
so that's good so here we go with our

487
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:36,309
unprojected come in here to our

488
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,259
unprojected the graphic transform so

489
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:41,500
let's take a look at what comes in

490
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:43,750
there's the X Y there's the Z and meters

491
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,059
that's what what I want I've got the

492
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:50,740
transform screen Center here screen

493
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:53,200
Center and that's exactly what I would

494
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,390
expect so let's go ahead and do our

495
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:01,330
transform where we transfer the pixels X

496
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:08,320
Y basically into meters so let's see

497
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:11,409
what that got that is oh well that

498
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,750
should be a device and it's not so

499
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,640
that's you know that's one of those

500
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,069
things that you probably don't want to

501
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,390
do alright let's take a look at where

502
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,399
that's at

503
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,550
alright still got nothing on the screen

504
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,890
though so we've still got a ways to go

505
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:30,220
let's go back in there and see about our

506
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:33,700
meters that is much more like it that's

507
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,769
a certainly much more reasonable value

508
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,539
to have and so now we take this as a

509
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:40,750
target so this is basically just going

510
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:43,599
to be evaluate to 1 right well negative

511
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,519
1 and then we've got the the transform

512
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,909
focal length so it's gonna be like you

513
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:51,099
know negative some small value right so

514
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:57,850
what's the unprojected see here

515
00:20:51,099 --> 00:21:00,339
unprojected y so that's where it is or

516
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:03,189
believes it to be in meters which is a

517
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:05,679
totally reasonable value and the the

518
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,150
transform offset P should actually be 0

519
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,570
at this point so it should not actually

520
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,910
be relevant and it isn't ok so that's

521
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:16,000
what we wanted there and now we set the

522
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,620
offset P to be equal to the the world

523
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,319
mouse that this is the actual location

524
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:26,288
right and so let's go ahead in here now

525
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:29,269
I guess now I think about it

526
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:30,888
well well let's actually go into push

527
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:32,179
rect and actually see I'm gonna say I

528
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:33,648
think we have might have one slight

529
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:39,379
thing wrong there but that's kind of a

530
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:42,168
separation ooh no I did not want to step

531
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:45,859
into the security stack check but thank

532
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:47,960
you all right and so we're gonna go

533
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:50,538
ahead and compute the P here

534
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,980
so essentially yeah like know nothing

535
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:54,589
other than base they are dimensional

536
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,669
offset so that's all totally fine

537
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:58,970
and exactly what you would expect

538
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:00,649
although I do note well we'll talk about

539
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,960
that a second I'll go in to get render

540
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:05,859
an entity basis and now we can kind of

541
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,940
see what what our original P is right

542
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:10,939
there's the value that we're looking to

543
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,288
get and our transform offset P well

544
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,369
we've got it right there there it is

545
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:18,378
right and so what we should have is a

546
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:28,058
p-value that's mostly made up of that

547
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:38,778
right thus we made up of that value yeah

548
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:44,388
although although I am a little curious

549
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:49,148
I do have one slight confusing thing to

550
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:49,148
say there which is that

551
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:57,909
this is a little weird how we did this

552
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:08,000
quick me if I'm wrong but if you look at

553
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:13,460
how we were doing this here when we do

554
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:18,740
our offset right in our dimensions when

555
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:26,778
we pass those in it is a little bit

556
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:28,339
strange that this offset is not well all

557
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:29,808
right you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna

558
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:32,298
table that let's say it's a little bit

559
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:35,089
strange the way we do it because one of

560
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:37,460
these would be scaled and the other one

561
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:38,599
wouldn't be it it's it's not worth I

562
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,600
guess I don't know it's not worth

563
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:44,178
fussing over anyway

564
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,408
so when we come through here the office

565
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:47,330
of Z is this thing that's never gets

566
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:49,159
used we get deleted that because we

567
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:50,898
decided we didn't want Z offsets to to

568
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,789
matter at all so that's why I'm sorry

569
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:54,500
just as above target is 9 like we

570
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:57,710
thought it was going to be so the

571
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,538
distance to PZ negative 1 so that's

572
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,340
basically so that's our problem there

573
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,750
right you can see what's going to happen

574
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:05,058
the new your clip plane check is going

575
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:10,009
to force that out so we're messing up

576
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:12,319
this Z the Z computation that we that we

577
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:15,919
sort of back compute and I suspect

578
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:19,730
although I am not really 100% sure I

579
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,590
suspect that that is because we were

580
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,000
just a little sloppy when we quickly

581
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:29,298
kind of did that routine so let's take a

582
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:32,769
look at get render entity basis P ok so

583
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:37,038
yes so the Z value in this case is

584
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:39,259
literally just going to be like look the

585
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:43,339
Z that that you actually specify that

586
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:45,379
you put that you pass in right that's

587
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,970
going to if that's supposed to be the

588
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,880
distance from the target if I supposed

589
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:55,069
to be the distance from the camera then

590
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:57,730
I guess I guess that would literally

591
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,730
just

592
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:06,509
like I'm trying to think of of what this

593
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,970
the meaning is here I want to make sure

594
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:10,769
we get the meaning correct so that if

595
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,839
it's actually this routine that should

596
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:15,569
be modified in that the other one so I

597
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,459
just want to kind of go and and actually

598
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:24,480
specify this a little bit more directly

599
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:26,400
right so the way that we've got this set

600
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,329
up at the moment we're sort of saying

601
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,670
that we have a camera that's looking

602
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:32,639
down on things right and we specified

603
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:37,529
distance to target right this is

604
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:41,670
distance to target that makes sense

605
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:44,759
so then we've got Z the the actual value

606
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,850
that's getting passed in is here that's

607
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:53,910
that's the point we're trying to draw at

608
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:56,869
right and that is like that value is how

609
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,860
far off of the target plane you are

610
00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:01,859
right because I mean look at the way

611
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:06,479
that that's being interpreted right so

612
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:10,199
if P Z is positive right that means

613
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,690
you're coming up and if P Z is negative

614
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,130
that means you're coming down because

615
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,070
you can see I'm taking distance of our

616
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:22,290
target and I'm moving Z distance away

617
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:24,269
from that right so if you tell me that

618
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:27,059
you are that your Z value that you're

619
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:29,430
passing in is like 10 for the

620
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:31,619
unprojected was if what we're trying to

621
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,750
say is it's tansy and screen-space like

622
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:37,489
you're 10 away this way in screen space

623
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:40,740
that's how far you were you know that

624
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:43,319
we're not inverting that at all by the

625
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,620
way that we did our unprojected the

626
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:49,679
question is what do we want this Z to me

627
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:51,629
because we're passing in a Z but what do

628
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,640
we want it to mean do we wanted me to

629
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:58,080
mean a world Spacey or do we want to

630
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,150
mean a screen space Z right and it feels

631
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:02,819
kind of like we don't want to do any

632
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,890
inversion at all on that right it feels

633
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:07,470
kind of like since we're always

634
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,930
specifying Z there's no there's no

635
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,089
actual world space Z in that sense

636
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:15,808
there's only a camera relative Z

637
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:18,500
relative to the targets not the camera

638
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:31,440
that Z just gets passed through directly

639
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:33,179
right so like this value yeah that value

640
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,210
would just get passed through directly I

641
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:40,500
think I mean isn't that what we want it

642
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,970
to be I don't know it's hard to say I

643
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,519
feel like that's the right thing because

644
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:46,169
if we're talking about Oh where's the

645
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,740
mouse well the mouse is on the sort of

646
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:51,299
on the plane right on that target plane

647
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,980
we'd pass in that Z value we pass them

648
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:55,679
to Z valve zero right and we'd want it

649
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:59,250
to be here so I feel like what this is

650
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:02,730
this is like Z meters from Target plane

651
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:05,849
or something like that that's what that

652
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:07,349
actually means and so yeah when we do

653
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:10,558
the result presumably that just gets

654
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:11,908
added in there and like it would just be

655
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:17,519
something like you know something like

656
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:21,000
zero so yeah so I feel like that's what

657
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,369
we want and so we can't have a distance

658
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,659
of 10 like that's what we were asking it

659
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,398
we were asking it to tell us where the

660
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,600
thing was this is a 10 it will solve it

661
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:29,759
but then it will immediately clip

662
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,769
against the plane so the fact that we

663
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,690
were passing 10 men that would never

664
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:36,148
actually work like this local Z of 10

665
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,038
will never work so like three could work

666
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:41,819
and we should be able to get that

667
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:45,058
working just fine but 10 is never going

668
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:46,798
to write and so hey yeah that that was

669
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:50,069
the only problem there right because

670
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:52,349
there you can see it it's locked on so

671
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:55,019
that's a more sane unprotect map to me

672
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:56,398
because at least now all you do is you

673
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:59,668
actually are you're actually

674
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,959
unproductive pixels for reals it's still

675
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,038
not great there's still some janki's in

676
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,519
there again this is because of the two

677
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:06,629
and a half D nature of things and since

678
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,490
this is the first time I've ever done 2

679
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,770
and 1/2 T normally I'm full 3d I'm not

680
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:13,230
used to thinking of I'm not used to

681
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:15,148
knowing what the right way to like wrap

682
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,250
everything up is and so I suspect after

683
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:19,979
handmade hero or sometime in the middle

684
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,960
of a meteor in fact we may have develop

685
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,659
a strong opinion about how these

686
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,180
parameters should be specified that

687
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:26,530
minimizes the chance

688
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,519
that you make a stupid mistake like we

689
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:33,809
did yesterday for example but yeah so

690
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:37,960
now that that's actually known and

691
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:40,750
that's correct I feel like we should be

692
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,019
able to maybe get a little harder quark

693
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:47,019
here and say okay so now if we wanted to

694
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:48,639
unprotect the same if we want to do a

695
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,329
full-on project which is what we're

696
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,730
doing here

697
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:55,299
we shouldn't have to pass anything other

698
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:58,059
than just like okay if the mouse P were

699
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:59,829
at the plane of this entity which we

700
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:01,629
don't need to add any of this because

701
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:03,039
it's just whatever the volume offset is

702
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,060
because the the transforms already set

703
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:10,509
to that so if we just did that right

704
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:15,339
where we just like that's the offset the

705
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:20,920
total differential offset right if we do

706
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:23,019
that on project and then we do yeah we

707
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,690
do that on project we should be able to

708
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:28,990
get back whatever the correct local

709
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:30,519
coordinate is I think right and you know

710
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,960
I probably spoke a little too soon I

711
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,170
probably should still leave this in

712
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:38,079
there so we can debug this code with a

713
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:40,090
single entity right like just do and the

714
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,769
index equals 10 like we did before

715
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:44,319
just so we can just see it happen once

716
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:46,539
right so we just do this on project now

717
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,490
we say where is the mouse you know if it

718
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:50,230
were out this plane we then go ahead and

719
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:53,769
push a rectangle that shows the local

720
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:56,620
mass P relative relatively speaking and

721
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:58,059
in order to do that again we have to the

722
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:59,799
problem with this and this is the kind

723
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,240
of thing that I'm saying it I feel like

724
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:03,819
we need some way in the renderer to do

725
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,650
this a little smarter but we want to be

726
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:08,019
able to render this and we need to be

727
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,960
able to render it at a particular offset

728
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:13,480
there fortunately we now we can just say

729
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,650
it could be at zero because we're going

730
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,019
to render it in the same coordinate

731
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,880
system that we're already in and we just

732
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:20,889
want just to use that local offset that

733
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,260
we computed so in theory that would

734
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:28,900
probably be fine let's see if it

735
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:31,529
actually is fine here we go and I guess

736
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,530
when we unprojected

737
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:39,288
yeah I think that's probably

738
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:39,288
I think that's probably reasonable I

739
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,880
wonder when we do our unprojected let's

740
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,069
think one let's let's let's think one

741
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,730
more thing about our unprojected just

742
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:52,619
want to see if this works but I want to

743
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,690
do I want to do one more thing with the

744
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:58,918
unprojected I was just thinking of so

745
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:01,740
let's do that a second here alright so

746
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:05,190
let's see so there's our unprojected

747
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:07,169
thing and it's a little bit off you can

748
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,980
see that the scale is is a little bit

749
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:12,240
off it's not quite right for the mouse

750
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,038
but it's pretty close and we're pretty

751
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,649
close to being correct for that back

752
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:21,599
projection so we're close but not quite

753
00:32:18,648 --> 00:32:24,778
so let's try this is the part that I

754
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,859
think is gonna be a little bit wonky and

755
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:27,628
why I said we should talk about this a

756
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:34,288
little more so I think probably what we

757
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:37,980
would like to have happen right is we

758
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:45,690
would like to be able to render directly

759
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:49,250
with that unprojected think of what to

760
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,250
do here how to do this exactly

761
00:32:55,838 --> 00:33:00,019
well so here's one thing I will do first

762
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:05,538
I'm just gonna see

763
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:08,088
so suppose we specify as the as the

764
00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:08,749
unproductive suppose we specified just

765
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:12,138
nothing

766
00:33:08,749 --> 00:33:18,889
so we're it's not going to be if we were

767
00:33:12,138 --> 00:33:31,278
to just specify nothing this is the part

768
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:33,048
I wanted to check out so yeah yeah so

769
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,028
this is the part that's a little weird

770
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:38,028
this is the part that's a little weird

771
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:40,069
if we were to if we're gonna use the Z

772
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:42,469
meters from Target plane as a direct

773
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:44,658
pass-through then we also have this

774
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:47,239
other kind of nasty problem which is

775
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:51,830
that the math doesn't exactly work out

776
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:55,579
correctly on like the math doesn't

777
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:58,069
actually work out correctly to reverse

778
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:59,598
it because everything with the XY does

779
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:02,298
happen in reverse order like it should

780
00:33:59,598 --> 00:34:03,950
but since this is not the actual value

781
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:06,950
that would have come out of the

782
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:09,889
projection for this got for the you know

783
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:12,679
the entities let's say then we don't

784
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,389
actually know like what we would we

785
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:17,450
don't actually get in the Z value here

786
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:20,419
that should actually be used for this

787
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:26,088
part now we know what it is right we

788
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:27,798
know what it actually is but I just

789
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:29,960
wonder if maybe we shouldn't sort of

790
00:34:27,798 --> 00:34:31,699
again think about changing that meaning

791
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,480
to make it a little bit more consistent

792
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:37,908
like just to say oh you know I want

793
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,219
these to be much you know more logically

794
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,710
invertible and so if you were to say

795
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:45,168
pixels XY and like some kind of a notion

796
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,000
of a screen space Z but you often would

797
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:48,648
have an in a real 3d set scenario

798
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
because you do a full 3d transform so

799
00:34:48,648 --> 00:34:52,338
you know what the Z is relative to the

800
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,418
camera and then in here you know when

801
00:34:52,338 --> 00:34:55,219
you want to talk about doing the

802
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:56,778
unprotect you would talk about doing

803
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,489
unprotected with a screen space z

804
00:34:56,778 --> 00:35:00,230
coordinate so you'd have to figure out

805
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:02,358
how far the entity was like from the

806
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,269
camera or whatever in order to do that

807
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:06,809
now it's it just seems a little unwieldy

808
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:10,800
so I just don't know it's like it's more

809
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:12,599
convenient to do it this other way but

810
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,170
it's not invertible it just feels a

811
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:19,110
little janky right I don't know I'm

812
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:21,000
really torn about that I'm really torn

813
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:24,000
about that but point being when you pass

814
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,739
in Z meters from Target plane right then

815
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,500
that's Z meters from Target plane like

816
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:31,979
if you look in we look back here at the

817
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:34,349
get render entity basis P thing so when

818
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,969
we divide by PZ it's like what's PZ made

819
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:39,449
up well it's made of this transform

820
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:41,609
offset P thing right and so essentially

821
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:44,849
when we do this this reversal here this

822
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:46,530
distance above target minus Z meters

823
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:48,869
from plane thing right we're emulating

824
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:51,780
what we're we're you know reversing what

825
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:55,650
happened with this distance to PZ we're

826
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:58,650
emulating what happened here right and

827
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:00,780
in emulating what happened here we're

828
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:04,470
sort of we're sort of redoing the same

829
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:08,820
computation excuse me

830
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:12,149
so what that means is that if we

831
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:16,140
actually do if we if we had some offset

832
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:18,440
in the offset P right that was different

833
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:22,259
from the value that we were passing here

834
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,720
right you can you can imagine like you

835
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:28,050
know like this right so I pass in this

836
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:30,000
volume offset P and now that offset P is

837
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:32,519
is actually not necessarily the correct

838
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,610
value it's really the correct value

839
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:40,289
would actually be whatever the whatever

840
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:41,849
the entity's actual offset was right

841
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:43,619
it's actually going to be whatever this

842
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:45,900
thing was that's what actually would

843
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:48,679
have been doing the transform here what

844
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:51,300
I mean so in some sense it's like oh

845
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:52,799
really you could avoid the way we've got

846
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,600
this effect you could avoid passing the

847
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,470
Z altogether because we know that

848
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:03,119
actually the Z is just this that's the

849
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:04,769
only Z that we ever use right and so

850
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,150
that's actually like that's sort of I'm

851
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:08,730
trans days like that's a more correct

852
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,849
thing if you actually looked at the

853
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:15,990
function we wrote it's actually that

854
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:18,719
that is actually what it is and so I

855
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:19,949
don't know you know I don't know what to

856
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,399
say about that

857
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:25,049
I really don't I think it's just kind of

858
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,910
ugly and I'm really feeling like we

859
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,950
probably need to fix this I probably

860
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:34,920
won't fix it immediately but it's

861
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:36,029
definitely on my list so hey and you can

862
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,659
see now that we're working properly

863
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:41,580
right because we are now correctly doing

864
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:43,079
that in that inversion so when we move

865
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,659
over an entity we can highlight it and

866
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,279
that's all well and good I'm just really

867
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:49,170
not feeling good about that way we're

868
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,230
doing transforms and I wonder if maybe

869
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:55,559
it's like maybe we need to do like a

870
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,639
real transform there maybe we need to

871
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:59,789
start taking it a little bit more

872
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:04,289
seriously and not letting the math be

873
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:06,630
quite so lacks right I don't know what I

874
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:07,079
just I just did something bad what did I

875
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:11,519
do

876
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:18,569
I need to delete that and that and that

877
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:21,300
and so now we should see those around

878
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:25,320
all the entities and hopefully we can

879
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,760
pick any entity we want like so we don't

880
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,650
really need to draw these rectangles

881
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,160
this rectangle anymore that's really

882
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:37,590
just a testing rectangle so what kind of

883
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:38,909
get rid of that and then we've just are

884
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,550
left with something that can kind of go

885
00:38:38,909 --> 00:38:43,319
around highlighting an entity as

886
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,490
necessary now what I would like to do -

887
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,740
and you can see it we could highlight

888
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:48,779
these entities like so what I'd like to

889
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:51,089
do too is actually do something to make

890
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,820
sure that as we move up like is in RZ

891
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:55,620
that these all still work and if they're

892
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,590
very precise which they do appear to be

893
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:59,909
right and as you can see we can also see

894
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:03,000
if we're over multiplying Z at a time

895
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:04,949
which we are right so that's all good

896
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
let's keep going with that let's try

897
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:10,169
moving upwards and over there with lots

898
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,929
of these guys let's these entities

899
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:16,250
around yeah so that all that all feels

900
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:21,149
pretty good to me that all feels fine

901
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:23,219
okay so that whoa all right I guess the

902
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:27,059
Wacom tablet decided to take its own

903
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:31,139
life they took a whipper off the table

904
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:32,759
there all right so that's really that's

905
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:35,039
the long and short of it I'm not super

906
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,750
happy with that and I feel like we

907
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,789
should put on our to-do list here I

908
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:42,269
don't know that it matters super matters

909
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:45,690
when we do it but I kind of feel like we

910
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:48,980
should do something like real

911
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:50,820
projections with solid concept of

912
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:54,210
project unprojected

913
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,500
it's not you know I mean if it has to be

914
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,449
the way it is then maybe just at least

915
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,130
document it thoroughly if it's like this

916
00:39:57,449 --> 00:40:03,629
is what two and a half D is gonna mean

917
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:04,829
and that's we just do it that way that's

918
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,470
fine with me it's not the end of the

919
00:40:04,829 --> 00:40:10,549
world but I just think it's like it

920
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:14,339
needs to be a little more more rigorous

921
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:15,840
so that's that's all she wrote in this

922
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,430
particular case what we could do is

923
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:21,289
something like oh you know actually

924
00:40:17,429 --> 00:40:23,609
let's just only push that rect outline

925
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:26,279
in the case where we're actually

926
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:28,860
highlighting the guy right that seems

927
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,820
like a little bit more sane so we'll do

928
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,730
something like this

929
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,470
and that way it's like okay you know the

930
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,539
game is normally doing its gamey thing

931
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:39,049
and then you can kind of move around and

932
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:42,289
like highlight these entities right

933
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:48,300
whatever their collision volumes are

934
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:49,619
okay so now what I'd like to do hmm it's

935
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,260
like to have a way of displaying the

936
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:53,809
entities and so if we take a look at

937
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,760
just you know we've never really

938
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:58,769
implemented anything particularly fancy

939
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,510
for our entities but what I would like

940
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:01,920
to do is I'd like to go through here and

941
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:05,370
I'd like to make a really easy way for

942
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,159
us to essentially dump out an enemy

943
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:10,079
right so if I want to display this

944
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:11,639
entity when I come over these volumes

945
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,779
here you know what I'll do is I'll say

946
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,989
oh okay

947
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,430
entity is or maybe you know I'll do

948
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:21,949
another kind of one of those hot entity

949
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:21,949
things and so I could do something like

950
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,259
debug hot

951
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:32,909
element or something like that I would

952
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:35,219
do something like this

953
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:38,248
I'd say debug hot element and I'd say

954
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:41,068
the debug element is going to be one of

955
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:43,230
these entity things the entity is going

956
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:48,150
to be whichever this one was that we

957
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:52,170
were on right whatever it is here it's

958
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:53,789
just this guy right and then later I

959
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,318
would I would sort of pick it up and I'd

960
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:59,660
draw it a little bit further down the

961
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:59,659
line now I guess there is a little bit

962
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:04,889
you know there's a little bit of a

963
00:42:03,298 --> 00:42:06,420
problem with that if this entity which

964
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,190
this entity is right the way our sim

965
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,869
region stuff works is the simulation

966
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,970
only exists for the time when it's

967
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:13,980
stimulating so if I wanted to output the

968
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:17,429
stuff here I kind of don't want to defer

969
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:19,019
the actual capture of that state so I

970
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:20,940
might do something more like this I

971
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:25,169
might say something more like begin hot

972
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:28,889
element right and hot element sort of a

973
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:30,930
thing I might do something a little bit

974
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:32,308
more like that and I might say that you

975
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:34,440
know like okay this this is a hot

976
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:35,460
element it's the Senate II thing and I

977
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,929
want to dump all this

978
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,789
I want to dump like everything from it

979
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,669
right I want to dump like all the stuff

980
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:45,499
that there is and so like I want to dump

981
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:47,608
like what kind of type it is right

982
00:42:45,498 --> 00:42:56,608
something like that so I want to do

983
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:58,768
debug you know debug value property or

984
00:42:56,608 --> 00:43:01,048
something something like this debug

985
00:42:58,768 --> 00:43:06,689
value I want to say okay I've got the

986
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:14,989
end of these storage index right I got

987
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:14,989
the updatable I've got the flags type

988
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:20,269
all this stuff so I just want the whole

989
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,769
thing and again this is why I say like I

990
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:26,000
like medipartner myself because see is

991
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:27,829
like well it's C++ is just a I mean it's

992
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,469
it's an ancient language right

993
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:32,029
and as I harp on the C++ standard Kamiya

994
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:33,739
all the time like no one should ever

995
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,000
have to type this code I mean it's just

996
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:36,619
absurd that you have to type this code

997
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,440
it's absurd that in the Year 2015 you

998
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:41,719
would ever type this code but in 30

999
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,159
years of development the C++ Ange

1000
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:46,039
community still has not added

1001
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:48,170
introspection so every programmer who's

1002
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:50,929
ever written anything has typed this

1003
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,980
exact code doesn't they're not concerned

1004
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:55,419
about this they're fine with it

1005
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:58,099
they're like that's totes cool man and

1006
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:00,860
you know we'll get to it when we get to

1007
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:04,190
it so anyway we've got our stuff here

1008
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:06,440
right we've got our entity reference

1009
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:11,179
there well that's probably well okay

1010
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:20,059
that's fine we've got these guys well

1011
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:21,409
damn and our walkable height and that's

1012
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:22,670
just again we don't really have anything

1013
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:25,489
going out these entities but it just

1014
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:27,650
like it's what we kind of had done for

1015
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:29,419
tests code inside you know pretend it

1016
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,369
was a real entity and that we want to

1017
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,170
dump it this is what we would do right

1018
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:35,869
and for those hip points right - we've

1019
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,670
got a four I loop here so we've kind of

1020
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:40,549
got a like hip point index that we could

1021
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,139
loop over and we could say like the hit

1022
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:51,320
point index has to be less than the hit

1023
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:54,500
point max like so and whoops and then we

1024
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:57,890
would dump we dump each value there -

1025
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:02,989
right so we do like debug entity hit

1026
00:44:57,889 --> 00:45:05,150
point point index like that and this

1027
00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:07,729
would probably be something like debug

1028
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:10,970
begin array or something like this as

1029
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:14,210
well and this is like debug end array or

1030
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:22,119
something not totally sure kind of a

1031
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:24,139
thing ish thing that exists in the world

1032
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:27,208
yeah

1033
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:31,318
so something like that right

1034
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:35,038
something like that and you know if we

1035
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:36,900
were super motivated fancy-pants people

1036
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,759
we could even maybe have something like

1037
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,709
a thing that printed out a raise

1038
00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:42,509
manually like that automatically but

1039
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,848
let's not let's not bother with that for

1040
00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:47,009
now

1041
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:50,160
so if we imagine that we had the perfect

1042
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:54,028
debug system I feel like that's like in

1043
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:57,088
C again without C with C or C++ without

1044
00:45:54,028 --> 00:45:59,699
augmenting it with a meta programming

1045
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:01,078
system there's nothing you can do for

1046
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:02,719
this because it doesn't have

1047
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:05,729
introspection so you're always stuck

1048
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:09,119
doing something like this or something

1049
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:11,728
equally similar somewhere so but this is

1050
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,680
a pretty straightforward thing right so

1051
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:16,409
that's what I want that's what I want to

1052
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:19,078
have happen and with that is I think you

1053
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:20,728
know maybe tomorrow we got a weird like

1054
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:23,548
stream Athan thing happy tomorrow maybe

1055
00:46:20,728 --> 00:46:26,009
tomorrow we'll we'll implement that what

1056
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:27,298
I will do here I will just stub it out

1057
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:29,998
for now and then I want to go over and

1058
00:46:27,298 --> 00:46:33,059
do one more thing that we kind of have

1059
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:36,478
to do for our unprojected stuff so all

1060
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:39,028
right so if I go to handmade debug

1061
00:46:36,478 --> 00:46:43,259
probably maybe handmade platform I guess

1062
00:46:39,028 --> 00:46:44,880
it's in here technically right so if I

1063
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:47,099
come in here to handmade platform we've

1064
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,289
got all our debug code is in here right

1065
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:52,499
and so I'm just gonna come in and I'm

1066
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:54,390
gonna define these guys right so I'm

1067
00:46:52,498 --> 00:46:57,598
just gonna do a pound to fine of each of

1068
00:46:54,389 --> 00:46:59,879
these things for now I'm just gonna like

1069
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:07,999
stub it out and it's it's not gonna do

1070
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:07,999
anything at all let's see we've got this

1071
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:21,039
right and we got that already exists

1072
00:47:16,228 --> 00:47:22,928
there's this guy and this guy so now all

1073
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,959
that stuff will just compile out right

1074
00:47:22,929 --> 00:47:28,239
it won't do anything so it'll just be

1075
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:31,629
sitting there and so when we actually go

1076
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:36,130
to activate it you know we'll be able to

1077
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:37,749
see it right so that's all good so we're

1078
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,858
still highlighting now and those calls

1079
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:40,808
are in there but they don't do anything

1080
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:42,009
what we want to do tomorrow's make them

1081
00:47:40,809 --> 00:47:45,069
do something now the other thing that I

1082
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:47,079
wanted to do is now you'll notice well

1083
00:47:45,068 --> 00:47:49,058
you should be able to should see that

1084
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:51,759
our old debug stuff doesn't work anymore

1085
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:54,939
right like we can't actually click on

1086
00:47:51,759 --> 00:47:58,208
that and of course the reason for that

1087
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:59,588
is because we changed the mouse input we

1088
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:03,759
totally changed how the mouse input

1089
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:06,429
worked right and that's actually ok and

1090
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:08,048
it's actually a good thing because if

1091
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:10,209
you look at the way we do the mouse be

1092
00:48:08,048 --> 00:48:12,670
here right we do this mouse piece stuff

1093
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:17,078
and we create the mouse piece so let's

1094
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:21,188
see mmm else P equals right so there's

1095
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:22,329
where we create our mouse B and C that's

1096
00:48:21,188 --> 00:48:23,170
really that's really the place where

1097
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:25,449
it's created the other things are just

1098
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,489
pass throughs so we create our mouse be

1099
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:29,438
here all we did was take the mouse bian

1100
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:30,818
to start using it but that's not really

1101
00:48:29,438 --> 00:48:32,739
the reality of the situation because the

1102
00:48:30,818 --> 00:48:35,798
reality situation is the thing with all

1103
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:37,568
of our drawing right is happening in

1104
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:39,219
this orthographic projection this one

1105
00:48:37,568 --> 00:48:42,188
that we set up here we could have set

1106
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:43,929
that up to be anything and so this would

1107
00:48:42,188 --> 00:48:45,909
have been wrong a long time ago actually

1108
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:47,889
even before we change the screen center

1109
00:48:45,909 --> 00:48:49,178
stuff because we weren't actually taking

1110
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:50,949
the account what we said if we had set

1111
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:53,139
it to be a broad ass more stretched out

1112
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:54,099
projection just we could have all the

1113
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,989
drawing would have worked fine with the

1114
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:59,469
mouse we've been wrong so what we

1115
00:48:55,989 --> 00:49:01,659
actually want here right is we want our

1116
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:04,568
mouse speed to actually be a nun project

1117
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:10,889
right what we want to do is we want to

1118
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:10,889
do this so that we can unprojected

1119
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:18,710
right whatever the the mouse is by

1120
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:21,739
whatever the current transform is right

1121
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:24,679
like this that's what we actually want

1122
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:26,750
and so if we run that we're gonna get an

1123
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:28,849
assertion because we set it up here

1124
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:30,380
because we didn't implement this but we

1125
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:31,759
should just go ahead and implant it now

1126
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,760
and that way everything's actually

1127
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,030
running through a nice uniform path as

1128
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,620
well so no matter whether you're some

1129
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:41,090
orthographic debug stuff overlaid on top

1130
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:43,279
of things or you're some projection case

1131
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:45,170
you still just call and project to put

1132
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,850
the mouse back into the world that you

1133
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,110
are rendering in whether that's an

1134
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:50,509
orthographic screen space or a

1135
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:52,280
perspective world space it's kind of

1136
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:56,450
this that's nice it just keeps it more

1137
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:58,490
consistent and correct okay so if we

1138
00:49:56,449 --> 00:50:00,109
take a look at what's going on here

1139
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:02,959
what we need to do is just figure out

1140
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:05,360
what the transfer actually is again for

1141
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,659
orthographic views and so I'm gonna take

1142
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:11,360
a look at what we actually do and it

1143
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:13,929
looks like that that's I guess we just

1144
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:17,900
cut and paste it in here right so that's

1145
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:18,980
that's what we do and you can kind of

1146
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,559
see that it's the same sort of thing

1147
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:25,519
it's exactly what we were doing before

1148
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:27,320
right so and meters to pixel just

1149
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,269
happened to be defined to one in this

1150
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,930
case right that was the one that we were

1151
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:35,840
passing in when we didn't remember this

1152
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:37,879
in debug do you remember this one right

1153
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:40,400
here that's why that didn't do anything

1154
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,690
that's why this worked right that's why

1155
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,750
this mouse X Mouse why announce that

1156
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:46,130
that's why that work so yeah

1157
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,840
so now we just have the opportunity to

1158
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:50,599
do it right and that just means

1159
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:54,050
multiplying by the inverse of meters to

1160
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:56,089
pixels right and in doing that

1161
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,920
that's subtract first right so we

1162
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:00,260
basically just reverse we're just

1163
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,510
solving the equation right so we just do

1164
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:05,960
the the reverse and that gets us our

1165
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:07,640
unprojected X Y and and that should be

1166
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,059
that should be all there is to it

1167
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:10,059
actually

1168
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:19,309
right and so now I've got my my picking

1169
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:21,710
back right and so I can do all this

1170
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:23,750
stuff and so that's pretty good right

1171
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:25,220
but you'll note that we do have some

1172
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,840
other things and this is why I said I

1173
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:28,009
kind of wanted to do the hot and any

1174
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,329
stuff in there this there's more stuff

1175
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,500
that we're gonna want to do we're

1176
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:31,969
probably going to want to make it so

1177
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,320
that when you're over a debug menu right

1178
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:34,789
you don't like pick enemies underneath

1179
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,349
it and stuff like that and again this is

1180
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:39,019
all part of you can see how it's slowly

1181
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:42,019
building up into a coherent system for

1182
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:43,789
UI for doing the debug stuff it's just

1183
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:47,809
inherently very complicated and takes a

1184
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:49,969
while but you know once you do it you

1185
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:52,039
did it right and and it's kind of just

1186
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:55,250
nice to have around alright so I'm going

1187
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:59,079
to go ahead and go to the Q&amp;A so if you

1188
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,079
have any questions about what we do I

1189
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:03,500
will try to answer them now please

1190
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:07,059
prefix them with Q :

1191
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,059
so they'll be able to see them

1192
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:48,039
not much in the way of questions

1193
00:53:14,668 --> 00:53:18,879
mr. fourth dimension I'm a little

1194
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:21,099
unclear about what pressure is keeping

1195
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:31,660
you from doing the Z math exactly like

1196
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:35,259
you would do in 3d so I can try to sort

1197
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:39,928
of explain the problems that I have with

1198
00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:43,929
it and so normally what happens right is

1199
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:46,449
in 3d you're gonna have some kind of a

1200
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:49,410
situation where all of the points right

1201
00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:53,979
like in your world whatever they are

1202
00:53:49,409 --> 00:53:55,618
that form whatever things they form you

1203
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:58,358
know you've kind of got this this like

1204
00:53:55,619 --> 00:54:01,989
view and they all kind of symmetrically

1205
00:53:58,358 --> 00:54:05,380
project along you know on to some some

1206
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:07,028
monitor plane right and so the way that

1207
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,249
you handle Z is like really clean

1208
00:54:07,028 --> 00:54:11,108
because it's just it's just a transform

1209
00:54:09,248 --> 00:54:12,548
it's a straight transform and the XY z--

1210
00:54:11,108 --> 00:54:14,308
and z0 handle done hundred percent the

1211
00:54:12,548 --> 00:54:17,559
same and it's it's fine

1212
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:19,869
but we have kind of a weird situation in

1213
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:22,599
2d where things don't work that way

1214
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:24,669
right and the reason they don't work

1215
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:29,609
that way is because if you imagine for

1216
00:54:24,668 --> 00:54:33,219
example a dude standing somewhere right

1217
00:54:29,608 --> 00:54:35,679
here's the head here's the body right

1218
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:40,079
the body is here the head is here let's

1219
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:44,079
say when those two things get projected

1220
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:46,809
then what's going to happen is depending

1221
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:49,119
on how close you are to the camera and

1222
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:51,489
depending on how you are laterally right

1223
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:55,650
you can imagine like let's let's draw it

1224
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:59,349
this way so let's say we're looking down

1225
00:54:55,650 --> 00:55:02,858
so this is this is us here sitting right

1226
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:04,929
here's the monitor here's the world and

1227
00:55:02,858 --> 00:55:07,659
like here's the dude's head right so

1228
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:08,889
there's the head and and the body like

1229
00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:14,949
they're right on top of each other

1230
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:17,728
right so what happens and I guess even

1231
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:19,989
this is not quite the diagram I need

1232
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:23,348
because we're looking down on something

1233
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:25,679
that's standing up right it's it's kind

1234
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:25,679
of weird

1235
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:32,469
I really wish I should probably just

1236
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:34,150
install blender on this machine that's

1237
00:55:32,469 --> 00:55:37,329
why I can show it all right

1238
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:38,590
fully concrete case and I'm sorry for

1239
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:40,989
the diagrams I just don't know how to

1240
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:42,579
draw them well enough in 2d like I don't

1241
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:46,809
have those kind of sketching skills I'm

1242
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:50,440
afraid so here's a here's a box right

1243
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:52,000
and here is a head a floating head the

1244
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,349
floating head of the familiar and the

1245
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,480
floating head of the familiar is behind

1246
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:57,549
the box here's its shadow and it's

1247
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,869
moving this way right and it's going to

1248
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:01,170
move it's going to move straight across

1249
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:04,659
the box it's not gonna hit the box right

1250
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:07,780
so in 3d we know that the head is like a

1251
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:09,309
certain Z above the plane right and we

1252
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:11,080
know that the box is a certain Z above

1253
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:13,329
the plane well in that case it's zero

1254
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:15,989
and we know that the box has a bounding

1255
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:19,059
box that's some certain height right and

1256
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:22,059
we know that this Z that's floating plus

1257
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:24,610
the the diameter of the head right I'm

1258
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:26,380
sorry plus the radius of the head but

1259
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,510
it's bounding box we know that the

1260
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:30,070
height and that don't intersect so that

1261
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:34,480
all works just fine in our system and

1262
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:37,210
it's fine right but if we were to draw

1263
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:40,019
that remember we have a camera that's

1264
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:43,510
looking straight down onto the screen

1265
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:45,460
that's just what we're doing right and

1266
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:47,500
we can pick you know we could pick how

1267
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:50,710
that was if we wanted to we could have

1268
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,630
it be look at more of an angle right but

1269
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:55,420
but at some point we've got something

1270
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:58,450
between you know like 45 degrees and 90

1271
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:00,550
degrees that's where the camera is okay

1272
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:04,299
now if we were to actually just

1273
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:06,190
interpret all this stuff 100% 3d what we

1274
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:08,320
would see when we looked when we did

1275
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,630
this projection so we are here we're

1276
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:14,050
looking down here's the monitor here's

1277
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:15,789
the view for us - here's the guy we

1278
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:17,620
would see for handmade hero the top of

1279
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:19,119
the hero's head and his cloak would be

1280
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:23,710
like a circle like this you would just

1281
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:26,109
see hair right and it'd be even weirder

1282
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:28,659
because since yangshin drew it side on

1283
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,370
here's the guy right we'd actually see

1284
00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:32,349
his head like looking up at us and his

1285
00:57:30,369 --> 00:57:34,210
cape from the side would be stacked

1286
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:38,559
right on top of them and it's just

1287
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:39,369
totally wrong right so instead obviously

1288
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,778
what we need to do is

1289
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:43,480
make sure that when we draw him we

1290
00:57:40,778 --> 00:57:46,889
actually consider the Z values for him

1291
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:50,230
to actually be sort of Y values for him

1292
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:55,449
because he is a standing up right entity

1293
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:57,929
whatever that means right and so what

1294
00:57:55,449 --> 00:58:00,518
that means is that we now have two

1295
00:57:57,929 --> 00:58:03,429
conceptualizations of what Z actually is

1296
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:04,838
it is actually a Z value off the ground

1297
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:09,068
for purposes of collision protection but

1298
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:13,058
then it is also an offset in Y if you

1299
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:15,940
are part of a model so this guy's

1300
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:17,769
position in Z is actually handled just

1301
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:21,159
like everything else in the real world

1302
00:58:17,768 --> 00:58:22,929
but his offset in Z is not the like

1303
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:25,868
different parts of the body offset Z

1304
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:27,639
have to be interpreted directly in 2d

1305
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:29,019
without ever going through any other

1306
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:31,179
kind of transform other than just the

1307
00:58:29,018 --> 00:58:34,239
scaling necessary to make him shrink or

1308
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:38,379
grow and what that leads to is a

1309
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:41,498
two-part transform where the basis point

1310
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:47,019
of the guy which is XYZ gets transformed

1311
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:54,068
for reals right real Z it gets

1312
00:58:47,018 --> 00:58:57,429
transformed for reals but the for lack

1313
00:58:54,068 --> 00:59:01,509
of ever trim the attachment or the

1314
00:58:57,429 --> 00:59:05,679
alignment points of bitmaps they get

1315
00:59:01,509 --> 00:59:08,559
faked and that was the problem we ran

1316
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:10,719
into on Tuesday why we thought we had a

1317
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:13,930
bug was because I had forgotten that we

1318
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,118
had to do this nonsense right to make

1319
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:17,798
the 2d stuff work out properly and so I

1320
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:19,059
was like passing a Z expecting you to

1321
00:59:17,798 --> 00:59:20,949
actually do something but it doesn't do

1322
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:22,900
them because that's the offset slot we

1323
00:59:20,949 --> 00:59:25,538
were passing things in and it's only the

1324
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:28,420
transform the base transform slot that

1325
00:59:25,539 --> 00:59:30,579
actually has a real Z in it so mr. Firth

1326
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:35,970
I mentioned does that clear it up at all

1327
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:35,970
for you or not really

1328
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:48,849
party wind bill where are you going to

1329
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:51,250
draw the levels for entity properties

1330
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:53,199
our sorry let labels you corrected your

1331
00:59:51,250 --> 01:00:06,519
thing uh we're going to put them into

1332
00:59:53,199 --> 01:00:08,139
that debug hierarchy Icarus did you

1333
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:10,300
decide which awesome thing to do for

1334
01:00:08,139 --> 01:00:11,949
tomorrow stream not really and I'm not

1335
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,330
really sure I was I was thinking about

1336
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:14,799
it whether we should bother I think I

1337
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:16,750
was thinking I should just do what I was

1338
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,880
gonna do so I think I might just do this

1339
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:21,880
because I think it's more important to

1340
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,260
stay on I'm focused so I think I'm

1341
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,260
probably actually just gonna do what we

1342
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:28,030
were gonna do anyway what do you find is

1343
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:29,980
a good game design

1344
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:31,150
I just want food s that's a pretty big

1345
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,829
topic it probably one that's better for

1346
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:35,650
a pre stream that's not really about

1347
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:36,789
programming jerry johansson curious your

1348
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:39,250
decision to design your own game engine

1349
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:41,139
has more to do with you furthering your

1350
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:42,489
own skill level or do you have a reason

1351
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:46,440
to not trust the middleware solutions

1352
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:51,309
that you have seen in the past well so I

1353
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:53,679
can't tell you for example that you know

1354
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:56,170
for handmade hero I don't know how many

1355
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:59,109
things we would be doing in it that

1356
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:00,639
would that you couldn't do in a

1357
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:01,930
middleware thing obviously there's some

1358
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:03,279
stuff we do like the loop live coding

1359
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:07,269
aside that that are cool features that

1360
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,710
middleware doesn't have right now so

1361
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:11,800
there's definitely that and there's also

1362
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:13,449
sort of the agility with which you can

1363
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,740
program in a code base like handmade

1364
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:16,929
hero that's like just simply not

1365
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:18,459
possible in something like you know in

1366
01:01:16,929 --> 01:01:20,019
something like unity right look unity

1367
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,760
doesn't even have the concept that the

1368
01:01:20,019 --> 01:01:23,559
whole game streams in right you have to

1369
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,050
have like weird look level packages and

1370
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:28,570
all this like so there's there's

1371
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:31,810
actually a lot of reasons why middleware

1372
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:33,880
is actually not very good but you know

1373
01:01:31,809 --> 01:01:35,349
on the whole if you were gonna sit down

1374
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,210
and make handmade here on your goals to

1375
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:38,860
make it as fast as possible you know

1376
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:40,720
it's probably true that you could make

1377
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:42,820
it quicker in something that was already

1378
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,189
all built you know game maker or unity

1379
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:47,050
right right and maybe you can't do all

1380
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:49,090
the things that we do but you could do

1381
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:50,740
most of them and maybe

1382
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:54,340
yes a bunch of things are annoying and

1383
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:55,899
take you longer but they but because you

1384
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:58,090
save time not having to write like this

1385
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,889
other stuff maybe you come out ahead I

1386
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:01,210
don't know right and I don't really

1387
01:01:59,889 --> 01:02:02,710
pretend to know that particular thing

1388
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:04,659
because I'm not really in the business

1389
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:07,690
of cranking out very simple games

1390
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:09,969
quickly right I don't I don't do that

1391
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:12,519
and I don't have a strong opinion about

1392
01:02:09,969 --> 01:02:14,469
how you should do that but what I can

1393
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:17,739
tell you is that if you actually care

1394
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:19,659
about making something fairly new that

1395
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:22,389
pushes some boundaries you can forget

1396
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:24,190
you know using an engine usually because

1397
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:27,460
they just it ends up being more trouble

1398
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:29,139
than it's worth you know maybe it's

1399
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:31,090
worth it if you're doing some very if

1400
01:02:29,139 --> 01:02:32,589
most of the stuff you're doing happens

1401
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:35,350
to be like exactly what Unreal Engine

1402
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:38,260
does and you just need some other small

1403
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:40,690
changes that could be a big time saver

1404
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:43,080
you know but like for example what we're

1405
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:45,940
doing at Melly rocket right now is like

1406
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:48,759
not I I can't even think of a single

1407
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:51,880
piece of it that I've built so far

1408
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:55,990
that's in either engine like neither of

1409
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:57,519
them have any of it so it's not even a

1410
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:59,379
choice with like the stuff I'm working

1411
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:04,119
on professionally it's it's not even

1412
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:06,280
like I I would only be strictly losing

1413
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:08,920
time I'd be paying money to lose time

1414
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:13,810
right if I use one them there so that's

1415
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:15,639
you know hopefully that give you some

1416
01:03:13,809 --> 01:03:17,619
perspective and one of the reasons that

1417
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:18,639
I'm doing handmade here alright there's

1418
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:21,159
a couple different reasons but one of

1419
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,960
the reasons is to encourage people who

1420
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:24,699
are interested in this kind of code to

1421
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,650
do it and to show how easy it actually

1422
01:03:24,699 --> 01:03:28,359
is because like I said you know a lot of

1423
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:29,559
times you know we're all it's only an

1424
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,059
hour at night that's not a very big

1425
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:34,059
investment and we've gone through tons

1426
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:35,980
and tons of features already on handmade

1427
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:38,440
hero and and you know we just haven't

1428
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:40,150
spent very much actual physical time and

1429
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,210
so you know part of its to show how easy

1430
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:45,010
it is to do some of these things but the

1431
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:47,019
other part of it is to say like hey yeah

1432
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:50,740
you know if you are the kind of person

1433
01:03:47,019 --> 01:03:53,619
who enjoys the sort of stuff I hope you

1434
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:57,819
will consider making some new things you

1435
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:59,650
know and that could be like a whole new

1436
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:00,490
engine Pratt potentially with does some

1437
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:02,110
really interesting things that people

1438
01:04:00,489 --> 01:04:02,979
don't do in ways they don't do them or

1439
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:04,630
it might just be

1440
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,820
opponents for existing engines right

1441
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:08,170
like maybe you're gonna go make a unity

1442
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:10,240
plug-in that does a bunch of really cool

1443
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:11,889
stuff that unity can't do or maybe

1444
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,969
you're gonna go you know mod the Unreal

1445
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:16,089
Engine to do a bunch of tough the unis

1446
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:18,069
can't do and so even you know even if

1447
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:19,990
your mindset is let's use an engine I

1448
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:21,250
think it's really valuable to have done

1449
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:23,469
a bunch of this stuff because it means

1450
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:28,260
now you know how everything works out

1451
01:04:23,469 --> 01:04:28,259
there and you can go do the stuff right

1452
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:49,160
SIA Chisholm says did you play Warcraft

1453
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:51,109
3 at all or any of the mods I need some

1454
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:52,819
help replicating some of the movement

1455
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:55,150
mechanics from one of the games and

1456
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:58,250
nobody understands me when I describe it

1457
01:04:55,150 --> 01:05:03,440
willing to pay PayPal to whoever can

1458
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:05,599
code it I am sorry to say that no I I

1459
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,019
did not play worker 3 I played I played

1460
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:11,360
Warcraft 1 and 2 to completion but I

1461
01:05:09,019 --> 01:05:13,519
never played Warcraft 3 I think I had

1462
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,380
burned out on realtime strategy games by

1463
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:16,849
then because I played like all of

1464
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,360
command &amp; Conquer all of World of

1465
01:05:16,849 --> 01:05:18,739
Warcraft

1466
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:22,519
I mean I'm sorry all of Warcraft I love

1467
01:05:18,739 --> 01:05:24,799
Warcraft 2 and I think I even played

1468
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:26,389
like all of Total Annihilation and I

1469
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,570
just at some point I was like okay and

1470
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:31,099
Starcraft the original Starcraft and so

1471
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:32,120
by the time we got to work our three I

1472
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:34,730
think I was just I was like I'm done

1473
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:36,710
okay just don't wanna play this anymore

1474
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,269
and so you know it was probably one of

1475
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:42,829
the better Warcraft but I just

1476
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:44,449
yeah I'm spent would it work to render

1477
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:46,309
it in full 3d and rotate all the sprites

1478
01:05:44,449 --> 01:05:53,629
by 40 to 5 degrees or whatever the

1479
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:59,869
camera angle is taking um you know it

1480
01:05:53,630 --> 01:06:06,320
might I mean I don't know like I said

1481
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:07,339
I'm a full 3d guy usually and actually

1482
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,970
the project that we're working on a

1483
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:15,350
trolley rocket does have some too nice

1484
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:18,189
there's it's not that there's to the

1485
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:21,170
illustrative stuff in it obviously but

1486
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:24,710
it's not this this way it's not the like

1487
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:28,099
weird like two and a half D thing so I

1488
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:29,420
don't it's definitely not something that

1489
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:37,699
I have an opinion about because I just

1490
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:40,579
haven't played around with it and so you

1491
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:43,669
know I I just don't know

1492
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:45,318
I mean maybe something like that would

1493
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:48,650
work it seems like it would be a little

1494
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:50,838
tricky to get right I feel like you'd

1495
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:55,459
have to have the camera at 45 and then

1496
01:06:50,838 --> 01:06:58,278
spend the sprite by 45 and then it would

1497
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:59,808
look right cuz if you if you only if the

1498
01:06:58,278 --> 01:07:02,630
camera was top-down and then the sprites

1499
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:04,400
were bent 45 that would still that would

1500
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:06,199
compress them right they would they

1501
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,719
would even if was orthographic I would

1502
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:11,869
compress them in a bad way which you

1503
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:13,608
don't really want so I think you'd have

1504
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:15,499
to have the camera at 45 and then the

1505
01:07:13,608 --> 01:07:18,159
sprite at 45 or something like that like

1506
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:20,478
the camera at 80 and the sprite to 20

1507
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:22,909
times I had 10 you'd have to add up to

1508
01:07:20,478 --> 01:07:24,048
90 somehow right the sprites would

1509
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:26,899
always have to be at a right angle to

1510
01:07:24,048 --> 01:07:29,199
the camera I think that's just my guess

1511
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:29,199
anyway

1512
01:07:51,579 --> 01:07:55,400
aren't even well I understand the

1513
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:57,739
artists run in the 3/4 view is the

1514
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:02,780
camera at an angle or top down the

1515
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:05,949
camera is like top-down right now so

1516
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:10,790
we're basically like emulating Zelda or

1517
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:13,009
Zelda dungeon is like the goal right so

1518
01:08:10,789 --> 01:08:19,698
you know if you look at something like

1519
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:21,650
this right this is this is you know what

1520
01:08:19,698 --> 01:08:22,639
we were starting with us as far as an

1521
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:25,579
idea anyway

1522
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,500
right which is to say that it's very

1523
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:31,609
clear that the camera is pointing

1524
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:33,948
directly down but the sprites just for

1525
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:37,910
attractiveness purposes are pointing

1526
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:41,210
like at you and nobody knows why his

1527
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:47,028
works right I don't pretend to know why

1528
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:48,829
that works but it does and so since

1529
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:50,810
people are ok with it

1530
01:08:48,829 --> 01:08:55,309
you know since they they seem to be okay

1531
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:59,179
with that style that's what we're doing

1532
01:08:55,310 --> 01:09:03,980
and like I said I don't pretend to be a

1533
01:08:59,179 --> 01:09:05,690
game designer I don't claim to know if

1534
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:06,948
that's like the smartest way to design

1535
01:09:05,689 --> 01:09:09,019
your game or anything like that that's

1536
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:10,789
just you know handmade hero it's a

1537
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:13,400
programming stream and we need a game to

1538
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:15,319
program and so that is I I liked this

1539
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:17,809
game a lot the original Zelda was one of

1540
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:22,370
my favorites I really think it's a great

1541
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:23,839
game and and I think you know like I've

1542
01:09:22,369 --> 01:09:27,198
mentioned Binding of Isaac before is

1543
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:29,809
like an update of it you know and all of

1544
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:31,969
the dungeon part of it and I think it

1545
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:33,679
worked out fabulously again and so I

1546
01:09:31,969 --> 01:09:37,880
feel like there's something reasonable

1547
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:40,219
about this sort of methodology I mean if

1548
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:42,739
you look at Binding of Isaac right the

1549
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:45,109
if they did the exact same thing right

1550
01:09:42,738 --> 01:09:47,329
down to like the number of squares in it

1551
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:49,130
and it's exactly the same everything's

1552
01:09:47,329 --> 01:09:50,689
like top down except sometimes they

1553
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:53,569
decide you know the sprites are this way

1554
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:55,789
and like some rocks or that way and some

1555
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:57,469
rocks aren't right some rocks are top

1556
01:09:55,789 --> 01:09:59,210
down some rocks are sideways that's just

1557
01:09:57,469 --> 01:10:02,890
something that like players brains

1558
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:02,890
except they don't have a problem with it

1559
01:10:03,109 --> 01:10:10,609
and so you know that's that's just what

1560
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:12,740
I decided we would do again because

1561
01:10:10,609 --> 01:10:14,659
original Zelda was a was a favorite of

1562
01:10:12,739 --> 01:10:17,979
mine and and I am I really like binding

1563
01:10:14,659 --> 01:10:21,430
of issac too so I just feel like that's

1564
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:21,429
it's reasonable

1565
01:10:33,599 --> 01:10:51,489
the 3d Zelda games do the 3d angle for

1566
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:53,889
2d yeah I so I don't super love that

1567
01:10:51,488 --> 01:10:58,658
look to be honest it's a little weird to

1568
01:10:53,889 --> 01:11:03,368
me because it's skews well I don't know

1569
01:10:58,658 --> 01:11:06,488
I wouldn't be like adverse to it but I

1570
01:11:03,368 --> 01:11:07,899
feel like it's just a little bit I feel

1571
01:11:06,488 --> 01:11:10,000
like if I was gonna do that I'd go all

1572
01:11:07,899 --> 01:11:12,969
the way I don't I don't know that I

1573
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,738
would I would just make it 3d at that

1574
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:16,929
point I'm not sure what the bonus is of

1575
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:20,500
if you're gonna actually construct the

1576
01:11:16,929 --> 01:11:22,210
geometry like that why can't you just do

1577
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:27,448
it in regular old 3d and that's a little

1578
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:27,448
weird it's a little bit weird

1579
01:11:30,599 --> 01:11:38,069
so Gary Johansson so I'm making a full

1580
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:40,198
3d RTS that uses a mouse with a joystick

1581
01:11:38,069 --> 01:11:41,488
built-in so you can adjust where you are

1582
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:42,750
looking with the joystick it's to use

1583
01:11:41,488 --> 01:11:44,879
the mouse's mouse from your section do

1584
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:52,109
you think that that's an untenable idea

1585
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:54,449
for a product what Gary what how do I

1586
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:57,299
have anything useful to say about that

1587
01:11:54,448 --> 01:12:00,868
at all I'm a programmer that's not

1588
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:06,510
really a programming question I have no

1589
01:12:00,868 --> 01:12:08,189
idea I feel like most of the time it's

1590
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:12,869
hard to get people to buy peripherals so

1591
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:14,219
I guess what I'd say did you ever end up

1592
01:12:12,868 --> 01:12:15,689
playing the mother series that's still

1593
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:17,099
in your to do yes it's on my to do I

1594
01:12:15,689 --> 01:12:18,328
would like to play the mother series

1595
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,739
it's been on my to do for a long time

1596
01:12:18,328 --> 01:12:21,000
actually and I haven't been able to do

1597
01:12:19,738 --> 01:12:22,589
it but I would like to at some point

1598
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,238
when I have some time which probably

1599
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:27,690
will be never but if I ever have some

1600
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:30,328
time you know I would I would totally do

1601
01:12:27,689 --> 01:12:31,738
that already windmill I kind of jumped

1602
01:12:30,328 --> 01:12:33,448
over 100 episodes so I don't understand

1603
01:12:31,738 --> 01:12:35,609
what the issue was with the debug

1604
01:12:33,448 --> 01:12:39,479
selector was the issue with the hitbox

1605
01:12:35,609 --> 01:12:41,189
depth only or also the position well it

1606
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:42,509
was it was actually just that we didn't

1607
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:43,710
quite understand the fact that the Z

1608
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:45,239
wasn't reproductive so everything was

1609
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:48,960
actually working just fine but the

1610
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:50,309
problem was when we went to draw it the

1611
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,719
Z we were passing was just getting

1612
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:55,530
thrown out which is what it was supposed

1613
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:59,989
to do but it it's obviously a little

1614
01:12:55,529 --> 01:12:59,988
deceptive right so

1615
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:36,840
all righty I think we are we are good I

1616
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:36,840
want to see a type user list

1617
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:52,289
we go do we know why the usual list

1618
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:57,210
doesn't work anymore he used to work

1619
01:13:52,289 --> 01:13:59,250
just fine so it yet anyway I think we're

1620
01:13:57,210 --> 01:14:02,270
all good I think I've answered all the

1621
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:03,988
questions that are actually questions

1622
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:06,060
tomorrow is a little bit weird

1623
01:14:03,988 --> 01:14:07,738
tomorrow's a little wonky it's like a

1624
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:14,250
two-hour stream and it's like at night

1625
01:14:07,738 --> 01:14:18,299
it's like at 8:00 p.m. so yeah so that's

1626
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:21,359
a that's the thing but I guess what I

1627
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:24,989
would say is I also don't know

1628
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:27,689
should we if I tried when I originally

1629
01:14:24,988 --> 01:14:34,488
set the stream to stream it on hitbox as

1630
01:14:27,689 --> 01:14:37,319
well and you know I don't know how to I

1631
01:14:34,488 --> 01:14:39,750
couldn't get it working to stream to

1632
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:42,960
both services at the same time you were

1633
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:51,020
supposed to be able to do that on using

1634
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:51,020
this like server thing you know but I

1635
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:56,189
never got it working and so what I was

1636
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:58,320
wondering is like I don't know since

1637
01:14:56,189 --> 01:15:02,129
since Twitter ban John I guess of

1638
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:03,899
Twitter since twitch banned John I feel

1639
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:06,840
like maybe we should try again to

1640
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:12,179
support hitbox so people who you know

1641
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:16,560
want to go watch it on there might be

1642
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:19,319
good act binary sent sent restreamed IO

1643
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,909
so what is restream that IO is that just

1644
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:23,908
a thing that would like broadcast it to

1645
01:15:20,908 --> 01:15:27,799
multiple services for you I don't know

1646
01:15:23,908 --> 01:15:27,799
I'll check that out

1647
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:44,470
and swag kiddie 69 the reason John got

1648
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,289
mad was he was playing a video on

1649
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:49,060
YouTube and like playing a video on

1650
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:53,460
YouTube I guess that's like content

1651
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:56,920
that's you know copyrighted and so I

1652
01:15:53,460 --> 01:16:00,489
don't actually know like how that works

1653
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:05,920
but I guess technically that is a

1654
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:13,449
copyright violation because YouTube has

1655
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:18,960
a license to play it but but twitch

1656
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:22,889
doesn't do you know what I mean and so

1657
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:27,010
you know I don't I don't really know I

1658
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:28,930
don't really know I mean it is a

1659
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:34,539
copyright violation right you can't play

1660
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:36,940
a movie on a stream but you know in in

1661
01:16:34,539 --> 01:16:39,760
in all fairness I feel like it probably

1662
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:41,589
was something where you know to be how

1663
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,970
much did he play was it illegal excerpt

1664
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:45,039
sighs you know I have no idea

1665
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:46,570
and it's probably likely that it really

1666
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:48,369
wasn't much of a copyright violation at

1667
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:52,689
the end of the day certainly shouldn't

1668
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:54,939
have resulted in a ban but yeah so

1669
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:56,919
anyway so I was thinking of trying to

1670
01:16:54,939 --> 01:16:58,809
support hitbox just to have more people

1671
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:03,489
in the mix there I could also try to

1672
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:04,900
support YouTube streaming so yeah if you

1673
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:07,569
have opinions about that send them to me

1674
01:17:04,899 --> 01:17:12,210
or post them on the forums and we could

1675
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:16,869
check it out all right um

1676
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:22,090
anyway anyway let's wrap it up I'm gonna

1677
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:25,539
go hop over on my crutches and hop over

1678
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:26,739
on some crutches I am I'm gonna go hop

1679
01:17:25,539 --> 01:17:27,250
over some crutches and try to have some

1680
01:17:26,739 --> 01:17:29,409
dinner

1681
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:30,310
anyway thank you very much for joining

1682
01:17:29,409 --> 01:17:31,449
me for another episode of hand made

1683
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:33,670
heroes don't slide recording with you as

1684
01:17:31,449 --> 01:17:35,439
always tomorrow we have the dev stream a

1685
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:38,050
thon thing I don't really know very much

1686
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:39,189
about it it's a thing that someone was

1687
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:41,260
putting together of just like dev

1688
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:42,250
streams that are going back-to-back so

1689
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:47,320
if you're interested in that check it

1690
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:48,699
out and and like I said we'll be in in

1691
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:51,279
the timeslot I think from eight o'clock

1692
01:17:48,699 --> 01:17:52,869
to ten o'clock so will be an 8 p.m. to

1693
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:54,849
10 p.m. will

1694
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:57,399
do a 2-hour stream so maybe an hour and

1695
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:59,050
a half plus a half-hour of questions or

1696
01:17:57,399 --> 01:18:00,759
maybe we'll save questions for Monday or

1697
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:02,409
I don't know what we'll do but we'll

1698
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:05,520
figure it out so that's happening

1699
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:07,720
tomorrow hope see you here for that and

1700
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,340
you know maybe we'll do a cool look a

1701
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,480
cool entity debug view things since

1702
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:12,420
that's where we've kind of ended today

1703
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:15,429
that would be pretty cool to get working

1704
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:16,569
so anyway that's we're doing tomorrow in

1705
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:19,240
the meantime if you want to play around

1706
01:18:16,569 --> 01:18:20,590
the source code you can always do so you

1707
01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:22,960
can play around with the source code on

1708
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:24,310
by pre-ordering the game it comes with

1709
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,390
source code I uploaded every night after

1710
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:27,039
we're done so you notice to play with

1711
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:28,960
the latest one just fool around with it

1712
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:30,250
see what's going on we also have patreon

1713
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,840
page you want supports a video series

1714
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:33,909
always much appreciated we have a forum

1715
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:37,750
site you can go to to ask questions and

1716
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:39,039
watch episodes old episodes annotated by

1717
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:41,140
the community

1718
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:42,640
and there's also a tweet bot that you

1719
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:45,840
can go to to find out what the schedule

1720
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:50,050
is now we also have a convention that

1721
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:52,690
it's coming up till handmade con it's

1722
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:54,430
coming up in December and I just wanted

1723
01:18:52,689 --> 01:18:56,349
to mention it one more time because the

1724
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:59,400
speaker list is now essentially

1725
01:18:56,350 --> 01:19:03,490
finalized it will be announced on Monday

1726
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:07,809
it is pretty much the best speaker list

1727
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:11,380
that I've ever seen on anything ever for

1728
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:16,060
programming it's like literally kind of

1729
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:18,850
like exactly the five people that I want

1730
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:22,510
to interview on programming for games

1731
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:24,910
and so I'm expecting that probably when

1732
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:27,070
I announce the speaker list on Monday I

1733
01:19:24,909 --> 01:19:29,590
don't know if it will be a sellout but

1734
01:19:27,069 --> 01:19:31,329
I'm suspecting that probably the tickets

1735
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:33,880
will go pretty fast at that point so if

1736
01:19:31,329 --> 01:19:35,739
there's anybody who's like a hardcore

1737
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:37,750
handmade hero viewer who's on the stream

1738
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:39,819
right now and was on the fence about

1739
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:41,380
whether you want to go please try to

1740
01:19:39,819 --> 01:19:43,689
make up your mind this weekend because I

1741
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:46,989
do not have any I literally do not have

1742
01:19:43,689 --> 01:19:48,460
a way to sell any more tickets than 275

1743
01:19:46,989 --> 01:19:50,619
that is the number of people that will

1744
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:54,640
fit and like 15 of them or so will be

1745
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:58,630
reserved for you know the speakers and

1746
01:19:54,640 --> 01:20:00,400
and help people who are helping and so

1747
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:03,960
like there's I think there's a total of

1748
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:06,159
250 second ticket 250 tickets to sell so

1749
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,630
again like if you

1750
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:10,090
really want to go to it and you're sure

1751
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:13,390
that you are gonna go if you can decide

1752
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:16,869
by Sunday and buy a ticket just I can

1753
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:19,390
only apologize in advance i I just don't

01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:24,010
tickets to last after next week but you

1756
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:25,570
there's plenty of them left right now so

1757
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:28,030
it shouldn't be a problem for anyone who

1758
01:20:25,569 --> 01:20:32,319
wants to buy one this weekend that's

1759
01:20:28,029 --> 01:20:33,969

want to warm up ahead of time before a

1767
01:20:50,829 --> 01:20:55,390
stream until then have fun programming

1768
01:20:53,079 --> 01:20:58,979
