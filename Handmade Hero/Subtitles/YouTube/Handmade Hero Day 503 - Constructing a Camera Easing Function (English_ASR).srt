1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
one welcome to handmade hero sure we

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,319
code a complete game live on stream we

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:10,109
are well we're doing whatever we really

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:15,120
want to do at this point everything is

5
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:16,829
kind of on the table and you know we're

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,960
at that point where you could kind of

7
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:21,118
just play around however you want to and

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,800
there are some things that I would like

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:27,028
to get to that are big items at some

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,198
point I don't really know that I super

11
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:33,210
care about them right now but like you

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,890
know at some point we did a bunch of

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,509
engine work and we've got so much stuff

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,210
in there that works now and like the

15
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,710
things that we don't have done that are

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,299
a little bit big like wanting to finish

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,920
up the lighting so it's more consistent

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,319
and stuff like that

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,270
can certainly wait I mean we have an

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,939
idea of what stuff looks like in the

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,680
world now so we can proceed with things

22
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,589
like having art done and stuff like that

23
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,600
and so I would say now is probably a

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,039
good time to again not be super

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,020
restrictive about what's going on

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,429
because a lot of the stuff like a couple

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,409
of rendering modifications that we want

28
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:07,829
to make to fix like glitches and stuff

29
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,700
like that shouldn't be too big of a deal

30
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:14,280
at this point so I feel like we want to

31
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:17,700
maybe just focus on on getting more

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:23,460
stuff in there at this point and you

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,379
know how how to how to adjust some of

34
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,599
the other stuff is it's probably not it

35
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,670
not as big a deal so what I want to do

36
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,349
today is focus on the camera you can see

37
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,540
right now like we kind of screwed with

38
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,798
it at the end of the stream last time we

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,570
have some issues that we're gonna have

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,430
to address like you notice when the

41
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:39,779
camera gets too close here it will clip

42
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,579
out because we were playing with where

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,379
the Alpha should happen when the camera

44
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:44,728
zooms in it'll clip out things like

45
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,280
right there you can see it's clipping

46
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,899
out everything but we wanted to do some

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,200
clipping right because we want to be

48
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,670
able to do stuff where in the you know

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,350
when we're hopping downstairs it'll clip

50
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,820
it out we also have the problem of

51
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,349
figuring out who's in the lighting

52
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,089
solution and not you can see right there

53
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:01,319
we get those bugs where we just right

54
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,000
now we're just kind of slapping an

55
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,258
arbitrary rectangle on there and saying

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,310
that's who's in the lighting solution

57
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,318
right and so those are two camera things

58
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,240
and so in addition to the fact that I'd

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,119
like to put the debug camera in a good

60
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,770
now I think today should just be camera

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,740
day and like try to get some of this

62
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,170
stuff cleaned up now lighting is always

63
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,760
a problem for us and so I don't know

64
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:27,359
like one thing that we could also

65
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,849
consider doing is adjust the lighting as

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,700
a stopgap measure before we try to

67
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:35,370
improve the lighting for more real time

68
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:38,849
you know quality and maybe move it to

69
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:42,090
the GPU one of the things that we could

70
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:45,199
do here is try to make it so that we are

71
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:49,379
using the lighting in some kind of a

72
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:51,509
adaptive way so for example when we get

73
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,620
to a scene like this and it's like oh

74
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:55,079
man there's all the stuff that has to

75
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,759
get lit we could do something where

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,469
things further from you don't really get

77
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,030
many rays cast or something like that

78
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,400
because we really just want to avoid

79
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,229
having this weird like artifact II sort

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,909
of stuff like this where you know so we

81
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:07,590
want everything in the lighting solution

82
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:10,620
so we don't see obvious bugs like this

83
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,349
but we may not need to really do great

84
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,000
lighting selves so far away so we could

85
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:16,409
also put in a stopgap measure a little

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,330
bit of something for adaptiveness there

87
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:19,379
which would just let us finish most of

88
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,940
the game without worrying about the

89
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,310
lighting too much and then you know at

90
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,629
some point when we wanted to spend

91
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,129
another concentrated period of time on

92
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,310
it go back and figure out how we're

93
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:31,079
gonna get the lighting really good right

94
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,569
and all that so I think today is a

95
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,360
camera day I'm gonna start off by adding

96
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:39,500
some parameters that we can tweak in

97
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,970
real time just to allow us to sort of

98
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,259
fine-tune like for example here right if

99
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:44,909
I want to fine-tune it so that we don't

100
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,549
you know we want to figure out where the

101
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:51,210
right ceiling level is and stuff like

102
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,830
that III want to get some fine-tuning in

103
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,909
there and I also want to add the debug

104
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,900
stuff so I think that's what we wanna do

105
00:03:53,909 --> 00:04:00,359
today we have the ability here to have a

106
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,780
UI that we set up an area to put camera

107
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,150
UI in so I may want to just do that I

108
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,770
may want to just get some UI in here

109
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,420
that allows me to play with some camera

110
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,630
parameters and that would let us sort of

111
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:16,319
see what's up in that respect and

112
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:18,449
furthermore when we're doing when we're

113
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,339
doing our alpha fade one of those I was

114
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:23,219
thinking is the the whole point of the

115
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,109
Alpha fade is really not to be relative

116
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,590
to the camera it's to clip out stuff

117
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,110
like the

118
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:31,409
fluor so it's for that right there and

119
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,150
so when we do that really if you think

120
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,090
about what's happening there is we want

121
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:40,049
the alpha fade to be based more on on

122
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:42,299
the heights of things in Z and not

123
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,449
really on camera because since the

124
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,259
camera is tilted we don't really want

125
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:54,240
things that are closer to us in Y that

126
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:55,379
way to somehow not get faded and things

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,850
that are further away to be faded

128
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,009
because they will have deeper Z's

129
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,379
relative the camera and so I think what

130
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:06,240
we want to do there is is base some of

131
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:09,029
our values not on the actual camera

132
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,879
space but rather on world space and I

133
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:14,819
don't remember if the fog measurement is

134
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,620
the same measurement we use for alpha if

135
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,050
it is then we already have done this

136
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,500
because we already have the ability to

137
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:27,810
set the fog measurement axes and so you

138
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:30,990
know well you get the idea alright so

139
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,180
let's go ahead and do some some basic

140
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,478
stuff here the first thing I want to do

141
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,038
in world mode is start to take a look at

142
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,899
what we're doing in terms of bringing

143
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,339
things into the sim region I think I'm

144
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,288
gonna say just to avoid having

145
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,529
performance issues on our part for the

146
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:48,629
moment I'm also gonna say let's not

147
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:50,788
let's not simulate anything that's more

148
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,009
than one floor up or up or down so

149
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:54,990
there's only one floor away and then we

150
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,848
fog out I'm gonna just make that as a

151
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:01,199
thing just to keep things from getting

152
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:03,659
too crazy in the world so in order to do

153
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,740
that well you know what I shouldn't say

154
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,760
that quite yet we can we can maybe leave

155
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,168
it like that for a little while and just

156
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,879
deal with your artifacts so maybe I'll

157
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:14,009
skip that so I'm just gonna jump right

158
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,579
to putting in the camera stuff and we'll

159
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:18,810
try to work with with that as we go so

160
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:21,689
you can see here we've got our

161
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,280
parameters for the fog and for the Alpha

162
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:24,810
clip they're just something we hacked in

163
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,978
here right before we call the set camera

164
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,139
transform and we just set them new

165
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:29,779
whatever we wanted to set them to but

166
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,400
what we'd like to do here is actually

167
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:37,408
start making these measurements mean

168
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:39,699
something and we'd like to be able to

169
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:42,039
tune them as well and play around

170
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:44,409
and potentially so what I'd like to do

171
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,140
is have some notion of where these

172
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:51,250
things are generally specified and then

173
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:53,829
we can have those be you know can sort

174
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:58,449
of fiddled with in our in our debug UI

175
00:06:53,829 --> 00:07:00,849
potentially and we can also try to have

176
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,769
these be set to something that makes

177
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,960
them a little bit more consistent the

178
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:07,870
Alpha clip being based on something that

179
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,810
doesn't have any relationship to the to

180
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,160
the world is not as good right and so

181
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,879
that's something that we probably want

182
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,740
to to change as well all right so the

183
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,589
first thing that I want to look at is in

184
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,720
terms of fog and alpha clip what I'd

185
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:26,439
like to do in addition to having the fog

186
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,060
be measured around a particular axis and

187
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,639
also I'd like the Alpha clip to be

188
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,379
measured the same way I'd like the fog

189
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,899
and Alpha clips to also be measured

190
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:36,279
relative to some point that I specify as

191
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:38,199
well right

192
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:43,869
in other words I would like there to be

193
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:46,240
some way of saying the the fog and alpha

194
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,819
clip are based off of like the current

195
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,120
floor that I'm on like the simulation

196
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:54,279
center it should be based more on that

197
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,019
then you know then some other you know

198
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,359
arbitrary thing that's that's based on

199
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:59,649
the camera location because our alpha

200
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:06,300
clip and fog are very they're very

201
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:09,310
semantic right they're very much about

202
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,370
they're very much about where we are

203
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:15,160
relative in the level and so the problem

204
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,170
that we're gonna have with the fogging

205
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,780
and the Alpha clip there is that we

206
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:22,660
would like some way of talking about

207
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:24,579
where the camera is in between floor

208
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,810
levels and we'd like to set the Alpha

209
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:30,759
clip to like match that somehow and I'm

210
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,679
not really sure exactly how we would do

211
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,069
that but I think what we could probably

212
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:40,839
do is we can probably just set the Alpha

213
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:44,800
clip such that the clipping happens

214
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:50,580
relative the clipping happens in world

215
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,579
space Z and we use the cameras position

216
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:59,230
versus the world

217
00:08:54,299 --> 00:09:00,879
well I think we're gonna have to just

218
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,560
use I think we're gonna have to use the

219
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,600
simulation center and then the camera

220
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:08,679
position I really can't think of

221
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,509
anything else I mean let's draw it out

222
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:18,969
for a second and you can see the problem

223
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:29,319
that I'm having or will have right so if

224
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:32,410
you imagine what we've got is a series

225
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,460
of floors in our world right and then

226
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:37,889
occasionally we've got things like

227
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:40,840
stairwells down from the upper areas and

228
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:44,799
so what we want here is some way of

229
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:47,950
saying this area wants to fade out as

230
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:50,799
the camera moves and focuses on lower

231
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,450
levels so if my camera is here and it's

232
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,490
pointing down this way here is the

233
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,040
player standing here and the player

234
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,960
moves down here to this location the

235
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,669
camera is gonna interpolate downward and

236
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,590
eventually come to rest somewhere like

237
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:04,059
this now

238
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,639
the first thing you'll notice here is

239
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:09,509
like I saying going based on the camera

240
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,069
Z is erroneous because it's you know

241
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:15,039
doing stuff off of that will mean that

242
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,530
this which is a constant floor height

243
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,449
will have different alpha values as it

244
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,929
goes out which I don't really know that

245
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:26,080
we want if that makes sense so I think

246
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:28,419
we may want to rather specify it based

247
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,210
on the world space Z so that this whole

248
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:33,129
floor fades out at the same time now the

249
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,450
problem that we're going to have and

250
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:37,029
that I don't really know what the

251
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,830
solution to it is like I say we need

252
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:41,019
some good way of specifying this that's

253
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:44,259
consistent and it doesn't produce

254
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:46,029
artifacts is that the interpolation of

255
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:48,159
the camera from here to here might

256
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,899
happen in different circumstances that

257
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,709
are difficult to distinguish without

258
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:56,289
additional information for example if I

259
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,720
have a player standing in a small room

260
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:01,299
the camera might be here whereas if a

261
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,840
player standing in a big room the camera

262
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:06,818
might be here so looking at you know a

263
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,918
zoom between here and here

264
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:10,628
and saying well that should correspond

265
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,548
to some amount to fade out of this

266
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,438
probably because we're starting to come

267
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:20,499
down to go below it it's like well not

268
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:26,139
if I was just doing this so I think what

269
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:29,859
we're going to need is some idea of what

270
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:32,798
the actual fade-out level is that gets

271
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:36,399
interpolated along with the camera so

272
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:38,198
we're sort of saying look we interpolate

273
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,578
the camera position and we also

274
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:44,948
interpolate a value which is how you

275
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:52,978
know in Z we're measuring where we

276
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:52,978
should cut right so I think

277
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:26,970
yeah so OBS has crashed again because

278
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:28,590
you know crashy I have no idea why it's

279
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,600
crashing today it's crashed twice a day

280
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:32,610
whereas it almost never crashes on us so

281
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,220
something has happened that it doesn't

282
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,220
like but I have no idea what of course

283
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,600
where were we

284
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,600
what was the last thing I said

285
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:59,290
it's on a Linux machine it's not on

286
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,810
Windows it's on a Linux machine and it's

287
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:04,028
a dedicated machine it's not even

288
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:06,099
running the stream I mean it's it's

289
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:17,169
streaming the video but it's not running

290
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:21,759
this so all I was gonna say is I think

291
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:23,949
probably what we're gonna want to do is

292
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,588
we're going to want to interpolate a

293
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,990
parameter that tells us we're in here we

294
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:32,650
are so basically like we want to say

295
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,389
okay when we zoom we know what we're

296
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:39,600
focusing on we know where the camera is

297
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:44,199
and then we know that we want everything

298
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:47,730
that is inside this floor to be visible

299
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:52,450
so we can compute where along the camera

300
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:54,879
Z that is or in world Z how where that

301
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,310
is and we can use that as our clipping

302
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:01,559
boundaries and so I think that's all we

303
00:13:57,309 --> 00:14:01,559
really want to do if that makes sense

304
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:07,509
so let me go ahead and and just sort of

305
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:10,929
sketch in what that would look like here

306
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:12,549
for us so first thing I want to do is I

307
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:15,159
want to just look at the shader and

308
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:18,309
remind us because we've written it a way

309
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:20,620
back when I want to go ahead and look at

310
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:23,259
inside the Z bias program when it

311
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,200
actually figures out what's going to

312
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:28,899
happen here I want to take a look and

313
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,629
find out what it's doing as far as the

314
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:34,360
lighting so you can see in here where we

315
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:36,159
do our Z bias program we compute the fog

316
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,909
distance by looking at that fog

317
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:42,309
direction there right and then we've got

318
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:44,980
in here the stuff that actually applies

319
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:47,139
the fog and other nonsense which you

320
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,580
know this this stuff will get finalized

321
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:50,230
at some point so it's not gonna happen

322
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,680
exact like this but this is the basic

323
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,909
idea so if you look at the the fog

324
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,349
amount the Alpha amount what you could

325
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:58,689
see here is they're both operating on

326
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,149
fog distance and that's actually good

327
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:04,030
the reason that's good is because it

328
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:07,120
means that everything will properly

329
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,389
align to the world z-axis if I tell it

330
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,310
to

331
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,319
right I can also tell to use the camera

332
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:14,018
if I want but it means that both alpha

333
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,680
clip and fog will both align to the to

334
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:19,950
the world Z which is what I wanted so

335
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:23,769
then what I really need to do is just

336
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:27,430
adjust these parameters dynamically to

337
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:30,070
make sure that they you know slide

338
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:32,439
around what those fogging places should

339
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:35,079
be so that they correspond more to where

340
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,060
the floors are and less to the actual

341
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:38,739
distance from the camera that you are

342
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:40,328
which is less what I'm going for like

343
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,829
I'm trying to have a more semantic

344
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:46,449
coloration of these things not so much a

345
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:49,328
realistic like distance based sort of

346
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:52,420
thing so if we look at how that's going

347
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:54,639
to go in here you can see the way that

348
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:57,129
this works is to compute the fog

349
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,049
distance we take the inner product of

350
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:00,970
the direction that we're trying to

351
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:06,069
measure which is what I specified here

352
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:08,079
and the camera relative vertex so we're

353
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,660
talking about the vector that goes from

354
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:17,379
the camera to the vertex measured along

355
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:20,679
this axis right and so that's really you

356
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:26,919
know fine with me I think we can just

357
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:29,948
about say that that's I I mean that

358
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:32,828
pretty much makes this trivial it means

359
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:34,870
all I have to do is set these values as

360
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:36,549
iterate it as interpolated camera

361
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,259
parameters and set them based on where I

362
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:44,528
know the camera is which I always always

363
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:46,659
do and we should be fine there may be

364
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:49,259
some squink enos there that we have to

365
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:51,159
do when we're doing like offset

366
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,879
interpolations to make sure that the

367
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:56,919
speeds don't get weird but we'll cross

368
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,809
that bridge when we come to it it's a

369
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,328
very subtle thing and it wouldn't be a

370
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:03,099
huge problem even if it was happening so

371
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:05,318
what I want to do now is take a look at

372
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,750
the camera code here so in the game

373
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:11,769
camera we got this nicely boiled down so

374
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:13,539
that we really don't have any kind of

375
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:15,818
additional parameters here that we don't

376
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:18,609
need so now what we want to do is again

377
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:20,980
we want to avoid adding any parameters

378
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,219
here that we don't need we want to make

379
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,199
sure

380
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,360
that we have the minimum number of

381
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,390
parameters for interpolation so that we

382
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,939
don't proliferate you know possibilities

383
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:34,809
for bugs there so looking at how the fog

384
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:37,419
and Alpha clip stuff shakes out what I

385
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:42,369
really want to know here is I know where

386
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:43,480
the camera is going to be and so you

387
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:45,369
know when I interpolate camera from one

388
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,860
person to another that's just gonna work

389
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:49,779
the P target peep interpolation will

390
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:51,158
just work and we have some you know we

391
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:52,720
want to put in some better interpolators

392
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:54,390
than what's in there now but it will

393
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,730
just work it'll just end up at Target P

394
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,890
and we know that so then what we need is

395
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,750
some way of fog and Alpha clip getting

396
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,780
set to the right values they should be

397
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,808
set up for this target P so we want to

398
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:11,259
parameterize this in some way that

399
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:13,359
allows us to do exactly that if we look

400
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:16,150
at how these are set up one thing that

401
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:19,990
we can say is they're probably always

402
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,429
going to be the same distance apart and

403
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,269
furthermore they're probably always

404
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:27,850
going to be aligned so if we look I'm

405
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:31,029
reaching over to my my drawing pad here

406
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:34,750
if we look at what's gonna happen to a

407
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:37,750
series of Z Heights here in world Z is

408
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:42,159
if I actually you know look at at sort

409
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:44,230
of the the separation here right what

410
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,419
I'm gonna do is I've got some place the

411
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,029
character standing on I know I want the

412
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:51,460
Alpha fade to like start somewhere and

413
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:53,259
end somewhere right so I know I want

414
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,460
like this stuff to have been faded out

415
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:56,440
or something so I guess actually

416
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,419
technically it's more like this like

417
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,580
there's the Alpha fade region so

418
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:02,740
wherever I'm looking at you know I've

419
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:05,678
got the Alpha fade region is like that

420
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,750
much above it or something right and I

421
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,690
know that the fog region is like this

422
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:13,690
much below it so probably what I can do

423
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:16,509
is just remember this value so I'm gonna

424
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:20,100
see if I can get away with just setting

425
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:22,720
like a camera basis V Z value there and

426
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:25,839
basing everything else off of just that

427
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:30,819
value so I'm going to do like expected

428
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:33,158
you know floor at Z value here and so

429
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:34,599
when we're interpolating that will be

430
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,419
the thing that we're interpreting

431
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:40,178
- and then these parameters will all be

432
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:43,480
set off of this expected floor at Z

433
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:45,970
value and again this we know will stay

434
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,470
the same because we always have and I

435
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,980
don't ask me why I did that when I could

436
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,298
have done that we'll always have

437
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,548
measurements being conducted in world

438
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:56,648
space we're not going to conduct the

439
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:58,089
measurement the measurements in camera

440
00:19:56,648 --> 00:20:02,319
space because that's just not what I'm

441
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:05,500
looking for okay so if we know that

442
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:11,408
we've got an expected floor Z of some

443
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:13,480
value right what I want to do here is

444
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:16,659
say however far the floor is out I know

445
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,878
I want to go say one more floor down or

446
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:22,379
two more floors down or something before

447
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:25,269
I actually start to fog things out right

448
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:28,569
so if I know that from this floor to the

449
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:30,849
next floor is something like you know

450
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:33,009
five units or six units or something I

451
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:34,808
can set the fog values to something like

452
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:36,128
this and this should fog them out and

453
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:38,648
you know again these are parameters we

454
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:40,178
can play with that like - whatever looks

455
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:43,839
right and so that'll be us putting those

456
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:45,909
in the UI to play with as well similarly

457
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,528
for the floor Z this way we know that we

458
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:49,450
want to alpha put things that's behind

459
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:51,759
where the floor is so we're talking

460
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,819
about something that says well if I'm at

461
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,788
a particular floor level here then I

462
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:59,829
want to go up a little bit - no you know

463
00:20:57,788 --> 00:21:03,339
okay so it's like three point five two

464
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:05,288
maybe five or you know four point five

465
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:06,658
or something is where that would be you

466
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:10,658
know again assuming that a standard

467
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:16,690
floor is maybe five five meters up and

468
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:19,899
down right that's what we set it to all

469
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:22,090
right so what we need now is then to

470
00:21:19,898 --> 00:21:23,558
actually set and interpolate this value

471
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:27,278
in some way that's actually going to be

472
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:31,168
useful if I set expected floor Z at here

473
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:33,128
I'm sorry not set it expected floors

474
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:35,500
there we go

475
00:21:33,128 --> 00:21:38,619
if I set floor Z equal to whatever this

476
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,259
is in the game camera so inside the

477
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:43,689
cameras you know struck they're grabbing

478
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:45,940
that out then all I need to do to make

479
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,870
this work is actually have this set to

480
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,419
something useful at some point

481
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:52,489
right which we can do inside the

482
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:54,500
simulation when we update the camera so

483
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,630
when we update the camera for the you

484
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,579
know looking at a particular entity then

485
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:01,010
what we can do here is say okay you know

486
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:04,460
this crappy interpolator will just do

487
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:07,940
the same thing here where we have the

488
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:11,690
camera expected floor at Z will get

489
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,759
moved in some way right and so what we'd

490
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,370
want to do here is say yeah do the same

491
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,470
exact crappy thing as before you know

492
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:21,259
something like this and again this is

493
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,669
super crappy don't do this at home we're

494
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:24,798
just putting this inner to make sure we

495
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:26,028
got a parameterize correctly and who

496
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:27,710
knows if we finish the debug camera

497
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:30,950
stuff to like you know maybe the next

498
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:36,288
thing we do is is good make a good solid

499
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:38,298
interpolator here right so anyway but

500
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,648
you know this kind of one will work fine

501
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:40,819
just to get you to the point where you

502
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:42,439
can see if it's working because it will

503
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,490
still arrive at the right values the

504
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,230
reason these aren't good is because

505
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,298
their framerate dependent so you really

506
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,009
don't want an exponential like framerate

507
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:51,558
dependent thing it'll lead to

508
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:53,000
oscillation and and unpredictable

509
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:54,379
behavior if you change the frame rate so

510
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,210
like that's we've talked about this

511
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,570
before but that's why you generally

512
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:02,960
don't you don't leave these in but

513
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:04,398
they're nice and quick if you haven't

514
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,750
put an interpolator in your codebase yet

515
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:08,329
once you have it interpolated code base

516
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,349
yet you just call it so at some point

517
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:14,210
we'll put one in and then we'll just

518
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:16,759
call it so here's our delta p step let's

519
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:20,390
do our delta z step in the same way so

520
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:23,629
you have expected floors the app and and

521
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,700
that's gonna be on the camera and let's

522
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:33,260
see here we know we need the target to

523
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:34,909
write so here's us taking the difference

524
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:38,240
between those two things and here's me

525
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:40,370
adding it back in right and so we're

526
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,370
just going to going to move towards that

527
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:45,829
target value as we go so that leaves us

528
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:48,259
with only one more thing left to do

529
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:51,379
which is to actually set whatever that

530
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:53,720
target Z is going to be and so when

531
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,480
we're in a room you know we can see here

532
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,519
we're doing all this stuff it actually

533
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,019
we don't even really need to compute

534
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,420
this value because what you can see here

535
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:04,900
is we're actually

536
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:07,470
already starting with it the offset Z

537
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,390
this target offset Z that we use here is

538
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,339
actually the Z value we're moving back

539
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:15,430
in the camera we could just use that now

540
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:19,149
again that's gonna be angled though so

541
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:22,509
we we still want to probably do the

542
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:26,290
measurement of how it's going to map on

543
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:28,839
to our camera vector I'm sorry onto the

544
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:33,670
world vector and so this right here

545
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:35,230
which is like the camera arm right the

546
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:39,880
thing that let goes from the target out

547
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:43,269
to the camera that is what we would

548
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,770
measure to find out the Z length now you

549
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:46,539
can see that this goes in the opposite

550
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:49,180
direction so that also means that the

551
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:50,889
the target expected floor at Z in

552
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,930
addition to just being the inner product

553
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,220
of it it's gonna be negative now we

554
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,870
don't actually need to take the inner

555
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,630
product because we know that we just

556
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:01,449
need the Z right we know that our

557
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:05,860
measurement is just along the z axis so

558
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:08,170
we don't really have to do that we can

559
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:11,849
just do this and know that that's the

560
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:13,720
actual value but again this Z is going

561
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:16,509
well that's actually still correct

562
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,329
because that Z's is going upward and so

563
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:20,529
if we were to negate it and look at the

564
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:22,000
negative vector it would still be the

565
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:23,950
same so if if that's actually exactly

566
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,759
the Z value that we want it just comes

567
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,610
right out of there

568
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:30,700
and and we're good to go right so once

569
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:32,469
we have all of that stuff set it should

570
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,990
just work I don't think we need anything

571
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,500
else going on there and so then it's

572
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:41,230
just a matter of a debugging this and B

573
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,750
makeups supposed to be build C and B

574
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,839
actually setting those values in the

575
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:49,089
other code to be something logical right

576
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,919
because right now they they really

577
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:56,490
aren't if that makes sense

578
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,490
oh that's cool what's going on there

579
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:04,990
it's like right at that height oh that

580
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:07,629
looks so neat all right also by the way

581
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:11,380
I kind of want to maybe start us off in

582
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:13,120
the orphanage because that has more well

583
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:25,960
know you know

584
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:28,149
this is fine that just looks so cool

585
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,549
I kind of feel like we're gonna need

586
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:34,140
ground-based fog after looking at this

587
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:34,139
it just looks really neat

588
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:40,449
again another reminder that our fog is

589
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:44,110
busted alpha value eyes but I think that

590
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:47,860
just looks really cool we're gonna have

591
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:55,689
to put some fog in there alright that

592
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:58,089
just looks so cool alright so moving

593
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:00,549
along what I want to do now is just go

594
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:01,899
like okay let's debug that let's have a

595
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:04,419
way of setting those parameters

596
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:08,679
ourselves and we could just tweak with

597
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:11,289
them in in the using commune oh the fact

598
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,850
that we can hot load code but the

599
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:14,859
problem with that is the turnaround time

600
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:16,509
is still even though our compile isn't

601
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:18,089
that long it's still longer than we

602
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:20,950
would like for tuning a value like that

603
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:24,189
so what I'd like to do is have a way of

604
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:26,200
using the camera mode here to somehow

605
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,269
edit those values right in the world

606
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:32,049
mode to just to just let us edit those

607
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:34,359
somehow and so what I want is some way

608
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:37,480
of storing these I want these values to

609
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:42,339
be exposed somewhere where they can be

610
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,230
edited to me and I don't really know

611
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:45,849
what the best place to put that is we

612
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,440
have the game state and I feel like

613
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:49,750
that's probably the best place to put it

614
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,120
just because I don't know where else we

615
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,650
would bother putting it at the moment

616
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:56,500
they're just sort of some constants that

617
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,300
could just be specified wherever and you

618
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,130
know at some point if we got a little

619
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:02,799
harder core about saving and loading

620
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:04,840
values we could make a general way that

621
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,940
you did that but at the moment I don't

622
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:09,250
really want to do that so I'm not going

623
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:13,029
to so let's just look at what we would

624
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:16,630
store here we need like our fog start

625
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:19,519
value and our fog end value we need our

626
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:24,790
alpha start value and our

627
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:28,430
alpha end value these are a little bit

628
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:32,119
ambiguous because it's it's kind of

629
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:35,720
difficult maybe I maybe will do fog man

630
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:37,909
fog max and alpha min alpha max just so

631
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,009
we know what they mean like the values

632
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:44,300
that are like the hires and lows if that

633
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:47,210
makes sense so in in a way you know like

634
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:50,960
if for example we just change this to

635
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:53,059
that right it would allow us to always

636
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,730
know what we were talking about here you

637
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:57,710
know what I mean

638
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:04,519
so I don't know that that maybe seems

639
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:08,090
like a good idea so I would say if we do

640
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:10,279
gamestate to fog men and I'll just

641
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:13,429
pretend that we're gonna set these into

642
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:16,670
some initial state here as well so the

643
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:17,900
fog min is 6 that's what or figment is

644
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:26,450
the case maybe

645
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:37,450
and the fog max is 30 right then here we

646
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:47,000
would have alpha min equals 3.5 and the

647
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:49,190
alpha max which is 4.5 and then what we

648
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,349
want to do here is just have that

649
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:54,740
initialized when we start up and then

650
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:57,829
allow the editor access to it so it can

651
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:59,720
just be edited so yeah look in here

652
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:01,099
where we just initialize some stuff you

653
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,360
know I'm just like okay there are some

654
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:11,389
things to edit if you want to and in the

655
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:13,669
editor will just say hey you know you

656
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:17,900
can edit that when you're in camera edit

657
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:19,430
mode and we'll pass the gamestate to

658
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,890
that function sorry about going behind

659
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,630
my head there and we'll just say that

660
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:26,690
the gamestate comes down here as

661
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:29,570
something that can be edited so that

662
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:31,940
seems good and then I just need the

663
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:32,869
camera editor to actually expose those

664
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:47,720
somehow

665
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:49,489
so not super hard I don't think I don't

666
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,379
know why we do begin row and row we

667
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:59,028
probably can just do new row so well

668
00:30:54,378 --> 00:31:07,519
like tell me why we did that did we do

669
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:09,829
that for some reason it looks like the

670
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,490
reason we did that is because this no

671
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:21,319
line feed modifier was supposed to be in

672
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:23,179
the mix I'm not sure how I feel about

673
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:26,480
that cuz like we should like do how much

674
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:28,659
do we really care about no line feed you

675
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,659
know

676
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:43,499
does anyone even ever set that like do

677
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:47,788
we do we even have such a thing as an

678
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:49,860
airline fee does anyone use that I I

679
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:58,019
don't see anyone who ever could really

680
00:31:49,859 --> 00:32:01,319
set it oh wait a minute

681
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:04,378
so does that does that mean that by

682
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:07,798
default you just are on a new line every

683
00:32:04,378 --> 00:32:10,199
time if that's the case maybe I'm

684
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:11,608
smarter than I thought I was because

685
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,769
that means that you wouldn't even have

686
00:32:11,608 --> 00:32:23,220
to do begin row and row for individual

687
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:24,210
items that's kind of cool so I want to

688
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,339
be able to put an editable

689
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:32,369
f32 in here right and you know we've got

690
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:36,868
it's sort of like an editable P like we

691
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:42,199
had before where you could do this sort

692
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:45,298
of thing where did that go edible P XY

693
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,340
so we pretty much want this exact same

694
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:49,710
thing but we want one that just does one

695
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:52,558
of these you know what I mean

696
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:54,509
and so I think I want to just for now

697
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,308
cut and paste this I don't really want

698
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:58,200
to reuse that code because I I don't

699
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:02,548
know how I really want these to shake

700
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,769
out I may want some like fairly

701
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:06,960
different stuff to happen in the case

702
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:08,849
where there's two versus the case where

703
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,249
there's one so I don't really want to

704
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:13,498
like regice it by saying that I'm going

705
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:15,358
to use the same thing for these two or

706
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:17,548
anything like that I want to just handle

707
00:33:15,358 --> 00:33:19,618
it as a completely separate case that

708
00:33:17,548 --> 00:33:22,618
can be modified yeah however it wants to

709
00:33:19,618 --> 00:33:25,648
be modified so I think that's what I

710
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:28,819
would prefer so anyway we just want an

711
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:32,638
edible px thing here where we can say

712
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:34,259
yeah like just whatever it is doesn't

713
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:36,508
matter if this is the only one that's

714
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:38,099
ever going to be there and we're gonna

715
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:40,170
edit

716
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:43,409
whatever this label is we know what the

717
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:46,110
min is and what the max is you know

718
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:47,580
there's there's probably a pretty I

719
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:51,179
don't know

720
00:33:47,579 --> 00:34:07,529
same max somewhere but we know that

721
00:33:51,180 --> 00:34:10,519
we've basically got like this for the

722
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:16,980
Alpha if we do it as a plus or a minus

723
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:18,630
it's you know it's gonna be it it

724
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,090
depends on how we choose to do it here

725
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:25,650
you know if we do it as a minus right

726
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:27,240
then it looks like that versus a plus so

727
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:31,940
like I said I'm not sure exactly how we

728
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:34,139
want that to work out but in here I

729
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,900
think I'll just leave them all positive

730
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,690
and let it let it flow from that that's

731
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,610
really all there would be to it I think

732
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:46,769
that would just let us adjust those

733
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:50,789
however we want and go ahead and set

734
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:53,670
those up here I think that would give us

735
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:56,730
the ability to edit those just an in

736
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:59,250
real time right like we need these to be

737
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:04,340
addresses though so it can actually

738
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:06,650
change them and then that's it right i

739
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:10,230
hears handmade hero

740
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:15,869
if I actually go to the camera code Oh

741
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:23,460
nope gotta pass that too I think that's

742
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:26,940
no more errors now right yeah so in

743
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,440
theory those should have got initialized

744
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:33,329
if we started the game but we didn't

745
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:35,820
start the game if you remember so like

746
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:37,500
we we just did live code reloading so

747
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,840
they didn't get set to any initial

748
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,869
values so that's why they came as as all

749
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:45,240
zeroes there anyway you can see here I

750
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:49,319
can play with these however I want to

751
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:51,389
write what I don't know here is some

752
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,809
there's actually some more important in

753
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:55,049
for me

754
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:56,940
that I would like to have which is where

755
00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:00,960
that where the camera thinks the floor

756
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:03,840
height is at the moment and so I want if

757
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,240
I could to get the world mode I'd like

758
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:11,010
to get that displayed right I would like

759
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:15,629
that to be shown here and so what I want

760
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:19,560
to do is have the world mode camera

761
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:22,500
actually get reported on so it can show

762
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:26,969
this this information now I'm not sure

763
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:33,690
exactly how I would want to do this but

764
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:35,789
I almost I almost want to say that since

765
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:39,450
all this stuff is happening in here it

766
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:44,190
almost feels like you know this kind of

767
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:45,719
should go like this all of this instead

768
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:49,170
of putting it there I feel like it

769
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:53,309
should maybe be in the you know in the

770
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:55,769
world mode itself right and then instead

771
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:58,170
of that in getting initialized in here

772
00:36:55,769 --> 00:37:03,960
it actually gets initialized in the

773
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:06,300
world mode so like when you actually

774
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:19,019
create the world mode here you would

775
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:23,250
actually set it like this and once we

776
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:25,110
set that up instead of having the editor

777
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,780
being there I just wonder if we could

778
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,610
just put the editor here right so the

779
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,860
camera editor rather than getting called

780
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,860
this way actually gets called this way

781
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:39,769
you know what I mean

782
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:53,119
and then that feels better to me because

783
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:55,760
then we can also inspect anything else

784
00:37:53,119 --> 00:38:00,859
about the world note that we wanted to

785
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:04,850
oops caps lock I don't know even why

786
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:07,400
that key exists on the keyboard so yeah

787
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:09,949
like if we just do this then what we

788
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:14,530
could do is say well whatever the layout

789
00:38:09,949 --> 00:38:16,879
is that we're using here world mode wise

790
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:19,700
we'll just fill that out with this stuff

791
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,470
and we can place in here in addition to

792
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:25,189
these editable parameters you know I

793
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:28,519
could also put in what the cameras

794
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:35,659
location was at the moment so I could

795
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:40,130
say well you know that War Z or like

796
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:42,409
expected lore Z and it's you know this

797
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:46,010
is what I expect it to be you know what

798
00:38:42,409 --> 00:38:48,799
I mean we could then say whatever the

799
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:56,050
camera is expected floor Z is we could

800
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:56,050
also say like this oops

801
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:07,519
so we could say what the target was too

802
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:14,500
you know so I feel like that would make

803
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:14,500
sense and and yeah

804
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:26,720
so game world mode versus world mode

805
00:39:30,289 --> 00:39:40,500
know why we've got that there is no such

806
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:44,059
thing as world mode so I'm not sure what

807
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,059
how that got in there

808
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:57,300
so now we need to do is have some way in

809
00:39:53,039 --> 00:40:00,000
the in-game editor of actually you know

810
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,890
we need some way to dispatch this off of

811
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,179
the world mode and there's a couple

812
00:40:01,889 --> 00:40:09,449
different ways we could do that but we

813
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:12,509
can look at some different ones I'm

814
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:15,539
assuming the game world mode what's

815
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:21,420
going on here I'm super confused struct

816
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:23,579
game world mode oh it's alright I'm

817
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:30,300
having a bad morning it's game mode

818
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:32,969
world not game world mode ah ok so

819
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,910
looking at the camera stuff here we need

820
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:39,329
to get these values out of the camera

821
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:44,699
properly it's expected floor at Z anak

822
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:48,360
target expected floor at Z and think

823
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:50,759
that's mostly all we need there when we

824
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,470
call out the to the camera editor here

825
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,310
like I said I don't really think we need

826
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:59,339
that anymore so the interesting thing

827
00:40:56,309 --> 00:41:01,799
here is when we call update and render

828
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:05,100
editor really it's just we want the

829
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,080
layout box stuff to happen so you know I

830
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:09,839
mean I can do this in a number of ways

831
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:14,039
and really the only thing is you would

832
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,870
need to pass the game the world mode

833
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:19,860
here if that was what was currently

834
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:21,960
being used and you know

835
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:25,500
we could look to see if the game-mode is

836
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:29,789
world right we could say like if game

837
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:32,000
state game mode equals game mode worlds

838
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:36,329
then we can run the camera editor

839
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:43,440
otherwise we can't you know and that

840
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:45,210
seems totally fine again it's kind of

841
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,269
just hacked in there it's not as thought

842
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:50,220
through as I would have liked but it's

843
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:53,579
fine

844
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:56,129
so yeah so once we have that we should

845
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:59,610
be able to see this a little bit more

846
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:02,010
specifically and we should be able to

847
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:05,910
guess to what extent these are correct

848
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:10,370
values as well so right now it's saying

849
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:15,659
that it expects the floor Z to be at 19

850
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:17,960
down right or close to 20 and I guess my

851
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:19,339
first question is does does that seem

852
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:24,199
[Music]

853
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:28,280
you know reasonable so if we look here

854
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:31,049
at you know get camera offset Z for dim

855
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,000
it seems like it's it is plausible for

856
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:35,190
higher stuff right I mean that that is a

857
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,070
reasonable distance to be off if the y

858
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:41,250
count was greater than 13 you know it

859
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:45,289
could be that Y just was 21 so that all

860
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:50,610
seems you know certainly possible right

861
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:52,380
so if the expected floor Z is is at that

862
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,570
value then what we're doing is we're

863
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:57,930
taking that and we're adding to it you

864
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:59,580
know the these values here so alpha min

865
00:42:57,929 --> 00:43:02,009
is getting subtracted away these are

866
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:05,130
getting subtracted away and fog men and

867
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:07,980
fog max are getting added in so if I

868
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:11,010
were to take these values and add them

869
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,449
and make them really high right so that

870
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,640
means that the fog is not having any

871
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:17,129
effect similarly if I took these values

872
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,869
and made them very high it should have

873
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,250
no effect as well but you know what I'm

874
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:22,589
seeing here is that it does I wonder if

875
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:24,719
that's cuz these are backwards I think

876
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,579
that's what's happening there yeah so

877
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,019
alpha min and alpha max are actually

878
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:29,489
backwards in terms of how they're being

879
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:33,320
used in the computation so we should

880
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:33,319
probably rename those two right

881
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,920
right you can see it building up

882
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:45,369
properly that way so alpha min and alpha

883
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:53,860
max need to be swapped when they're

884
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:55,960
getting used in the world mode now

885
00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:02,620
granted I don't understand why that

886
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:04,269
would be the case I guess I don't know

887
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:08,799
how we were expecting those things to be

888
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:13,000
used but I guess that's the answer is

889
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,760
like that and so looking at this like

890
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,559
this also looks wrong to me like so

891
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:23,530
again something's weird here because

892
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:26,710
just looking at those values I should be

893
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:28,540
seeing these happening in world Z and so

894
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:32,349
why they're not happening in a world see

895
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:35,230
I'm not sure right so like looking over

896
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:39,279
there the fact that that is fading in

897
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:43,690
differently then this is I don't quite

898
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,840
get so there's one of the things I think

899
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:48,340
I would do before we get further on

900
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,289
debugging this just looking at how those

901
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:52,000
are parameterised I think it's more

902
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:57,880
intuitive if I parametrize them the

903
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,820
other way round so maybe I could say

904
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:04,150
what is the fog point and what is the

905
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:07,740
fog span right so like the fog starts

906
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:13,180
here and the fog depth is set separately

907
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:15,639
so it's more like you know this you know

908
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:21,179
what I mean and so this is sort of like

909
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:21,179
saying well it's it's going to be this

910
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:37,970
so that I'm really just talking about a

911
00:45:36,048 --> 00:45:40,400
length you know what I mean

912
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:43,730
I'm really starting to length there and

913
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,559
so I can set that range however I want

914
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:49,969
and I can set you know that separately

915
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:52,789
so here you know if we were to preserve

916
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:55,338
these values it would be 24 long and

917
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:58,519
here it would be one long and then you

918
00:45:55,338 --> 00:46:04,369
could you could expand or contract those

919
00:45:58,518 --> 00:46:08,419
two things separately so it's sort of

920
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:10,039
like making it a little bit easier to

921
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:20,269
adjust the thing you were trying to

922
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:22,640
adjust and I'll forget sue yes so

923
00:46:20,268 --> 00:46:23,929
looking at those values there let's

924
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,868
let's try to play with some of these

925
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:30,199
values here so in terms of setting the

926
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:33,818
Fogg minimum like just looking at what's

927
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:37,730
happening there right and the fog span

928
00:46:33,818 --> 00:46:38,960
what what I'm not really under just

929
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,759
looking at this it doesn't make any

930
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,500
sense so something really weirds going

931
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:49,099
on looking at the fog minimum I'm not

932
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:52,009
like this value what if it's set to that

933
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:54,470
clothes should be fogging out everything

934
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:57,889
and the fact that I have to set it down

935
00:46:54,469 --> 00:47:00,649
to that makes like no sense to me at all

936
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:01,940
so I'm something about this is not

937
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,650
correct

938
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,079
like the measurements are not happening

939
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:08,720
in the right space or something but

940
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,440
something's borked right like something

941
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:13,730
is is very strange here

942
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:20,778
so let's go try to figure out what that

943
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:22,608
is I'm going to pop over to the Z bias

944
00:47:20,778 --> 00:47:27,068
renderer here and just take a look at

945
00:47:22,608 --> 00:47:31,670
this again so when I create one of these

946
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:34,548
vertices here you can see when I take

947
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:36,619
the Z vertex it shouldn't really matter

948
00:47:34,548 --> 00:47:39,860
in either case here which one I'm using

949
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:42,200
just looking at these you know

950
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,630
there really isn't any difference

951
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:49,039
between Z vertex and in vertex they're

952
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:50,450
the same vert P X Y Z is all you're

953
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:51,909
going to the W coordinates what's

954
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:55,369
different front and we're not using that

955
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:59,899
so the camera position as it comes down

956
00:47:55,369 --> 00:48:02,329
to us that's actually pushed on in the

957
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:04,369
shader and then we use whatever that

958
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:06,739
camera P that gets moved on there we are

959
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:12,889
subtracting those two to produce the

960
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:23,599
vector right now that's all in world

961
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:26,359
space and I don't really see anything

962
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:30,679
odd about that I am gonna double check

963
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:32,480
what we passed down for that just so we

964
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:34,969
can figure out if there's any weirdness

965
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:39,590
there but I want to make sure that the

966
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:43,219
camera P is set properly inside our code

967
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:45,559
here and and nothing weird is going on

968
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:47,299
so you can see our prog camera P there

969
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:52,159
with a set up camera P and all that

970
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:55,550
stuff so the render setup is getting

971
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:58,489
passed a used program begin and that

972
00:48:55,550 --> 00:49:00,260
just comes in through the entries so

973
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:02,209
it's exactly what you would expect

974
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,850
there wasn't anything weird happening

975
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:06,650
there so whatever the camera P is that

976
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:13,099
gets passed down here is the one that

977
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:16,340
would go into the system right so we

978
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:18,980
should in theory see that camera P flow

979
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,660
all the way through and so it's whatever

980
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,920
we would be passing to set camera

981
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:33,170
transform that is what we would then use

982
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:36,440
for the camera P now this is bad so

983
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:40,880
that's part of our problem here probably

984
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:42,860
right in that for some reason this is

985
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,170
based off the near clip plane and that

986
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:47,420
was probably vestigial we definitely

987
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:49,990
don't want that so I'm gonna remove that

988
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,990
as well

989
00:49:52,280 --> 00:50:01,110
that is should not affect our fog at all

990
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:03,539
so that's sort of a separate issue but

991
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:09,150
that will help us tune the Alpha clip

992
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:11,489
better so now I just again going back to

993
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:14,460
what I'm not sure is if this fog start

994
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:19,319
and end distance is specified there and

995
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:21,630
the direction we've got if I take how

996
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:24,059
far I am along the z axis from the

997
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:26,250
camera then that should correspond

998
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:36,139
pretty cleanly to those values we were

999
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:36,139
computing before so when we do this I

1000
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,559
don't really know why we were getting

1001
00:50:39,659 --> 00:50:42,559
any problem there

1002
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:55,949
that looks like a pretty sane

1003
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:58,640
computation right we're just taking the

1004
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:58,639
alpha amount

1005
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:17,099
we can actually also see here why we're

1006
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:19,049
getting our bug with the fog right

1007
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:19,920
remember we were having fringing but a

1008
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:23,340
bug with the fog

1009
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,500
so remember premultiplied alpha fog

1010
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:27,690
amount alpha amount here's our color

1011
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,039
we're taking our texture sample we're

1012
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,570
multiplying it by the fragment color

1013
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,519
multiplied by the alpha mouth that's

1014
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:35,190
correct because everything including the

1015
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:37,500
RGB should get B be modified by the

1016
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,659
Alpha to stay and premultiplied alpha so

1017
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,820
that all works and the clip alpha work

1018
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:44,279
would work properly we come down here we

1019
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:48,110
do a surface reflect RGB equals lerp

1020
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:51,200
between the mod color and the fog color

1021
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:56,539
no multiplication by the alpha value

1022
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:59,609
right so this really needs to happen

1023
00:51:56,539 --> 00:52:02,639
beforehand or it needs to be multiplied

1024
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:10,250
here by the alpha amount so one or the

1025
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:10,250
other but not neither right so this

1026
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:22,410
needs to do this or something right if

1027
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:24,150
we're just setting the a this way then

1028
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:27,000
what I would say there is like okay

1029
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:29,579
since if we're gonna blend just the XYZ

1030
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,139
if we if we blended everything we'd be

1031
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:36,779
fine but if we're gonna blend just the

1032
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:38,759
XYZ or I should say the RGB well in fact

1033
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,410
just looking at this I think we should

1034
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,610
just blend the whole thing so I guess

1035
00:52:40,409 --> 00:52:45,389
what I'd say is we should probably just

1036
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:48,900
do this and then set the fog colors

1037
00:52:45,389 --> 00:52:51,210
alpha properly right so when the fog

1038
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:57,960
color comes in here went and we get that

1039
00:52:51,210 --> 00:53:00,269
smooth in I think we want to have that

1040
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,579
fog alpha be set to some understandable

1041
00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:04,829
thing you know what I mean we want the

1042
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,539
fog alpha to be set to something and we

1043
00:53:04,829 --> 00:53:10,860
want to pre multiply that something as

1044
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:15,059
well so that it blends properly I guess

1045
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:19,079
I'm thinking it through though since we

1046
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:20,849
don't want fog to be alpha based I'm

1047
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:23,068
gonna I'm gonna say

1048
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:25,140
I'm gonna take that back I'm gonna say I

1049
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:30,568
think the easiest way to do it would be

1050
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:32,328
to do it ahead of time actually so in

1051
00:53:30,568 --> 00:53:35,849
here when we figure out the fog amount

1052
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:37,829
and we you know take the text sample and

1053
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:39,599
we do the alpha amount x frag Clark

1054
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:43,528
comes text sample I think what we want

1055
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:46,349
to do is actually lerp those values

1056
00:53:43,528 --> 00:53:48,630
before doing the pre multiplication so

1057
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:50,970
we can basically take the fog value pre

1058
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:53,900
multiply the fraud color then snap in

1059
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:58,129
the alpha amount maybe in the end

1060
00:53:53,900 --> 00:54:03,900
shouldn't all just come out in the wash

1061
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:06,239
the problem is that let's say the you

1062
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:11,579
know what's the fog value what's its

1063
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:13,380
alpha value going to be you know and our

1064
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:15,269
thing's gonna become more solid as they

1065
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:18,028
get fogged I don't know right like I'm

1066
00:54:15,268 --> 00:54:19,379
not that's the part that I'm just not

1067
00:54:18,028 --> 00:54:21,088
sure about it seems like you want to

1068
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:24,778
preserve the alpha value but you can't

1069
00:54:21,088 --> 00:54:28,920
really preserve the Alpha value properly

1070
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:32,909
if you don't blend in non pre multiply

1071
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,588
it space so you get whatever the text

1072
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:37,798
samples alpha is and you're gonna have

1073
00:54:34,588 --> 00:54:40,349
to multiply the fog by that all right

1074
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:43,940
here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say

1075
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:43,940
that the fog color gets multiplied by

1076
00:54:45,108 --> 00:54:51,929
the total alpha so basically whatever

1077
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:56,278
the mod colors alpha is that's what the

1078
00:54:51,929 --> 00:54:58,108
fog color gets gets multiplied by and

1079
00:54:56,278 --> 00:55:00,838
then when you do this blended way it

1080
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:03,869
should just work right because this is

1081
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:06,088
now the same pre multiply as this so the

1082
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:07,700
Alpha values are equivalent and then off

1083
00:55:06,088 --> 00:55:10,349
you go

1084
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:13,608
that seems like the best plan to me

1085
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:13,609
don't quote me on it

1086
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:27,789
okay back to our show it didn't like

1087
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:31,159
that what didn't you like

1088
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:35,210
am I not I mean I may have to do it down

1089
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:38,089
here because it may not want me

1090
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:43,340
modifying a smooth in value which I can

1091
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:45,620
understand that makes sense alright and

1092
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:47,329
so now we shouldn't have that bug with

1093
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:51,049
fogging either where we were getting

1094
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:53,269
like fringing artifacts so that's good

1095
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:55,700
alright so let's take a look at our

1096
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:56,929
situation with the fog now and see what

1097
00:55:55,699 --> 00:56:02,089
was going on with it because I don't

1098
00:55:56,929 --> 00:56:06,159
understand like it's still kind of a

1099
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:06,160
weird measurement domain it looks like

1100
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:19,080
so there's like if we set the fog men

1101
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:24,299
and we just have like a very short fog

1102
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:27,059
max that fog man is set to basically I

1103
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,950
mean it sort of looks like it's down a

1104
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:35,699
little far it looks like the fog is

1105
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:39,389
maybe a little bit it just looks like

1106
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:42,569
it's starting somewhere after this

1107
00:56:39,389 --> 00:56:46,319
because this if this is zero then this

1108
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:48,330
it should start at 19 for which we

1109
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:52,140
should be like right here

1110
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:54,210
you know what I mean and it looks like

1111
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:56,690
it's soaring substantially further down

1112
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,690
than that

1113
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:05,100
like if the fog span is zero right then

1114
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,500
then you fog right away right you can

1115
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:11,639
stand you can see that happening if I

1116
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:14,460
look at the game per se you can see that

1117
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:16,949
I actually see quite a bit further down

1118
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:24,480
though right

1119
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:30,349
so I'm not sure well no I mean all right

1120
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,349
okay I guess that's right

1121
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:42,230
so you know you need some better

1122
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:42,230
fine-tuning on those variables

1123
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,140
that seems pretty good

1124
00:57:58,699 --> 00:58:04,879
we do have the problem if we want to

1125
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:06,260
make sure that the player is within no

1126
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,670
matter where we're focusing we kind of

1127
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,770
want to make sure the player doesn't

1128
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:11,809
come out of that alpha so I'm not sure

1129
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:13,969
how exactly we want to do that but let's

1130
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:16,969
see if we now solved the problem two of

1131
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:20,149
when we zoom in on a player in a smaller

1132
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:22,789
room if they are correctly yeah so we

1133
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:25,639
fixed that now because again it's basing

1134
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:38,179
it off of where we're focusing so I

1135
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:39,589
think that's a pretty good system now so

1136
00:58:38,179 --> 00:58:42,949
that's that's pretty good

1137
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:46,730
and again like now I think what we would

1138
00:58:42,949 --> 00:58:50,059
have to do is maybe set there to be like

1139
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:52,130
a I wonder if we need to sort of have

1140
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:54,949
two interpolated values there that are

1141
00:58:52,130 --> 00:59:08,869
sort of like our viewing bracket almost

1142
00:58:54,949 --> 00:59:11,839
so like it's just to sort of say look if

1143
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:14,599
you imagine that in a situation like

1144
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,550
this we always want to be able to see

1145
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:18,319
where the person is but we're focusing

1146
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:20,600
on this floor you know maybe what we

1147
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,610
should do is say there's a bracket which

1148
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,440
is if the player is like you know on the

1149
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:26,780
stairwell and they're standing here and

1150
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:30,200
then the floor is here there's actually

1151
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:33,080
a thickness of visibility and the fog is

1152
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:35,119
based off of this down and the Alpha is

1153
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:36,409
based off of this up you know and I'm

1154
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:41,210
saying

1155
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:43,750
and so that bracket is actually used you

1156
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:47,329
know sort of as two separate things and

1157
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:50,960
so you know I'm just gonna try that just

1158
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:53,110
in case that's good and so inside the

1159
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:57,590
camera system here where we're

1160
00:59:53,110 --> 01:00:01,840
specifying these things we're gonna say

1161
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:01,840
Minzy and Mack Z and

1162
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:15,019
I'm gonna call this instead of floor I'm

1163
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:17,030
gonna call it focus and we're just gonna

1164
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:19,130
have like a focus bracket so we're

1165
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:22,550
basically saying this is the range in

1166
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:26,360
which I would like to make sure I am not

1167
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:28,580
obscuring the ability to view date with

1168
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,910
you know with effects you know what I

1169
01:00:28,579 --> 01:00:31,429
mean

1170
01:00:28,909 --> 01:00:34,899
so if this is the game camera then I'm

1171
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:43,609
gonna call this focus focus

1172
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:48,230
Minzy and Max Z and and then I'll just

1173
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:50,780
like use those values instead so then in

1174
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:55,130
cure what we would say is the target

1175
01:00:50,780 --> 01:01:01,930
expected like like this stuff where we

1176
01:00:55,130 --> 01:01:01,930
set it we want this to actually get set

1177
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:10,550
yeah and just think industry in order to

1178
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:13,550
tack this properly we actually need sort

1179
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:17,240
of another value there as well which is

1180
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:20,240
like the players location which will

1181
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:29,149
always be included in the bracket so in

1182
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:33,909
a sense in a sense I wonder a little bit

1183
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:33,910
if I maybe want to do

1184
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,000
you

1185
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:56,389
so I think again this is a little a

1186
01:01:50,780 --> 01:02:08,660
little tricky but let's say I'm doing

1187
01:01:56,389 --> 01:02:13,029
this okay so let's say I was keeping

1188
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:13,029
both of these values oops

1189
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:20,240
so I'm keeping them in in the max and

1190
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:22,239
they're getting interpolated but I need

1191
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:26,089
to know what they should actually be

1192
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:29,059
targeting right and so I don't actually

1193
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:32,090
know what to set the expected target

1194
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:33,559
here for until I've looked at what the

1195
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:37,610
two values are and figured out which

1196
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:43,179
ones the min and the max so I think what

1197
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:49,070
I actually want to do is say the room

1198
01:02:43,179 --> 01:02:53,529
focus Z is going to be lets say the

1199
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:56,900
entity focus Z and then if I'm in a room

1200
01:02:53,530 --> 01:03:00,260
then I set the room focus Z to be the

1201
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:02,750
camera arm Z and then here what I do is

1202
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:05,840
I set the targets for these two things

1203
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:11,949
based on those so I would say target

1204
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,950
expected focus Minzy and target expected

1205
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:21,130
max V so these and I mean we're expected

1206
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:23,480
probably come out of those now but

1207
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:26,390
target expected focus Maxie and Minzy

1208
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:29,929
those are now just the minimum and

1209
01:03:26,389 --> 01:03:32,539
maximum of those two values so the room

1210
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:34,759
focused Z and the entity focus Z are

1211
01:03:32,539 --> 01:03:37,130
just going to be like the two things we

1212
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:40,660
pass in here and we pick the bracket

1213
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:40,660
based on whichever is minimum or maximum

1214
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:47,800
that just leaves us with this but again

1215
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:50,930
we already kind of know what that is

1216
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:56,840
because we just you know when we do this

1217
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:58,219
measurement to figure out what the to

1218
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:00,470
figure out with the target offset Z is

1219
01:03:58,219 --> 01:04:01,829
there we just need something up here

1220
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:04,649
that does the same thing

1221
01:04:01,829 --> 01:04:06,329
with the with the initial entity so we

1222
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:12,570
just be like enemy focus e equals the

1223
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:14,269
entity's position in Z right and that

1224
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:18,450
just has to be relative to the camera

1225
01:04:14,269 --> 01:04:22,969
so whatever the cameras position is we

1226
01:04:18,449 --> 01:04:22,969
need to compute that off of yeah I mean

1227
01:04:27,889 --> 01:04:37,440
we just need to compute that off of this

1228
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:39,989
I guess it if we don't know what the

1229
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:47,309
target camera should be then it's kind

1230
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:50,699
of hard to know I mean maybe we just say

1231
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:54,480
look we don't know what that should be

1232
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:56,819
but here once we actually have that we

1233
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:01,409
would know what it was it's just the

1234
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:03,240
whatever the camera arm whatever

1235
01:05:01,409 --> 01:05:07,489
whatever we expect the camera position

1236
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:07,489
to be so that the target P

1237
01:05:15,639 --> 01:05:26,119
it just do this so I think that gives us

1238
01:05:22,969 --> 01:05:29,869
the bracket and it tells us you know so

1239
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:31,519
it says here's the range of heights that

1240
01:05:29,869 --> 01:05:35,179
we're looking at in the world so you

1241
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:38,480
know don't screw it up and so now what

1242
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:47,149
we would do is say well the the Minzy

1243
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:49,780
and the maxi which we're now actually

1244
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:49,780
calling focus

1245
01:05:50,539 --> 01:05:58,690
we know that the fog wants to be off of

1246
01:05:54,050 --> 01:06:02,210
the maxi and we know that the Alpha

1247
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:12,700
wants to be off of the Minzy and so I

1248
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:20,570
think that's what we need nuts are good

1249
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:24,099
so so the maxi is Right the Minzy is

1250
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:24,100
nuts what did i do there

1251
01:06:26,139 --> 01:06:32,980
this must be bogus

1252
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:32,979
[Music]

1253
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:58,519
so I'm not sure why that would be bogus

1254
01:06:51,440 --> 01:07:00,980
though you know the room focus II camera

1255
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:04,159
arm part obviously you know appears to

1256
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:06,800
be working correctly it would seem the

1257
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:10,129
enemy focus D part though doesn't seem

1258
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:13,640
to work and we're taking the entity's

1259
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:15,559
location which should be mapped in the

1260
01:07:13,639 --> 01:07:18,769
same way as this is right I mean it's

1261
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:20,659
it's we're in the sim region and we're

1262
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:23,199
subtracting the target position which

1263
01:07:20,659 --> 01:07:32,480
should also which is also in the sim

1264
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:34,789
region and so this should be a vector

1265
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:42,740
that goes from the camp the location we

1266
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:49,070
want the camera to be at in the end and

1267
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:55,149
just looking at where the entity is

1268
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:55,150
itself why would that be odd

1269
01:08:07,269 --> 01:08:17,689
like why would that be it looks like

1270
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:22,310
we're getting the wrong sign Oh which we

1271
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:25,909
would because the MVP is always going to

1272
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:28,310
be less so that was just a sign bug

1273
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:30,050
right the entity P's always lure the

1274
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:31,340
target P I was thinking well the vectors

1275
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:34,670
going that way and we'll look but we're

1276
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:37,730
not looking at its length so that yeah

1277
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:39,140
that's just that's just a brain fart so

1278
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:40,969
I think that should give us a reasonable

1279
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:43,280
bracket now and that does look like a

1280
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:44,810
pretty reasonable bracket and so we can

1281
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:48,409
see whether that fixes our camera

1282
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:52,550
problems where we're not seeing okay so

1283
01:08:48,409 --> 01:08:53,750
that is wrong and it looks like it's

1284
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:55,779
computing the right bracket but the

1285
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:58,989
Alpha still appears to be wrong

1286
01:08:55,779 --> 01:08:58,989
why is that

1287
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:24,399
so what is the rub Wow off to a great

1288
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:26,650
start today huh hmm it helps if you

1289
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:30,069
assign the values to local variables

1290
01:09:26,649 --> 01:09:31,569
with the right names so in theory now I

1291
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:37,000
should be able to test this right and

1292
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:39,250
and that looks real good you know

1293
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,770
because now like when you hop up to this

1294
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:44,829
step you start to get a fade in and

1295
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:53,200
you're never outside of that range so

1296
01:09:44,829 --> 01:09:54,850
that's really nice um so now a couple of

1297
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:58,389
things that we think we probably want to

1298
01:09:54,850 --> 01:10:00,000
do let's actually maybe start looking at

1299
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:02,020
our interpolation a little bit better

1300
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,479
because one of the things that you'll

1301
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:07,300
note here is that it's just - it's it's

1302
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:08,859
much too laggy right like I get down

1303
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:12,119
here and I'm already out the door and

1304
01:10:08,859 --> 01:10:15,729
the camera is like not catching up right

1305
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:20,199
and we want the camera to be to be more

1306
01:10:15,729 --> 01:10:22,689
proactive more tightly tied right and so

1307
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:26,409
you know we can sort of see why that

1308
01:10:22,689 --> 01:10:28,679
that lag eNOS is happening and it's

1309
01:10:26,409 --> 01:10:31,720
because if you look at what this

1310
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:34,180
interpolator does it's stupid it all it

1311
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,500
does is take the distance between where

1312
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:38,470
you're trying to go and where you want

1313
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,819
to go either in 3d or in 1d in the case

1314
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:44,170
of just interpolated directly

1315
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:48,639
interpolated values there and it just

1316
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:49,270
you know it really doesn't do anything

1317
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,539
interesting

1318
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:53,820
it just takes those and adds in a

1319
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:56,409
time-based

1320
01:10:53,819 --> 01:10:58,719
amount of that which is sort of like

1321
01:10:56,409 --> 01:11:01,720
saying I get faster to get to something

1322
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:03,789
the further away I am right so if I'm

1323
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,230
really far away I take big steps towards

1324
01:11:03,789 --> 01:11:09,369
it if I'm close I take tiny steps

1325
01:11:05,229 --> 01:11:12,399
towards it but while that leads to a

1326
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:15,760
sort of rubberband II kind of way of

1327
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:17,859
pulling towards things it doesn't really

1328
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,020
do what we want which is provide a

1329
01:11:17,859 --> 01:11:22,569
guarantee that will like arrive in a

1330
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:23,560
timely fashion at the target right like

1331
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:25,929
we want to just know

1332
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,610
the player is never more than a quarter

1333
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:29,760
second away from getting to where

1334
01:11:27,609 --> 01:11:35,859
they're supposed to go right

1335
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:42,460
so what we'd rather do perhaps is take a

1336
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:45,819
look and see when we're interpolating

1337
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:50,170
things from one place to another

1338
01:11:45,819 --> 01:11:54,960
can we specify these in a more time

1339
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:58,350
based fashion that will pull us there

1340
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:02,260
more I don't know how I would say it but

1341
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:04,180
more deterministically so you know try

1342
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:08,350
to try to make it so that we can put

1343
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:10,869
some hard guarantees on how bad it is to

1344
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:14,140
you know to get to to get to one of

1345
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:17,590
these things by by some kind of

1346
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:20,350
guaranteed time now this would be really

1347
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:23,770
easy to do actually if we knew when we

1348
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:26,170
were changing the location we wanted to

1349
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:29,500
get to but we don't actually know that

1350
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:31,300
and so we are in a kind of bad situation

1351
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:33,640
where we're trying to interpolate

1352
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:37,930
towards potentially a moving target and

1353
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:41,710
so we probably want to have some kind of

1354
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:43,180
a way of understanding that the thing

1355
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:45,760
that we're chasing is continuously

1356
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:46,930
moving right and that was the nice part

1357
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,970
about these is you don't have to think

1358
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:51,400
too hard this will always just chase

1359
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:54,970
what you're go you know what you're

1360
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:56,379
looking at but what I'd like to do is

1361
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:58,110
try to work up towards something a

1362
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:04,600
little bit better than that that's all

1363
01:12:58,109 --> 01:13:08,349
okay so the first thing I want to do is

1364
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:12,010
I want to try and define a fixed way of

1365
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:14,050
interpreting that we can think about in

1366
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:16,360
an abstract sense that doesn't have very

1367
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:18,279
much to do with our problem at hand

1368
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:20,409
right I actually want to pull back for a

1369
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:25,199
second and think about what we want to

1370
01:13:20,409 --> 01:13:28,119
do here and what I want to do is go look

1371
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:34,229
we want to interpolate between two

1372
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:37,300
things right so we want to interpolate

1373
01:13:34,229 --> 01:13:40,000
so I guess we should say from

1374
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:45,730
to target right something like that or

1375
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:49,060
from A to B you know and so if that's

1376
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:52,569
what we're gonna do I want to talk about

1377
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:55,410
the the speed at which we interpolate a

1378
01:13:52,569 --> 01:13:58,809
rigid linear interpolation between them

1379
01:13:55,409 --> 01:14:02,649
you know would look like that right an

1380
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:07,360
ease in ease out interpolation you know

1381
01:14:02,649 --> 01:14:11,500
would look like this right and ease in

1382
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:19,479
with no ease out would look like this

1383
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:23,289
and in ease out with no ease in would

1384
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:24,969
look like this right and you can see

1385
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:27,069
each of the curves I've drawn there

1386
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:29,470
right corresponds to a different feel

1387
01:14:27,069 --> 01:14:32,139
this one takes off immediately at full

1388
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:36,789
speed and then gradually comes to a stop

1389
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:38,650
up here this one takes off gradually and

1390
01:14:36,789 --> 01:14:40,810
then immediately comes from a stop up

1391
01:14:38,649 --> 01:14:43,599
here this one maintains the same speed

1392
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:45,820
the entire way and this one does both it

1393
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:50,980
slowly comes up to speed and then slowly

1394
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:52,899
comes down again right and so what I'd

1395
01:14:50,979 --> 01:14:58,199
like to do is make it so that we can

1396
01:14:52,899 --> 01:15:05,529
freeze what we're doing in terms of this

1397
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:09,069
approach right meaning I'd like to talk

1398
01:15:05,529 --> 01:15:11,590
about that behavior separately from

1399
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:16,989
implementing how we actually map from

1400
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:20,050
what we have into this space so let's

1401
01:15:16,989 --> 01:15:26,139
set up a kind of way we can play with

1402
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:30,369
that what I'm gonna do here is I'm going

1403
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:31,869
to say that I'm going to remove a

1404
01:15:30,369 --> 01:15:33,640
function of piece of functionality from

1405
01:15:31,869 --> 01:15:36,430
the camera first which is the ability to

1406
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:42,010
continuously track the player and then

1407
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:44,740
I'm going to add it back in okay so so

1408
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:47,440
I'm going to to get worse before we get

1409
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:49,000
better that make sense so the first

1410
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:50,779
thing we can do this is I'm going to go

1411
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,238
into the world mode

1412
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:56,840
and we've got this notion of an in-room

1413
01:15:53,238 --> 01:15:59,988
like which room were in and what I'm

1414
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:03,828
gonna do is gonna track which room were

1415
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:07,549
in and I'm only going to actually kick

1416
01:16:03,828 --> 01:16:11,389
off an iteration kick off a change when

1417
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:11,779
we change rooms okay does that make

1418
01:16:11,389 --> 01:16:14,929
sense

1419
01:16:11,779 --> 01:16:16,670
I'm not gonna do it any other way I'm

1420
01:16:14,929 --> 01:16:21,529
also gonna pop back over to the world

1421
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:24,319
generator and I'm going to where does

1422
01:16:21,529 --> 01:16:26,769
that go I'm going to put us back in our

1423
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:26,769
original

1424
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,210
because that's a place with lots of

1425
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:40,530
rooms we can move between quickly so

1426
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:41,699
we're gonna start in this room and what

1427
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:43,619
I'm going to do is instead of like

1428
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:45,809
having the continuous camera track I'm

1429
01:16:43,619 --> 01:16:49,199
only going to kick off a camera

1430
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:52,050
iteration interpolation rather when we

1431
01:16:49,199 --> 01:17:05,300
actually change rooms okay mix make

1432
01:16:52,050 --> 01:17:08,400
sense all right so in order to do that I

1433
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:10,890
got to keep around what room are in and

1434
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,869
that's okay I I can do that by

1435
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:14,940
distorting the game camera so if I have

1436
01:17:12,869 --> 01:17:17,760
any of the ID much like we have in

1437
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:20,489
special I'm gonna have in room and every

1438
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,770
time we find ourselves in a room we are

1439
01:17:20,489 --> 01:17:24,569
going to set the in room value to that

1440
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:27,720
room so that we know that we are there

1441
01:17:24,569 --> 01:17:31,489
so much like you can see here where

1442
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:37,730
we've got in camera I'm sorry in special

1443
01:17:31,489 --> 01:17:40,260
and we set that end of the ID right here

1444
01:17:37,729 --> 01:17:43,409
we're gonna do the same thing now but

1445
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:46,110
for every room so whatever room were in

1446
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:48,779
we're gonna remember that ID all right

1447
01:17:46,109 --> 01:17:53,089
and then what I'm going to do here is

1448
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:56,519
say every time we go into this routine

1449
01:17:53,090 --> 01:18:00,360
I'm actually going to add a predicate

1450
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:06,510
here which is that if the in room ID is

1451
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:11,989
not the same right to what we thought we

1452
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:17,180
were in before then we execute the code

1453
01:18:11,989 --> 01:18:22,679
otherwise we don't make sense

1454
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:24,780
remember how you check these I need are

1455
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:26,280
equal instead of is equal I don't know

1456
01:18:24,779 --> 01:18:30,239
why I name those differently sometimes

1457
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:32,579
it's annoying so when we actually are

1458
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:34,349
running the game now you know if I go

1459
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:37,079
from one room to another it should still

1460
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:38,370
trigger but now if I go out to a room

1461
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:41,789
where they were supposed to be scrolling

1462
01:18:38,369 --> 01:18:43,500
it will not scroll right so even though

1463
01:18:41,789 --> 01:18:45,930
I haven't actually removed that code

1464
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,738
that was doing the scrolling before it's

1465
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:49,130
just not going to

1466
01:18:46,738 --> 01:18:53,009
and because I never update the target

1467
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:54,779
right except when we change rooms so now

1468
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:59,159
every time I change rooms like you can

1469
01:18:54,779 --> 01:19:00,079
see that happening but only if I change

1470
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:06,389
rooms

1471
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:10,159
well what happened or not something were

1472
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:10,160
to happen there what happened there

1473
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:20,980
what I knew what happened what happened

1474
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:24,290
there how did I get into a place where

1475
01:19:20,979 --> 01:19:25,669
it didn't trigger I don't really care

1476
01:19:24,289 --> 01:19:27,079
cuz we're not gonna use that code but I

1477
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:28,579
would be I want to know if we have but

1478
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:32,779
do we have some other bug that happened

1479
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:36,559
there all right well anyway so i nuked

1480
01:19:32,779 --> 01:19:39,349
that piece of code and so now what I

1481
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:42,470
want to do is I want to go ahead and

1482
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:44,660
kick off interpolation that works in a

1483
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:47,360
different fashion so what I'm going to

1484
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:50,809
do is I'm going to say that when we do

1485
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:53,659
that trigger I'm actually going to do

1486
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:55,550
instead of world P target P I'm going to

1487
01:19:53,659 --> 01:19:58,729
introduce another thing that's like from

1488
01:19:55,550 --> 01:20:01,400
P and so in here when we actually

1489
01:19:58,729 --> 01:20:03,949
trigger a transition I'm going to take

1490
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:06,559
the current position that the cameras in

1491
01:20:03,949 --> 01:20:08,869
and I'm going to set the from P equal to

1492
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,360
that so we remember where we're going

1493
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:13,729
from and where we're going to and then

1494
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:16,969
I'm going to have a t of interpolation

1495
01:20:13,729 --> 01:20:19,909
that I use to move between those two so

1496
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:24,650
I'm gonna set that T interpolation to

1497
01:20:19,909 --> 01:20:26,329
zero and then down here where we start

1498
01:20:24,649 --> 01:20:28,729
to do now that we want to start building

1499
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:31,489
a real interpolator what I'm going to do

1500
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:33,919
is I'm going to interpolate between my

1501
01:20:31,489 --> 01:20:36,559
two camera positions based on that value

1502
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:39,260
on this T interpolation now we already

1503
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:42,140
know how to do that right we know that

1504
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:45,680
we can take a position for our camera

1505
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:50,090
and we can say let's go from the you

1506
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:58,250
know let's do the from P to P here if I

1507
01:20:50,090 --> 01:21:02,329
just take these values where I'm going

1508
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:04,729
from and where I'm going to I should be

1509
01:21:02,329 --> 01:21:08,779
able to trivially interpolate it by

1510
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:10,549
saying look just lurk between the p

1511
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:15,949
value and you know the place I'm going

1512
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:18,650
from and the place I'm going to just

1513
01:21:15,949 --> 01:21:21,500
interpolate between those two based on

1514
01:21:18,649 --> 01:21:24,409
that interpolation parameter and then

1515
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:27,409
the interpolation parameter is actually

1516
01:21:24,409 --> 01:21:28,010
the thing that I update with the Delta

1517
01:21:27,409 --> 01:21:31,760
time

1518
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:33,860
right so now we're just using a second

1519
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,940
group you know we're using a way of

1520
01:21:33,859 --> 01:21:39,939
stepping back from the problem slightly

1521
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:39,939
okay

1522
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:58,909
so sue me

1523
01:21:44,149 --> 01:22:01,819
I forgot to clamp my value so obviously

1524
01:21:58,909 --> 01:22:03,800
when we actually increment this value we

1525
01:22:01,819 --> 01:22:05,000
have to also clamp it between 0 and 1

1526
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,730
otherwise it will just keep going

1527
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:12,130
forever we want to stop when we go from

1528
01:22:07,729 --> 01:22:18,049
0 to 1 and so you know I apologize there

1529
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:20,810
oh and I don't have to pass that so yeah

1530
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:23,449
sorry about that my bad let's try that

1531
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:24,890
one more time and so now we're just

1532
01:22:23,449 --> 01:22:26,599
going to interpolate between those and

1533
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:28,460
you can see that the interpolation is

1534
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:31,489
linear which it should be because we're

1535
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:34,430
calling lerp right so we are every time

1536
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:36,409
step moving a constant amount from the

1537
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:43,159
place we started to the place we're

1538
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:46,069
ending right makes sense um but I don't

1539
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:49,399
necessarily want it to feel like that

1540
01:22:46,069 --> 01:22:53,090
right and so you might ask well how do

1541
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:55,250
we get some control over these curves

1542
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:57,350
right like I was saying is right now

1543
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:59,329
we're tracing this curve right we're

1544
01:22:57,350 --> 01:23:01,400
going straight from A to B what if I

1545
01:22:59,329 --> 01:23:05,059
want to change how the easing of that

1546
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:08,629
feels well obviously if I do my

1547
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:11,330
interpolation here if I want to

1548
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:13,730
interpolate nonlinearly from from P to

1549
01:23:11,329 --> 01:23:14,988
target P I can still use lerp I guess

1550
01:23:13,729 --> 01:23:17,389
I'll use linear interpolation to do it

1551
01:23:14,988 --> 01:23:19,339
if I just take the scalar that I'm using

1552
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:21,079
to interpolate between to say how far

1553
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:25,520
between I wanna go and just make that

1554
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:29,659
nonlinear right so if we wanted to make

1555
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:32,150
you know some kind of a curve between

1556
01:23:29,659 --> 01:23:33,680
them I can just make this nonlinear and

1557
01:23:32,149 --> 01:23:36,170
then it will be so for example if I just

1558
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:38,630
square this value which makes it

1559
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:41,680
nonlinear I will get a non linear

1560
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:41,680
interpolation between them

1561
01:23:41,729 --> 01:23:53,849
right see starts off slow and fast

1562
01:23:49,729 --> 01:24:02,639
starts off slow and fast similarly if I

1563
01:23:53,850 --> 01:24:03,570
were to do the opposite I think you know

1564
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:08,070
guess what happens

1565
01:24:03,569 --> 01:24:14,519
starts off fast and slow starts off fast

1566
01:24:08,069 --> 01:24:17,009
and slow right so whatever the shape is

1567
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:21,360
of the function that we feed into this

1568
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:24,840
thing you know what I mean that's the

1569
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:29,089
behavior pattern will get out so if we

1570
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:32,579
want to create some kind of a you know

1571
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:34,819
nice curve that we like what we really

1572
01:24:32,579 --> 01:24:38,340
need to do is look for the function here

1573
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:42,149
that makes sense now if we were to use

1574
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:44,190
sort of like I don't know I'm not sure

1575
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:46,589
worth the correct site is to go to for

1576
01:24:44,189 --> 01:24:49,799
graphing these days but like what I did

1577
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:52,110
there for example was I graphed the

1578
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:54,270
square root of x right that was what I

1579
01:24:52,109 --> 01:24:59,069
did that last time just right that's

1580
01:24:54,270 --> 01:25:00,840
here so you can see what the shape of

1581
01:24:59,069 --> 01:25:04,920
the curve is specifically we're looking

1582
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:08,420
at this region I don't know how it's

1583
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:12,289
okay how do I actually get to somewhere

1584
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:12,289
web graphing

1585
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:24,979
let's try x squared so here's x squared

1586
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:28,149
I want to just kind of zoom in on the

1587
01:25:24,979 --> 01:25:30,769
zero to one block here it is right and

1588
01:25:28,149 --> 01:25:32,929
so you can see why we start off slow and

1589
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:34,489
end fast right because that's the shape

1590
01:25:32,929 --> 01:25:37,100
of the curve right it starts off slow

1591
01:25:34,488 --> 01:25:39,799
ends fast and so remember the closer

1592
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:42,020
this value gets to 1 the closer we are

1593
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,820
to our target the closer it is to 0 the

1594
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:44,960
closer our starting point so we're close

1595
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:46,488
to the starting point close the starting

1596
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,739
point getting a little further away now

1597
01:25:46,488 --> 01:25:50,658
lot lot lot really quickly approaching

1598
01:25:48,738 --> 01:25:53,359
here and there we go in fact we're only

1599
01:25:50,658 --> 01:25:56,809
in the upper half in like the back third

1600
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:59,719
or quarter almost of of this function

1601
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:02,210
right so if we wanted something that did

1602
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:04,579
ease-in ease-out or you know whatever

1603
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:07,219
else right you can imagine wanting to

1604
01:26:04,579 --> 01:26:09,800
make a curve that has a shape here that

1605
01:26:07,219 --> 01:26:15,289
we might like now let's talk about how

1606
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:17,480
we would shape curves to fit this ok one

1607
01:26:15,289 --> 01:26:22,399
of the things that you know you may

1608
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:24,169
recall from your days in junior high

1609
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:25,698
school or high school or if you're not

1610
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:28,039
in America they probably different names

1611
01:26:25,698 --> 01:26:30,138
for those parts but pre algebra or

1612
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:33,289
algebra when you're graphing functions

1613
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:37,840
or looking at graphs of functions you

1614
01:26:33,289 --> 01:26:42,289
may remember that the power of a

1615
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:46,789
polynomial determines certain aspects of

1616
01:26:42,289 --> 01:26:49,069
the curve so you noticed I did Square

1617
01:26:46,789 --> 01:26:51,079
and square root right I did both of

1618
01:26:49,069 --> 01:26:52,969
those things I don't know if this can do

1619
01:26:51,079 --> 01:26:54,559
ok there we go

1620
01:26:52,969 --> 01:26:58,210
so that was the opposite shape curve

1621
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:00,440
right starts off fast and slow you know

1622
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:02,719
but some things that you'll notice about

1623
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:06,379
this either square roots or parabolas

1624
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:09,380
right the parabola looks like this is

1625
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:14,440
that they don't change direction more

1626
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:19,069
than once right so they can only have

1627
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:20,629
one bend to them ok and the reason they

1628
01:27:19,069 --> 01:27:22,630
could only have one bent to them is

1629
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:25,219
because the power of a polynomial

1630
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:28,130
determines how many zero roots it could

1631
01:27:25,219 --> 01:27:30,050
have and no matter how you shift this

1632
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:31,730
function around right I'm

1633
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:33,590
never gonna get more than two roots of

1634
01:27:31,729 --> 01:27:36,078
the function okay

1635
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:38,328
I mean if it's x squared we know there's

1636
01:27:36,078 --> 01:27:40,488
two values that X could take that will

1637
01:27:38,328 --> 01:27:42,198
allow us to solve this equation you know

1638
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:47,238
what I mean

1639
01:27:42,198 --> 01:27:50,089
and so those roots are important because

1640
01:27:47,238 --> 01:27:51,738
if you can only have two roots then the

1641
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:55,610
most number of times you could ever

1642
01:27:51,738 --> 01:27:59,209
cross a single line is two which means I

1643
01:27:55,609 --> 01:28:00,589
can't have another wiggle I can't change

1644
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:04,250
directions and then change directions

1645
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:06,949
again right and so another way to think

1646
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:08,569
about this is that you have actually

1647
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:10,908
when you look at the power rather than

1648
01:28:08,569 --> 01:28:12,250
thinking of as zero crossings a better

1649
01:28:10,908 --> 01:28:15,769
way to think about it for our

1650
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:20,210
perspective from so we're looking for it

1651
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:23,030
for a mom a shaping perspective is that

1652
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:25,340
there can only be one apex there can

1653
01:28:23,029 --> 01:28:29,210
only be one minimum or maximum point in

1654
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:31,578
this thing not two there could never be

1655
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:35,090
another curve like top of the mountain

1656
01:28:31,578 --> 01:28:36,349
if you will right and so and this is

1657
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:37,819
talking figured out the shape because

1658
01:28:36,349 --> 01:28:39,380
all we care about is sake we look at

1659
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:41,448
about the math we care about the shape

1660
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:43,730
right and we need the math to give us

1661
01:28:41,448 --> 01:28:44,988
the shape but the properties we care

1662
01:28:43,729 --> 01:28:47,209
about are not the mathematic properties

1663
01:28:44,988 --> 01:28:48,500
they're the shape properties which

1664
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:51,020
happened to be mathematical as well but

1665
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:52,969
you get an idea so when we're looking at

1666
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:56,630
that function it's crucial to remember

1667
01:28:52,969 --> 01:28:58,368
in our heads what are the kinds of

1668
01:28:56,630 --> 01:29:01,368
mathematical functions that could

1669
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:05,328
produce the shapes we want and so for

1670
01:29:01,368 --> 01:29:07,848
example a line can never produce any

1671
01:29:05,328 --> 01:29:09,799
kind of curve so we know that for

1672
01:29:07,849 --> 01:29:13,340
example if I came back here if I wanted

1673
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:17,510
to produce this one right this is like

1674
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:19,250
an ease in ease out right well I know it

1675
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:21,559
can't be a line because that can't curve

1676
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:25,639
at all but furthermore now I also know

1677
01:29:21,559 --> 01:29:28,520
it can't be a second-order equation it

1678
01:29:25,639 --> 01:29:32,420
can't be power two because that only has

1679
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:35,179
one curved part to it and I need to

1680
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:37,670
write I need two of that I need that to

1681
01:29:35,179 --> 01:29:41,658
fundamentally change the direction it

1682
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:43,460
goes right and so what I really need is

1683
01:29:41,658 --> 01:29:46,219
a third order polynomial

1684
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:49,130
and you can see that right here you can

1685
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:51,920
already see the shape of it looks a lot

1686
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:54,680
like the shape of this right it's two

1687
01:29:51,920 --> 01:30:01,430
bends now this isn't the exact shape we

1688
01:29:54,680 --> 01:30:03,829
want but it is the right form okay

1689
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:05,360
now you may be asking yourself because

1690
01:30:03,829 --> 01:30:08,090
if you're the type of person who always

1691
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:09,199
thought mass was confusing up until you

1692
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:10,550
know you start working with computers

1693
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:12,260
and realize it kind of all makes sense

1694
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:14,449
at least that's what happened to me you

1695
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:17,090
may be asking well why you know why is

1696
01:30:14,449 --> 01:30:22,399
that the case why is it that you know

1697
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:24,770
this has no why is it that this has no

1698
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:29,420
bends in it why does that have one and

1699
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:32,300
why does that have to right and the

1700
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:35,480
answer is actually pretty easy to look

1701
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:38,090
at if you understand the concept of

1702
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:41,179
rates of change or if you've you know

1703
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:43,400
done any calculus right I won't go into

1704
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:44,690
it too much right now because you know

1705
01:30:43,399 --> 01:30:46,969
we could spend all day talking about

1706
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:48,529
it's actually pretty fun to kind of go

1707
01:30:46,970 --> 01:30:49,970
and explore a little bit more so I'll

1708
01:30:48,529 --> 01:30:53,239
just leave that open for a future

1709
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:56,180
discussion but if you look at what

1710
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:59,960
actually happens with having different

1711
01:30:56,180 --> 01:31:03,470
powers of polynomials if you look at

1712
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:06,109
what the rate of change is so you know

1713
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:08,420
as I'm going from left to right let's

1714
01:31:06,109 --> 01:31:12,469
say if I'm looking at what the rate of

1715
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:14,420
changes of X the value X right because

1716
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:17,570
this is fundamentally graphing that

1717
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:20,930
right I'm graphing Y the height of the

1718
01:31:17,569 --> 01:31:22,130
line equals x and I just didn't type the

1719
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:23,990
why because this graphing calculator

1720
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:28,220
smart enough to know that just do y

1721
01:31:23,989 --> 01:31:32,750
equals whatever I put in there right so

1722
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:35,420
if I do y equals x as X goes this way Y

1723
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:39,100
just changes exactly proportional to it

1724
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:41,659
y pun intended

1725
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:44,810
well it's because the only thing I could

1726
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:48,139
do is take the input which is my X right

1727
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:53,210
and I can multiply it by some value to

1728
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:55,970
change how fast Y is changing right but

1729
01:31:53,210 --> 01:31:57,319
that's it all I can do they're directly

1730
01:31:55,970 --> 01:32:00,260
related to each other

1731
01:31:57,319 --> 01:32:02,539
only separated by one coefficient so the

1732
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:05,800
only thing I can do is take my input and

1733
01:32:02,539 --> 01:32:10,010
make the output change faster or slower

1734
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:15,440
everywhere so everywhere in the entire

1735
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:18,530
graph I I'm powerless to change how much

1736
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:21,049
the the speed of this thing is I'm

1737
01:32:18,529 --> 01:32:22,639
powerless to change it based on the

1738
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:24,560
location it has to be the same

1739
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:27,230
everywhere that's why you have a

1740
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:30,250
constant slope right the input is X the

1741
01:32:27,229 --> 01:32:33,049
output is y the only thing I can do is

1742
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:35,539
everywhere change the speed by a

1743
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:39,230
constant factor right that's all I can

1744
01:32:35,539 --> 01:32:41,869
do now I can also offset it right by

1745
01:32:39,229 --> 01:32:44,089
adding a constant but again it can't be

1746
01:32:41,869 --> 01:32:46,010
dependent on the location so no matter

1747
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:48,980
what I do I'm affecting the graph

1748
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:50,810
everywhere always I don't get any if

1749
01:32:48,979 --> 01:32:55,579
statements I don't get anything that

1750
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:58,430
varies based on x2 tune I just have to

1751
01:32:55,579 --> 01:33:03,920
say whatever X is I can multiply it by a

1752
01:32:58,430 --> 01:33:05,920
value right and offset it that's it but

1753
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:11,500
now watch what happens when I square it

1754
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:15,050
okay once we have a squared function

1755
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:17,949
what does that actually mean well it

1756
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:23,000
means that now I actually have two

1757
01:33:17,949 --> 01:33:25,729
things that depend on X right in a sense

1758
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,880
I can write you know this a different

1759
01:33:25,729 --> 01:33:27,879
way

1760
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:38,090
right I mean I can write two different

1761
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:40,789
things in terms of X and the math now

1762
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:46,880
has to be dependent on both of those

1763
01:33:40,789 --> 01:33:49,939
things right what that means is now the

1764
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:53,300
actual offset of my function or the

1765
01:33:49,939 --> 01:33:56,809
speed of my function can be dependent on

1766
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:59,659
X right because that's actually what's

1767
01:33:56,810 --> 01:34:01,940
going on here you know what I mean I can

1768
01:33:59,659 --> 01:34:04,789
specify two different constraints for

1769
01:34:01,939 --> 01:34:07,489
example that it has to hit at negative 3

1770
01:34:04,789 --> 01:34:09,849
and positive 5 and it has to do both of

1771
01:34:07,489 --> 01:34:11,918
those things which means that as

1772
01:34:09,849 --> 01:34:14,559
goes it's gonna come top to come back

1773
01:34:11,918 --> 01:34:16,448
around right and another way of saying

1774
01:34:14,559 --> 01:34:18,099
that is well okay if I've got something

1775
01:34:16,448 --> 01:34:21,398
that's like you know x-squared or

1776
01:34:18,099 --> 01:34:24,159
whatever that is right then in order for

1777
01:34:21,399 --> 01:34:26,649
this thing to be to say what the speed

1778
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,179
of the change is well in order to know

1779
01:34:26,649 --> 01:34:30,329
what the speed of the change is anywhere

1780
01:34:28,179 --> 01:34:32,800
you have to know where you actually are

1781
01:34:30,328 --> 01:34:36,248
because the speed of the change is going

1782
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:39,279
to be based on X itself since as X goes

1783
01:34:36,248 --> 01:34:41,648
forwards it gets faster at a speed of X

1784
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:45,518
right that's the exponential part of

1785
01:34:41,649 --> 01:34:49,840
that as I increase X I increase X by X

1786
01:34:45,519 --> 01:34:55,780
not by some constant value right so if I

1787
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:57,519
say you know this 2 times X just says

1788
01:34:55,779 --> 01:35:00,340
the output is always based on whatever

1789
01:34:57,519 --> 01:35:06,099
the X is x 2 I have no ability to change

1790
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:08,649
that speed once this goes to squared now

1791
01:35:06,099 --> 01:35:11,739
I know that actually it's going to get

1792
01:35:08,649 --> 01:35:13,989
faster proportional to some X and I can

1793
01:35:11,738 --> 01:35:16,688
make that proportionality be work

1794
01:35:13,988 --> 01:35:20,678
however I want really right I can make

1795
01:35:16,689 --> 01:35:26,249
this part of it right bend it out I can

1796
01:35:20,679 --> 01:35:28,599
change that rate function dependent on X

1797
01:35:26,248 --> 01:35:30,550
now if you know derivatives you can see

1798
01:35:28,599 --> 01:35:33,538
this even easier because if I have x

1799
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:38,079
squared then I know the derivative is 2x

1800
01:35:33,538 --> 01:35:40,208
right that includes X in it again it's

1801
01:35:38,078 --> 01:35:43,658
the speed is dependent on my location

1802
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:45,819
now whereas if I have just that the

1803
01:35:43,658 --> 01:35:49,569
derivative is just 2 again the speed is

1804
01:35:45,819 --> 01:35:51,368
just a constant right so all this is

1805
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:53,288
just a long-winded way of saying well if

1806
01:35:51,368 --> 01:35:55,238
we want a function that's going to look

1807
01:35:53,288 --> 01:35:57,368
like this we're going to have to go up

1808
01:35:55,238 --> 01:36:00,549
to 3 and the reason for that is because

1809
01:35:57,368 --> 01:36:04,748
if you want to changes in direction it

1810
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:08,609
means that your acceleration right has

1811
01:36:04,748 --> 01:36:12,819
to be something that is non constant

1812
01:36:08,609 --> 01:36:14,409
I've got to be changing my acceleration

1813
01:36:12,819 --> 01:36:15,608
throughout it so that I can be bending

1814
01:36:14,408 --> 01:36:17,708
one way and then have the acceleration

1815
01:36:15,609 --> 01:36:20,409
change and bend the other way right so

1816
01:36:17,708 --> 01:36:22,510
now my change has to be dependent on X

1817
01:36:20,408 --> 01:36:23,289
the change in my change has to be

1818
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:25,480
dependent on X

1819
01:36:23,289 --> 01:36:28,029
and the change in my change in my change

1820
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:30,639
is the thing that we actually set right

1821
01:36:28,029 --> 01:36:32,590
and so if you have x-squared you've got

1822
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:34,740
one derivative is X the next rivet is

1823
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:36,789
the constant if I got X cubed then

1824
01:36:34,739 --> 01:36:39,039
derivative is x squared the derivative

1825
01:36:36,789 --> 01:36:41,470
is X and then a constant so it's just

1826
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:45,550
getting us out to enough to get the dual

1827
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:47,949
wiggle so we know right off the bat that

1828
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:50,340
we're gonna need a cubic if we want to

1829
01:36:47,949 --> 01:36:52,630
have a shape like this and lo and behold

1830
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:54,789
because that is the kind of shape we

1831
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:57,279
typically want in graphics almost all

1832
01:36:54,789 --> 01:36:59,739
graphics is based on cubics cubic

1833
01:36:57,279 --> 01:37:02,199
splines aren't cubic for no reason

1834
01:36:59,739 --> 01:37:04,510
they're cubic because you need to get

1835
01:37:02,199 --> 01:37:08,260
that shape people want ease-in and

1836
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:10,900
ease-out and parabolas can't do it so

1837
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:14,409
almost every spline you see is power

1838
01:37:10,899 --> 01:37:17,710
three at least and usually not more

1839
01:37:14,409 --> 01:37:19,000
because there's well cubics are hard

1840
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:20,500
enough as it is so usually you don't

1841
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,560
want to raise your powers up higher than

1842
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:24,970
you have to right but almost all

1843
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:27,070
interpolation therefore it takes place

1844
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:29,650
at least in the cubic domain for that

1845
01:37:27,069 --> 01:37:31,479
reason because you if you want ease in

1846
01:37:29,649 --> 01:37:33,579
and out represented in a single curve

1847
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:35,379
you got to have it there's really no

1848
01:37:33,579 --> 01:37:40,239
other way to do it because a parabola

1849
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:42,310
can't can't cut it right all right so

1850
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:44,469
now we have to say well okay how do we

1851
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:46,510
shape this parabola to get us something

1852
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:48,640
that we want because obviously one way

1853
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:51,070
of doing it would just be to say well we

1854
01:37:48,640 --> 01:38:00,060
know we've got an equation that looks

1855
01:37:51,069 --> 01:38:02,380
like this right something like that

1856
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:04,090
where we have four things to play with

1857
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:05,409
the coefficient on the cube term the

1858
01:38:04,090 --> 01:38:06,850
coefficient on the squared term the

1859
01:38:05,409 --> 01:38:11,139
coefficient on the linear term and then

1860
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:13,329
an offset if we wanted it right and so

1861
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:16,030
we could sit here all day trying to

1862
01:38:13,329 --> 01:38:18,369
figure out what it is right I mean we

1863
01:38:16,029 --> 01:38:21,989
could we could just say I don't know man

1864
01:38:18,369 --> 01:38:24,609
like I'm getting am I getting any closer

1865
01:38:21,989 --> 01:38:26,139
maybe you know I don't know and I'm not

1866
01:38:24,609 --> 01:38:29,920
sure how long it would take me really to

1867
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:32,690
figure out what that would be but it's

1868
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:35,380
pretty hard you know

1869
01:38:32,689 --> 01:38:41,529
[Music]

1870
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:48,090
yeah like me yeah maybe that's got to be

1871
01:38:41,529 --> 01:38:48,090
negative let's say I don't know

1872
01:38:55,199 --> 01:39:11,590
yeah I mean it started getting better

1873
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:19,810
maybe is it

1874
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:25,350
I can't tell like it's not quite going

1875
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:25,350
far enough over it turns back around

1876
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:36,789
it's too hard of course now I'm kind of

1877
01:39:33,789 --> 01:39:38,140
into it it's like a game I was gonna try

1878
01:39:36,789 --> 01:39:39,909
and say look it's too hard but now I'm

1879
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:43,060
like actually enjoying myself which is a

1880
01:39:39,909 --> 01:39:44,559
bit of an issue because I was trying to

1881
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:46,090
motivate the reason to not do it this

1882
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,990
way but now I'm like having a lot of fun

1883
01:39:46,090 --> 01:39:48,989
doing this this way

1884
01:39:53,859 --> 01:39:57,939
let's suppose that I had enough

1885
01:39:56,319 --> 01:40:01,829
self-discipline to not sit here for a

1886
01:39:57,939 --> 01:40:01,829
long time playing with the curve right

1887
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:07,239
what we would like to do is be able to

1888
01:40:05,229 --> 01:40:09,969
talk about curves of this forum in a way

1889
01:40:07,239 --> 01:40:13,090
that was already set up for us so that

1890
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:16,420
was it was intentionally making the

1891
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:18,850
curves that would produce useful

1892
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:21,310
graphical results based on the kinds of

1893
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:23,650
properties we care about so someone who

1894
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:26,020
has gone through working out all the

1895
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:27,460
math solving for various things like the

1896
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,720
beginning in the ending point and what

1897
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:30,819
we want to happen in the middle and

1898
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:35,320
putting them into some format that

1899
01:40:30,819 --> 01:40:37,599
allows us to easily describe the shape

1900
01:40:35,319 --> 01:40:38,799
of the curve that we want without having

1901
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:43,210
to sit here and manipulate all these

1902
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:46,360
things right and so if you think about

1903
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:49,090
what happens there that actually is what

1904
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:51,659
a Bezier curve is a Bezier curve is

1905
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:55,239
bezzie a having sat down for you and

1906
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:58,300
solving what will happen inside here in

1907
01:40:55,239 --> 01:41:00,550
a cubic so that you can set it to

1908
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:02,560
something reasonable and let me just

1909
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:06,340
sort of give an example of what's going

1910
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:08,320
on there right if I was going to be

1911
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:10,869
super hard chord mathy about it and I

1912
01:41:08,319 --> 01:41:13,689
want to make a function of T where I'm

1913
01:41:10,869 --> 01:41:15,970
going to say that some coefficient to

1914
01:41:13,689 --> 01:41:18,279
the cubed and then some coefficient

1915
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:22,630
squared and then some coefficient linear

1916
01:41:18,279 --> 01:41:28,529
and then oops supposed to be a C and

1917
01:41:22,630 --> 01:41:31,329
this is what I'm solving for and I know

1918
01:41:28,529 --> 01:41:35,380
that I want to have certain things be

1919
01:41:31,329 --> 01:41:39,189
true like I want F of T I should say F

1920
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:43,659
of zero to equal zero and F of one to

1921
01:41:39,189 --> 01:41:45,339
equal one then I know that I can start

1922
01:41:43,659 --> 01:41:47,439
to solve this and break it down till

1923
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:52,150
there's only for example two parameters

1924
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:56,109
to play with right and that is exactly

1925
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:58,420
what the bezzie a system does right it

1926
01:41:56,109 --> 01:42:00,219
says let's make a function where I know

1927
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:01,930
that I've been plug in 0 I get 0 and I'm

1928
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:03,369
a plug in 1 I get 1 so we're only

1929
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:07,030
talking about the curve between and why

1930
01:42:03,369 --> 01:42:07,720
right because yeah we want something

1931
01:42:07,029 --> 01:42:09,969
that

1932
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:13,510
that makes curves of like this sort of a

1933
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:15,970
caliber so they always end 0-0 and they

1934
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:18,340
always end at 1:1 so we know that this

1935
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:21,010
has to be true about them and then what

1936
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:23,529
they said is well let's just say that

1937
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:25,539
what we want to specify to control the

1938
01:42:23,529 --> 01:42:30,340
shape of the curve are the derivatives

1939
01:42:25,539 --> 01:42:32,529
so we'd say the derivative right at 0

1940
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:37,329
equals some value that I want to specify

1941
01:42:32,529 --> 01:42:40,029
right lebih b we call that U and F Prime

1942
01:42:37,329 --> 01:42:41,829
at 1 which is the derivative here so

1943
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:43,869
whatever you know kind of approach you

1944
01:42:41,829 --> 01:42:52,720
want to take and the start off you want

1945
01:42:43,869 --> 01:42:56,859
to take their right is V this oops and

1946
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:58,539
this are just a transform of each other

1947
01:42:56,859 --> 01:43:00,909
right in other words this is some

1948
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:03,069
equation I can compute these are some

1949
01:43:00,909 --> 01:43:06,039
things I want to be true about the

1950
01:43:03,069 --> 01:43:08,799
equation and what the Bezier curves are

1951
01:43:06,039 --> 01:43:13,090
is basically just a way of getting this

1952
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:15,610
to be true right getting these things to

1953
01:43:13,090 --> 01:43:19,810
be true does that make sense

1954
01:43:15,609 --> 01:43:20,170
I don't know hopefully that does make

1955
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:21,789
sense

1956
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:23,470
now we could go through the whole thing

1957
01:43:21,789 --> 01:43:26,649
here but that would be a little bit of a

1958
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:29,590
math headache probably although like I

1959
01:43:26,649 --> 01:43:34,179
could I suppose I could try it because

1960
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:35,680
you know I mean I could write I mean

1961
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:38,829
some of these things are kind of trivial

1962
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:40,840
like you can see that basically you just

1963
01:43:38,829 --> 01:43:46,840
know that D is 0 this condition just

1964
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:48,760
means that D is 0 right so that's kind

1965
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:51,819
of just a non thing so you're really

1966
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:54,880
talking about solving this for this you

1967
01:43:51,819 --> 01:43:56,769
know what I mean right and so you know

1968
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,079
if we wanted to try it

1969
01:43:56,770 --> 01:44:02,470
plugging these various values in for T

1970
01:43:59,079 --> 01:44:06,699
and seeing what we actually get sure why

1971
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:09,070
not I'm game I am bad at doing math on

1972
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:11,349
paper so I think that promises but you

1973
01:44:09,069 --> 01:44:13,569
know let's say we wanted to so if we

1974
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:15,370
want to actually solve this what we know

1975
01:44:13,569 --> 01:44:17,349
is we plug in 1 we get 1 so everywhere

1976
01:44:15,369 --> 01:44:20,500
here so that's effectively just saying

1977
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:21,530
we have a plus B plus C right because 1

1978
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:23,930
cubed

1979
01:44:21,529 --> 01:44:25,909
squared and one right is just a plus B

1980
01:44:23,930 --> 01:44:28,369
plus C we know that that has to equal

1981
01:44:25,909 --> 01:44:29,809
one so there's our first equation we

1982
01:44:28,369 --> 01:44:32,479
then know that the derivative has to

1983
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:34,580
equal U and the derivative has to equal

1984
01:44:32,479 --> 01:44:37,039
V at these two points what's the

1985
01:44:34,579 --> 01:44:39,710
derivative of this right what's the

1986
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:41,119
derivative of that equation well the

1987
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:46,340
derivative is pretty straightforward to

1988
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:47,869
compute right it's just going to be 3a T

1989
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:50,360
squared right because just multiply the

1990
01:44:47,869 --> 01:44:59,470
three and go from there

1991
01:44:50,359 --> 01:45:02,479
plus 2b T plus C so there's our you know

1992
01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:05,480
there's our derivative in that case

1993
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:08,779
right and furthermore since we're

1994
01:45:05,479 --> 01:45:09,919
plugging in 0 and 1 here we actually

1995
01:45:08,779 --> 01:45:12,380
don't have to worry about the t's

1996
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:17,119
because they're gonna go away so we can

1997
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:20,329
actually write this out now with a 0 and

1998
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:24,140
a 1 so if this is our F prime of

1999
01:45:20,329 --> 01:45:25,189
something right of T then once we want

2000
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:29,150
to write this out we would just say

2001
01:45:25,189 --> 01:45:33,049
alright 3a T squared what's T squared

2002
01:45:29,149 --> 01:45:35,000
oh it's zero actually right in fact that

2003
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:38,690
whole term goes away this altar is a so

2004
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:46,520
only C remains so in this case we just

2005
01:45:38,689 --> 01:45:48,739
have C equals u right why what's going

2006
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,120
on there why is that so simple well the

2007
01:45:48,739 --> 01:45:51,859
reason that that's so simple is because

2008
01:45:50,119 --> 01:45:54,260
think about it if we want to specify the

2009
01:45:51,859 --> 01:45:56,029
derivative at this point well the

2010
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:57,980
derivative of that point is just the

2011
01:45:56,029 --> 01:46:00,619
derivative as the function starts out

2012
01:45:57,979 --> 01:46:04,669
when it has neither its squared term nor

2013
01:46:00,619 --> 01:46:09,170
its nor its its linear term because it's

2014
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:11,690
at zero so obviously the slope at 0 is

2015
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:13,640
always going to be whatever the non T

2016
01:46:11,689 --> 01:46:16,009
dependent term is because all the other

2017
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:18,650
T terms have gone away right they

2018
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:21,020
haven't had a chance to start yet makes

2019
01:46:18,649 --> 01:46:26,449
sense these are the modifications to the

2020
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:28,850
slope that happened over time so that

2021
01:46:26,449 --> 01:46:31,429
makes perfect sense this makes perfect

2022
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:33,410
sense right we don't know what the heck

2023
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:35,270
that means yet but we've got one more

2024
01:46:33,409 --> 01:46:37,760
thing to do here which is F Prime

2025
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:40,420
1 equals V so if we did that these would

2026
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:46,610
all be ones so we would end up with just

2027
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:52,550
what 3a plus 2b plus C equals 0

2028
01:46:46,609 --> 01:46:56,149
oh sorry equals V right and since since

2029
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:59,900
we know that C equals u everywhere we

2030
01:46:56,149 --> 01:47:02,269
already kind of have that term taken

2031
01:46:59,899 --> 01:47:04,189
care of so we're really just talking

2032
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:06,680
about that's you know that's a

2033
01:47:04,189 --> 01:47:08,750
proscribed constant so we're really just

2034
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:14,690
talking about this part of the equation

2035
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:17,329
right we can rewrite these to be we can

2036
01:47:14,689 --> 01:47:21,109
we can rewrite these terms to be a plus

2037
01:47:17,329 --> 01:47:24,590
B you know equals 1 minus u right

2038
01:47:21,109 --> 01:47:29,509
and in this case we have 3a plus 2b

2039
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:30,980
equals V minus u right and so now we can

2040
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:32,869
just we're really just talking about

2041
01:47:30,979 --> 01:47:38,000
solving this system of equations for

2042
01:47:32,869 --> 01:47:40,579
these two variables right a and B so

2043
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,409
doing that we can solve for a to

2044
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:44,359
substitute back in pretty quickly right

2045
01:47:42,409 --> 01:47:45,920
because this is already we can choose

2046
01:47:44,359 --> 01:47:46,250
either of these two whichever one we

2047
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,899
want

2048
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:49,159
maybe we choose because it's multiplied

2049
01:47:47,899 --> 01:47:50,719
by 2 into the 3 I don't know it doesn't

2050
01:47:49,159 --> 01:47:52,760
really matter it's just a coefficient

2051
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:54,529
doesn't matter which one we choose but

2052
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:57,230
let's suppose we chose that we would

2053
01:47:54,529 --> 01:47:59,029
have be right in this case I'll just

2054
01:47:57,229 --> 01:48:04,009
write it out again B equals 1 minus u

2055
01:47:59,029 --> 01:48:11,500
minus a so here we would have 3a plus 2

2056
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:14,930
1 minus u minus a equals V minus u ok

2057
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:19,640
solving for a we would get 3a plus 2

2058
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:21,619
minus 2-u minus 2a equals V minus u

2059
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:23,480
again I'm horrible at math so I probably

2060
01:48:21,619 --> 01:48:27,469
made a mistake already but you know what

2061
01:48:23,479 --> 01:48:31,639
can you do that's 3a plus and you can

2062
01:48:27,469 --> 01:48:33,079
see here that we've got the a term the 2

2063
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:35,930
and the 2 you want to go to the other

2064
01:48:33,079 --> 01:48:40,130
side so really what we want to do is say

2065
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:43,250
it's 3a minus 2a right equals V minus u

2066
01:48:40,130 --> 01:48:48,868
minus the 2 minus R plus the two you

2067
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:51,840
right so then we have 3a minus 2a

2068
01:48:48,868 --> 01:48:56,219
is just a and then here we just have the

2069
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:58,559
V which we only use we only have one of

2070
01:48:56,219 --> 01:49:01,618
and then the U which we have to combine

2071
01:48:58,559 --> 01:49:05,059
so it's a - you in a to use so it's V

2072
01:49:01,618 --> 01:49:10,578
Plus u - - and that's what a equals

2073
01:49:05,059 --> 01:49:14,248
right I don't know if that makes sense

2074
01:49:10,578 --> 01:49:18,118
so there's our a term and then finally

2075
01:49:14,248 --> 01:49:20,819
if we if we want to actually find out

2076
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:24,029
what B is now we have to back substitute

2077
01:49:20,819 --> 01:49:27,599
that in to something we can solve for

2078
01:49:24,029 --> 01:49:30,328
right so if we plug it back into this

2079
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:33,389
equation for example the a plus B equals

2080
01:49:30,328 --> 01:49:36,090
one minus U to actually find out what B

2081
01:49:33,389 --> 01:49:43,859
equals right that would be B equals one

2082
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:48,439
minus u minus V Plus u minus two which

2083
01:49:43,859 --> 01:49:55,069
is B equals one minus u minus V minus u

2084
01:49:48,439 --> 01:49:57,320
plus two which is equal to one plus two

2085
01:49:55,069 --> 01:50:06,929
am i right about that

2086
01:49:57,319 --> 01:50:10,158
yeah I think so minus 2-u minus B so

2087
01:50:06,929 --> 01:50:12,748
here are our values supposedly right

2088
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:14,429
again I'm awful at working Mathews

2089
01:50:12,748 --> 01:50:16,378
those are probably totally wrong I

2090
01:50:14,429 --> 01:50:18,029
highly recommend getting a good computer

2091
01:50:16,378 --> 01:50:19,590
algebra system which I've never found

2092
01:50:18,029 --> 01:50:24,509
but let's say someone actually made one

2093
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:26,489
someday I would very much love it um but

2094
01:50:24,510 --> 01:50:28,079
those are our coefficients and now we

2095
01:50:26,488 --> 01:50:30,718
can actually just use them directly if

2096
01:50:28,078 --> 01:50:32,549
we want to right we should be able to

2097
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:34,408
just specify those directly in theory

2098
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:35,550
right now it's probably wrong so that

2099
01:50:34,408 --> 01:50:38,698
probably did the math wrong but that's

2100
01:50:35,550 --> 01:50:41,010
the idea right meaning if you were good

2101
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:43,259
at doing math through you would have

2102
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:45,719
gotten equations that were right and so

2103
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:46,979
coming back in and remembering what

2104
01:50:45,719 --> 01:50:49,590
these are this is the two derivatives

2105
01:50:46,979 --> 01:50:51,989
that we wanted to specify and so looking

2106
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:54,239
at these two here we can specify all the

2107
01:50:51,988 --> 01:50:56,848
pieces that we actually need we know

2108
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:59,819
that our C value is equal to U so if I

2109
01:50:56,849 --> 01:51:02,199
just rewrite these here right our a

2110
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:05,558
value is V Plus

2111
01:51:02,198 --> 01:51:08,169
you - to our B value with some stuff

2112
01:51:05,559 --> 01:51:15,059
over there and our C value is just you

2113
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:19,420
so that's what three - to you - be right

2114
01:51:15,059 --> 01:51:21,010
um so if we you know let's say that was

2115
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:22,690
right then what would happen is we could

2116
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:24,969
put those in there and set this and we

2117
01:51:22,689 --> 01:51:26,978
would get something interesting so in

2118
01:51:24,969 --> 01:51:32,078
here for example if we were to set this

2119
01:51:26,979 --> 01:51:33,670
up V + 2 v + u minus 2 let's say what we

2120
01:51:32,078 --> 01:51:36,458
want to do because remember what those

2121
01:51:33,670 --> 01:51:41,319
values actually mean our derivative at

2122
01:51:36,458 --> 01:51:44,618
zero is you right so u equals the zero

2123
01:51:41,319 --> 01:51:46,748
derivative and V equals the one

2124
01:51:44,618 --> 01:51:48,458
derivative so let's say we wanted

2125
01:51:46,748 --> 01:51:52,569
ease-in ease-out we just set those both

2126
01:51:48,458 --> 01:51:56,010
to zero a would be minus 2 B would be 3

2127
01:51:52,569 --> 01:51:58,268
and C would be zero right

2128
01:51:56,010 --> 01:51:59,469
and so basically what we'd be saying

2129
01:51:58,269 --> 01:52:15,099
there is I don't know it would look like

2130
01:51:59,469 --> 01:52:17,529
this B would be 3 right and lo and

2131
01:52:15,099 --> 01:52:19,958
behold I did the math right there's our

2132
01:52:17,529 --> 01:52:22,748
East curve shocking right

2133
01:52:19,958 --> 01:52:25,029
but look it starts out easing in goes

2134
01:52:22,748 --> 01:52:27,458
fast in the middle and then eases out

2135
01:52:25,029 --> 01:52:31,328
ends directly at one start strictly at

2136
01:52:27,458 --> 01:52:34,599
zero math it's amazing right

2137
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:37,420
if only anyone ever taught it right it

2138
01:52:34,599 --> 01:52:39,639
would be pretty cool um sue you could

2139
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:42,489
see there that you know all I really did

2140
01:52:39,639 --> 01:52:44,288
was I said what I wanted and then I

2141
01:52:42,488 --> 01:52:49,149
plugged a truck in even someone like me

2142
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:50,559
who is very bad at this lucked out right

2143
01:52:49,149 --> 01:52:52,420
but if you have a computer algebra

2144
01:52:50,559 --> 01:52:54,998
system you can take the luck out of that

2145
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:57,969
and actually know that you didn't miss a

2146
01:52:54,998 --> 01:52:59,679
negative somewhere or something right so

2147
01:52:57,969 --> 01:53:01,809
what this also means is we can change

2148
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:05,190
those parameters I don't know if this

2149
01:53:01,809 --> 01:53:05,190
thing lets me make variables

2150
01:53:10,569 --> 01:53:22,250
so let's say I cut and paste that here

2151
01:53:13,369 --> 01:53:25,069
can I say stuff like I don't know if I

2152
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:26,539
can all right um but anyway let's say we

2153
01:53:25,069 --> 01:53:31,429
did one more just for good measure let's

2154
01:53:26,539 --> 01:53:34,550
say we want it to be one here and and I

2155
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:37,070
guess it would have to be one here as

2156
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:41,390
well so we what if we plugged in just

2157
01:53:37,069 --> 01:53:45,289
like one one instead right

2158
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:47,000
so we'd have 1 plus 1 minus 2 because so

2159
01:53:45,289 --> 01:53:49,460
that means the derivative it's linear

2160
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:51,829
right so we should get it degenerating

2161
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:54,079
to just a line cuz we're now not having

2162
01:53:51,829 --> 01:53:57,050
a curves at all so if we plugged in 1 1

2163
01:53:54,079 --> 01:53:59,000
what would we get

2164
01:53:57,050 --> 01:54:04,279
well we would and remember here what we

2165
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:05,659
got was negative 2 3 0 right if we've

2166
01:54:04,279 --> 01:54:08,319
looked along we get well we get 2 minus

2167
01:54:05,659 --> 01:54:13,819
2 which is 0 so this term goes away

2168
01:54:08,319 --> 01:54:17,349
right we'd get 3 minus 2 minus 1 so this

2169
01:54:13,819 --> 01:54:21,229
term goes away and then we'd get one

2170
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:24,170
right so we just have that term so 1

2171
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:26,029
behold it's alive exactly what you would

2172
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:28,609
expect because we told it that the

2173
01:54:26,029 --> 01:54:34,789
derivative should be unchanging and it

2174
01:54:28,609 --> 01:54:37,339
should be 1 at both points right um so

2175
01:54:34,789 --> 01:54:41,149
now if we want to do this if we want to

2176
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:45,140
figure this out we can just make our

2177
01:54:41,149 --> 01:54:47,689
bezzie a magic here right and we can do

2178
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:50,990
exactly what we just typed in before

2179
01:54:47,689 --> 01:54:53,389
well I deleted it but this negative 2 3

2180
01:54:50,989 --> 01:54:59,149
0 right so we know we can just do

2181
01:54:53,390 --> 01:55:02,420
negative 2 times our T value squared

2182
01:54:59,149 --> 01:55:03,559
which is this I'm gonna make that be

2183
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:09,949
something I can see there a little more

2184
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:16,039
clearly so T squared right plus 3

2185
01:55:09,949 --> 01:55:18,880
oh sorry T cube plus 3 T squared and

2186
01:55:16,039 --> 01:55:22,969
plus nothing there are no other terms

2187
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:28,369
because the the C term is 0

2188
01:55:22,969 --> 01:55:33,050
right make sense so now if I specify

2189
01:55:28,369 --> 01:55:35,750
that value oops if I specify the bezzie

2190
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:37,969
a magic value we should get an ease in

2191
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:40,760
ease out over the exact time that we

2192
01:55:37,969 --> 01:55:46,750
asked for which was happens to be one

2193
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:46,750
second in this case right but off we go

2194
01:55:46,869 --> 01:56:01,099
and that's what we got right so I think

2195
01:55:55,939 --> 01:56:04,250
we're out of time unfortunately but that

2196
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:08,180
is precisely how you compute a nice

2197
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:11,140
curve from scratch right we didn't look

2198
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:11,140
a single thing up

2199
01:56:29,488 --> 01:56:34,729
looks pretty nice too let's go to QA

2200
01:57:12,939 --> 01:57:16,488
the slate actually had super frills it

2201
01:57:15,078 --> 01:57:19,519
was giving you a slider to edit the

2202
01:57:16,488 --> 01:57:21,319
values okay so if that's the case let me

2203
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:23,090
just do that then because I wasn't sure

2204
01:57:21,319 --> 01:57:24,349
what was going on this is a this is I've

2205
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:26,860
never used this before by the way this

2206
01:57:24,349 --> 01:57:26,860
was pretty cool

2207
01:57:29,828 --> 01:57:34,670
not sure what else I've put in here

2208
01:57:32,389 --> 01:57:39,828
exactly but all right so let's say I

2209
01:57:34,670 --> 01:57:43,069
wanted to do you equals zero V equals

2210
01:57:39,828 --> 01:57:46,219
zero and then down here I wanted to

2211
01:57:43,069 --> 01:57:48,408
compute these things as dependent values

2212
01:57:46,219 --> 01:57:55,399
I don't know if that's allowed but so V

2213
01:57:48,408 --> 01:58:01,460
Plus u minus 2 and then B equals 3 minus

2214
01:57:55,399 --> 01:58:04,219
2 u minus V and then C equals u right

2215
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:06,828
and then what I can do is I can actually

2216
01:58:04,219 --> 01:58:14,929
specify my XY values here so I can just

2217
01:58:06,828 --> 01:58:23,420
say like look plot the y equals a X cube

2218
01:58:14,929 --> 01:58:26,859
oops cubed plus BX squared plus CX value

2219
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:26,859
there and

2220
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:36,190
did I actually specify that right

2221
01:58:41,569 --> 01:58:44,469
so

2222
01:58:57,090 --> 01:59:04,110
Oh coz I'm sooo good that's what the

2223
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:13,020
problem is so that's right there we go

2224
01:59:04,109 --> 01:59:15,199
so there's one one so now I is there a

2225
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:20,040
way to set like the boundary values oh

2226
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:23,189
yeah this thing is good just you see

2227
01:59:20,039 --> 01:59:25,739
this stuff this is like this is serious

2228
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:30,750
this is someone went the full nine here

2229
01:59:25,739 --> 01:59:35,819
my dude right but you can see how right

2230
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:40,409
I can I can sort of change the shape of

2231
01:59:35,819 --> 01:59:43,380
this function here I wonder - you know I

2232
01:59:40,409 --> 01:59:49,349
could look at values that were sort of

2233
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:51,119
further afield I want to right - so you

2234
01:59:49,350 --> 01:59:53,490
can see here if you if you don't mind it

2235
01:59:51,119 --> 02:00:01,229
going down below as well you can set it

2236
01:59:53,489 --> 02:00:02,909
to other things let me set it so we can

2237
02:00:01,229 --> 02:00:05,759
get a little more range so this gives us

2238
02:00:02,909 --> 02:00:08,039
one on a full one value on either side

2239
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:10,680
that we can go to right so you notice we

2240
02:00:08,039 --> 02:00:12,569
still always end 0 and 1 because those

2241
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:14,760
are hard constraints of the function but

2242
02:00:12,569 --> 02:00:18,359
now like the function can go outside of

2243
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:21,300
its interpolation boundaries or it can

2244
02:00:18,359 --> 02:00:25,409
get torqued up pretty high right like it

2245
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:27,360
is here and and so yeah like I don't

2246
02:00:25,409 --> 02:00:29,460
know negative 1 is probably not a useful

2247
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:31,619
value but you know two more values

2248
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:34,289
higher than than one here are probably

2249
02:00:31,619 --> 02:00:36,720
fine you know for it for certain

2250
02:00:34,289 --> 02:00:42,630
applications right but you can see you

2251
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:44,310
know at some limit we start getting

2252
02:00:42,630 --> 02:00:48,390
things to go outside but if it's within

2253
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:49,980
reason right you can see that that still

2254
02:00:48,390 --> 02:00:57,270
always stays within our interpolation

2255
02:00:49,979 --> 02:00:59,699
bounds pretty much right makes sense

2256
02:00:57,270 --> 02:01:02,280
so anything between zero and three is

2257
02:00:59,699 --> 02:01:09,539
pretty fair game here I should solve why

2258
02:01:02,279 --> 02:01:11,789
that is I suppose that could we also

2259
02:01:09,539 --> 02:01:23,029
describe the ease in out via a sine

2260
02:01:11,789 --> 02:01:25,529
function sure I mean it's a little

2261
02:01:23,029 --> 02:01:27,029
harder to deal with because sine tends

2262
02:01:25,529 --> 02:01:28,289
to be a little more finicky so I don't

2263
02:01:27,029 --> 02:01:29,939
know that you would ever want to do that

2264
02:01:28,289 --> 02:01:34,170
because the cubix usually are pretty

2265
02:01:29,939 --> 02:01:35,609
good and unless you really know you need

2266
02:01:34,170 --> 02:01:36,899
the sine function for some reason I

2267
02:01:35,609 --> 02:01:38,309
don't think you want to go for a

2268
02:01:36,899 --> 02:01:39,599
transcendental because you're gonna it's

2269
02:01:38,310 --> 02:01:41,250
gonna caught it's they're harder to

2270
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:45,110
optimize you can still optimize them

2271
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:45,109
pretty good but they get harder I

2272
02:01:46,010 --> 02:01:50,220
noticed that you use T times T times T

2273
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:52,050
for T cube just TF support for something

2274
02:01:50,220 --> 02:02:04,230
like T times times three for exponents

2275
02:01:52,050 --> 02:02:06,720
not that I know of so the problem that

2276
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:10,019
you end up getting is that if you wanted

2277
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:12,060
to support that the problem is that C

2278
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:14,730
syntax actually says that that's a

2279
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:19,530
pointer dereference so for example if i

2280
02:02:14,729 --> 02:02:21,949
say you know a star star b the way c

2281
02:02:19,529 --> 02:02:29,309
actually parses that is you know a

2282
02:02:21,949 --> 02:02:33,420
multiply pointer dereference B right

2283
02:02:29,310 --> 02:02:35,700
so it actually does this so I don't

2284
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:37,739
think you can I don't think C++ could

2285
02:02:35,699 --> 02:02:40,949
ever add an overloaded operator star

2286
02:02:37,739 --> 02:02:44,189
star in that way I mean you could but

2287
02:02:40,949 --> 02:02:45,720
you'd have to do that to do it which

2288
02:02:44,189 --> 02:02:47,309
seems probably not so good

2289
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:49,590
whereas especially you can just write

2290
02:02:47,310 --> 02:02:51,600
that and define the function cube and

2291
02:02:49,590 --> 02:02:54,900
that's probably the right way to go so I

2292
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:56,220
don't think you can do star star 3 even

2293
02:02:54,899 --> 02:02:58,439
in modern zeros list but maybe you kiss

2294
02:02:56,220 --> 02:03:01,260
modern cos plus adds the kitchen sink so

2295
02:02:58,439 --> 02:03:03,539
who knows like what's in there but in

2296
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:04,860
the old days you couldn't have have you

2297
02:03:03,539 --> 02:03:06,750
test the new transition for going up and

2298
02:03:04,859 --> 02:03:07,469
down the stairs well don't forget we're

2299
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:10,399
not done yet

2300
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:14,630
this is pretty

2301
02:03:10,399 --> 02:03:17,658
is the start of the interpolator we need

2302
02:03:14,630 --> 02:03:19,489
to then spend like all I did we show you

2303
02:03:17,658 --> 02:03:24,099
how to get the E's curve right we have

2304
02:03:19,488 --> 02:03:24,099
to now actually do the other part of it

2305
02:03:26,408 --> 02:03:32,629
I'd rather wait till tomorrow to talk

2306
02:03:30,829 --> 02:03:34,010
about that if that makes sense and so

2307
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:35,420
going up and down the stairs we don't

2308
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:37,610
really need to test cuz this isn't the

2309
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:40,340
right interpolator anyway if you just

2310
02:03:37,609 --> 02:03:41,809
want to see what it looks like just as a

2311
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:44,260
point of reference I could certainly go

2312
02:03:41,810 --> 02:03:44,260
do it

2313
02:03:52,109 --> 02:03:58,149
right of course why I'm not getting any

2314
02:03:56,738 --> 02:04:00,389
alpha there oh right because I'm not

2315
02:03:58,149 --> 02:04:06,149
interpreting those values anymore

2316
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:06,150
oops but yeah

2317
02:04:21,279 --> 02:04:24,489
by setting the unv value so negative you

2318
02:04:23,170 --> 02:04:25,989
can get things like overshoot with the

2319
02:04:24,489 --> 02:04:27,219
camera goes over then corrects back I

2320
02:04:25,989 --> 02:04:29,409
don't think it will be a good feel for

2321
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:32,470
HMH but some case is really good yeah if

2322
02:04:29,409 --> 02:04:36,670
we wanted to kind of overshoot and relax

2323
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:40,449
to it we could do that for sure right

2324
02:04:36,670 --> 02:04:42,220
and yeah you see like if I put that back

2325
02:04:40,449 --> 02:04:44,529
in you could see that happening at the

2326
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:47,170
bottom of the curve there right

2327
02:04:44,529 --> 02:04:51,969
I guess we're overshoot you'd want it

2328
02:04:47,170 --> 02:04:53,920
that way right and so you know we

2329
02:04:51,970 --> 02:04:56,440
certainly could do that if I come in

2330
02:04:53,920 --> 02:05:00,010
here so that we can actually test value

2331
02:04:56,439 --> 02:05:04,839
specifically if I set the U and V here

2332
02:05:00,010 --> 02:05:07,750
and then do the a the B and the C you

2333
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:13,900
could then say like okay so V Plus u

2334
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:18,609
minus 2 and this is 3 minus 2 u minus B

2335
02:05:13,899 --> 02:05:20,679
and this is you right here we can we can

2336
02:05:18,609 --> 02:05:23,349
plug these values in directly if we want

2337
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:27,369
to so you know if we had something where

2338
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:31,360
we wanted a little bit of of ease in and

2339
02:05:27,369 --> 02:05:33,099
then we wanted a little bit of overshoot

2340
02:05:31,359 --> 02:05:35,759
you know maybe it looks a little

2341
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:35,760
something like this

2342
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:44,500
one of the reasons so and the other

2343
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:47,350
thing you have to remember here is a

2344
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:49,090
cubic is only so expressive so this

2345
02:05:47,350 --> 02:05:52,120
probably won't quite be right because

2346
02:05:49,090 --> 02:05:53,440
you probably want more damping there so

2347
02:05:52,119 --> 02:05:55,029
what you'd probably would you really

2348
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:56,889
want to do if you wanted to do this is

2349
02:05:55,029 --> 02:05:59,800
you'd probably want to split the curve

2350
02:05:56,890 --> 02:06:03,070
as in two to cubics one that goes to 0.5

2351
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:04,300
and 1 that goes from point 5 to 1 and so

2352
02:06:03,069 --> 02:06:05,859
that you can have more expressivity

2353
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:08,230
there so I don't know that I would

2354
02:06:05,859 --> 02:06:11,739
really recommend doing this but if you

2355
02:06:08,229 --> 02:06:13,750
did want like overshoot but let you know

2356
02:06:11,739 --> 02:06:15,519
just to illustrate the point so if this

2357
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:18,789
is the actual parameters that we put in

2358
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:21,760
there mmm we should be able to see the

2359
02:06:18,789 --> 02:06:25,289
overshoot happen now in theory anyway

2360
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:28,980
right although I'm not really seeing any

2361
02:06:25,289 --> 02:06:28,979
to be honest Oh

2362
02:06:29,819 --> 02:06:48,849
because I didn't use the variables that

2363
02:06:34,289 --> 02:06:56,699
would do it okay try overtime why am I

2364
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:56,700
not what I do wrong here

2365
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:05,770
that's what I did wrong

2366
02:07:02,969 --> 02:07:10,630
V and you are specifications they're not

2367
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:13,860
the actual values so that's what we

2368
02:07:10,630 --> 02:07:13,859
actually need sorry about that

2369
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:20,890
try that one more time

2370
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:28,320
I still screwed up

2371
02:07:20,890 --> 02:07:36,610
you V our a is V + 2 + u e+

2372
02:07:28,319 --> 02:07:39,420
wait what d + 2 - you rather oh don't

2373
02:07:36,609 --> 02:07:39,420
ask me what that's about

2374
02:07:41,729 --> 02:07:48,039
so don't use you as a variable i guess

2375
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:52,000
is the lesson cuz to you is valid

2376
02:07:48,039 --> 02:08:00,698
because it's unsigned i think all right

2377
02:07:52,000 --> 02:08:02,469
so there's with overshoot right but you

2378
02:08:00,698 --> 02:08:04,419
see how the overshoot is really kind of

2379
02:08:02,469 --> 02:08:07,989
unpleasant and the reason for that i

2380
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:10,659
think is again it's just it's not it

2381
02:08:07,988 --> 02:08:13,089
needs it needs to overshoot and then

2382
02:08:10,659 --> 02:08:18,309
smooth out and you need a really a

2383
02:08:13,090 --> 02:08:21,219
Quadra whatever you've got quartic for

2384
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:23,500
that or split it into two cubics but a

2385
02:08:21,219 --> 02:08:26,159
single cubic can't really express that

2386
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:26,159
does that make sense

2387
02:08:40,010 --> 02:08:50,000
so anyway this is what I actually wanted

2388
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:53,539
which is to say that I want the it to do

2389
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:56,659
a nice soft landing there and so when we

2390
02:08:53,539 --> 02:08:59,899
actually run this this is what I kind of

2391
02:08:56,659 --> 02:09:01,609
want the camera more to feel like and so

2392
02:08:59,899 --> 02:09:11,029
I think that's what will mostly be going

2393
02:09:01,609 --> 02:09:15,109
with there and so that's gonna be it for

2394
02:09:11,029 --> 02:09:20,539
today tomorrow I will talk about this

2395
02:09:15,109 --> 02:09:32,479
the next step oh I kind of like this can

2396
02:09:20,539 --> 02:09:35,029
you save this what we made here I don't

2397
02:09:32,479 --> 02:09:42,279
I just want like a like a hot link to it

2398
02:09:35,029 --> 02:09:42,279
here we go

2399
02:09:48,119 --> 02:09:51,210
[Music]

2400
02:09:52,409 --> 02:10:12,519
yeah um there we go

2401
02:09:58,140 --> 02:10:18,579
busy a curve done so how do I can I

2402
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:20,530
remove this so now we can go to handmade

2403
02:10:18,579 --> 02:10:25,229
Bezier curve and there is our beautiful

2404
02:10:20,529 --> 02:10:29,219
Bezier curve that's a cool website uh

2405
02:10:25,229 --> 02:10:34,678
whoever Decimus is thank you

2406
02:10:29,219 --> 02:10:39,369
for this website that was really cool

2407
02:10:34,679 --> 02:10:41,710
like four basic graphing stuff that is

2408
02:10:39,369 --> 02:10:44,409
really helpful because it lets you

2409
02:10:41,710 --> 02:10:50,409
illustrate points much more easily than

2410
02:10:44,409 --> 02:10:52,029
you probably could you know it would

2411
02:10:50,409 --> 02:10:53,800
take a while for me to draw all that out

2412
02:10:52,029 --> 02:10:55,869
and here you know and people can now

2413
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:57,100
grab that link and play with it

2414
02:10:55,869 --> 02:10:59,170
themselves like that's that's great

2415
02:10:57,100 --> 02:11:07,449
that's like a really good educational

2416
02:10:59,170 --> 02:11:09,630
tool right Bravo sir like very very well

2417
02:11:07,448 --> 02:11:09,629
done

2418
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:30,350
yeah it's wse 2:05 kqp L someone wants

2419
02:11:21,659 --> 02:11:33,779
to post that in the chat wse 2:05 k QP L

2420
02:11:30,350 --> 02:11:38,789
that's the link Decimus comm /

2421
02:11:33,779 --> 02:11:42,149
calculator with that in there yeah

2422
02:11:38,789 --> 02:11:46,439
all right folks hmm and it seems it

2423
02:11:42,149 --> 02:11:48,779
seems like it works it seems like you

2424
02:11:46,439 --> 02:11:50,159
can just grab that link and go all right

2425
02:11:48,779 --> 02:11:51,389
thank you one for joining me for this

2426
02:11:50,159 --> 02:11:53,609
sort of handmade here oh it's a pleasure

2427
02:11:51,390 --> 02:11:54,810
coding with you as always if you want to

2428
02:11:53,609 --> 02:11:57,269
follow along series at home you can

2429
02:11:54,810 --> 02:11:59,490
always peer to the game on handmade here

2430
02:11:57,270 --> 02:12:02,850
org and it comes with the source code so

2431
02:11:59,489 --> 02:12:04,469
you can play around with it yourself and

2432
02:12:02,850 --> 02:12:07,260
maybe you want to play with the triple H

2433
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:10,050
parameters and see what you think I'll

2434
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:12,060
be back tomorrow for the second part of

2435
02:12:10,050 --> 02:12:15,539
camera interpolation so that we can get

2436
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:17,789
the function structure it in a way that

2437
02:12:15,539 --> 02:12:20,310
allows us to update the target because

2438
02:12:17,789 --> 02:12:22,140
really right now it's not in that form I

2439
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:24,060
just sewed the basic way to interpolate

2440
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:26,850
from one point to another but we haven't

2441
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:30,420
really talked about what we would do if

2442
02:12:26,850 --> 02:12:32,550
we didn't know like where the target was

2443
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:34,260
or how it was moving around and we just

2444
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:37,079
kind of have to speculate me update the

2445
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:39,180
camera at any given time to make that

2446
02:12:37,079 --> 02:12:42,960
happen so what we want to do is kind of

2447
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:45,060
like figure out a way to you know reform

2448
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:46,800
that function using what we now know

2449
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:48,390
about the interpolation and how we want

2450
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:52,320
it to kind of ease in and ease out of

2451
02:12:48,390 --> 02:12:55,140
things we want to figure out a way to

2452
02:12:52,319 --> 02:12:57,989
get that working right so that's what we

2453
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:59,640
will try to figure out on next time and

2454
02:12:57,989 --> 02:13:03,719
that will be a harder problem that's

2455
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:05,880
sort of more of a finesse thing and

2456
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:07,050
isn't quite so easy you saw today how

2457
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:09,300
you could just write the math out and

2458
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:11,610
just happens it's not so simple to do

2459
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:12,720
the second part but we'll tackle it and

2460
02:13:11,609 --> 02:13:14,670
we'll get something good going tomorrow

2461
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:16,260
so I hope see you back here for that

2462
02:13:14,670 --> 02:13:18,390
till then have fun programming and I'll

2463
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:20,039
see everyone on the Internet I'm

2464
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:21,450
assuming John is still streaming so

2465
02:13:20,039 --> 02:13:22,840
hopefully we'll go see what John's up to

2466
02:13:21,449 --> 02:13:24,550
now

2467
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:26,909
if that actually happened all right take

2468
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:26,909
you to everybody
