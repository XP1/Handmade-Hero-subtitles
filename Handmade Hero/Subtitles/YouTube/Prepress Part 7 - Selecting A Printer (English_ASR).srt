1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
so now let's talk about picking a

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:10,949
printer to work with and I just want to

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,509
give you some ideas so if you ever want

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:15,449
to do this process if you ever wanna

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,500
print a graphic novel or you know

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:22,980
somebody who does just some ideas to put

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,609
in your head about how this works what

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,380
the costs are and how to make sure that

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,279
you're gonna get like an actual high

10
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:34,289
quality job now the first part of

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,360
getting a high quality job from a

12
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:40,769
printer and doing it right you now

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,649
already know cuz everything we just

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,149
talked about you're like so far ahead of

15
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,259
somebody who doesn't know all that stuff

16
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,460
because now you know all about the

17
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:52,019
inking process you know all about the

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,910
pre-press you know all that stuff and so

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,140
you're already in a position to talk to

20
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,448
your printer and ask them questions

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,698
prepare them good quality input files

22
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:01,049
and you'll be saying things that if they

23
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:02,579
don't know what they're doing it'll be

24
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,408
kind of apparent to you probably pretty

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,118
soon right so you're already got a

26
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,430
little bit of a leg up because if you

27
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:09,959
know all this stuff and how like I see

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,420
color profiles work and how the printing

29
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,188
press process goes and flat blacks and

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,530
rich blacks and spa cloths and all this

31
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,089
stuff if you know those things you know

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,409
you can at least have a little bit

33
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,270
better time of like detecting if there's

34
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,710
something off right cuz you're you know

35
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:27,118
what's going on you're not just taking

36
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,250
what they say and assuming it's true

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,569
you've got some context to understand

38
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,150
the process and when they say something

39
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:34,919
if it doesn't seem to slot into the

40
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,570
understanding you can be like wait wet

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,978
and you know get get a little bit more

42
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:44,849
clarification and more information for

43
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:49,859
them from them on that so let's talk

44
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:51,809
about other things you can do to help

45
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,810
pick a good printer and I'm going to

46
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,990
talk about it in two phases one is

47
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,560
looking for artifacts and the other is

48
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:03,629
pricing so I'm gonna take it as a given

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,640
that after everything that I just said

50
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,798
in all of the previous stuff about

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,610
pre-press that you now know what you're

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,310
looking for

53
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,380
in terms of when you go to look for a

54
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,180
printer you

55
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,519
know what you need you need a

56
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,780
high-volume unit well high volumes fry

57
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,070
electrum you you know how many you need

58
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,719
to print five hundred a thousand two

59
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:22,849
thousand copies so you know your volume

60
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,169
you know what you're printing like I

61
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,030
said you want like roughly you know

62
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:28,579
maybe you're looking for some sort of 80

63
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:33,409
pound matte paper interior and maybe you

64
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:36,290
want you know a 12-point cover with spot

65
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:38,240
UV ores you know in the foils right so

66
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,769
you'll at least know when you go to the

67
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,230
printers web page where you call them on

68
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,610
the phone or how or email them you can

69
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:46,099
ask if they have what you need so you're

70
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,720
gonna know do they even have the

71
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,659
capability to do what you need so

72
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,819
assuming you found someone who has the

73
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:55,069
capability of what you need you can tell

74
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:58,549
them about your job in our kit we have a

75
00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:01,489
hundred ninety two page graphic novel we

76
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:05,200
want printed 80 pounds matte paper on

77
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:16,850
the interior we want a spot UV matte

78
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:22,099
cover with spot gloss 12.12.2012 pointer

79
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:24,019
to why they do that um this is a job is

80
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,599
that something you guys can handle right

81
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,340
and so you're gonna know whether they're

82
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,960
in the running at all if you contact

83
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,060
some printers because it's whether they

84
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,760
can even do this thing at all but then

85
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,580
after they say they can or can't do it

86
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:40,129
you want to impress upon them we're

87
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:44,000
looking for a really high quality work

88
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:46,759
and we want to see samples of something

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,110
close to what we're asking for so can

90
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,429
you send us something right and what you

91
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,840
want to do is you want to take that

92
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:59,480
something that they send you and you

93
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,420
want to really scrutinize it for issues

94
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,729
so I'm gonna now show you what it will

95
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:08,750
look like when you don't really see much

96
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:14,599
in the way of issues so here for example

97
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:19,970
is a craft novel right and if we zoom in

98
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:22,939
on this you know as I'm looking through

99
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,410
here what do I see well you know it's

100
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:27,139
true that me

101
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:31,520
there's a little bit of chromatic

102
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:33,979
aberration along those edges I don't see

103
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,259
very much that isn't probably mostly due

104
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,810
to my camera if we're honest about it

105
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:42,019
right and if you look at the millimeter

106
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,670
ruler here I mean you know looking at

107
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:46,129
areas where different colors touch each

108
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,900
other and just looking at places where

109
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:50,089
you might have blacks that roll off in

110
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:52,399
other colors you can start to just like

111
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:55,039
scrutinizes do you see any egregious

112
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,479
errors right and I you don't right and

113
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,060
if you look at some professional ones

114
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,730
that you have on your shelf you're not

115
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,800
gonna see anything weird when you start

116
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:07,040
looking at these right you're gonna see

117
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,319
pretty clean you know I'm saying it's

118
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,850
gonna be pretty clean and so you can

119
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,170
look in there you can see like you know

120
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,060
you shouldn't see too much blur on those

121
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,040
lines and again like I said I don't know

122
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,530
how much I don't have a macro lens so I

123
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,810
can't really zoom in here until too much

124
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:24,109
on those like I don't think that that's

125
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:27,230
an RD blur so that's probably not them

126
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,370
that's probably my camera but if you

127
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,569
happen to have a macro that's or you

128
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,629
could slap on a scanner if you have a

129
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:34,310
good flatbed scanner but the point is

130
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:38,810
you shouldn't see anything on the

131
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:41,389
millimeter scale right what does it look

132
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,670
like when you do well here's an example

133
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:46,149
of a sample we got from someone who we

134
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:49,189
did not go with for very obvious reasons

135
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:53,689
look at how much chromatic aberration

136
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:55,670
you can see in this it's like at least a

137
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,189
third of a millimeter if not a half

138
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,650
millimeter on the millimeter ruler right

139
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:03,019
and you can see like this is nowhere

140
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:06,469
near the camera resolution I can zoom

141
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:08,479
out pretty far and it is obvious right

142
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,580
and this is exactly the thing I was

143
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,710
talking about if they don't have a good

144
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:16,219
registration process when they print

145
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:18,589
something you can see immediately these

146
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,450
really bad sort of Fringe artifacts

147
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,589
there now never mind the fact that

148
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:25,639
nobody should have probably been

149
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:28,459
printing at 21 with rich black in the

150
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:32,599
first place so the pre-press sucked on

151
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:34,789
this as well but you know even if it

152
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,010
hadn't you would have seen a lot of this

153
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,060
chromatic aberration just in the quality

154
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,250
of the print job is

155
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,829
just not gonna be very good right

156
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,980
because he got these really big errors

157
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:47,240
everywhere and yeah when you look at the

158
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,379
font you know the thing if you're just

159
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,300
looking at from here maybe doesn't look

160
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:53,689
that bad but it definitely looks worse

161
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,770
than a high quality print job right so

162
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,779
you really want to look at those

163
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:58,279
registration errors see how the inks

164
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:00,379
look to the inks of nice and vibrant if

165
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,029
the paper look good is the registration

166
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,469
on target you shouldn't see any real

167
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,119
errors especially not the naked eye

168
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,620
which you can hear but even when you

169
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,000
zoom in that should be pretty close you

170
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,579
shouldn't be seeing like millimeter air

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,889
like a third of a millimeter or or

172
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:15,228
quarter of a millimeter errors are not a

173
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,990
common tolerance like modern

174
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:20,930
registration is pretty darn good there

175
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:26,780
is a bit of wobble there but it's not

176
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:28,129
like that right okay so and just to show

177
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,989
like this is the same book right you can

178
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:31,759
see here's another example so this time

179
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,478
it was the cyan plate that was D

180
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,189
registered right and the the magenta

181
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,439
yellow pates were like aligned so you

182
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,149
can I already told you all this right

183
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,709
you can you should know just by looking

184
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:45,228
at that you can see what happened right

185
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:47,319
you had a see my pass on top of your

186
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:50,839
black pass so this was a rich black and

187
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,750
the cyan plate was shifted up right I

188
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:57,699
mean that's that's what that is

189
00:07:52,750 --> 00:08:00,350
so that's what you don't want to see and

190
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:01,849
that's how you know you've got a quality

191
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,169
registration process and a quality

192
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,090
inking process if you're not seeing

193
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:07,219
those errors there's other errors you

194
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:10,009
could see you don't want to see like a

195
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,289
flimsy binding right you don't want to

196
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,418
see this kind of thing happening right

197
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:17,060
where it's pulling apart you don't want

198
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:21,228
to see glue errors and you can kind of

199
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:24,560
see in here right and so on I so you

200
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:26,959
just want to scrutinize the book take a

201
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,500
good look at a high quality graphic

202
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,250
novel printed recently you know what it

203
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,469
looks like

204
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,330
look it through it looks good there

205
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:37,459
aren't these obvious tears take a look

206
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,389
at the samples it should look that good

207
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:44,599
that's what you're looking for right now

208
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:47,689
we didn't talk much about binding and we

209
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,220
can mention binding a little bit there's

210
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,660
really not much for you to pick other

211
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,440
than what type of binding you actually

212
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:53,179
want MOU

213
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,970
graphic novels are what are called

214
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:58,669
perfect bound and what that is is when

215
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,910
you actually take all the Jimmy all the

216
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:03,559
sheets of paper so let me do it aside on

217
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:05,629
binding just so you kind of have a

218
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:08,329
little bit of process so when all these

219
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:10,429
sheets come out and they get cut you

220
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,310
then have all of the sheets getting

221
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:15,379
assembled into what constitutes the

222
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:15,769
actual interior of the book without the

223
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:19,250
cover

224
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:22,250
that's called a book block I believe in

225
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:25,009
printer parlance so like one physical

226
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,309
unit of the interior pages of one whole

227
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:31,220
book is called a book block and the book

228
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:32,689
block essentially gets into usually a

229
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,769
machine that you can do this by hand

230
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,390
people there are people who do perfect

231
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,069
minds by hand like artists and binder

232
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:39,110
E's and stuff like this they do my hand

233
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,940
too but I believe they're almost always

234
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,289
done by machine at any high volume place

235
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,290
because oh my god it would be really

236
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:46,909
hard to do by hand so it's gonna go into

237
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:51,740
a machine that's effectively going to

238
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:54,259
grind away and create pitting in the

239
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,269
binding side of all of those pages of

240
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:58,309
the book block so all the books are

241
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:00,259
stacked up and the binding side it's

242
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:02,899
gonna like grind and make pitting in

243
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:07,340
there and then it's going to suffuse

244
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:09,590
that with glue and so that the book is

245
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,470
now like physically like adhered

246
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:15,649
together in like just that one reason

247
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:18,590
and you can see I don't know if the

248
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:20,929
webcam is good enough to show you this

249
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:24,190
but if you've got one at home you could

250
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:27,469
pick it up let me go ahead and and just

251
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,170
try adding like a whole one here I don't

252
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,509
know if I can can make this webcam

253
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:34,399
bigger here but oh you know what I don't

254
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,990
even have to do that let me just use

255
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,500
that Kickstarter video again because

256
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,620
that one was I believe the binding very

257
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:47,299
clearly in one of the shots there as it

258
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:50,899
was coming up okay so if we go to Molly

259
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:52,069
oops if we go to Molly rocket comm such

260
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,470
projects that should take us straight

261
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:58,220
there right now since that's our going

262
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:02,899
project so if we go back to that binding

263
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:04,590
video which is right here you can see

264
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,620
without the low resolution

265
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:11,490
webcams you can actually see as this

266
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:14,039
gets tilted do you see that crease to

267
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:17,460
see it running right down there so you

268
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:19,709
write and when you turn the pages you'll

269
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,230
see that there's like a little bit that

270
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:25,290
doesn't really turn to a certain extent

271
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:28,289
right and you can see the and that

272
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:31,620
itself is the perfect binding process

273
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:34,829
Network glue was injected in at just

274
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,970
that one end and created like a solid

275
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:41,580
block all the way along that strip so

276
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,830
now the book has been like fuse together

277
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:47,190
with glue basically so that it won't

278
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:49,470
like come apart anymore at that end so

279
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,320
that is what they do to the book block

280
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,750
and once that's been glued together they

281
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,690
wrap the cover around basically and glue

282
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,330
that on against the end of the book

283
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,980
block and that's how you get a perfect

284
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,500
binding and that's what almost all

285
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,850
graphic novels that I see use but you

286
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,139
can do whatever you want there's all

287
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,759
kinds of other buying styles there

288
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:10,439
saddle stitch where they actually like

289
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,389
put like thread through it there's

290
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,950
spiral-bound where there's like you know

291
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:16,620
actual physical rings going through it

292
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,540
you know do whatever you want but I

293
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,509
believe graphic novels nowadays at least

294
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:25,469
anyone that I've ever seen and then

295
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:27,929
really I mean if it's not a hardcover

296
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,750
book if it's if it's if it's a soft

297
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:33,120
cover or you know trade paperback or any

298
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,379
of that stuff it's perfect binding seems

299
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,659
like what I've seen for graphic novels

300
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,159
pretty much always these days I don't

301
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:39,659
know that could be wrong I'm not a

302
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,490
graphic novel expert by any stretch of

303
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,750
the imagination like you know we went

304
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,159
through this process to make one so I

305
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,649
learned all the technical details but

306
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,240
you know I'm I'm far from authoritative

307
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,659
I'm like what the latest issue of like

308
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,789
spider-man is or something right so so

309
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,889
anyway that's just an aside on the

310
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,839
binding process and again they're really

311
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:59,819
all you're looking for there is does it

312
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,680
look like a competent job it should not

313
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,090
come apart at all if you want to

314
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,279
actually rip the binding you should have

315
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,840
to apply a lot of force to rip that

316
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,730
binding so push in there a little bit

317
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,710
make sure there's not a lot of give make

318
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,840
sure there's not glue coming apart there

319
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,970
or paint peeling I mean it's not paint

320
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,590
sank but like ink transferring to the

321
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,300
wrong side because like the glue went in

322
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,120
it you know

323
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,949
make sure there's none of that and

324
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,190
assuming that you've satisfied yourself

325
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,770
that the samples from the printer are

326
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,960
good enough quality then you're usually

327
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,269
pretty good to go and the only things

328
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,730
you have to start worrying about then is

329
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:37,319
the price of the print job I think I've

330
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,230
covered just about everything else you

331
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,050
might want to know so before I go into

332
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,149
pricing and how that works let me just

333
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:48,169
take one more break for questions if

334
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:48,169
anyone has them

335
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,339
looks like no question so I think we can

336
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:30,560
just roll into the last section and then

337
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:38,570
we're good and then you know everything

338
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:40,519
I know about printing okay so as you've

339
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,589
heard me say over and over again

340
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,049
throughout the entire part where I was

341
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:46,850
talking about pre-press and then how the

342
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:50,269
printing press actually operates and all

343
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:54,519
that stuff what you need to understand

344
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:59,809
now is that everything I said there

345
00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:02,230
implies that there is not a flat cost to

346
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:04,759
producing an individual book right

347
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,190
because think about all the stuff I said

348
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,450
you gotta buy inks in bulk you gotta buy

349
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,000
paper in bulk

350
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:14,150
you gotta set up like these coding

351
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,509
processes you have to make individual

352
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:19,490
plates like we were estimating what

353
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:22,189
twelve of them from now the infinite

354
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:25,100
that our actual physical etching is for

355
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:27,410
light laying down ink through a process

356
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,278
you've got to mount all that stuff on

357
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:34,189
your press and start running it right so

358
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:37,789
it's not the kind of thing where the

359
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,020
cost to print a book is X dollars that's

360
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:43,028
not how it works

361
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:46,490
there is like a massive amount of like

362
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:48,769
investment into printing just one book

363
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,899
but once you've done all of that

364
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:53,809
investment in creating all the stuff and

365
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:55,490
setting up the press the actual cost to

366
00:15:53,809 --> 00:16:01,009
print any individual book is

367
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:03,440
considerably less right so you have to

368
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:05,929
approach the printing process thinking

369
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,700
about it much more like an industrial

370
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:09,829
fabrication process because that's

371
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,740
basically what it is it's a lot like

372
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:15,259
making the casings for an iPhone you

373
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,120
have to make a whole tooling with like a

374
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:19,129
mold that's gonna get stuff poured into

375
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,220
it and all NASA and once you actually

376
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:23,958
have the machine and some people sitting

377
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,350
there to like operate it to produce

378
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:29,119
these iPhone cases well each individual

379
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,300
iPhone case isn't very expensive now is

380
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,840
it but all of that work making the molds

381
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,849
designing like the you know

382
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,600
Machinery to do it properly all that

383
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,580
stuff that was the work now it's not

384
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,029
high-tech because it's printing we

385
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,650
understand it now it's fairly well

386
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:50,009
streamlined so it's not like they have

387
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:52,199
to engineer anything but much like just

388
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,819
making the molds for something it still

389
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,250
has to happen so there's a physical

390
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,379
process with some manual labor it

391
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,700
involves computers now too so there's

392
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:01,529
like a computer operator is gonna you

393
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,180
know have it start doing some kind of

394
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:06,599
like lithography to print the plate or

395
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:11,579
something like this right that whole

396
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:13,829
process cost time materials and you're

397
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,759
gonna pay for it whether you print a

398
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:20,819
single book or 10,000 books

399
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:24,420
so the actual anatomy of a print process

400
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,909
looks very different depending on what

401
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:30,029
number of books you're actually trying

402
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:33,870
to make and this is why you will see

403
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:38,579
stuff like print on demand for example

404
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:42,149
or printing 50 books they won't even use

405
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:44,549
a offset printing process like the

406
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,590
multiple passes of ink on two giant

407
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:49,950
sheets they won't even do that they'll

408
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:52,199
use like an inkjet printer basically to

409
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,750
print small volumes of things why

410
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,460
because if you're only printing one book

411
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,369
that needs to get shipped to one person

412
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,569
right now you don't get any savings from

413
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,339
doing any of the stuff we were just

414
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:03,779
talking about because you'd waste all of

415
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:05,399
your money producing these things and

416
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:07,139
then you'd roll one book out of there

417
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,240
and then you got to take them off right

418
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,240
it just doesn't make sense so

419
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:16,099
fundamentally speaking the primary thing

420
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,150
you have to be aware of is it's

421
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:19,980
definitely if you're talking about

422
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,320
starting to print 500 a thousand two

423
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,599
thousand books which is generally what

424
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,750
you're gonna be looking at in this case

425
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:30,119
you don't want to be thinking of it as a

426
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,039
per book cost model because that's just

427
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:35,789
fundamentally not what it looks like

428
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:42,180
right it looks like a breakdown so let's

429
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:43,829
take a look at an example so this if it

430
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,070
can load up there we go

431
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:50,009
so this is an actual set of estimates so

432
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:53,278
these are nine these aren't fictitious I

433
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:55,589
didn't make them up these are an actual

434
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:59,130
set of estimates from an actual printers

435
00:18:55,589 --> 00:19:01,470
online estimation tool so when you go

436
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,419
for an automated quote these are

437
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,950
actually what you would get back for

438
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,519
basically for printing

439
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:12,028
meowww the infinite with them and what

440
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:16,079
you can see here is the curve is not

441
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:19,288
even close to a line right at 1,000

442
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,839
books it costs almost $8 to print a book

443
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:24,269
now eight dollars and considering the

444
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,589
fact that like once you actually talk

445
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:28,048
about because like if you talk about our

446
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:31,109
Kickstarter the cheapest tear that

447
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:33,210
includes a printed copy is $25 where

448
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:34,888
does that price come from well if you

449
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,759
start thinking about the actual pricing

450
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:40,949
model it costs us $8 roughly for the

451
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,138
most expensive shipping we might do in

452
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,700
the continental or actually the send in

453
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:46,859
the United States because shipping is

454
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,480
actually this is one of the weirdest

455
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:50,729
things about printing books now shipping

456
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,370
is actually more expensive often than

457
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,230
the book right so you have somewhere

458
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:57,629
between a five and eight dollar shipping

459
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,669
charge and then you're gonna have like

460
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,289
an eight dollar to print out the book

461
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:03,389
charge right so you're talking about

462
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:06,839
something like sixteen dollars of fixed

463
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:09,028
cost that you have to pay before you've

464
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,038
done any accounting for all the work

465
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:12,690
like before you even count trying to pay

466
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,440
Ana for the time it took her to draw the

467
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:19,710
book right so you can see that that's a

468
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:23,580
big deal actually because as that number

469
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:26,220
gets pretty high you're starting to not

470
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:28,528
make anything on this book and you're

471
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,750
more or less made it for free like all

472
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:33,980
of your labor and all of the work you

473
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:37,919
did you just paid for it yourself right

474
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:41,460
so you really don't want to be at the

475
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,919
thousand line you probably want to be

476
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,350
more like at the 2,000 line as this gets

477
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,778
down as you can print more of these out

478
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:51,269
you start to get to a knee of the curve

479
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:53,308
where you're almost getting like you're

480
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:55,470
down to like only about five dollars per

481
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:56,740
book and that means you're actually a

482
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,289
lot more Headroom

483
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,558
right if you're selling a book for $20

484
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:04,119
or $25 you can actually recoup some

485
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,069
reasonable amount of money if you're

486
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,619
able to sell 500 or a thousand of these

487
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:10,539
things right now it's not programmer

488
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:13,389
money right like it's not gonna compete

489
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:14,289
with tech right but nobody makes a comic

490
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,850
because they're trying to compete with

491
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:17,558
tech right I mean you're never that's

492
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,178
those are ridiculous salaries right

493
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:20,589
you're just trying to make something

494
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:21,790
you're trying to be self-sustaining

495
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:23,859
whatever right you're trying to make

496
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:25,899
something out of it and you can see it's

497
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:27,639
you'd really don't want to be up here

498
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,840
especially not if you ever want to have

499
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,000
a sale on these things like if you ever

500
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:33,819
want to sell heaven forfend you try to

501
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,529
sell a book for $15 at that point you

502
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:37,058
make nothing you're losing money on

503
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:39,700
every one at that point between the

504
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:43,420
shipping and the book so you can see

505
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:46,960
that this curve is very very curved it

506
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:49,779
is not a line right and so you can see

507
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,900
as you increase the number of copies you

508
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:56,289
come down to an asymptotic per book rate

509
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,630
and that's specifically because like I

510
00:21:56,289 --> 00:22:02,230
said there's a big fixed upfront cost

511
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:05,290
and then every book you print those

512
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,360
books cost very little so the actual

513
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:10,509
amount that you're maybe paying per book

514
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,609
might be only like $3.00 per book but

515
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:14,769
there was a huge five thousand six

516
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:16,808
thousand dollar upfront cost or

517
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:21,670
something like that that you had to pay

518
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:24,160
if you only even printed one so at some

519
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,590
level you have to look at this in volume

520
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,440
you simply won't ever be able to be

521
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:32,289
self-sustaining or even pay yourself a

522
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,740
modicum of money for your time making a

523
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:38,440
comic if you don't take into account the

524
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,509
fact that the volume curve is really not

525
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,789
in your favor if you're anywhere under

526
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:46,450
2,000 and what you can see here when you

527
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:48,579
look at this curve right is that two

528
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,539
thousand really is one of the points of

529
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:51,009
diminishing returns

530
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,678
it's sort of an inflection point in this

531
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:56,259
curve somewhere around 2500 for this

532
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,890
particular printer you can see that you

533
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:03,670
start to like level out so as you

534
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:05,890
increase 4,000 5,000 6,000 you're not

535
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,390
saving that much money per book as

536
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,300
you're getting up to these really high

537
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:13,060
rates so it really

538
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:14,950
who's you to figure out can you find a

539
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:18,669
way to sell 2,000 of these books over

540
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:20,590
time if you can that will make it a lot

541
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:23,230
more likely that you can really pay

542
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:26,679
yourself something for having done all

543
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,769
the work whereas if you're printing 500

544
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:32,950
heaven forfend or even a thousand it's

545
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:35,829
really hard to pay yourself anything for

546
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:39,039
the time that you put into this and it's

547
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:42,879
really actually pretty sad in my opinion

548
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:45,879
because drawing comic is a fantastic

549
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,530
amount of work for an artist I mean they

550
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:52,830
make next to nothing on it

551
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:56,920
and it is so much work I mean it is

552
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:57,939
every page is eight or nine drawings in

553
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,920
full-color

554
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,920
that they have to make and they're

555
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,420
making 300 pages of these over the

556
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:08,200
course of two books or something like

557
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:10,930
that right I mean it's amazing what

558
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,700
comic artists do and how diligent they

559
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,279
are to ever get a comic done if an

560
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,049
artist ever gets a comic done I think

561
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,759
they deserve a tremendous amount of

562
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:21,669
credit because it is like an incredibly

563
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,950
incredibly labor-intensive process and

564
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:28,450
especially if that comic actually looks

565
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:30,430
good I mean wow so again it's not in

566
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,740
your favor physical goods never are

567
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:35,950
nobody wants to pay 50 dollars for a

568
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:39,579
graphic novel unless you are the world's

569
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:42,490
most lauded comic artist or something

570
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:44,769
so you're just really trying to figure

571
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:47,380
out can you maybe make it to like the

572
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:49,660
2000 range and hope over a couple years

573
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,910
to sell those books and maybe you store

574
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,259
them in your garage it really does help

575
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,930
because then you're at least making

576
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:58,089
something on every copy instead of

577
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,509
really not making something this is also

578
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:03,189
where conventions help because a

579
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:05,140
convention doesn't have the shipping

580
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,580
overhead so yeah you got to pay a

581
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,130
hundred two hundred dollars to the table

582
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:12,759
but if it's a local convention well two

583
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:15,310
hundred dollars divided by eight right

584
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:17,049
that's only twenty twenty-five books you

585
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:19,359
have to sell at that convention before

586
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,980
you're clearing what your shipping costs

587
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,059
would have been and now you're never

588
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,069
paying that shipping cost

589
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:26,379
so again convention

590
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:28,299
it's really unfortunate that they're all

591
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,030
gonna be canceled because that's another

592
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:32,799
way you can either a reduce the price of

593
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:36,160
your book so instead of trying 25 and

594
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,750
you can charge 15 or 20 which helps

595
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,000
people be able to buy it you know

596
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,529
someone's more likely to buy something

597
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,170
if it's less expensive potentially right

598
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:45,549
or it just helps you recoup some money

599
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,039
you know so that you can pay yourself

600
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:49,450
something so but unfortunately they're

601
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,190
gone hopefully maybe someday they'll

602
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,319
come back that's why they're very

603
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,150
helpful for comic artists that shipping

604
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:57,279
goes away so in addition to having the

605
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,570
audience there you're not paying these

606
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,940
really big shipping charges because

607
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:02,950
that's a huge cost on top of things and

608
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:06,970
so either you pass it on to the customer

609
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,650
and you're charging $25 a book or you

610
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,339
just make nothing and it's it's a little

611
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:13,780
bit of an issue so again pricing curve

612
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:15,849
it's a bit rough you want to be higher

613
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:17,079
volume but you only really have to make

614
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:18,429
it to two thousand and then it's your

615
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:20,470
pretty good shape there's diminishing

616
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:22,720
returns in terms of perfect costs for

617
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,549
going out that far now one of the things

618
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,069
I want to point out is I sort of said oh

619
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:29,470
look this is sort of like a fixed

620
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:31,779
upfront cost plus a per book cost well

621
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:33,130
you know a lot of us are programmers

622
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:34,899
here I'm certainly programmers so I

623
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,720
thought you might want to see here's

624
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,340
what happens if you just try to guess

625
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,259
what's your printers fixed cost and

626
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:42,699
what's there per book cost again this

627
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:44,049
isn't the printer we went with that's

628
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,590
why I used it because I didn't want to

629
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:48,819
show their estimates and like because

630
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:50,139
you know that may be confidential of

631
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:51,970
them you know I don't want to put them

632
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:56,170
on the spot so I picked someone else who

633
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:58,779
we did not use and here's me making a

634
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:00,910
curve that is just fifty five hundred

635
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:03,279
dollars of fixed costs to make the set

636
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:06,690
up and two dollars and 40 cents per book

637
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:12,220
and I mean it's not the exact estimate

638
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:14,650
but it's real close right so again that

639
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,259
simplification of just thinking there's

640
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:20,320
some upfront costs probably five six

641
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:22,029
thousand dollars and that includes the

642
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,099
profit that the printer is making so

643
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:25,660
it's not the upfront cost to them but

644
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:29,429
it's the upfront cost in terms of they

645
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:31,930
need to make some money to write that is

646
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,430
plus some per book cost which is

647
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:35,170
probably around two dollars and forty

648
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,730
cents for our particular configuration

649
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,320
it will go up or down depending on how

650
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,630
fancy the cover is depending

651
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,619
how you know heavy the paper is or how

652
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:45,460
it's once the paper is all those are

653
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:46,869
things you can usually by looking at a

654
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,690
few estimates you can usually just

655
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:51,609
figure out what that is it's such an

656
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,080
obvious curve it's not exactly how

657
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:58,798
they're doing their estimates as you can

658
00:27:53,079 --> 00:28:02,699
see but it's pretty close right okay so

659
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:06,839
that's how print pricing works and

660
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:10,480
generally speaking in my experience I

661
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:12,939
haven't found that there's that much

662
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,899
variation if you ask for specific things

663
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:19,210
and you make them give you a quote it

664
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:21,759
turns out that it's oftentimes very

665
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,038
close the difference between printers

666
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,230
for professional quality graphic novel

667
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:30,759
printing that I have seen is actually

668
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:36,399
pretty consistent and what this means at

669
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:40,058
least to me is unless you really have

670
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,739
some well I mean well one reason could

671
00:28:40,058 --> 00:28:43,509
be you live somewhere where you're very

672
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,528
far from any center of industry where

673
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:50,288
there might be a reasonably good press

674
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:52,690
but for us there a lot of people we use

675
00:28:50,288 --> 00:28:55,658
like print ninja or something where it's

676
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,669
like they send the stuff off to China it

677
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:59,950
gets printed there it gets loaded onto

678
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:02,830
container ships and comes back here and

679
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:06,730
then gets to you those places have

680
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:09,668
literally like 11 or 12 week turnaround

681
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:14,048
times it's like 3 months between when

682
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:16,899
you submit your final proofs and when

683
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:20,648
you actually get the printed stuff back

684
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:22,989
and when you actually add in how much

685
00:29:20,648 --> 00:29:26,439
shipping charge plot the estimate plus

686
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:29,048
the shipping and this included basically

687
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:34,240
like transport in this estimate I was

688
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:37,329
actually including that in here even

689
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,099
though their RVs there are price breaks

690
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:40,480
from the fact that printing in China is

691
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:43,798
cheaper than printing here it would

692
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,620
appear once you add in the actual

693
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:50,069
shipping it's basically the same like

694
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,659
there

695
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:55,679
again I don't want to give out people's

696
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:59,870
estimates that they gave us but we can

697
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:04,170
get the same cost roughly let's just say

698
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:06,629
of printing done locally as doing that

699
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:09,930
whole ridiculous round-trip process the

700
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,850
benefit you can literally go down there

701
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,710
if you need to again coronavirus maybe

702
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:16,409
makes that not as likely but the other

703
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:19,860
thing the turnaround time is like a few

704
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:22,320
weeks so because we didn't go with a

705
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,639
crazy overseas go there go put it on

706
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,700
container ship ship it back here go

707
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,040
through customs yeah right because we

708
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,680
don't do that process we're probably

709
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:37,369
gonna be able to deliver our graphic

710
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:40,170
novels to our Kickstarter backers like

711
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:42,569
in a fraction of the time it would have

712
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:43,920
taken for people who just like go online

713
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:46,220
and they see that a lot of people use

714
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,050
this overseas stuff so they do right so

715
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,850
the one takeaway that I would say here

716
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:52,470
from pricing because obviously you know

717
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,059
with everything I've told you you now

718
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,049
could go ask a printer for an estimate

719
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,089
now you'd probably understand what you

720
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,529
got back but the one thing that I really

721
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:02,279
want to present mine is like local

722
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:04,859
printers don't suck like there are good

723
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,569
ones and at least in our area it appears

724
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:09,389
that there are very good ones and they

725
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:10,649
are price competitive especially if you

726
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,570
actually take into account how much

727
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,090
extra you're gonna have to pay to do all

728
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:19,319
the shipping to get the books from

729
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:20,909
overseas to here and if you actually

730
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:22,319
then bother to go put a premium on the

731
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:25,560
fact that the turnaround time is very

732
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,029
high then it actually becomes much worse

733
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,440
to print them overseas because now not

734
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:30,240
only are you paying roughly the same

735
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,710
price but you also have this huge delay

736
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:38,430
in your process right so I think local

737
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:40,289
printing should maybe happen more and I

738
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,910
would highly recommend finding out what

739
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:45,029
presses are available in your area and

740
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:47,610
checking them out first before you

741
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:49,379
decide on an overseas printing option

742
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:51,689
because there are a lot of benefits to

743
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:56,070
it that are actually practical benefits

744
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:57,480
to you get estimates from everybody get

745
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:59,639
estimates from print ninja get estimates

746
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,140
from anybody you can find because you

747
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,640
want to know what's available and you

748
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:07,200
want to know what's out there but

749
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,200
pass up your local presses
