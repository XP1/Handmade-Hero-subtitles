00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,938
hello everybody and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,520
here the show we code a complete game

3
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,349
live on stream we did some bugging

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,599
yesterday and I think we are now at the

5
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:13,379
point where as far as I know we don't

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,560
really have any outstanding bugs in our

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,480
art pipeline stuff that we've done which

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,608
means that we are kind of free to import

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,250
stuff into our game and decorate the

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,710
world and add entities to the world

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:28,618
which brings us to sort of the port part

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,260
where we have to really start engaging

13
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,368
with the the the gameplay more again

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,809
which is not really something that I

15
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,600
like to do because I'm not a game

16
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:38,549
designer and I feel more comfortable

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,760
generally speaking when a game designer

18
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:44,399
is at the helm and so you know we're

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,869
kind of at the part in how we're oh and

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,640
if I don't remember the end of last

21
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,128
stream we loaded first we have a giant

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,448
cat for some reason so there are some

23
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,269
technical things we can do right now

24
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:56,339
like I said I kind of wanted to do

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,840
alignment point stuff so we can do so we

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,539
can add some stuff to like you know we

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,969
want to line the the head and the body

28
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,368
and stuff like that and we can add some

29
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,960
technical stuff in there but we are kind

30
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:08,609
of getting up to that point where it's

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,368
stuff I feel less comfortable with I

32
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:14,188
don't like doing game design oriented

33
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,019
stuff I'd much rather be in a situation

34
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:17,758
like on the witness or something where

35
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:19,859
John blows doing the design and I'm just

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,799
programming something that's a lot more

37
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,090
comfortable but you know we'll muddle

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,830
through it we'll be fine and we'll focus

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,040
on the technical issues of it as we go

40
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:35,099
so what I want to do here is I want to

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:38,750
take a look at just what we want to have

42
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:41,250
happen naturally and then I want to

43
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,759
augment our current system to provide

44
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,009
that thing so what I want to be able to

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,938
do and we're ignoring the fact that the

46
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,810
hero is a cat currently but what I want

47
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:56,398
to be able to do is place you know

48
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,070
throughout the world right now we've got

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,680
a couple different cats in the art set

50
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,898
three of them we've got a brown tabby

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,649
named Fred we've got a great tabby named

52
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:11,370
Molly and we've got a ghost cat named

53
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,259
Hannah who's a Behrman and we would like

54
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,759
to place them in the war

55
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:19,348
old somewhere right we would like to

56
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:21,539
when the game starts up you know we'd

57
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:24,328
like to place three cats around these

58
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:27,750
three cats around the orphanage and we'd

59
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:30,239
like them to just be available for the

60
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,400
cat and you know for the player to come

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,200
to and you know maybe when the player

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,700
hops up to it we want them to interact

63
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,119
in some way like you know maybe they

64
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,798
purr or something like this right so

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,509
they're they're kind of a set dressing

66
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,099
for the game and maybe they have some

67
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:46,348
gameplay ramifications later as we get

68
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,689
into it we'll see but basically the idea

69
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:50,818
is we want to be able do that simply and

70
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:53,878
so the question is how do we make it

71
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,768
easy for us to accomplish this task that

72
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:57,750
I've just stated what are the current

73
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,789
technical barriers present in our engine

74
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,759
that are going to cause that to not be

75
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:06,449
fluent and easy for us to do and how do

76
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:09,989
we break down those those those barriers

77
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:11,669
right so again the goal is we're sort of

78
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,500
taking again a snuffleupagus oriented

79
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,939
approach here I want to go make a thing

80
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,189
that lets me place cats in the world

81
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,709
easily I want that to be as low a

82
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,329
friction as low overhead as possible so

83
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,378
I'm going to go into the system and try

84
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:28,169
to do so and then when I do it I'm gonna

85
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:32,068
see what problems arise and try to solve

86
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:36,239
those problems with improved engine

87
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:37,828
capabilities now in terms of like one of

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,480
them like I said is already just the

89
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,639
alignment fact and there's also the

90
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,738
scale fact right there's a lining and

91
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,049
scaling and stuff that's why our cat is

92
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,310
like huge and the head is not right so

93
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,930
we know some of the things we're gonna

94
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,939
deal with but we don't necessarily know

95
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,560
them all so I'm gonna go ahead and place

96
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,150
some cats in the world and then we're

97
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,389
gonna address all of the issues that we

98
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,069
see and then we'll we can use that to

99
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:00,419
also place monsters in the world and so

100
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:02,848
on right we're gonna build up our

101
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,329
repertoire so that we no longer have any

102
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:08,009
friction associated with this because

103
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,400
remember what we're going to be doing

104
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:14,728
you know 50 days 50 day episodes from

105
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,370
now as we've got the world up and

106
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,788
running all of our work is going to

107
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,889
revolve around these sorts of things

108
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:24,449
generating entity structures in the

109
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,639
world and programming those entities to

110
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:29,490
do things is the entire

111
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,829
of what gameplay programming is and so

112
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,490
we want to continue and we want to start

113
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:38,519
a trend now and continue the trend of

114
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,228
refining the systems and interfaces to

115
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,359
those systems that are involved in that

116
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:44,788
till it's very low friction to

117
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,310
experiment and change because that is

118
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:50,938
what will determine whether or not our

119
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,829
game is any good in a world where we had

120
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,840
a designer right and that's what I'm

121
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:56,639
trying to prepare you for right in other

122
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,348
words if you were the engine programmer

123
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,478
or one of many engine programmers

124
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:03,060
hopefully on some engine programming

125
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,188
team that is what you are trying to

126
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,899
accomplish because it doesn't matter how

127
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:09,240
good your gameplay programmers or game

128
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:10,468
designers are if the systems that they

129
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,810
have to interface with are very

130
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:14,668
laborious and onerous to work with then

131
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,620
they will not be able to iterate fast

132
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:18,750
enough on the design to make it any good

133
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,019
and this definitely you see this in a

134
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,478
lot of places there's a lot of times

135
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,889
where technological limitations prevent

136
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,709
a game from reaching its true potential

137
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,538
in fact this is a little bit separate

138
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:32,758
from the point I was making in terms of

139
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:35,128
NNE placements or things like that but a

140
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,560
very good example recently was Red Dead

141
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:40,229
Redemption 2 for those of you who played

142
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,478
it that game would be 10 times better

143
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:45,598
than it is if it had had a solid

144
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,258
technical program programmer on the UI

145
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:49,468
system

146
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,330
it's a incredibly clumsy game to play it

147
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:52,889
feels awful you end up accidentally

148
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:54,959
shooting people you were trying to talk

149
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,439
to and all sorts of other ridiculous

150
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,688
things and again that's part I mean you

151
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,569
could argue that's the designers fault

152
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:06,088
and to a certain extent it is but it's

153
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:09,330
also a technology problem because if you

154
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:11,668
provide good quality technology for

155
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:13,408
constructing user interfaces it's more

156
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,799
likely that you will arrive at a good

157
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:15,478
one

158
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,550
whereas if everything has to be

159
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,860
microprogrammed by people who are maybe

160
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,088
not necessarily even strong programmers

161
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,490
because they're more on the design side

162
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:26,038
you will end up with janky stuff so

163
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,778
again can't say why that happened but I

164
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,098
noticed it I mean it's a game that's

165
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:32,668
gorgeous I don't have you seen it looks

166
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:34,500
beautiful and it's just a lot of fun to

167
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:35,968
kind of ride around the world but oh my

168
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,759
god when you go to actually do something

169
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:40,500
it's not the interfaces mind-bogglingly

170
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,879
bad and I just

171
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,529
like that's a great place where

172
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,170
technology you know a little technology

173
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:49,289
and dynamic response to the environment

174
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,879
and allowing the controls to very

175
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,620
smoothly transition between meaning

176
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,050
different things that we're all very

177
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,610
intuitive would have helped a lot so the

178
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,829
player doesn't have to remember like oh

179
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,569
if I wanted to take my saddle off my

180
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:01,979
horse I hold down the left bumper and

181
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:03,870
the right trigger at the same time and

182
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,330
then I push up on the d-pad and then

183
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,360
it's just like oh my god right like it's

184
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:11,430
it's so weird and so I feel like a lot

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,230
of times you have to be aware of what

186
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,850
you give people to work with will a lot

187
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,650
of times determine what they end up with

188
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,660
and while you can blame them for that

189
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:20,250
the blame actually should be spread

190
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,290
around a little bit more because it's

191
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,660
also the underlying technology making it

192
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,810
easier difficult to represent certain

193
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,939
things oftentimes that shows through and

194
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,430
I suspect that at least in the Red Dead

195
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,930
Redemption case my gut instinct is that

196
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,150
there was a little bit of blame to

197
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,740
spread around there that it was not just

198
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,899
the design team's fault but also

199
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,620
probably a certain amount of programming

200
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,949
at fault

201
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,870
that wasn't exposing a rich language for

202
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:48,990
talking about how the UI could work that

203
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:53,100
leads to a very janky manual 15,000,000

204
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:56,100
button mapped kind of solution so don't

205
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,990
know purely hypothetical but you know I

206
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,640
always hate to see good experiences held

207
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,340
back by things that probably could have

208
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,310
been fixed so anyway let's go ahead and

209
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:07,679
jump into the world generator and we'll

210
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,918
talk about this particular thing that we

211
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:15,689
would like to do here so inside handmade

212
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:17,310
world mode with absolute world gen we

213
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:19,589
know that we can create rooms and things

214
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,509
like this and we have things like room

215
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:23,639
specs so when we go ahead and create a

216
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,649
room it has a pointer to a specification

217
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,069
that tells us about what that room has

218
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:28,069
to have any

219
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:38,149
now there's a couple different kinds of

220
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:40,729
things that we need to address here some

221
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:42,139
things have to do with with room

222
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,490
specific stuff and some things have to

223
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:46,730
do with characteristic stuff and some

224
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,950
things cross both boundaries if you

225
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,528
imagine specifying a room as we are

226
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,579
specifying room right now there's a

227
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:54,409
couple different ways you might want to

228
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:55,849
talk about that room one way we might

229
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,500
want to talk about that room is to

230
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,540
generically say that certain types of

231
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,730
things happen in the room for example

232
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,500
let's say that rooms in general just had

233
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,300
a 50% chance of having a cat in them

234
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,708
always that would be something that

235
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:08,559
would go in something like a room spec

236
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,789
because you would just be saying look

237
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,159
every time I have this type of room

238
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:15,679
there's a chance there's a cat in it so

239
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:17,389
roll the dice and if you roll it the you

240
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,870
know the dice comes up this out of cat

241
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:22,009
if there isn't don't add a cat right and

242
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,578
that's the kind of thing that treats

243
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:27,019
stuff as non-unique monsters are a good

244
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:29,479
example of something it will probably

245
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:31,310
most the time follow that pattern like a

246
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,740
non boss monster a non-unique monster

247
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:36,469
will normally follow the pattern of a

248
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,720
room just says it tends to have these

249
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,610
kind of monsters in it it expects the

250
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,490
room generator to then roll some dice

251
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,169
effectively and come up with which

252
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,329
monsters are actually in the room but

253
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:49,159
doesn't matter which ones are in any

254
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:50,689
particular sense it just matters if they

255
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,899
adhere to a certain pattern of

256
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,880
population right but that's not true for

257
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,649
something like unique characters so for

258
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,110
example if we want each of these three

259
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:02,570
cats to be a unique cat which was the

260
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,320
original idea in the game was that these

261
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:09,230
are three unique cats Hannah Fred Molly

262
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,940
they should only occur in one room so we

263
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,409
can't very well add something to a roo

264
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,500
spec that says there's a chance that

265
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:17,299
there might be a cat here because even

266
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,309
if we did that we would then still have

267
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:21,528
to have a structure on the back end that

268
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:24,469
check to make sure it only added each

269
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:26,448
cat once which therefore leads to a sort

270
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,990
of backwards phenomenon of rolling dice

271
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:31,759
every room and then picking a cat from

272
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,680
the available set of cats or none if

273
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,929
none is still available what this does

274
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,519
is it heavily biases the random

275
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:39,588
generation about where the cast will be

276
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,539
placed towards rooms that are placed

277
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,520
early in the placement sequence which is

278
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:45,079
not something we actually specified

279
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,850
right because think about it

280
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,900
say we said there's a 50% chance as a

281
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,300
cat in every room well there's only

282
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,189
three cats so after six rooms all the

283
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:53,779
cats are placed and the other thousand

284
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,000
rooms in the game will never have a cat

285
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,259
you're gonna see that bias and players

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,960
are gonna pick up on it and it's gonna

287
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:01,819
feel weird and it's gonna be bizarre

288
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,750
it's not gonna make sense it's obvious

289
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,760
that there was a technological

290
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,960
constraint they're causing something to

291
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,269
happen that was not supposed to happen

292
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,340
doesn't feel right

293
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:13,610
so what we'd rather do is place on a

294
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,710
more holistic sense where we say okay

295
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,659
there are room specs those say things

296
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,300
that are generic about the room and that

297
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:22,879
don't have cross room concerns meaning

298
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:24,199
they don't depend on what happened in

299
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,179
another room as to whether it can happen

300
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,190
in this room so we'd rather have

301
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:30,379
something that works in sort of a more

302
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,840
holistic sense and can say we're gonna

303
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:35,539
place three cats after we figure out

304
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,759
where all the rooms are then let's reach

305
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:39,589
in and place the cats say at that time

306
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,240
when we have complete knowledge about

307
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,759
the entire world and can make an

308
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,009
unbiased decision about which room the

309
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,990
cats will go in based on information

310
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:49,819
that we now have about the actual

311
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,430
structure of the world and this makes a

312
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,520
lot of sense especially because

313
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:57,439
especially in case of the cats they are

314
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,569
things that inhabit the world and the

315
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,790
world does not really respond to them in

316
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,190
a structural sense meaning we don't have

317
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:07,250
any plans or I don't anyway for saying

318
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,350
well if a cat is in a particular room

319
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,269
then the room and the things around it

320
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,490
should be structured like this right now

321
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,019
you could imagine a circumstance where

322
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,210
that is true and that would create a

323
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:18,679
more complex structure for the world

324
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,840
generator to have to understand and work

325
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,149
with but in this case we don't have that

326
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,920
situation the cats are more like just

327
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:27,230
inhabitants of a world that is

328
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,209
constructed based on rules ancillary to

329
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,860
the cat's and so you can think of their

330
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,690
placement as something that's more about

331
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,669
looking at the world and figuring out

332
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,620
where we think the cat should go rather

333
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:38,809
than building the world around the cats

334
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,210
which makes them sort of a perfect thing

335
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,859
for this sort of secondary placement

336
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,980
phase that's about analysis and

337
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,990
placement so what I'd like to do now is

338
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,940
add that phase into the world Jen

339
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,120
something that allows us to cleanly

340
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,260
think about placing unique items and

341
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,789
characters in the world in specific

342
00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:00,889
locations only once put that in have it

343
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:03,529
actually place the cats and then push

344
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:05,059
that down to the final part which is any

345
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,789
kind of cleanup we need for the asset

346
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:10,699
system like say those alignment points

347
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:13,039
or scaling information that we then want

348
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,530
to add the asset system to make it easy

349
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,779
for us to actually create the entity

350
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,679
which is a separate issue right so I'm

351
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,169
going to go through that whole process

352
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,209
today hopefully we'll get through all of

353
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:24,319
it but we may stop a little bit short of

354
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,180
setting the alignment points because

355
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,940
that's sort of another step that's a

356
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:33,019
little bit more involved so we can maybe

357
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:35,180
talk about next next weekend so here's

358
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,860
the structure for generating a room and

359
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:38,779
if we take a look at the world gem code

360
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,070
right now it's not particularly good

361
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,079
right we just sort of started sketching

362
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,700
things out but we you know we do play

363
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,230
some rooms in here and then if you

364
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,870
remember how this works we've got sort

365
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,100
of the create orphanage thing and so I'm

366
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,929
gonna go ahead pull it over here so my

367
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,810
head isn't blocking part of it and what

368
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:55,909
we do inside the Creed orphanage call is

369
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:57,559
we just create a bunch of room specs

370
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:59,929
that are specs for rooms that we want to

371
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:03,169
have exist here there's such save slots

372
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:07,009
and the bedrooms and things like this

373
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:08,750
and inside those room specs we have a

374
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,879
simple setting does it have stone floor

375
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,710
or not which we actually respect so if

376
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,169
you look we just do that as a test to

377
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,610
see if you actually look at what happens

378
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:19,309
when we generate the world here you can

379
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,930
see if I kind of move upwards here that

380
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:22,579
the bedrooms which are these right here

381
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:25,699
actually do have stone floors just like

382
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,889
we said that they should and so that's

383
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,770
actually being respected as the one and

384
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:32,120
only current specification for room that

385
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,730
we really use and there could be a lot

386
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,379
more there I'll see as we start making a

387
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,840
richer description of what constitutes a

388
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:40,549
room and what goes in a room so what we

389
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,790
want to do now is we want to say well

390
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:45,049
okay so if that's the stone like the

391
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,129
room spec stuff and you can set things

392
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:48,169
in there we have a good place for that

393
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,939
we now need a good place for talking

394
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:52,129
about when we generate these rooms you

395
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,660
can see us generating them here you can

396
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:55,610
see us setting the size of a lot of them

397
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:58,100
and you can see us connecting them we're

398
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,779
sort of creating a bunch of rules about

399
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,990
how these things have to be connected

400
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:05,240
and then they get laid out right we then

401
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:09,440
at the end of this would like some way

402
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:12,440
of saying how we might want things to be

403
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,090
placed right how we might

404
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,930
want entities to be placed in those

405
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:19,580
rooms so for example inside the bedrooms

406
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:22,969
we may want to place particular

407
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:25,100
characters from our character set right

408
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,950
we have all the orphans who live in the

409
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:32,750
orphanage and we may want some way of

410
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:34,700
placing them into the world they would

411
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,009
for example each live in one of the

412
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,330
bedrooms or something like this or you

413
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:40,370
know in the kitchen or the tailor's room

414
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,870
right the tailor orphan would live in

415
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,750
the tailor's room and the Baker orphan

416
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,039
would live in the kitchen for example

417
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,799
and I live is probably the wrong word

418
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:50,389
what we really mean is stay is is there

419
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,679
when you're walking around right baking

420
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,449
or doing something they probably don't

421
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,279
live there or maybe they do there's a

422
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,580
bedroom there I don't know but point

423
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:02,029
being we want some way to place people

424
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:05,330
into specific rooms probably and the way

425
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:08,449
that we would probably do this is at

426
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,460
some point after we've created this

427
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:13,040
stuff like for example inside create

428
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,889
orphanage we do all this stuff to create

429
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,629
the orphanage we also have things like

430
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:20,620
dungeons and we create the dungeons

431
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:23,870
right and so when we're doing these

432
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:27,490
creation things they return results that

433
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,310
we can use and so you can see in here

434
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,139
when we create the orphanage for example

435
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:36,879
or the forest or the whatever right we

436
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:40,100
can see us here we create these sort of

437
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:43,689
results from the spec generator this

438
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,159
sort of says stuff like oh you know I

439
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,200
here's the orphanage here's some

440
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,179
important rooms that I created and we

441
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,770
might eventually specify all the rooms

442
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,929
we created in here right so after you

443
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:57,230
call Corrine on it you can think about

444
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,819
it in other ways I think that's how we

445
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,430
would like to purchase because when we

446
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,650
call create world we'd probably like at

447
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:05,838
the end of create world when we've

448
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,088
created all the rooms in the world we'd

449
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,149
like to go through all of those sort of

450
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:15,980
structures and start tapping into them

451
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:19,610
to create various or to place various

452
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:22,699
things that we might want placed right

453
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,559
so I'm just gonna start by sketching in

454
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:25,689
what something like that could look like

455
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,658
so

456
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,950
for example in here if we have the the

457
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:38,860
orphanage what I kind of want to do is

458
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:41,528
take a look at some of the other I want

459
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:44,408
a way of reaching in there and placing

460
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:45,819
the cats as we go and there's a couple

461
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:48,429
of different ways that I might want to

462
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:49,778
do that right one way to do that would

463
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:51,909
be to do it in line with create

464
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:54,398
orphanage if the cats are always inside

465
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:56,649
the orphanage but another way to do that

466
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:58,449
would be to do it outside because what

467
00:17:56,648 --> 00:18:00,699
if for example sometimes the cats are

468
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,980
not in the orphanage like maybe once in

469
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:07,350
a while one of the cat cats wanders off

470
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:09,970
into the world and then that cat doesn't

471
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:13,418
place itself in the orphanage places

472
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:17,409
itself in some other world location

473
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:20,379
right so if I was to say look let's

474
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:22,690
actually record a lot of this

475
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:24,548
information in here maybe you know maybe

476
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,940
we want this as something that we can

477
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:30,158
actually record so you know I'm gonna

478
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:35,139
say let's say there's three hero saves

479
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:37,299
slaves slave slots four bedrooms and

480
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:40,689
then there's some specific other

481
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:44,950
elements in here that we you know have

482
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:46,750
talked about for example I if I was to

483
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,639
upgrade the orphanage structure to look

484
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,710
a little bit more like this so it

485
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:54,189
actually records all of the rooms that

486
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,980
it hasn't it then anyone who wants to

487
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,320
touch those rooms specifically or place

488
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,319
something into them specifically can do

489
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,418
so so if I grab this and fill it out at

490
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,099
the end I'm again just sort of guessing

491
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:08,740
cure but I'm thinking that might be a

492
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:12,428
nice way to propagate that information

493
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:15,940
out words exactly as we have been you

494
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:22,120
know the entire time so here's our save

495
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:23,200
slots here is the front hall it's so

496
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,729
then the other thing that I want to do

497
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,889
here is I would like to be able to

498
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:32,860
access these things as in multiple ways

499
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:38,408
so I'd like to be able to access them in

500
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:39,429
ways that allow me to randomly pick from

501
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:41,830
certain types of rooms

502
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,440
as well or do other sorts of things like

503
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:50,109
that and so one of the other things that

504
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:52,029
I can do is I can make you know I can do

505
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:54,399
a lot of different things here but

506
00:19:52,029 --> 00:20:00,339
another way that I can do this is to

507
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,240
make one of these right where I can see

508
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:03,639
Jen orphanage

509
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:10,140
and I get back a set of rooms and I can

510
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,140
if I want to actually just give them I

511
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,630
don't know exactly I'd say that it's not

512
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:18,490
really rude type it's more like a room

513
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:21,970
ID maybe might be the right way to look

514
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,099
at it and when we talk about these room

515
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,009
IDs what I could do is say oh you know

516
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:28,779
what instead of doing it like that let's

517
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:31,210
instead say that we've kind of got

518
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:35,049
something more like this where each of

519
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:38,259
these sort of rooms can come back in a

520
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:41,319
set of rooms and we just say what if

521
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:43,450
type of room is so we can do random

522
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:49,029
picking on them or you know who knows

523
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:50,680
what else right I'm not sure the best

524
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:53,259
way to place something like that there's

525
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,230
two ways we could do it one is to set a

526
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:58,119
room type and the other is and list the

527
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:07,900
rooms another is to actually just have

528
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:16,059
rooms by ID yet even another is to just

529
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:17,980
have giant list of these things hmm I

530
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:19,690
say and I don't really know I don't

531
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,610
really know what's the best one would be

532
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,220
I mean you can see sort of what I would

533
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:27,819
like what I'm going for here anyway is

534
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:31,029
I'd like to place three cats and so you

535
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:32,829
know what I want to do is inside here

536
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:33,970
where we say you know the same sort of

537
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:35,349
thing where we're like look this is

538
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,029
where the starting room is it's the

539
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:38,289
hero's bedroom or whatever so startling

540
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:41,289
happens there and generates the world

541
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:44,200
just go outward you know in here I would

542
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:45,369
like to to sort of say let's place some

543
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,130
cats you know

544
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:49,389
so in fact I guess I wouldn't quite do

545
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,140
it that way I'd probably more do

546
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,790
something like this place cat and I want

547
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,920
to pass something there that lets me

548
00:21:54,789 --> 00:22:02,769
pass where you know sort of the the set

549
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,740
of possible locations that we might want

550
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:08,170
to place the cat but you know then I'm

551
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:11,759
gonna pass which cat it is and so inside

552
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:14,019
the sorry I should say file formats

553
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,150
inside here we've got these tag types

554
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:19,329
and I can say like okay I would like to

555
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:22,360
place you know the Berman cat in a

556
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:25,480
particular location I'd like to pass the

557
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:28,240
tabby cat and I'd like to place the

558
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:32,289
brown cat I want to place each of these

559
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,670
cats and you know off we go so I'd like

560
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:35,589
to have a way of placing the cat

561
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,990
somewhere and I'd like to be able to

562
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:40,750
have it picked from a set of locations

563
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,250
fairly reasonably I just don't know what

564
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,400
we're actually going to be passing here

565
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,769
so when we write this routine you know

566
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,019
you can imagine how I would want to be

567
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:51,759
able to write it also I suppose there's

568
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:56,529
probably some kind of a gem placement

569
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:58,960
thing here or maybe even just an entity

570
00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:00,579
you know that comes back I'm not sure

571
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,289
how that would go well it's not gonna be

572
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:05,529
an Andy it's gonna be the request for an

573
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:11,049
entity right because we wouldn't

574
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:12,519
actually place the entity itself until

575
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:13,990
we actually generate everything right

576
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,970
it's cuz we want we're just saying that

577
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:19,990
there should be an end to be here not

578
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:22,380
you know what I mean so anyway what we

579
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,670
would like to do now is have some way of

580
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,770
you know discussing where this thing

581
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,140
actually goes and

582
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:31,029
we might want a couple different ways of

583
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,560
saying that obviously if we knew exactly

584
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:34,899
what room we want to put them in we

585
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,519
would just pass the room but since we're

586
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,140
sort of saying we would randomly want to

587
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:40,329
put them in a set of rooms we want

588
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:43,830
something that's going to be like the

589
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:43,829
series picker

590
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:51,830
here and you know the world generators

591
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:54,829
got a set of and you know in Tropic

592
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:56,240
serious that it can use for this so we

593
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:57,529
know that the world generator would come

594
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,349
in here and that we would use the

595
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:03,529
entropy from the world generator to pick

596
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:06,230
randomly from some set of things right

597
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:08,269
we would want to do a random choice over

598
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:12,529
some set of rooms like you know a room

599
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:16,579
count here something like this where

600
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:24,049
we'd say look pick a random room out of

601
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:33,740
a set of rooms like so find out what

602
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:35,210
that room is something like this and

603
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,220
when you found out what that room is

604
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:53,269
then we are going to add an entity to

605
00:24:37,220 --> 00:25:03,049
the world to that to that room right you

606
00:24:53,269 --> 00:25:07,549
know I'm saying something like this and

607
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:18,190
that sort of allows us to I guess this

608
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:18,190
should really be asset tag ID like that

609
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,970
this is sort of what we would want to do

610
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:35,460
and so the question is how do we come up

611
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,460
with this structure you and I mean I

612
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:50,319
my gut instinct which is often wrong but

613
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:51,759
is always the place to start because

614
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,119
what else where else are you going to

615
00:25:51,759 --> 00:26:00,669
start I is that maybe what we would like

616
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:07,269
to do is just maintain picking lists in

617
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:11,200
the world generator and then you

618
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:17,220
randomly pick from a picking list so for

619
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:19,900
example let's suppose that every time

620
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,450
one of our generation routines that's

621
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,700
creating structures in the world creates

622
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:28,409
a room where it thinks a cat might want

623
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:31,659
to hang out it would create a cat

624
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:34,900
placement record that is saying you

625
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:41,200
could place a cat here if you were so

626
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:45,519
inclined right then when we go to place

627
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:50,190
a cat or anything else a mini boss or a

628
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:54,220
boss monster or a treasure chest or

629
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:56,830
whatever you could imagine that system

630
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,860
being somewhat generally useful meaning

631
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:01,599
you would just say all right every time

632
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:03,279
the generator generates something that

633
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:07,079
could be used for a particular purpose

634
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,079
it adds it to the list of things

635
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:27,599
and I can't say I can't say I can think

636
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,600
of any particular reason not to do that

637
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:39,479
it seems okay

638
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:16,250
I guess what I'll say is I'm gonna

639
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:20,559
experiment with this a little bit and

640
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:24,079
just see how I like it I may not like it

641
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:27,259
and I reserve the right to therefore

642
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:30,919
stop doing it at that point so I'm gonna

643
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:39,410
call maybe I'm just gonna call this a

644
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:44,410
Jen option and a Jen option I think at

645
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:44,410
what I want to do is something like this

646
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:52,190
where you basically say okay I've got a

647
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:54,650
Jen option type and the option type is

648
00:28:52,190 --> 00:29:00,850
gonna be like this thing that says like

649
00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:00,850
Jen option you know cat or something I

650
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,730
apologize for this being kind of a

651
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,928
little bit ill-formed but it's

652
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:10,960
ill-formed because I don't really know

653
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:22,490
what I'm gonna do here right but like

654
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:31,299
imagine something like this where I just

655
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:31,299
sort of made some chains of stuff and I

656
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,600
mean I guess I could also make them be

657
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:41,109
the actual array so they'd be easier to

658
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,109
pick from

659
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:52,859
it's pretty hard to say what I'm

660
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:58,079
thinking is you know if you if you've

661
00:29:52,859 --> 00:30:00,179
got if you've got an array you can

662
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,009
pretty easily pick a random element from

663
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,590
the array if you've got a linked list

664
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:10,019
it's much harder to pick randomly from

665
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:12,269
it because I mean on the one hand you

666
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:14,490
can sort of do it in an efficient method

667
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:16,639
by randomly sorting the thing ahead of

668
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:20,339
time and then just taking the first one

669
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,450
but that random sort is a little bit of

670
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:23,449
an issue in and of itself

671
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,359
hmm

672
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,080
and the other thing that I think I want

673
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,490
to be cognitive is when you're placing

674
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,309
these things you don't want to place

675
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:02,200
them all in the same place so when you

676
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:04,589
place like a cat somewhere you kind of

677
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,140
want to talk about an option having been

678
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:11,970
overloaded to a certain extent which I

679
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,970
guess you can sort of do

680
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:28,569
I'm just gonna go with it I'm gonna say

681
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:33,249
arbitrarily speaking maybe there is a

682
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:38,558
gen option array and maybe that has an

683
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:43,269
option count in it and maybe it has the

684
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:51,028
options statically and maybe I have a

685
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:56,589
set of those like so and that's just all

686
00:31:51,028 --> 00:32:00,099
purely hypothetical right so that's what

687
00:31:56,589 --> 00:32:02,470
I would have and inside this the gen

688
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:08,319
option would really just be a pointer to

689
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:10,808
a room and that room would be the thing

690
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:15,878
that gets whatever we're talking about

691
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:21,509
here right uh and I might furthermore

692
00:32:15,878 --> 00:32:25,868
try to flag that out so that we have a

693
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:31,769
notion of what is in the room so we

694
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:34,868
would have like something like this

695
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:38,019
where the options picked in this case

696
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:40,528
get Ord in from the set of options that

697
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:40,528
are available

698
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,139
you

699
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:56,929
and I think that works reasonably well

700
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:59,659
at least my first inclination right so

701
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:02,360
basically every time we pick one of

702
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:05,240
these things we randomly select one and

703
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:09,439
then we see if it's suitable and if it

704
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,429
is we are in the flag here that seems

705
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,669
okay to me

706
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:19,788
so for example Jen option cats would be

707
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:21,770
one maybe Jenna Jenna option orphan is

708
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:26,119
another you know like we we put one of

709
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:29,808
the orphans in here maybe Jen option you

710
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:31,459
know trying to think of what they would

711
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:33,168
be you know they'd be like you know a

712
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,960
mini-boss or you know those sorts of

713
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:38,390
things right so I think we would put

714
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,788
sort of this stuff that we place around

715
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:43,130
in that way would create the options

716
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:44,509
would be sort of created in the list and

717
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:48,340
then we would pick from those options

718
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:50,509
and fill them out seems okay to me I

719
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:52,939
don't know maintaining the arrays that

720
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:57,619
the generation goes on seems like a kind

721
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:59,150
of pain in the butt because you want to

722
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:02,739
be able to both pick quickly from them

723
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:05,419
at random and also just add to them

724
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,179
which there is no really good data

725
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:11,269
structure for I mean there's better ones

726
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:13,639
probably than an array but you know

727
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:14,960
maybe depends on what you're optimizing

728
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:20,079
for whether you're optimizing for

729
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,079
picking or adding but I don't know so

730
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:31,869
I don't know

731
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,579
that's something it's hard for me to

732
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,199
really get too excited about it because

733
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,849
I'm just not sure yet

734
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,189
but that's roughly what we're talking

735
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:41,710
about here so what I would say is you

736
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:47,050
know there's gonna be something here

737
00:34:41,710 --> 00:35:05,619
which is like oh yeah maybe we'd do

738
00:34:47,050 --> 00:35:06,880
something like maybe we would do

739
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:08,920
something where we pick the option I

740
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,030
just can't decide if you should remove

741
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:16,769
it or not you probably do so we'd

742
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,769
probably do something like Jen option

743
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,130
you know pick option and it probably

744
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:33,190
just returns the room so we're like give

745
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:35,200
me something I just want you to give me

746
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:41,980
something that I can place this thing in

747
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:43,419
I'm gonna look at it and and maybe

748
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,230
there's a corresponding one which is

749
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:50,500
like hey this I'm gonna tell you that

750
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:53,559
this thing is now an option for placing

751
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:57,599
that thing so I can pop an option off at

752
00:35:53,559 --> 00:36:00,880
random and I could push an option on and

753
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,069
those two things both have to be able to

754
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,590
occur pretty much at any time I'm just

755
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:07,600
gonna say it's gonna be ugly cos gonna

756
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:09,100
waste a ton of memory because I've got

757
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,839
to make like these arrays and stuff it's

758
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:15,759
not compact but I guess that's just

759
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,660
gonna have to be okay for now and if we

760
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,100
really need to do something more

761
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:23,589
creative later we can you know as

762
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:25,690
necessary so then when we want to do

763
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,100
something like place cats we would

764
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,740
really just do something like oh oh

765
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:31,360
right so I need to know what cats what

766
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:35,219
room the cats in so I just do a pop

767
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,940
option and I say you know I need you to

768
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:40,480
give me

769
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:42,159
place for a cat can be you know and

770
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:47,440
maybe we do something a little bit

771
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:58,929
saucier where we also say like you know

772
00:36:47,440 --> 00:37:03,700
require and or or you know allowed and

773
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:07,000
disallowed and so what we saying here is

774
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:10,509
like well we're gonna pass you a bit

775
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,420
vector that basically says here are the

776
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:14,859
things that have to be in there and here

777
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,088
are the things that can't be or

778
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:18,088
something like that right

779
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:39,720
I mean really I guess what we can say is

780
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:42,088
a more complete version would give us

781
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:43,319
the full flags so it would say yeah you

782
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:46,730
know what I don't really want to do it

783
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,730
quite that expressively

784
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,320
yeah I don't want you back aggressively

785
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:07,059
so here's what I'm thinking I was

786
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,100
thinking oh you could pass some stuff in

787
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:10,929
here that would kind of let it

788
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:13,179
discriminate and determine what room it

789
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:15,129
wanted to place them in but I think

790
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:16,839
that's gonna be a lot more touchy like

791
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,490
it's gonna involve inspecting the room

792
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,720
and fairly complicated ways eventually

793
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:21,789
so that just doesn't really make a lot

794
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:24,939
of sense so I think what makes more

795
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:27,489
sense is to just say look give me one

796
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:30,159
the most important option here right

797
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:34,269
like here's the gen option type that I

798
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:36,849
want I'm gonna pop these off and I'm

799
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:39,070
gonna pop them off in order probably so

800
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:41,349
I think I'm not in order but I'm gonna

801
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:43,120
pop off potentially multiples as I look

802
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:45,400
through and try to find a room that's

803
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,569
suitable so really it should it's gonna

804
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,670
be a little more complicated and pop

805
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:53,200
option what it's actually look like more

806
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:55,510
is like an iteration if you will so it's

807
00:38:53,199 --> 00:39:03,489
gonna look more like this it's gonna

808
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:05,020
look like struct Gen option iterator and

809
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:08,319
what you're probably going to do here is

810
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:12,420
is inside this place calf thing you're

811
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:17,620
gonna say like for you know gen option

812
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:21,970
iterator begin option search or

813
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:26,170
something or iterate options and you're

814
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:31,569
gonna say I want options for someplace I

815
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:36,880
can place my tap and then you're gonna

816
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:39,640
iterate over what comes back and maybe

817
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,200
this is known to only work this way like

818
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:42,789
maybe we don't really need anything else

819
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:44,109
so it's just gonna be like yeah we

820
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:45,849
create one of these iterators we get

821
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:48,880
iterate over it this will give us our

822
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:52,659
options for each option we can look our

823
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,880
selves and we can say all right so

824
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:59,259
here's the room that it's saying we

825
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:04,480
should put it in here we could do to do

826
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:09,550
KC check this room to see if it meets

827
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:15,099
our other criteria whatever those happen

828
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:17,200
to be and then we can either

829
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,119
well I guess in what we would do here is

830
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:25,710
just say all right now we're done right

831
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:28,710
so we would say like finish or something

832
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,710
right

833
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:43,679
I don't know something like that so this

834
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:46,829
way we can iterate over a number of

835
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,539
random choices looking at them and the

836
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:51,389
system understands that we're doing that

837
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:53,730
so it won't keep picking randomly and

838
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:55,409
giving us back and like searching

839
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,119
through rooms we've already searched

840
00:40:55,409 --> 00:41:01,559
through right it'll always pick new ones

841
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:05,940
until we run out of rooms to pick and so

842
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:11,579
I feel like that would be the key right

843
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:15,690
so we'd have Jen entity results and we

844
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:22,949
would return the results here and in

845
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:26,250
here we would place the entity and so

846
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:27,809
this really is just an if one but

847
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,510
someday we're saying it would actually

848
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:41,309
look at something and then it would

849
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:44,400
place the entity in the room and I think

850
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:47,699
that's all we really need there right so

851
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,550
we have our room index and room choice

852
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:53,519
stuff is not necessary anymore that's

853
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,960
going to be coming from the system we

854
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,820
can iterate over all the options where

855
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,869
we might want to place a cat we can do

856
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,400
additional checking to figure out

857
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:04,950
whether a cat really belongs there and

858
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:07,280
that and yeah that's that's the end of

859
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:07,279
it right

860
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:19,349
seems reasonable to me so this goes

861
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,019
inside because you know if we didn't if

862
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:23,639
for some reason we didn't find this room

863
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:25,670
to be acceptable someday when there's an

864
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:28,349
actual criteria being evaluated in here

865
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,970
then what we would do is we wouldn't

866
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:32,130
finish so we'd keep looking for new

867
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:34,049
rooms right so I think that's how we

868
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:50,750
want that to work and so really this

869
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:55,380
looks like this and then each of these

870
00:42:50,750 --> 00:43:01,500
is just sort of a service call that

871
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:04,050
allows us to complete that iteration

872
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:08,639
cleanly and just makes it easy to use

873
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:10,950
the semantics of it right okay so there

874
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,719
is no pop option there's only a way to

875
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:15,779
add an option and to iterate over

876
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,369
options and then the system is

877
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,470
responsible for doing something

878
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:21,659
meaningful with it at that point right

879
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:24,750
and we'll figure out how I want that to

880
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:27,089
work but I pretty much already know how

881
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:31,230
I would have that work but we'll kind of

882
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:36,030
look at that in a minute so that seems

883
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:42,539
reasonable and we'll stub it in for now

884
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:46,890
so here's the results right and what I'm

885
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:49,110
gonna do is just say all right let's

886
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:50,489
just assume that this just always pops a

887
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:52,920
room right now and so it's totally

888
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:57,719
broken doesn't actually do at all what I

889
00:43:52,920 --> 00:44:01,380
wanted it to do yet right so it just has

890
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:07,199
a room on here and so the result of this

891
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:10,320
function is just is the room valid and

892
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:13,439
in order to advance it it just sets the

893
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,740
room zero and when we go to finish this

894
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,809
it also sets the room to zero and so

895
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,239
there really isn't so this is you know

896
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:24,679
I'm gonna put this in here not yet

897
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:24,679
implemented for real

898
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:31,500
so really I'm just stubbing this out and

899
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:34,139
not really making an actual function out

900
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,449
of it and we'll talk about that well

901
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:38,368
we'll actually implement it a little bit

902
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:40,710
later so when I iterate options here

903
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:44,818
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna pop

904
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:48,139
the first option off of the option array

905
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:50,818
so I'm gonna go ahead and say that if

906
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:53,308
well first I'll get the option array in

907
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:56,219
question which is here so I'm going to

908
00:44:53,309 --> 00:45:00,300
say alright this option array is

909
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:03,000
whatever the option arrays are plus the

910
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,550
type that you asked me for I'm then

911
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,039
gonna say that the array you know it's

912
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:10,920
got an option count so if there are

913
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:16,699
options in the option count then I'm

914
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,700
going to pop the back one like so and

915
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:29,750
I'm just going to grab it so the room in

916
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:35,849
this case is just going to be the

917
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:38,369
options and we're gonna say that the in

918
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:41,430
here when we get the Jen option array

919
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:43,170
it's got a pointer to the options the

920
00:45:41,429 --> 00:45:44,338
first one that will the last one in the

921
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:50,670
list we're just going to take whatever

922
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:57,599
that room is and use that makes sense so

923
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:59,880
that is that is sort of the stub out

924
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,099
that just says well it doesn't really do

925
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,930
what it's supposed to do meaning it

926
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:05,789
doesn't really allow us to pick multiple

927
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:07,858
rooms or randomly pick rooms or anything

928
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:09,869
else yet it just kind of gives us one

929
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:11,608
room and places it we're gonna get it

930
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:14,579
working with that and I'm gonna come

931
00:46:11,608 --> 00:46:17,429
back and change it to allow that to work

932
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:20,880
better right so that leaves us with push

933
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:23,009
option push option needs a way of

934
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,220
creating something meaningful here in

935
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:29,819
terms of option arrays and again this is

936
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:31,019
gonna be some pretty tasty bad code and

937
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:32,519
that's okay

938
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:33,780
because I don't think this is going to

939
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:35,849
be a particularly important part of the

940
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,829
system anyway but we're just gonna

941
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:39,269
basically just add

942
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:41,219
these in blocks of a hundred or a

943
00:46:39,268 --> 00:46:42,748
thousand or something and call it a day

944
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:45,719
right we're not gonna do anything else

945
00:46:42,748 --> 00:46:47,338
interesting here so what I'm gonna do is

946
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:50,309
the same thing I did before I'm just

947
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:52,889
gonna grab the array in question and I'm

948
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:55,709
going to check first to see if the

949
00:46:52,889 --> 00:46:59,670
maximum option count has been exceeded

950
00:46:55,708 --> 00:47:01,919
so if the option count is less than the

951
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:04,709
max option count and I'm kind of writing

952
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,469
that only semantically this is the case

953
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:09,899
where we could add it but if the option

954
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:11,729
count is equal to and greater than

955
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,619
should never happen so you know and

956
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:15,449
really it should just be that that is

957
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:17,269
never the case because that's just

958
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:20,129
totally borked

959
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:21,838
so assuming that the option count is

960
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,579
equal to the max option count means that

961
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,078
it's full and we can't add anymore that

962
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:27,630
could happen either because we've never

963
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,670
allocated any of them or it could happen

964
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,048
because we've used all the ones that we

965
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:33,180
have allocated so what I want to do

966
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:36,059
there is say that the max option count

967
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:38,068
is going to get increased by some amount

968
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:40,709
that amount is just going to be a

969
00:47:38,068 --> 00:47:41,940
hundred because I pulled that out of my

970
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:45,078
butthole and we're just going to use it

971
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:48,568
then what I'm going to do is say that

972
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:52,440
we'll reallocate the array so we'll

973
00:47:48,568 --> 00:47:56,880
basically say that we have a new option

974
00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:00,420
amount right new options is going to be

975
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:04,259
equal to an array that's pushed onto our

976
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:06,298
temporary memory and all we're gonna do

977
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:09,208
there is say inside our temporary memory

978
00:48:06,298 --> 00:48:12,478
that we're using for scratch let's just

979
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:17,848
go ahead and grab a we'll just lemongrab

980
00:48:12,478 --> 00:48:22,889
out one of the you know a block of this

981
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:29,400
mini however many we want we'll

982
00:48:22,889 --> 00:48:31,528
lemongrab that many gen options again

983
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,209
really piggy and wasteful memory here

984
00:48:31,528 --> 00:48:36,239
why is because we're not even going to

985
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:39,478
return the old array back to the system

986
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,630
for any particular use right so it's you

987
00:48:39,478 --> 00:48:41,629
know

988
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,630
we're only using it a generation time

989
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:51,989
however so it's not clear that we'd ever

990
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:53,340
really care and we will flush all this

991
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:55,169
before we actually start running the

992
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,940
game when we would might care about the

993
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:59,190
memory overhead so it's probably not an

994
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,599
issue but we'll see so anyway we're

995
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:03,269
going to increase the option count and

996
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:06,559
then we we need to copy the old array of

997
00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:09,090
options so we just say okay we've got

998
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,449
whatever the option count was we need to

999
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:14,220
copy our array of options I I do have a

1000
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:16,019
copy right yeah we're gonna our old

1001
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:19,169
array of options to our new array of

1002
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:35,429
options and then we're just gonna make

1003
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:37,110
that the new array that allows us to

1004
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:39,539
push as many as we want on and we'll

1005
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:40,860
continue to grow again don't know that

1006
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:42,809
we really care about this one way or the

1007
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:45,450
other but we'll find out later whether

1008
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:52,579
we need to be saucy err here or be more

1009
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:52,579
efficient right maybe we do maybe don't

1010
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:00,930
so now that that's done we can just

1011
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:02,340
actually place a cat the problem would

1012
00:50:00,929 --> 00:50:04,639
now be that we don't have a way of

1013
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:08,430
recording that we want specific entities

1014
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:11,730
to be placed into those rooms so we now

1015
00:50:08,429 --> 00:50:15,509
need some way of having that being

1016
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:17,159
notated in the world generator as

1017
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:20,010
standing structure that you know works

1018
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:22,980
with whatever's in there so inside here

1019
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:24,750
where we have a general we kind of want

1020
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:28,650
a way of attaching entities to it cuz

1021
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:30,239
like right now you can sort of see by

1022
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,740
the way that means all of this is not

1023
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:37,289
necessary anymore so I guess that means

1024
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:37,789
that was a waste of time sorry about

1025
00:50:37,289 --> 00:50:39,809
that

1026
00:50:37,789 --> 00:50:41,820
maybe we'll still use something like

1027
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:44,880
that later I don't know but probably not

1028
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:50,030
because we did something else um so

1029
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,030
there's really only these two

1030
00:50:55,329 --> 00:51:08,750
go ahead okay so essentially what we

1031
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:16,760
want to do here is we want to expand the

1032
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:19,159
notion of the of the room idea to

1033
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,110
include entities that have been placed

1034
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:23,899
specifically in this room and which must

1035
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:27,710
be placed in the room right meaning that

1036
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:30,559
the the outer scale system said hey this

1037
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:32,960
you gotta put this entity in here you

1038
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,170
don't get a choice so mister room

1039
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,170
generator thingy go ahead and do that

1040
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:44,300
right

1041
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:46,340
so if we say general room entity but

1042
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,200
really we can just say entity probably

1043
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,390
because this doesn't even stick to the

1044
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:52,339
room

1045
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:57,230
these can just be in the rooms as a

1046
00:51:52,340 --> 00:52:00,019
chain I think and so they would just get

1047
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:03,619
placed in here and these entities would

1048
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:06,769
just kind of stock up and then we tag

1049
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:11,299
them you know we would basically have

1050
00:52:06,769 --> 00:52:15,440
some set of tags in there and those tags

1051
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:17,180
would get carried forward as a way of

1052
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,800
specifying what the enemy was I'm not

1053
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:21,049
gonna have a variable list I think that

1054
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,850
would kind of be a waste of time

1055
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:28,190
so instead I'm just gonna say that we

1056
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:31,250
have a sort of a gender the tag here and

1057
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:33,970
that just has whatever the asset tag ID

1058
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:37,699
would have been and the value of the tag

1059
00:52:33,969 --> 00:52:39,500
and then there's just gonna be some

1060
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:41,509
number of tags that entities can have

1061
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:44,960
you know maybe it's eight

1062
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:46,370
maybe it's sixteen I don't know but

1063
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,889
we're just gonna place that many of them

1064
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:51,980
in there let's say it's 15 because why

1065
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:54,769
not because then we have a next this is

1066
00:52:51,980 --> 00:53:00,800
a balanced entity at that point it is

1067
00:52:54,769 --> 00:53:03,809
exactly 16 times 8 right because we've

1068
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:07,470
got one 8 byte thing

1069
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:10,049
and 15 8 light things so it's 16 times 8

1070
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:11,789
light things which is 128 bytes 2 cache

1071
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,710
lines everyone's favorite number of

1072
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:15,150
cache lines because it's actually the

1073
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:19,889
minimum number I think Zeon's pulling or

1074
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:21,450
something anyway doesn't matter so we

1075
00:53:19,889 --> 00:53:23,309
can place these throughout the room when

1076
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:24,599
we can just stack we can place them

1077
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:26,849
throughout rooms and stack them up and

1078
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:28,880
then when the room Jen generates them it

1079
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:32,250
will place them in there some are

1080
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:34,710
reasonable hopefully lots for a way to

1081
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:37,349
do that specific thing meaning how we're

1082
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:42,990
you know planning to actually make that

1083
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:46,019
work right so let's see here

1084
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:49,019
if we were to do that then we've got an

1085
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:55,679
identity call that we'll have to work

1086
00:53:49,019 --> 00:54:03,210
with that that system see here ok so

1087
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:05,989
when we call that identity call that's

1088
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:07,980
going to return one of these entities

1089
00:54:05,989 --> 00:54:10,769
it's not really gonna do anything

1090
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:13,349
specific it's gonna place it presumably

1091
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:15,869
in a room but I don't know whether we

1092
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:17,279
actually want to do that or not I feel

1093
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:19,859
like you'd probably want to do something

1094
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:27,019
more like this where you just said okay

1095
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:31,410
you know place an entity in a room and

1096
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:34,710
then that inserts it into that list you

1097
00:54:31,409 --> 00:54:37,170
know it's more of thing so that seems a

1098
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,909
little bit more sensible to me all

1099
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:40,530
things considered so then we were

1100
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:43,889
basically say alright the room first

1101
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:46,500
entity equals this entity and of course

1102
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:47,539
we need to preserve that list so off we

1103
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,699
go

1104
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:53,369
those get stacked up into the room

1105
00:54:49,699 --> 00:54:56,039
everyone's happy to add an entity no big

1106
00:54:53,369 --> 00:55:00,630
deal right here's the entity as a

1107
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:03,449
results that's just a push direct on the

1108
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:05,360
temp memory cuz again this is all just a

1109
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:10,259
temporary infrastructure we use for

1110
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:11,670
analyzing the structure of the world so

1111
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:15,520
we just want to grab one of these in

1112
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:17,200
there we then want to take a look

1113
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:20,050
well I think it just automatically

1114
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,699
clears it so really that's it because we

1115
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:24,970
wouldn't do anything else

1116
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:29,799
and then I don't know it would be a lot

1117
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:33,699
easier for us I suppose if we had some

1118
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:36,519
extra stuff in here so I might say you

1119
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:41,078
know maybe there is a tag cap and maybe

1120
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:44,769
there's a Flags field you know I don't

1121
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:46,420
know these really don't need to be quite

1122
00:55:44,769 --> 00:55:49,269
so large but you know I'm just saying

1123
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:51,338
maybe we do something more like that and

1124
00:55:49,269 --> 00:55:56,318
that way when you add tags it's just

1125
00:55:51,338 --> 00:55:58,568
quicker we'll see so anyway then we've

1126
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,519
got the notion that we want to add tags

1127
00:55:58,568 --> 00:56:04,179
to these things so when you add a

1128
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:07,108
particular tag to an entity again you're

1129
00:56:04,179 --> 00:56:09,489
just passing the same set of stuff in

1130
00:56:07,108 --> 00:56:13,269
here's the entity you want to add the

1131
00:56:09,489 --> 00:56:15,729
tag - here's the asset tag ID and here's

1132
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:18,099
the value and so that's just going to

1133
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:21,460
make sure that the entity in question

1134
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:23,559
only has a certain number of tags so

1135
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,329
it's gonna want the tag count to be less

1136
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:28,000
than the array account of the end of

1137
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:41,309
these tags and then it's going to say

1138
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:41,309
okay then the tags are added to like so

1139
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,220
in this case I should probably write it

1140
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,298
this way because we want an actual point

1141
00:56:45,219 --> 00:56:49,230
of the tag and then I'm going to take

1142
00:56:46,298 --> 00:56:51,940
the tag and set the ID and set the value

1143
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:53,349
that pushes the tag on so now we could

1144
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:55,240
play some of these put tags on the

1145
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:56,980
entities put them in particular rooms in

1146
00:56:55,239 --> 00:57:00,689
this case we're going to do that right

1147
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,690
here so we're gonna place the entity

1148
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:11,619
like this and we're not going to pass it

1149
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:14,588
there so that's all we're doing and once

1150
00:57:11,619 --> 00:57:17,369
we're done with that see here it's like

1151
00:57:14,588 --> 00:57:17,369
Europe bedroom

1152
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:24,130
we really just have to go in and make it

1153
00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:26,079
so that these things actually get placed

1154
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,640
in the world meaning when somebody

1155
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:31,509
actually reads that list and sticks the

1156
00:57:27,639 --> 00:57:34,929
entities into the actual room you know

1157
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:40,420
other than that not much else we have to

1158
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:55,569
deal with see here okay uh here's our

1159
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:56,920
option tiny just wanted to return that

1160
00:57:55,570 --> 00:58:02,680
in case people want to fuss with it

1161
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:05,829
after the fact and off we go okay so now

1162
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:07,210
we have the ability to place cats which

1163
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:11,259
is something everyone wants to be able

1164
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:12,760
to do especially shelters and there's an

1165
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:16,810
important difference here which is that

1166
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:19,660
one of our cats is a ghost so this is

1167
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:25,449
Hannah and she's a ghost so we're gonna

1168
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:30,190
add the ghost tag to Hannah because she

1169
00:58:25,449 --> 00:58:35,949
died she died a few years ago it wasn't

1170
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:39,159
great anyway so once we've added these

1171
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:40,329
entities in we're now almost done with

1172
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:41,710
the system for placing entities

1173
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:43,269
throughout the world kind of however we

1174
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:45,579
wish and then the system can respect

1175
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:47,349
those in different ways we still have a

1176
00:58:45,579 --> 00:58:51,699
couple things we haven't done and that

1177
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:53,980
is adding options for when rooms can be

1178
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:57,250
placed or when things can be placed in

1179
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:59,199
various rooms so I feel like cats

1180
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:01,329
probably wouldn't be in the hallway and

1181
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:03,969
I don't know that the cats are going to

1182
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:06,579
be in the save slots but otherwise they

1183
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:09,639
could be in a lot of these places so I

1184
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:11,380
would say I want to do what did I call

1185
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:14,079
it a push option I'm gonna call it add

1186
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:17,050
option instead I think so I'm gonna say

1187
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:23,679
i want to add an option for the main

1188
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:25,630
room to have cats in it right and the

1189
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:31,289
other ones here would be maybe the

1190
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:31,289
bedroom a b c

1191
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:42,670
and D maybe maybe the tailor room maybe

1192
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:44,500
the kitchen I don't know if I want them

1193
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:48,130
to be outdoor cats maybe only one of

1194
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:50,340
them is an outdoor cat I'm not sure or

1195
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:54,280
maybe none of them are so I don't know

1196
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:57,940
but I think that's mostly it in terms of

1197
00:59:54,280 --> 01:00:00,970
where they should probably be I at least

1198
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:02,860
here right so I'm gonna add these

1199
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:12,099
options here where we base say these are

1200
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:14,380
rooms that the cats could be in and that

1201
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:17,679
seems reasonable so then inside the

1202
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:21,730
world gencode right we had a push oops

1203
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:26,710
push option I'm gonna call that add

1204
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:29,320
option instead and I'm gonna grab this

1205
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:33,090
stuff and put it up above because we're

1206
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,090
all this stuff gets used right

1207
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:48,419
actually could be even higher than that

1208
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,780
I think this is kind of like you know

1209
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:55,139
it's like this kind of thing so I feel

1210
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:57,810
like it kind of belongs more up here so

1211
01:00:55,139 --> 01:01:07,039
anyway that means we can add options to

1212
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:09,420
the world right and I think I like that

1213
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:11,789
syntax better too I think I like it

1214
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:15,599
better this way so I'm just gonna make

1215
01:01:11,789 --> 01:01:17,820
it reversed but that seems good so that

1216
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:21,869
adds those options and then it will pick

1217
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:23,940
those options to put the cats in and so

1218
01:01:21,869 --> 01:01:26,309
I think if we run this actually it will

1219
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,990
in theory place the cats at least once

1220
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:29,699
we debug it

1221
01:01:27,989 --> 01:01:36,179
oh and that a search should be greater

1222
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:38,129
than or equal to sorry I'm sorry less

1223
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:40,949
than or equal to right it should be

1224
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:45,690
assert that it's really a cert not the

1225
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:48,179
thing that I was saying for so now it

1226
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:50,369
should maybe in theory wants to debug it

1227
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:52,858
it'll place the cats we won't actually

1228
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:56,190
see any cats and the reason that we

1229
01:01:52,858 --> 01:02:00,630
wouldn't see any cats is because the

1230
01:01:56,190 --> 01:02:02,579
actual entity list never gets processed

1231
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:05,250
by the room generation code so we will

1232
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:08,849
have to add that it looks like for some

1233
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:10,679
reason we didn't get any cats that's

1234
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:14,579
really disheartening because we would

1235
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:17,250
like more cats right so let's find out

1236
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:19,289
why I'm also going to switch the debug

1237
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:22,349
mode to make it easier for me to step

1238
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:23,489
through Visual Studio doesn't really do

1239
01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:26,730
a very good job of stepping through

1240
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:36,739
release mode code unfortunately so let's

1241
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:38,929
go ahead and and oh I know why

1242
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:39,859
I don't even really need to step through

1243
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:41,480
it

1244
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:43,849
we expanded our array we never actually

1245
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:56,389
put the thing in it so we still need to

1246
01:02:43,849 --> 01:03:03,009
do this right so this allows us to add

1247
01:02:56,389 --> 01:03:03,009
an option and then we can make that

1248
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:15,880
option be the room in question yeah I'm

1249
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:18,680
saying I'll probably return that in case

1250
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:22,269
we add framers to it that someone who

1251
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:27,349
adds an option wants to be able to touch

1252
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:30,409
so that should add our cat like our cat

1253
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:34,029
request records so there we go we placed

1254
01:03:30,409 --> 01:03:36,670
Hana so now all of our cats are like

1255
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:39,530
recorded as being somewhere in the world

1256
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:42,050
but we inside the room generator now

1257
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:46,430
need to actually put entities in when

1258
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:49,609
they're requested so you know I'm gonna

1259
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:52,940
take the simplest possible way right now

1260
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:57,969
and we'll again we'll add much like this

1261
01:03:52,940 --> 01:04:00,230
route this is completely on worked on

1262
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:02,118
the world generator is starting to

1263
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:04,460
become a little bit more real like

1264
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:06,140
there's actual logic in it and it's sort

1265
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:10,099
of starting to look more like a thing

1266
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:12,049
that's a real system for doing what it

1267
01:04:10,099 --> 01:04:14,210
does the generate room is still just

1268
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:15,980
garbage and so I'm not gonna spend any

1269
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:18,639
time on this part here yet because we're

1270
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:21,079
gonna we're gonna do this whole part

1271
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:23,779
much more seriously at some point when

1272
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:26,929
we get to actual room gen stuff we care

1273
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:29,359
about and so this I'm just gonna do the

1274
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:32,480
stupidest possible thing which is to say

1275
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:37,099
that here when we do we've got on lamp

1276
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:42,108
right on boundary on connection so on so

1277
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:46,159
on so anytime we add a traversable right

1278
01:04:42,108 --> 01:04:49,789
here I'm going to add an entity if we've

1279
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:51,920
got an entity to add right

1280
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:54,590
so the entities that you add to a room

1281
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,210
will just literally stack up along the

1282
01:04:54,590 --> 01:05:00,230
top row well in this case would be the

1283
01:04:56,210 --> 01:05:02,659
bottom row of the room and that's just

1284
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:05,030
where they'll go because again I don't

1285
01:05:02,659 --> 01:05:06,639
care and I just want to make sure that

1286
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:08,540
the higher level codes working

1287
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:09,949
eventually then we'll get into room

1288
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:14,360
shaping which will be like a different

1289
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:18,589
thing that we'll do when we get there so

1290
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:20,090
here when we do the traversable we know

1291
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:23,240
we can put it in the honest reverse well

1292
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:28,130
if we want to so that's exactly what I'm

1293
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:31,549
gonna do we'll start out by opening at

1294
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:36,740
the start we know we've got a particular

1295
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:38,960
room we know we have like a or a you

1296
01:05:36,739 --> 01:05:42,079
know an enemy or a pending entity let's

1297
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:46,940
call it so we know we've got that first

1298
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:49,099
entity it could be zero but you know

1299
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:50,990
we're gonna check so if we're not on a

1300
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:53,480
lamp and we add the traversable here

1301
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:56,419
we're just gonna say look if there is a

1302
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:58,909
pending entity we're gonna add the

1303
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:02,389
pending entity and then we'll advance

1304
01:05:58,909 --> 01:06:04,519
the next one so if we want to add one of

1305
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:07,839
these entities into the system we need

1306
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:09,980
to add whatever the type of entity is

1307
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:12,260
that we're actually looking at here

1308
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:17,900
right so in the case of the cat we have

1309
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:21,230
to actually add the cat so again we've

1310
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:23,240
kind of got some there's probably an

1311
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:25,190
additional piece of information that

1312
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:27,559
we'll add to our gennadiy which is like

1313
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:36,559
what the generator call is that adds

1314
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:39,259
this thing and I'm not sure how I want

1315
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:43,099
to do that but I don't really care right

1316
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:44,600
now because that's not really yeah again

1317
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:46,579
that's something that we can kind of

1318
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:47,690
address later when we have more stuff we

1319
01:06:46,579 --> 01:06:49,579
care about because there's really no

1320
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:53,990
information at the moment about how we

1321
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:55,610
might want to do that so let me just go

1322
01:06:53,989 --> 01:06:58,219
ahead and jump up here and take a look

1323
01:06:55,610 --> 01:07:02,870
at what happens when you add in these to

1324
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:04,369
the world right looks like this so what

1325
01:07:02,869 --> 01:07:05,690
I want to do is I want to be able to add

1326
01:07:04,369 --> 01:07:07,549
entities and then I want to be able to

1327
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:09,619
add tags to the entities that come from

1328
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:16,240
the list of tags that we specified there

1329
01:07:09,619 --> 01:07:16,239
uh you know it kind of occurs to me I

1330
01:07:20,949 --> 01:07:26,719
feel like we already okay here we go

1331
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:30,230
so here's like for example the code that

1332
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:31,909
adds a mon-star so if we want to add a

1333
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:34,599
monster you know would look something

1334
01:07:31,909 --> 01:07:34,599
like this

1335
01:07:59,719 --> 01:08:14,819
so I'm pretty sure all we really wanted

1336
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:17,130
to do I'm pretty sure all we really want

1337
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:19,170
to do is just make this a little bit

1338
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:24,500
more generic and then we just go from

1339
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:24,500
there like if we want to add a Monstar

1340
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,920
like it is a little bit harder because

1341
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:34,048
like things like snakes that occupy

1342
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:37,079
multiple squares are going to be harder

1343
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:38,850
for us to place so we'll have to think a

1344
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:41,189
little bit harder about those but most

1345
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:43,770
things since they only occupy just the

1346
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:48,239
one square would be really easy for us

1347
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:49,560
to place so I'm gonna start with the

1348
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:53,130
simpler case and we'll have to kind of

1349
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:55,230
grow it out to work on the harder case

1350
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,940
but if we look at what happens when you

1351
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:59,699
place it entity it looks actually quite

1352
01:08:56,939 --> 01:09:03,210
simple so we've got like the world

1353
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:06,149
position P and the standing on place

1354
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:08,489
that's occupying right and so it looks

1355
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:10,229
like you can kind of just do this where

1356
01:09:08,489 --> 01:09:12,088
you say this is where the thing is going

1357
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:14,459
to be in the world and this is what its

1358
01:09:12,088 --> 01:09:16,309
going to stand on so it looks like we

1359
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:21,359
kind of already know the end of the

1360
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:22,950
position right it's this thing and so

1361
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,500
it's going to get placed down here by

1362
01:09:22,949 --> 01:09:26,849
that call or this thing's a would get

1363
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:31,289
placed down here by that call anyway I

1364
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:34,440
don't know why we would have to specify

1365
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:37,380
a P if we already specify a standing on

1366
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:39,148
that's a little opaque to me why that

1367
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:42,208
would occur

1368
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:42,209
[Music]

1369
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:50,279
so we'll have to think about that a

1370
01:09:47,548 --> 01:09:51,359
little bit more because I don't

1371
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:52,859
understand why you would need to do that

1372
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:56,640
and maybe you don't really need to do

1373
01:09:52,859 --> 01:10:01,800
that but that's sufficient so in this

1374
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:04,410
case if we have a pending entity we're

1375
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:07,949
just gonna like place the pending entity

1376
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:12,238
here and off we go

1377
01:10:07,948 --> 01:10:14,729
I yeah I mean the other thing I guess I

1378
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:17,029
would say is maybe we want to leave that

1379
01:10:14,729 --> 01:10:20,819
up to this system and if that's the case

1380
01:10:17,029 --> 01:10:30,359
then what we'd like to do is really have

1381
01:10:20,819 --> 01:10:33,539
something like this so we know that this

1382
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:36,509
is what we would place or how we would

1383
01:10:33,539 --> 01:10:39,448
request the placement of an entity this

1384
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:48,989
will do that addition and add the

1385
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:53,429
various pieces here like so I don't

1386
01:10:48,988 --> 01:10:54,988
really know how much more of this there

1387
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:57,329
would be for cats probably just the Buy

1388
01:10:54,988 --> 01:10:59,129
in the head but this is what it would

1389
01:10:57,329 --> 01:11:01,948
look like I don't really know that it

1390
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:06,000
has hit points either but you know we'll

1391
01:11:01,948 --> 01:11:08,309
cross that bridge when I come to it so

1392
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,229
this is a brain cat as well I'm not

1393
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:12,780
going to add a brain to it at the moment

1394
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:14,939
but eventually we probably would and

1395
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:18,149
that is pretty much all there would be

1396
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:19,919
for adding cat that means although we'll

1397
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:21,420
call this directly here because all of

1398
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,250
our entities are cats

1399
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:27,779
we will then just make this a more

1400
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:30,930
abstract way of specifying which what we

1401
01:11:27,779 --> 01:11:34,979
actually want to place a little further

1402
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:38,670
down so here's how all of these

1403
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:42,059
functions should I believe work and so

1404
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:44,640
then we would say you know entity equals

1405
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:47,100
add cat I don't know that there's

1406
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,739
anything really else this is like the

1407
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:51,810
place entity add cat I don't understand

1408
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:55,229
the else we do other than spam the tags

1409
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:57,360
on there so in here we wouldn't need to

1410
01:11:55,229 --> 01:11:59,399
do the occupying because that gets

1411
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:00,989
in here and we wouldn't need you to

1412
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:03,659
place entity because that gets done in

1413
01:12:00,989 --> 01:12:06,779
here so really all we would be talking

1414
01:12:03,659 --> 01:12:10,139
about is adding the tags that exist on

1415
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:17,670
the pending entity so we'd really just

1416
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:19,890
do something like this where we take

1417
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:32,819
that array and we just say all right for

1418
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:37,410
every for every one of these we just

1419
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:38,939
push them on now looking here you know I

1420
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:41,460
mean it's really just pretty basic right

1421
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:46,559
we would just say here's the genin of

1422
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:48,960
the tag if the pending entity tags plus

1423
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:52,230
the tag index we would then just call

1424
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:57,390
add tag on the place entity and we're

1425
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:58,979
just effectively copying these over so

1426
01:12:57,390 --> 01:13:01,560
that adds all of those tags to the

1427
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:06,899
entity and after they've already been

1428
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:12,080
placed and in terms of adding the cat we

1429
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:12,079
just need to pass it the traversable

1430
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:21,870
which like su passed like that don't

1431
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:27,029
actually know how you pass that to be

1432
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:30,510
completely honest with you that we'll

1433
01:13:27,029 --> 01:13:32,340
have to see but looking at ad cat here

1434
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:35,250
right we need to pass the other things

1435
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:38,789
that we do know what they are so the

1436
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:40,770
region the P and the standing on I just

1437
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:42,029
don't know how you get a traversal

1438
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:49,190
reference because I honestly don't

1439
01:13:42,029 --> 01:13:49,189
remember how you make those traversal

1440
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:06,958
let's try and find out

1441
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,959
[Music]

1442
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:17,078
not seeing a lot of information there so

1443
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:22,188
you've got an entity reference which

1444
01:14:20,328 --> 01:14:25,188
says which the which entity we're

1445
01:14:22,189 --> 01:14:26,929
talking about here and then you've got

1446
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:30,889
an index which is the one inside the

1447
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:32,899
entity so it's pretty easy to make one

1448
01:14:30,889 --> 01:14:35,569
of those but I don't know again like

1449
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:42,049
that systems kind of old and we haven't

1450
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:45,368
really done a lot with it so I'm not

1451
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:50,029
sure how that wants to be done I mean I

1452
01:14:45,368 --> 01:14:56,139
guess it would be done like this right

1453
01:14:50,029 --> 01:14:56,139
where you say the traversable reference

1454
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:08,079
is just zero zero and the entity that

1455
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:08,078
we're talking about here is is this one

1456
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:25,500
maybe and again I'm not really sure

1457
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:36,710
the only reference in this case I guess

1458
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:41,988
looks like that and the only thing I

1459
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:43,880
don't know is so the entity ID though is

1460
01:15:41,988 --> 01:15:46,669
not filled out in this case which is

1461
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:49,690
less good because we don't really know

1462
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:51,590
what that entity ID would necessarily be

1463
01:15:49,689 --> 01:15:55,309
although I guess we can just fill that

1464
01:15:51,590 --> 01:16:01,400
out as well is there a way to just

1465
01:15:55,310 --> 01:16:05,420
reference an MB but don't we have a

1466
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:08,319
function to like make one of these stuff

1467
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,319
needs to get overhauled

1468
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:36,140
so no that's kind of seat-of-the-pants

1469
01:16:33,409 --> 01:16:37,579
there don't love any of that stuff I

1470
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:40,160
feel like that stuff could get cleaned

1471
01:16:37,579 --> 01:16:44,119
up quite a bit now but one thing that

1472
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:47,300
I'm so placing one of these things would

1473
01:16:44,119 --> 01:16:48,769
work like this and this call will be

1474
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:50,029
something that I think we then turn into

1475
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,260
a function pointer so when you play

1476
01:16:50,029 --> 01:16:52,670
something you could just say this is the

1477
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:55,159
function I would like to create my

1478
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:59,300
entity at you know at such time as we

1479
01:16:55,159 --> 01:17:04,909
actually go to create it in in practice

1480
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:06,860
right um so now we probably love to step

1481
01:17:04,909 --> 01:17:09,079
through the codes somewhat to find out

1482
01:17:06,859 --> 01:17:11,059
if these entities are getting placed but

1483
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:14,119
it looks like they are right because if

1484
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:19,670
I go now in here you can see that we've

1485
01:17:14,119 --> 01:17:21,319
got Fred is there right although there's

1486
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:23,000
some really weird stuff happened I think

1487
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:24,679
with with I don't know if that's

1488
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,020
z-fighting or some other weird thing

1489
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:29,260
that's happening with them let me go

1490
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,260
ahead and

1491
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:36,650
you

1492
01:17:48,109 --> 01:17:52,439
so some weird things happening although

1493
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,270
and it looks like really most of it just

1494
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:55,559
that he like he's not structured

1495
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:56,910
particularly correctly so he's kind of

1496
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:00,060
flattened on top of each other which is

1497
01:17:56,909 --> 01:18:02,819
not particularly great there but it

1498
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:04,830
looks like we've placed two cats for

1499
01:18:02,819 --> 01:18:07,769
some reason we're getting both threads

1500
01:18:04,829 --> 01:18:13,710
which is not correct right we should

1501
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:15,060
have been getting so there's a Hana but

1502
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:17,369
we should have been getting a gray tabby

1503
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:19,710
and we're not getting a gray tabby so we

1504
01:18:17,369 --> 01:18:21,949
got all three cats placed and that

1505
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:24,899
system does seem to be working properly

1506
01:18:21,949 --> 01:18:35,699
except for the fact that we're not

1507
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:40,199
actually singing one of the cats ah you

1508
01:18:35,699 --> 01:18:42,300
know why because it's one is a grit it's

1509
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:44,250
because we didn't pass those tags we

1510
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:48,510
just said tabby so actually that's our

1511
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:50,899
fault right so when we go to place this

1512
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:59,970
tabby here what we really wanted to do

1513
01:18:50,899 --> 01:19:02,549
is probably specify in here maybe even

1514
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:07,619
take this out so we may want to do like

1515
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:14,329
a place cat and say that it's you know a

1516
01:19:07,619 --> 01:19:14,329
Burman and then here we want to say

1517
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:43,920
that this is a gray and here we would

1518
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:46,109
want to say so so now we've got one

1519
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:48,300
ghost firm in one brown tabby and one

1520
01:19:46,109 --> 01:19:49,710
gray tabby and I guess technically we're

1521
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:52,190
going in the right ad active order it

1522
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:52,189
would look like that

1523
01:19:54,199 --> 01:20:01,260
that's a volume that's an entity and so

1524
01:19:57,989 --> 01:20:03,750
now we are correctly I think doing all

1525
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:07,199
of the entity placement there so when we

1526
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:10,170
start off in the world here we do have

1527
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:12,539
so there's one ghost Hannah there's one

1528
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:15,630
brown Fred

1529
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:24,380
and then there's well no no we're still

1530
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:24,380
we're still wrong there yep typos abound

1531
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:31,139
the code can only be as good as the

1532
01:20:29,729 --> 01:20:34,500
parameters you pass it folks

1533
01:20:31,139 --> 01:20:38,010
um so let's try more time so there's a

1534
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:39,329
Molly there is a Fred and hopefully

1535
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:46,170
we'll get a hand up here if there's a

1536
01:20:39,329 --> 01:20:49,889
Hana so that's good and at this point

1537
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:51,420
we've got that envy placement stuff that

1538
01:20:49,889 --> 01:20:53,010
seems to be working roughly the way I

1539
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:56,429
would want so really what we need you

1540
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:59,130
now is just expand that slightly to have

1541
01:20:56,429 --> 01:21:03,329
the notion of a call in there that's

1542
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:06,539
gonna be specific to the type of entity

1543
01:21:03,329 --> 01:21:09,300
being placed so in here where we do Jen

1544
01:21:06,539 --> 01:21:11,929
entity we're gonna have some kind of a

1545
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:17,130
callback which is like you know type def

1546
01:21:11,929 --> 01:21:19,260
entity star and I guess I'll do my

1547
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:23,520
standard defined trick here which is

1548
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:26,969
just this is like an entity generator or

1549
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:30,679
like this is a create Kennedy call

1550
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:37,920
something like that you know I'm saying

1551
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:43,618
and so one of these is just something

1552
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:46,618
it's anything that returns an ende and

1553
01:21:43,618 --> 01:21:53,880
takes the same parameters as our place

1554
01:21:46,618 --> 01:22:03,059
cat call right where is our place cat

1555
01:21:53,880 --> 01:22:12,539
call nope I'm sorry not place cat add

1556
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:13,949
the cat so it's basically that so you

1557
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:16,439
pass it a sim region in the world

1558
01:22:13,948 --> 01:22:22,250
position and traversable that should go

1559
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:25,250
on and you know that's what it does so

1560
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:25,250
that

1561
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:39,880
is going to be on the entity struct it's

1562
01:22:37,149 --> 01:22:42,129
like a thing that we then have gender

1563
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:44,650
identity and then like this is the

1564
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:45,760
creator and so when we we make one of

1565
01:22:44,649 --> 01:22:47,529
these we're just gonna say look that's

1566
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:51,070
the function that you actually want to

1567
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:53,469
call and so in place of calling add cat

1568
01:22:51,069 --> 01:22:55,689
here what we're gonna do instead is call

1569
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:58,300
whatever the pending entity said we

1570
01:22:55,689 --> 01:23:00,368
should call to create the thing and

1571
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:02,860
that's what's going to create it so now

1572
01:23:00,368 --> 01:23:06,308
if we ran this we would just crash right

1573
01:23:02,859 --> 01:23:08,228
because there is no that is not it's

1574
01:23:06,309 --> 01:23:10,420
just a zero right so we would try to

1575
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:12,039
call a zero so in order to restore the

1576
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:14,590
functionality but now we've made it so

1577
01:23:12,038 --> 01:23:18,059
we can do whatever we want we just need

1578
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:22,269
our fleet I'm sorry our add cat call

1579
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:26,288
here to be a Jen entity Jen create

1580
01:23:22,269 --> 01:23:27,820
entity call add cat like so so that it

1581
01:23:26,288 --> 01:23:29,710
fits the particular function prototype

1582
01:23:27,819 --> 01:23:31,929
they're looking for and then inside

1583
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:33,460
world Jen whenever we do a place cat we

1584
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:36,639
just need to make sure that the thing

1585
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:40,118
that gets placed when we place cat knows

1586
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:42,309
that the thing should be a cat so I'm

1587
01:23:40,118 --> 01:23:44,348
gonna say that the add entity called

1588
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:51,420
generally speaking to encourage good

1589
01:23:44,349 --> 01:23:51,420
behavior takes a create entity callback

1590
01:23:51,868 --> 01:23:57,130
that's what needs to do the entity

1591
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:59,260
creation and so that will always be set

1592
01:23:57,130 --> 01:24:01,659
so we don't end up jumping into no-man's

1593
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:05,099
land okay

1594
01:24:01,658 --> 01:24:06,879
so we then need our calls like add cat

1595
01:24:05,099 --> 01:24:13,869
to be things that are generally

1596
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:15,819
available and since that's sort of since

1597
01:24:13,868 --> 01:24:17,710
we have like world Jen room Jen I think

1598
01:24:15,819 --> 01:24:20,529
at this point we need entity Jen right

1599
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:23,189
so I think we need like in the code

1600
01:24:20,529 --> 01:24:31,859
directory we need like handmade entity

1601
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:31,859
Jen dot H and dot C here's our H

1602
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:43,308
here's what see and so all of this stuff

1603
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:47,320
should really go in there in my opinion

1604
01:24:43,309 --> 01:24:49,639
right so all of this lamps familiars

1605
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:53,779
blah blah blah blah blah right whatever

1606
01:24:49,639 --> 01:25:00,949
that is that all goes in here and this

1607
01:24:53,779 --> 01:25:04,069
stuff is given like primacy over when

1608
01:25:00,948 --> 01:25:11,448
we're doing the Chen stuff there's an

1609
01:25:04,069 --> 01:25:16,939
M&amp;E Chen the codes in here and the same

1610
01:25:11,448 --> 01:25:22,399
is true in here right and then we can

1611
01:25:16,939 --> 01:25:24,229
move similarly this stuff here out see

1612
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:27,138
where did I have that stuff right here

1613
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:29,348
so this stuff that was previously you

1614
01:25:27,139 --> 01:25:31,880
know stuffed in there is now its own

1615
01:25:29,349 --> 01:25:34,940
sort of space that can exist outside of

1616
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,800
it now everything should kind of be

1617
01:25:34,939 --> 01:25:38,419
properly bucketed so we can think about

1618
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,269
what we're doing at Yin time

1619
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:43,069
um so that allows us I believe to just

1620
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:45,860
make whatever we want so we can make

1621
01:25:43,069 --> 01:25:49,759
things that add whatever random stuff we

1622
01:25:45,859 --> 01:25:52,158
want to add and it will just work which

1623
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:54,500
I think concludes the placement series

1624
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:56,089
of things so now I think we're on to the

1625
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,130
proper construction side of things which

1626
01:25:56,090 --> 01:26:00,500
is to say that that does not look like a

1627
01:25:58,130 --> 01:26:01,849
cat because the head and the bite well

1628
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:04,038
first of all it's enormous

1629
01:26:01,849 --> 01:26:05,538
start with that the head in the body

1630
01:26:04,038 --> 01:26:07,460
aren't lined up right blah blah blah

1631
01:26:05,538 --> 01:26:09,408
right so now we're kind of we need to

1632
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:13,670
work on the entity construction part of

1633
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:17,089
this process right so that's something

1634
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:18,500
that we kind of want to work on here so

1635
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:22,069
let's pop over doing that and this is

1636
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:24,109
where I said I might stop today but we

1637
01:26:22,069 --> 01:26:25,939
got about 50 minutes left so we might as

1638
01:26:24,109 --> 01:26:28,939
well just start with some of the light

1639
01:26:25,939 --> 01:26:31,879
treatment that we might want to do here

1640
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:37,129
and we can then move on a little later

1641
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:40,969
to whatever we want to do that's more

1642
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:43,069
serious later right so we can start with

1643
01:26:40,969 --> 01:26:45,109
some basics which is that well you know

1644
01:26:43,069 --> 01:26:46,219
the scale of cats is just going to be

1645
01:26:45,109 --> 01:26:47,808
the scale of cats

1646
01:26:46,219 --> 01:26:49,819
so really you know whatever this is

1647
01:26:47,809 --> 01:26:52,340
supposed to be here just is what it is

1648
01:26:49,819 --> 01:26:53,840
so at some level we don't really have to

1649
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,760
do much work because I think our system

1650
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:58,849
already allows us to make things as big

1651
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,349
as we want them to be and so if we just

1652
01:26:58,849 --> 01:27:01,760
scale these things a little bit

1653
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:04,519
differently we would end up with cats

1654
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:06,469
that are appropriately sized right and

1655
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:07,460
similarly if we float them a little bit

1656
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:10,219
above you can see they're kind of

1657
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:12,920
interpenetrating there if we make them

1658
01:27:10,219 --> 01:27:14,960
higher up off the ground that'd help as

1659
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:17,479
well and again I'm not really sure what

1660
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:19,118
we want to do about that necessarily but

1661
01:27:17,479 --> 01:27:21,800
for right now what I can do is elevate

1662
01:27:19,118 --> 01:27:24,049
elevate them up off the ground so we can

1663
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:25,489
see them so this will be both of their

1664
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:30,619
pieces are just kind of floating above

1665
01:27:25,488 --> 01:27:32,509
where they are I should probably

1666
01:27:30,618 --> 01:27:35,929
instantiate them in our room it would

1667
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:39,739
make them easier to see but so there you

1668
01:27:35,929 --> 01:27:43,328
can see me walk in there there you can

1669
01:27:39,738 --> 01:27:45,348
see a more normal looking Fred right and

1670
01:27:43,328 --> 01:27:47,299
there's a couple of things that we want

1671
01:27:45,349 --> 01:27:48,260
to be able to do there his body I'm

1672
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:53,239
sorry that's Molly

1673
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:55,429
so her you can see that the body is now

1674
01:27:53,238 --> 01:27:59,178
a more reasonable size the head maybe

1675
01:27:55,429 --> 01:28:02,359
isn't exactly and so we might want to

1676
01:27:59,179 --> 01:28:05,658
adjust those two things separately and

1677
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:07,609
just kind of get the relative sizes

1678
01:28:05,658 --> 01:28:10,609
correct and I could even position them

1679
01:28:07,609 --> 01:28:12,529
correctly after that but that that once

1680
01:28:10,609 --> 01:28:14,089
we get to that that gets more into the

1681
01:28:12,529 --> 01:28:16,728
sort of align point stuff that I want to

1682
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:17,479
talk about separately which we can then

1683
01:28:16,729 --> 01:28:21,260
go from there

1684
01:28:17,479 --> 01:28:23,659
so let me go ahead and do two things one

1685
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:27,289
let me raise the head slightly above the

1686
01:28:23,658 --> 01:28:28,759
body because it should be right and two

1687
01:28:27,288 --> 01:28:30,800
let me make the head a little bit

1688
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:33,440
smaller than the body because you know

1689
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:40,029
it should be and there's a couple of

1690
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:47,328
things we may have to do we may have to

1691
01:28:40,029 --> 01:28:48,349
respect sizes a little bit more then

1692
01:28:47,328 --> 01:28:50,238
we're doing right now so I may have to

1693
01:28:48,349 --> 01:28:52,699
go look and see how we want do that as

1694
01:28:50,238 --> 01:28:55,459
well because these two things it's hard

1695
01:28:52,698 --> 01:28:57,198
to say I don't remember if we're

1696
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:58,878
respecting sizes correctly in things so

1697
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:04,488
let's see

1698
01:28:58,878 --> 01:29:09,618
about that anyway so looking in here

1699
01:29:04,488 --> 01:29:10,908
right I feel like the head should have

1700
01:29:09,618 --> 01:29:13,398
been raised up a little higher and it

1701
01:29:10,908 --> 01:29:18,018
wasn't I'm not sure why right that

1702
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:21,530
should place the head higher up because

1703
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:23,590
that's a Z offset I thought so like that

1704
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:25,639
for example it should be clearly above

1705
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:27,260
and the fact that it wasn't clearly

1706
01:29:25,639 --> 01:29:30,038
above is a little odd so I'm wondering

1707
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:32,628
if maybe is that not being used somehow

1708
01:29:30,038 --> 01:29:33,708
and again this entity stuff we're gonna

1709
01:29:32,628 --> 01:29:35,059
have to go and and cleaned up because we

1710
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:37,309
it's kind of always been an afterthought

1711
01:29:35,059 --> 01:29:40,788
so now that is you can see that it's got

1712
01:29:37,309 --> 01:29:43,279
a Z offset now right floating up there

1713
01:29:40,788 --> 01:29:45,828
so I'm not sure why that wouldn't have

1714
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:49,248
been sufficient I think even one point

1715
01:29:45,828 --> 01:29:50,658
one should have been enough to see it

1716
01:29:49,248 --> 01:29:52,760
floating above and I guess part of

1717
01:29:50,658 --> 01:29:55,308
that's you know the Z obviously is

1718
01:29:52,760 --> 01:30:00,939
modified by the Z bias program and so on

1719
01:29:55,309 --> 01:30:00,939
so there's that but we'll see so anyway

1720
01:30:04,059 --> 01:30:10,659
yeah so that seems a little bit more

1721
01:30:05,988 --> 01:30:14,378
correct now and so yeah there's the cat

1722
01:30:10,658 --> 01:30:16,839
and it seems fine

1723
01:30:14,378 --> 01:30:20,090
certainly more fine than our current cat

1724
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:23,828
giant weird hopping cat that is not

1725
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:26,779
supposed to even be a cat so I think

1726
01:30:23,828 --> 01:30:30,889
mostly the stuff there is now about

1727
01:30:26,779 --> 01:30:32,569
aligning things in particular ways so I

1728
01:30:30,889 --> 01:30:35,748
think that's a good place to stop for

1729
01:30:32,569 --> 01:30:37,308
today just trying to think if I should

1730
01:30:35,748 --> 01:30:39,519
if I should bother going further into

1731
01:30:37,309 --> 01:30:39,519
that

1732
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:46,360
I don't feel like I should

1733
01:30:51,288 --> 01:30:54,768
and you can kind of see like we're

1734
01:30:53,269 --> 01:30:56,030
getting some different weird things

1735
01:30:54,769 --> 01:30:57,559
they're like different sized things so I

1736
01:30:56,029 --> 01:31:01,729
think we want to respect size more I

1737
01:30:57,559 --> 01:31:03,170
should probably go do that maybe I could

1738
01:31:01,729 --> 01:31:05,808
do that in 15 minutes just to get the

1739
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:08,179
size stuff being correctly proportional

1740
01:31:05,809 --> 01:31:11,739
to the sizes that are in the files so

1741
01:31:08,179 --> 01:31:15,429
that's something we would like to do and

1742
01:31:11,738 --> 01:31:20,569
yeah so let's we can think about that

1743
01:31:15,429 --> 01:31:21,949
but you know we're kind of opening up a

1744
01:31:20,569 --> 01:31:23,479
bunch of things we can start doing now

1745
01:31:21,948 --> 01:31:25,788
and I'm not sure which of them we want

1746
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:27,558
to work on first but one of the things

1747
01:31:25,788 --> 01:31:36,018
that I would like to do maybe is just

1748
01:31:27,559 --> 01:31:39,500
see here about inside like inside the

1749
01:31:36,019 --> 01:31:42,650
actual system that that renders the

1750
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:45,170
entities I'm thinking also you know if

1751
01:31:42,649 --> 01:31:47,299
the things a ghost it should get alpha

1752
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:49,158
or something I mean just as an example

1753
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:51,829
and we probably wouldn't quite do

1754
01:31:49,158 --> 01:31:53,929
exactly that in the future but you know

1755
01:31:51,828 --> 01:31:56,210
something to that effect so when we go

1756
01:31:53,929 --> 01:31:57,710
to do an entity render here what I would

1757
01:31:56,210 --> 01:32:03,368
like to do is look and see you know if

1758
01:31:57,710 --> 01:32:03,368
this cat is a ghost then it's going to

1759
01:32:03,849 --> 01:32:10,279
it's going to have its alpha affected by

1760
01:32:06,889 --> 01:32:13,460
that so one way to do that here would be

1761
01:32:10,279 --> 01:32:16,729
like say hey you know we did whatever

1762
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:19,189
this match vector here is tells us if

1763
01:32:16,729 --> 01:32:22,158
it's a ghost or not so we could do

1764
01:32:19,189 --> 01:32:24,078
something like I don't know if there's

1765
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:25,518
an alpha value that comes through here

1766
01:32:24,078 --> 01:32:29,328
probably not so you can see there's

1767
01:32:25,519 --> 01:32:32,599
probably a color right here and what we

1768
01:32:29,328 --> 01:32:37,158
could do is say look color it's going to

1769
01:32:32,599 --> 01:32:43,730
be x equals whatever the tag value is on

1770
01:32:37,158 --> 01:32:49,000
ghost for this entity so match vector

1771
01:32:43,729 --> 01:32:49,000
and the ghost tag

1772
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:57,689
so just looking at whatever that is one

1773
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:59,939
- the ghost tag is going to multiply

1774
01:32:57,689 --> 01:33:02,669
impure so if something is a ghost tag

1775
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:04,169
you know it would ghost out now I don't

1776
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:06,329
want it to become completely invisible

1777
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:09,859
when it's completely a ghost I want to

1778
01:33:06,329 --> 01:33:12,180
maybe be you know just a little bit

1779
01:33:09,859 --> 01:33:14,519
invisible when it's a ghost or something

1780
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:22,619
like this so well you know it'd be

1781
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:25,230
something more like that so that way in

1782
01:33:22,619 --> 01:33:26,849
theory now ghost cats are translucent I

1783
01:33:25,229 --> 01:33:29,759
mean that's what you would expect a

1784
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:32,130
ghost cat to be I would think I don't

1785
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,630
really know but let's just assume and

1786
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:35,640
and now they are right and I think

1787
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:37,590
that's better because you know if I go

1788
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:39,720
into a room when I see a ghost cat

1789
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:43,409
that's what a ghost cat should look like

1790
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:46,500
in my mind a ghost cat shouldn't look

1791
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:48,769
like a regular cat because ghost cats

1792
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:51,329
are ghosts for a reason

1793
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:52,650
so again just some little things like

1794
01:33:51,329 --> 01:33:54,059
that that also should be taken care of

1795
01:33:52,649 --> 01:33:56,399
and so anything that's a ghost in the

1796
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:57,690
game should probably have some effects

1797
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:58,829
on it that's just a simple effect

1798
01:33:57,689 --> 01:34:02,009
throught now it's probably not the one

1799
01:33:58,829 --> 01:34:03,859
we'd use in the final but it's close

1800
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:06,239
enough for now

1801
01:34:03,859 --> 01:34:09,869
so yeah I think we're down to a line

1802
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:11,399
points and sizing looking at sizing I

1803
01:34:09,869 --> 01:34:15,479
think is the first thing I would want to

1804
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:19,319
do so the thing that we've got that

1805
01:34:15,479 --> 01:34:32,879
currently happens with sizing is when we

1806
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:36,409
push an actual sprite on here here so

1807
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:39,680
what happens here where we do the bitmap

1808
01:34:36,409 --> 01:34:46,250
dimension stuff right you can see us

1809
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:50,360
sort of playing with it here we don't

1810
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:50,359
well there's a lot of things we don't do

1811
01:34:53,350 --> 01:35:03,910
when we go to push a bitmap on what you

1812
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:09,819
can see happening is we use the bitmap

1813
01:35:03,909 --> 01:35:11,829
dimension to figure out what the aspect

1814
01:35:09,819 --> 01:35:14,099
ratio should be to make sure that we

1815
01:35:11,829 --> 01:35:19,300
always get the aspect ratio correct

1816
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:25,210
right and this is a good thing what we

1817
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:28,210
don't do is figure out how big this

1818
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:36,909
thing should be based on any bitmap

1819
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:44,109
dimensions right and that is potentially

1820
01:35:36,909 --> 01:35:48,720
a problem and potentially not it really

1821
01:35:44,109 --> 01:35:48,719
depends on how you want to look at it so

1822
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:58,480
if we imagine that most art assets in

1823
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,399
the end would want to be scaled up to

1824
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:02,619
maximally put detail

1825
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:04,089
into the space available for the texture

1826
01:36:02,619 --> 01:36:08,680
then really what we're talking about

1827
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:10,949
here is some intrinsic value that tells

1828
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:15,300
us how big this thing would have been

1829
01:36:10,949 --> 01:36:18,099
relative to other things its size right

1830
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:20,710
relative to other things sizes I should

1831
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:24,910
say so what we're really talking about

1832
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:27,130
is we want to have something in addition

1833
01:36:24,909 --> 01:36:29,559
to the width over the height which tells

1834
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:31,060
us how to correlate those two things we

1835
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,550
would want something that tells us how

1836
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:36,010
to correlate the incoming size of the

1837
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:37,630
thing we said we wanted versus the size

1838
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:39,909
the things should be according the art

1839
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:41,800
assets right and this is just a way of

1840
01:36:39,909 --> 01:36:46,420
saying look if I say that something

1841
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:48,909
should be 1.0 in terms of scale well

1842
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:50,890
something that was small at a scale of

1843
01:36:48,909 --> 01:36:52,840
1.0 and something that was large at a

1844
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:55,300
scale of 1.0 should come out to

1845
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:58,659
different sizes that's really the only

1846
01:36:55,300 --> 01:37:01,060
sane way to have the game treat art

1847
01:36:58,659 --> 01:37:02,680
assets uniformly but have them come out

1848
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:06,170
different sizes based on how big they

1849
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:09,020
should have been in the input

1850
01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:11,770
so right now we don't have that piece of

1851
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:15,350
information and we kind of need it right

1852
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:18,530
we need something that tells us what

1853
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:22,220
that was otherwise we can't really

1854
01:37:18,529 --> 01:37:31,130
process it and if we look back at our

1855
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:32,869
file formats right then what we have is

1856
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:34,699
we have a dimension of the bitmap which

1857
01:37:32,869 --> 01:37:36,409
says how big the bitmap is in terms of

1858
01:37:34,699 --> 01:37:40,880
storage area and then we have an aligned

1859
01:37:36,409 --> 01:37:43,340
percentage right we should also have a

1860
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:47,869
width over height here but I guess we

1861
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:51,170
just get that from this dimension so

1862
01:37:47,869 --> 01:37:53,720
nowhere in here do we actually store any

1863
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:57,020
information about how big the thing

1864
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:58,970
should have been right we just don't

1865
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:00,410
have that information and it would be

1866
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:03,020
nice if we did have that information

1867
01:38:00,409 --> 01:38:06,170
because we liked ideally have a way to

1868
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:09,020
adjust sizes of things based on whatever

1869
01:38:06,170 --> 01:38:11,420
their input size worth maybe or maybe we

1870
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:14,950
just want to be able to do that sizing

1871
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:14,949
after the fact right

1872
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:27,809
that's my thinking anyway

1873
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:39,250
so I feel like we really want an

1874
01:38:37,630 --> 01:38:40,359
additional piece of information there

1875
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:44,670
and that additional piece of information

1876
01:38:40,359 --> 01:38:44,670
is like a scale factor that gets applied

1877
01:38:55,819 --> 01:39:00,869
that's what I'm thinking

1878
01:38:58,409 --> 01:39:03,899
so roughly what we would do is we'd say

1879
01:39:00,869 --> 01:39:05,159
all right what was the input size and

1880
01:39:03,899 --> 01:39:06,839
this well actually no we probably

1881
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:09,689
wouldn't do anything what we'd probably

1882
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:11,670
do is we just import the data as we

1883
01:39:09,689 --> 01:39:15,149
imported it and then we would size the

1884
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:17,699
thing ourselves on import till we

1885
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:20,429
adjusted the size to be what we wanted

1886
01:39:17,699 --> 01:39:22,229
it to be you know what I mean

1887
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:24,750
that's probably what we would do and

1888
01:39:22,229 --> 01:39:26,969
then we would just say look that's the

1889
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:28,619
sizes so the alignments and the sizes

1890
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:31,110
would just be things that we adjust when

1891
01:39:28,619 --> 01:39:32,699
we first import that asset in and then

1892
01:39:31,109 --> 01:39:35,159
the asset even if it gets updated we'll

1893
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:41,380
just retain that size every time you re

1894
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:44,430
imported right so I think that's good

1895
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:44,430
[Music]

1896
01:39:45,739 --> 01:39:50,489
and I think that's probably what I want

1897
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:52,140
to do I'm not going to tackle that now

1898
01:39:50,489 --> 01:39:56,760
so I think we are towards the end so I'm

1899
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:59,520
gonna go to the QA and we will tackle

1900
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:02,070
that stuff next weekend when our goal

1901
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,770
will be to place I guess most of our

1902
01:40:02,069 --> 01:40:07,380
entities into the world as examples and

1903
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:09,950
get their sizes and appearances to be

1904
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,949
correct

1905
01:40:21,510 --> 01:40:24,940
justice would or could you add the

1906
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:26,350
values the cat pieces into the two big

1907
01:40:24,939 --> 01:40:28,299
data lists and from there drag the

1908
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:30,310
values to liven at the cats I think you

1909
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:32,680
already made those features long ago yes

1910
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:34,330
that is actually probably roughly what

1911
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:38,470
we are going to do something along those

1912
01:40:34,329 --> 01:40:40,029
lines do you have a video where you talk

1913
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:42,010
in depth about the construction of meow

1914
01:40:40,029 --> 01:40:49,380
hash I didn't find it on YouTube no I

1915
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:49,380
have not put anything on you know hash

1916
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:57,030
video wise but it's pretty

1917
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:57,029
straightforward if you look at the code

1918
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:07,539
are you offended that we named our cat

1919
01:41:03,789 --> 01:41:10,930
Miura Tori no I'm honored I love cats

1920
01:41:07,539 --> 01:41:15,359
cats are awesome so if there's a cat

1921
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:15,360
named after me I am pleased

1922
01:41:44,869 --> 01:41:48,800
can you talk about some of your plans on

1923
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,630
the AI amenities and what options you're

1924
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,789
considering

1925
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:55,789
so there's not really gonna be any AI on

1926
01:41:52,789 --> 01:41:58,279
entities so entities are supposed to be

1927
01:41:55,789 --> 01:42:00,340
arcade-style if that makes sense so

1928
01:41:58,279 --> 01:42:04,009
they're generally supposed to do

1929
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:08,449
patterns that the player can like

1930
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:13,699
predict so to the extent that there is

1931
01:42:08,449 --> 01:42:15,529
AI if you choose to call it that it

1932
01:42:13,699 --> 01:42:18,109
really is an AI so much as its pattern

1933
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:22,250
execution so the entities are supposed

1934
01:42:18,109 --> 01:42:24,139
to kind of like do specific sets of

1935
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:25,970
actions that the player predicts like it

1936
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:28,640
knows you know that this kind of entity

1937
01:42:25,970 --> 01:42:31,159
when it sees you like charges at you or

1938
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:33,500
whatever and you know that like this

1939
01:42:31,159 --> 01:42:35,059
other kind of entity like randomly

1940
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:38,659
weights amount of time and then like

1941
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:41,539
bounces at you or something right so

1942
01:42:38,659 --> 01:42:45,920
there shouldn't be any like AI in the

1943
01:42:41,539 --> 01:42:47,090
game that's you know doing something

1944
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:50,810
that could be considered like

1945
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:52,400
intelligent because that's would ruin

1946
01:42:50,810 --> 01:42:54,620
the feel like the feel is supposed to

1947
01:42:52,399 --> 01:43:01,009
it's opposed really like Arkady like an

1948
01:42:54,619 --> 01:43:07,699
arcade game not like a like a immersive

1949
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:08,630
like simulation feeling thing offended

1950
01:43:07,699 --> 01:43:12,439
if they missed the opportunity to name

1951
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:16,730
the cat per Ettore I'm not offended but

1952
01:43:12,439 --> 01:43:19,729
I do agree that that would have would

1953
01:43:16,729 --> 01:43:26,439
have been a step up right purgatory is

1954
01:43:19,729 --> 01:43:30,699
great cat see per Ettore also great I

1955
01:43:26,439 --> 01:43:30,699
mean who could argue with that

1956
01:43:49,409 --> 01:43:53,979
and again the AI thing just to be clear

1957
01:43:51,970 --> 01:43:56,140
on that it's that's a stylistic decision

1958
01:43:53,979 --> 01:43:59,559
it's not a technical decision it's just

1959
01:43:56,140 --> 01:44:01,090
the type of game that you're making if

1960
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:08,850
you're making an arcade game you

1961
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:11,800
generally don't want to specify a lot of

1962
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:13,810
things that like the goal of artificial

1963
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:15,820
intelligence generally is to sort of

1964
01:44:13,810 --> 01:44:18,160
confound the player to a certain extent

1965
01:44:15,819 --> 01:44:20,380
meaning it's supposed to feel more like

1966
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:22,809
you were playing against a human right

1967
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:24,159
so it's supposed to make decisions that

1968
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:26,920
maybe you don't necessarily exactly

1969
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:31,090
understand or maybe do things that might

1970
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:35,619
be considered clever or or respond to

1971
01:44:31,090 --> 01:44:37,449
your behavior and those are not things

1972
01:44:35,619 --> 01:44:38,829
that I want in this game meaning like

1973
01:44:37,449 --> 01:44:41,970
nothing in this game should be like

1974
01:44:38,829 --> 01:44:45,100
learning about what you are doing or

1975
01:44:41,970 --> 01:44:46,869
taking actions based on expectations

1976
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:48,220
about what you've done in the past and

1977
01:44:46,869 --> 01:44:51,909
those are the kind of things that you

1978
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:53,440
would normally consider AI and this game

1979
01:44:51,909 --> 01:44:55,149
is not supposed to feel that way it's

1980
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:57,369
supposed to feel like the things in the

1981
01:44:55,149 --> 01:45:00,250
world are very like simple simple

1982
01:44:57,369 --> 01:45:07,149
organic beings that just have a

1983
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:09,659
particular reflex right they're very

1984
01:45:07,149 --> 01:45:11,949
like innate and they just only do

1985
01:45:09,659 --> 01:45:14,319
exactly what you would expect them to do

1986
01:45:11,949 --> 01:45:17,079
and the difficulty in the game comes

1987
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:19,179
from you trying to look at a particular

1988
01:45:17,079 --> 01:45:22,119
screen go these are the patterns that I

1989
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:24,420
know will occur so I'm gonna do this

1990
01:45:22,119 --> 01:45:26,949
because that's the most effective way to

1991
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:29,350
thwart those patterns or accomplish the

1992
01:45:26,949 --> 01:45:31,899
objective I'm trying to accomplish given

1993
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:36,039
that I know those patterns will happen

1994
01:45:31,899 --> 01:45:37,359
right and of course is not always

1995
01:45:36,039 --> 01:45:38,890
possible for the player to really be

1996
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:40,989
that thorough about it because as you

1997
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:43,720
get enough enemies on the screen their

1998
01:45:40,989 --> 01:45:45,550
patterns become fairly unpredictable to

1999
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:48,280
a certain extent as well so that chaos

2000
01:45:45,550 --> 01:45:49,930
is fine - I know I'm not saying the you

2001
01:45:48,279 --> 01:45:51,189
know we have to keep it to the player

2002
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:53,590
could perfectly predict it's going to

2003
01:45:51,189 --> 01:45:57,159
happen or anything but generally

2004
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:58,750
speaking it used supposed to be case

2005
01:45:57,159 --> 01:46:00,760
that like if it's just a player and one

2006
01:45:58,750 --> 01:46:02,140
or two entities they should not have to

2007
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:03,970
guess about what's gonna happen there

2008
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:05,650
should be should be very clear like oh I

2009
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:07,180
know these things patrol back and forth

2010
01:46:05,649 --> 01:46:08,949
and I know this thing will charge at me

2011
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:11,110
when it sees me and you know it that

2012
01:46:08,949 --> 01:46:12,279
should be the the way that the player is

2013
01:46:11,109 --> 01:46:15,309
reasoning about the world that should be

2014
01:46:12,279 --> 01:46:17,170
very consistent and if that's ever not

2015
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:19,030
the case it should only be like one

2016
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:22,029
maybe there's like you know a specific

2017
01:46:19,029 --> 01:46:23,829
type of entity that's that was smart if

2018
01:46:22,029 --> 01:46:30,369
we ever did any AI at all it would only

2019
01:46:23,829 --> 01:46:31,989
be like very specific for some I don't

2020
01:46:30,369 --> 01:46:33,699
think we will because I can't think of

2021
01:46:31,989 --> 01:46:35,800
any reason why I want that in there but

2022
01:46:33,699 --> 01:46:37,840
you know it would be a very isolated

2023
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:40,110
incident if we put in anything that

2024
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:43,110
would be considered like an AI style

2025
01:46:40,109 --> 01:46:43,109
thing

2026
01:47:01,989 --> 01:47:07,939
see you're fairly optimistic in your

2027
01:47:06,590 --> 01:47:09,590
ex-patients a serious thing don't expect

2028
01:47:07,939 --> 01:47:10,819
to be done for two years what are some

2029
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:12,560
of the topics if taken long as expected

2030
01:47:10,819 --> 01:47:14,750
actually nothing's taken longer than

2031
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:18,140
expected and the two years is right on

2032
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:20,210
target the only thing that I messed up

2033
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:22,460
was when I was computing the two years

2034
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:24,829
because I said two things I was like 600

2035
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:26,869
episodes is how many we're gonna do so

2036
01:47:24,829 --> 01:47:30,920
it'll take two years for some reason in

2037
01:47:26,869 --> 01:47:34,750
my head I was like thinking 300 ish days

2038
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:38,930
a year of episodes so 600 is two years

2039
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:40,640
but we only do either five or two

2040
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:43,460
episodes a week depending on the

2041
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:45,680
circumstance which means that it's more

2042
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:48,319
like five or six years to get 600

2043
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:50,600
episodes so we're more or less exactly

2044
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:57,139
where I thought we would be which is to

2045
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:59,570
say that we're on Episode four 85 and I

2046
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:03,470
said there'd be 600 I still think that's

2047
01:47:59,569 --> 01:48:05,960
roughly how many they'll be you know I

2048
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:07,460
might be more or less if there were 700

2049
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:11,720
episodes I wouldn't consider myself that

2050
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:14,000
far off in the estimate but that's just

2051
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:15,470
the reality of doing it this slowly you

2052
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,170
know normally you program you program

2053
01:48:15,470 --> 01:48:20,710
many hours a day here I get four hours a

2054
01:48:18,170 --> 01:48:23,119
week it's just not very many hours so I

2055
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:24,890
would say yeah there was really no

2056
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:26,269
optimism was pretty realistic and so far

2057
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:29,810
it seems about right I don't we'll see

2058
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:31,400
where we were at on days 600 if I was in

2059
01:48:29,810 --> 01:48:33,110
the ballpark or not you know maybe we're

2060
01:48:31,399 --> 01:48:35,949
on day 600 and we're nowhere near done

2061
01:48:33,109 --> 01:48:35,949
you know

2062
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:48,409
how did you approach redrawing small

2063
01:48:46,609 --> 01:48:49,699
parts of the screen in an immediate mode

2064
01:48:48,409 --> 01:48:51,229
GUI

2065
01:48:49,699 --> 01:48:52,519
well immediate mode really doesn't have

2066
01:48:51,229 --> 01:48:53,718
anything to do with whether you're

2067
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:55,130
redrawing the small part of the screen

2068
01:48:53,719 --> 01:49:00,829
or a large part of screen right it's

2069
01:48:55,130 --> 01:49:02,840
just how you decided to iterate so in an

2070
01:49:00,829 --> 01:49:05,510
iamb GUI right

2071
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:08,539
you're just you've got a structure and

2072
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:12,079
you have a way of looking up where you

2073
01:49:08,539 --> 01:49:15,769
are in the structure that is code rather

2074
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:18,590
than data right so at each branch where

2075
01:49:15,770 --> 01:49:20,600
you go I'm gonna draw this panel now you

2076
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:22,130
can just do a lookup to say do I need to

2077
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:23,180
draw this panel now and the answer is no

2078
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:27,319
you just don't touch it

2079
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:28,579
right another way to say it is you do it

2080
01:49:27,319 --> 01:49:30,049
exactly the same way that you would do

2081
01:49:28,579 --> 01:49:31,488
it in RM GUI they're really not

2082
01:49:30,050 --> 01:49:35,329
different they're just different API is

2083
01:49:31,488 --> 01:49:37,639
to the same system right and I'm GUI is

2084
01:49:35,329 --> 01:49:41,059
a different interface but it doesn't

2085
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:43,670
imply a different structure you could

2086
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:46,070
create a complete in fact I've often

2087
01:49:43,670 --> 01:49:47,600
said you can take an RM GUI library and

2088
01:49:46,069 --> 01:49:49,039
create and I'm GUI interface out of it

2089
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:53,750
I've actually done that I did that once

2090
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:55,159
for a QT app where you could I am you

2091
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:56,630
know have an IM interface and then what

2092
01:49:55,159 --> 01:49:59,569
would do is it would build the structure

2093
01:49:56,630 --> 01:50:02,539
out of the IM calls look at the

2094
01:49:59,569 --> 01:50:04,159
structure that existed in QT and modify

2095
01:50:02,539 --> 01:50:08,350
all the things that it needed to to

2096
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:10,969
basically sync them together right so I

2097
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:12,710
am gooeys an interface paradigm it's not

2098
01:50:10,969 --> 01:50:14,029
an implementation paradigm the

2099
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:15,529
implementation can be anything you want

2100
01:50:14,029 --> 01:50:16,849
and if you want something that's more

2101
01:50:15,529 --> 01:50:18,229
retained in terms of implantation

2102
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:23,930
because you decided that's better you

2103
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:29,839
can just do it it's really not

2104
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:31,070
complicated the goals you seen are

2105
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:32,300
trying to inspire the next generation of

2106
01:50:31,069 --> 01:50:33,349
game engine parents how successful do

2107
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:38,930
you feel the series has been on that

2108
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:41,050
front remarkably successful far more

2109
01:50:38,930 --> 01:50:46,730
than I thought it would be actually I

2110
01:50:41,050 --> 01:50:48,380
receive emails so I had to I kind of

2111
01:50:46,729 --> 01:50:52,099
buried my email address because I was

2112
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:55,550
getting so many emails from people about

2113
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:57,079
the series and them going into game

2114
01:50:55,550 --> 01:50:58,860
programming or getting a job and getting

2115
01:50:57,079 --> 01:51:01,800
pregnant cuz of the series that I just

2116
01:50:58,859 --> 01:51:03,929
got overwhelmed by them so I buried my

2117
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:05,550
email and even with the email there's

2118
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:08,730
only one place got the email now and

2119
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:12,659
it's in like the it's a business email

2120
01:51:08,729 --> 01:51:17,099
I still get email routinely like every

2121
01:51:12,659 --> 01:51:19,680
week from people who are like I got a

2122
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:21,539
job doing like Louisville programming

2123
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:23,610
after watching the series and this sort

2124
01:51:21,539 --> 01:51:25,489
of stuff so it's been like way more

2125
01:51:23,609 --> 01:51:29,489
successful than I thought it would be

2126
01:51:25,489 --> 01:51:33,659
which is great I think I mean it's hard

2127
01:51:29,489 --> 01:51:35,460
to know how necessary it is to have low

2128
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:36,930
level programmers in the world but from

2129
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:39,119
my perspective we need a lot more of

2130
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:41,610
them so having people getting into that

2131
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:43,609
and getting jobs and doing it for a

2132
01:51:41,609 --> 01:51:49,979
living I think is really good

2133
01:51:43,609 --> 01:51:53,599
personally toxification could you please

2134
01:51:49,979 --> 01:51:58,409
explain again what does volatile do sure

2135
01:51:53,600 --> 01:52:01,110
volatile is a pretty simple concept but

2136
01:51:58,409 --> 01:52:05,039
it's very widely misunderstood largely

2137
01:52:01,109 --> 01:52:06,719
because people I think so in that same

2138
01:52:05,039 --> 01:52:08,460
way that like low level programming is

2139
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:10,710
not very common these days people tend

2140
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:12,600
to think of things dogmatically or in

2141
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:14,789
terms of abstract concepts they've been

2142
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:16,500
told not in terms of what something

2143
01:52:14,789 --> 01:52:17,670
actually does and that makes it very

2144
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:19,350
difficult for them to understand

2145
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:21,270
something like volatile because volatile

2146
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:25,890
is not really an abstract concept it's

2147
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:30,030
very concrete so volatile tells the

2148
01:52:25,890 --> 01:52:33,450
compiler that the piece of code it

2149
01:52:30,029 --> 01:52:36,329
happens to be compiling at that time is

2150
01:52:33,449 --> 01:52:40,920
not necessarily the only one that will

2151
01:52:36,329 --> 01:52:44,880
modify the value in question and that is

2152
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:46,440
all it does so if I say int X and the

2153
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:49,829
compiler is compiling code that

2154
01:52:46,439 --> 01:52:51,929
references X the compiler implicitly

2155
01:52:49,829 --> 01:52:54,000
assumes that the piece of code is

2156
01:52:51,930 --> 01:52:57,300
compiling is the only thing that is

2157
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:00,210
touching X so if it compiles the code X

2158
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:02,310
plus equals one it assumes that the

2159
01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:05,609
value before and after that statement

2160
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:10,520
are whatever X was and then whatever X

2161
01:53:05,609 --> 01:53:13,939
was plus 1 right

2162
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:15,920
if you insert a volatile so you have a

2163
01:53:13,939 --> 01:53:18,109
volatile index instead of a regular

2164
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:20,690
index now when the compiler compiles

2165
01:53:18,109 --> 01:53:26,179
that code it assumes that the value of x

2166
01:53:20,689 --> 01:53:28,819
after X plus equals one is arbitrary who

2167
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:31,039
knows what it is it knows that it will

2168
01:53:28,819 --> 01:53:33,619
write back the X plus equals one to the

2169
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:35,420
location where X belongs and then it

2170
01:53:33,619 --> 01:53:35,809
will have to read it again to find out

2171
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:40,000
what it is

2172
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:42,680
the next time X is referenced right so

2173
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,810
volatile is a way of preventing the

2174
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:47,780
compiler from making assumptions about

2175
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:50,330
the values of variables that are marked

2176
01:53:47,779 --> 01:53:53,750
volatile and it tells the compiler that

2177
01:53:50,329 --> 01:53:55,789
every time you operate on a value marked

2178
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:58,039
volatile you must read it into a

2179
01:53:55,789 --> 01:54:01,189
register and write it back out again

2180
01:53:58,039 --> 01:54:05,890
after you are done because other people

2181
01:54:01,189 --> 01:54:10,489
are simultaneously modifying this thing

2182
01:54:05,890 --> 01:54:12,079
that's all it does so it's imperative to

2183
01:54:10,489 --> 01:54:14,090
recognize that when you were doing

2184
01:54:12,079 --> 01:54:15,890
multi-threaded programming you need to

2185
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:17,779
use volatile in a lot of circumstances

2186
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:19,910
because you need to tell the compiler it

2187
01:54:17,779 --> 01:54:21,319
cannot rely on the value of this thing

2188
01:54:19,909 --> 01:54:23,269
being the same as it was because other

2189
01:54:21,319 --> 01:54:25,039
threads are touching it but it's also

2190
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:26,660
imperative to understand that that is

2191
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:29,510
the only thing that volatile does

2192
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:31,720
volatile does not synchronize access to

2193
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:36,829
that variable so you must still use

2194
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:40,430
locking or locked operations in order to

2195
01:54:36,829 --> 01:54:41,989
access that variable because otherwise

2196
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:45,680
you can get race conditions if you don't

2197
01:54:41,989 --> 01:54:48,289
know what you're doing right so volatile

2198
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:49,850
is one tool in a set of tools necessary

2199
01:54:48,289 --> 01:54:52,729
to make multi offender code work

2200
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:54,190
properly and it's crucial that you

2201
01:54:52,729 --> 01:54:56,479
understand what it does and does not do

2202
01:54:54,189 --> 01:54:57,379
if you're doing a lobster point if

2203
01:54:56,479 --> 01:54:58,639
you're not doing multi-threaded

2204
01:54:57,380 --> 01:55:01,119
programming you never need to know what

2205
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:03,110
volatile is ever it's completely

2206
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:06,010
unrelated if you're not doing much

2207
01:55:03,109 --> 01:55:08,299
started programming however

2208
01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:10,070
multi-threaded programming can sometimes

2209
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:14,180
mean things you don't think it means for

2210
01:55:10,069 --> 01:55:16,909
example if there is hardware in a system

2211
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:19,610
and that hardware is sort of effectively

2212
01:55:16,909 --> 01:55:22,130
executing its own threads and can modify

2213
01:55:19,609 --> 01:55:24,049
values in main memory that is the case

2214
01:55:22,130 --> 01:55:29,029
where volatile might be important right

2215
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:31,070
so you may have liked its give me very

2216
01:55:29,029 --> 01:55:33,139
simple let's suppose there's a keyboard

2217
01:55:31,069 --> 01:55:35,139
controller that operates asynchronously

2218
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:41,420
on a particular piece of hardware right

2219
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:43,880
so you don't have to call a function to

2220
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:45,380
read from it or do anything else that

2221
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:49,340
would clue the compiler in that it could

2222
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:51,079
change you just know that the main

2223
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:52,520
memory contents may spontaneously change

2224
01:55:51,079 --> 01:55:55,760
to reflect the fact that a key was

2225
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:57,650
pressed right well there's another case

2226
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:59,720
you need volatile because if you don't

2227
01:55:57,649 --> 01:56:01,489
tell the compiler that this memory range

2228
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:03,500
could just be spontaneously changed by

2229
01:56:01,489 --> 01:56:05,659
somebody then the first time you read it

2230
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:07,579
it may just think well I know what it is

2231
01:56:05,659 --> 01:56:08,960
and I know that no one's changed it so

2232
01:56:07,579 --> 01:56:10,670
the next time I read it I don't need to

2233
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,680
read it again I know it hasn't changed

2234
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:14,270
because I'm looking at this piece of

2235
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:15,800
code on compiling and I can see we're in

2236
01:56:14,270 --> 01:56:17,600
a loop here looking at the space of

2237
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:18,829
memory and I know that no one's touched

2238
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:22,070
it because I'm looking at the code and

2239
01:56:18,829 --> 01:56:26,210
no one touched it right so again multi

2240
01:56:22,069 --> 01:56:29,960
thread can mean more than just the

2241
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:32,239
threads you write it includes any type

2242
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:36,560
of execution unit that exists anywhere

2243
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:39,380
in the system write an interrupt handler

2244
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:41,270
a asynchronous piece of hardware a

2245
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:43,960
separate bus that can reach over and

2246
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:47,780
touch main memory all of that stuff

2247
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:53,480
would induce volatility and things that

2248
01:56:47,779 --> 01:56:55,069
have that characteristic must be marked

2249
01:56:53,479 --> 01:56:57,519
volatile in order for the code to work

2250
01:56:55,069 --> 01:57:00,170
otherwise the compiler may accidentally

2251
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:02,150
compile out work that it should have

2252
01:57:00,170 --> 01:57:04,750
compiled in because it thinks something

2253
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:08,679
can't change when really it can

2254
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:08,680
hopefully that makes some sense

2255
01:57:09,909 --> 01:57:13,220
Poul future with explaining the Maya

2256
01:57:11,930 --> 01:57:14,690
question I aimed less at the

2257
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:16,400
implementation but the thought process

2258
01:57:14,689 --> 01:57:18,139
that goes behind it do you know of a

2259
01:57:16,399 --> 01:57:20,059
good resource to read up on how hashes

2260
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:21,470
are generally constructed how you design

2261
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:23,560
them so they produce low clearing rates

2262
01:57:21,470 --> 01:57:26,659
and how do you quality check them

2263
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:29,480
actually no I don't so the interesting

2264
01:57:26,659 --> 01:57:35,500
thing about hashes is they really aren't

2265
01:57:29,479 --> 01:57:37,848
well understood in my opinion so

2266
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:39,439
basically there's two types

2267
01:57:37,849 --> 01:57:41,779
Tosh's there's cryptographic and non

2268
01:57:39,439 --> 01:57:43,729
cryptographic there's some work that has

2269
01:57:41,779 --> 01:57:45,438
been done on cryptographic hashes that

2270
01:57:43,729 --> 01:57:46,939
has to do with things that you might be

2271
01:57:45,439 --> 01:57:50,149
able to do in terms of proving their

2272
01:57:46,939 --> 01:57:52,639
strengths and that in a sense is a way

2273
01:57:50,149 --> 01:57:54,769
of looking at hash design that is

2274
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:58,069
systematic but the kind of hash that

2275
01:57:54,769 --> 01:58:00,679
meow hash is which is a practical hash

2276
01:57:58,069 --> 01:58:03,108
non cryptographic there really isn't

2277
01:58:00,679 --> 01:58:06,078
much known about good ways to implement

2278
01:58:03,109 --> 01:58:08,689
those because the definition is bizarre

2279
01:58:06,078 --> 01:58:11,688
the definition of what makes a good hash

2280
01:58:08,689 --> 01:58:13,969
for non cryptographic purposes is one

2281
01:58:11,689 --> 01:58:22,369
where the data that isn't expected to

2282
01:58:13,969 --> 01:58:24,198
hash will not collide right because

2283
01:58:22,368 --> 01:58:26,058
fundamentally speaking what you're

2284
01:58:24,198 --> 01:58:27,558
talking about we talk about a hash is

2285
01:58:26,059 --> 01:58:29,538
you're talking about compression

2286
01:58:27,559 --> 01:58:31,519
function it's a function that compresses

2287
01:58:29,538 --> 01:58:34,340
compresses a large amount of data

2288
01:58:31,519 --> 01:58:36,619
usually into a small amount of data so

2289
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:39,769
it's something that takes I don't know

2290
01:58:36,618 --> 01:58:42,078
10k of data and represents it in 128

2291
01:58:39,769 --> 01:58:44,510
bits we know from information theory

2292
01:58:42,078 --> 01:58:48,319
that there is no way to represent 10k of

2293
01:58:44,510 --> 01:58:50,748
data any set of 10k of data in 128 bits

2294
01:58:48,319 --> 01:58:53,958
which means that all hash functions are

2295
01:58:50,748 --> 01:58:55,969
equally bad I'll say that again

2296
01:58:53,958 --> 01:58:58,488
all hash functions are effectively

2297
01:58:55,969 --> 01:59:01,668
equally bad why because information

2298
01:58:58,488 --> 01:59:04,308
theory tells us that every hash function

2299
01:59:01,668 --> 01:59:08,179
is exactly as bad as representing its

2300
01:59:04,309 --> 01:59:09,769
inputs as every other hash function now

2301
01:59:08,179 --> 01:59:11,449
I'm not an information theorist so

2302
01:59:09,769 --> 01:59:13,550
correct me if I'm wrong on that but

2303
01:59:11,448 --> 01:59:15,648
that's my read on information theory

2304
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:17,958
there is no way to construct an

2305
01:59:15,649 --> 01:59:20,300
arbitrarily good hash functions they are

2306
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:22,010
all equally good or bad however you want

2307
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:25,489
to look at it they all have exactly the

2308
01:59:22,010 --> 01:59:28,719
same arbitrary provable quality which is

2309
01:59:25,488 --> 01:59:30,799
to say that all of them are bad at

2310
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:33,559
representing data because there's no way

2311
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:38,479
to represent 10-k data in HoN 28 bits

2312
01:59:33,559 --> 01:59:40,519
right um now I should couch that a

2313
01:59:38,479 --> 01:59:42,800
little bit to say that it's not really

2314
01:59:40,519 --> 01:59:44,479
true because I could write a function

2315
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:47,329
that I call a hash that just returns

2316
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:51,050
zero and obviously that's worse than a

2317
01:59:47,328 --> 01:59:51,619
hash that actually returns all 128 bits

2318
01:59:51,050 --> 01:59:54,590
worth

2319
01:59:51,619 --> 01:59:57,739
data so what I should say is there is

2320
01:59:54,590 --> 02:00:00,140
sort of a way to assess a hash function

2321
01:59:57,739 --> 02:00:03,079
and say that some hash foot patches are

2322
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:05,300
objectively bad because they are unable

2323
02:00:03,079 --> 02:00:07,399
to produce an even distribution from the

2324
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:09,800
distribution that comes in right

2325
02:00:07,399 --> 02:00:12,710
meaning that all of the messages that

2326
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:14,810
come in if almost all of the possible

2327
02:00:12,710 --> 02:00:17,510
inputs to the hash all map to zero

2328
02:00:14,810 --> 02:00:20,539
that's objectively a worst hash function

2329
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:23,750
than one that can actually produce a

2330
02:00:20,539 --> 02:00:25,760
message that maps to all possible 128

2331
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:27,739
bits so there is one way you could look

2332
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:30,020
at hash and say there is a quality that

2333
02:00:27,739 --> 02:00:33,289
you would like to get which is that you

2334
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:36,830
want to use all possible 128 bits worth

2335
02:00:33,289 --> 02:00:39,170
of output right because if you don't use

2336
02:00:36,829 --> 02:00:42,079
the complete range of output then your

2337
02:00:39,170 --> 02:00:45,050
hash is objectively worse than a hash

2338
02:00:42,079 --> 02:00:47,420
that did but assuming that your hash can

2339
02:00:45,050 --> 02:00:50,060
produce all possible values of the

2340
02:00:47,420 --> 02:00:51,890
128-bit 64 bit 32 bit whatever the

2341
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:54,110
output of ash is assuming that that's

2342
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:55,640
true then they're all equally bad and

2343
02:00:54,109 --> 02:00:58,909
the reason that they're all equally bad

2344
02:00:55,640 --> 02:01:02,570
is because each one Maps the input

2345
02:00:58,909 --> 02:01:05,809
message space redundantly somehow onto

2346
02:01:02,569 --> 02:01:07,369
that 100 set of 128-bit values whether

2347
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:09,920
one of them is good or bad for a

2348
02:01:07,369 --> 02:01:12,260
particular purpose just depends on which

2349
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:16,069
set of messages you will input to the

2350
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:19,250
hash because I can always take a given

2351
02:01:16,069 --> 02:01:22,699
hash and pick messages that will collide

2352
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:24,409
right and furthermore the number of

2353
02:01:22,699 --> 02:01:27,920
messages that will collide should be the

2354
02:01:24,409 --> 02:01:29,809
same for every hash right because you

2355
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:34,819
know that the total number of outputs of

2356
02:01:29,810 --> 02:01:37,760
the hash is 2 to the 128 that means that

2357
02:01:34,819 --> 02:01:39,949
that the number of collisions for every

2358
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:42,320
hash that can produce the full range of

2359
02:01:39,949 --> 02:01:45,380
128 bits of output is the same they all

2360
02:01:42,319 --> 02:01:48,799
have the same never collisions so the

2361
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:51,050
only question is do they have the same

2362
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:55,190
number of collisions on the data we care

2363
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:57,770
about so that's what I think makes

2364
02:01:55,189 --> 02:01:59,919
hashes particularly hard to read to

2365
02:01:57,770 --> 02:02:02,420
reason about non cryptographically

2366
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:05,000
because non cryptographic hashes are

2367
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:06,800
about what are the chances that the type

2368
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:13,000
of data you will feed too it will

2369
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:15,800
collide and we have no idea who knows

2370
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:19,250
right I mean the way to look at it would

2371
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:20,900
be we'd need to take a large corpus see

2372
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:23,840
what the sorts of structures of the

2373
02:02:20,899 --> 02:02:26,299
messages are that are in that corpus and

2374
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:30,170
then say which hashes do a good job of

2375
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:32,420
spreading those out very diffusely so

2376
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:35,149
that changes that are likely to occur

2377
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:39,289
between two similar messages will result

2378
02:02:35,149 --> 02:02:41,329
in different 128-bit values I mean

2379
02:02:39,289 --> 02:02:43,550
that's really it so there's some

2380
02:02:41,329 --> 02:02:46,100
properties that we can say probably are

2381
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:48,980
ones we want generally speaking we would

2382
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:51,140
want a bit that changes in the input to

2383
02:02:48,979 --> 02:02:54,579
change all the bits in the output or as

2384
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:57,079
many of them as we can make happen right

2385
02:02:54,579 --> 02:02:59,059
we want messages that are the same but

2386
02:02:57,079 --> 02:03:01,579
in different orders to produce different

2387
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:03,230
hashes you know things that we can

2388
02:03:01,579 --> 02:03:08,390
generally say are true about the kinds

2389
02:03:03,229 --> 02:03:10,549
of inputs that we're feeding it that's

2390
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:12,140
really all I can really say there's not

2391
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:14,029
a lot more that I feel like you can

2392
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:16,220
really say in the abstract about non

2393
02:03:14,029 --> 02:03:19,429
cryptographic hashes cryptographic

2394
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:22,970
hashes are much more well understood in

2395
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:28,190
a sense and the reason for that is

2396
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:29,270
because they have a real model for what

2397
02:03:28,189 --> 02:03:32,599
they're trying to prevent a

2398
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:37,100
cryptographic hash is trying to prevent

2399
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:39,980
someone from spoofing a hash value

2400
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:42,530
so what they're trying to do is look at

2401
02:03:39,979 --> 02:03:45,679
how difficult it is to work backwards

2402
02:03:42,529 --> 02:03:49,819
from a particular hash to a particular

2403
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:54,260
input or set of inputs that's actually

2404
02:03:49,819 --> 02:03:58,609
much easier in my opinion of a problem

2405
02:03:54,260 --> 02:04:02,810
statement because you actually have some

2406
02:03:58,609 --> 02:04:05,599
idea of what you're trying to do an on

2407
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:07,250
cryptographic hash is both easier to

2408
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:12,550
make by accident than a cryptographic

2409
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:15,829
hash and harder to define rigorously

2410
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:17,690
there is no attacker in a non

2411
02:04:15,829 --> 02:04:18,939
cryptographic hash we don't know what

2412
02:04:17,689 --> 02:04:21,339
their motivations are and we

2413
02:04:18,939 --> 02:04:24,969
certainly don't know how to look at a

2414
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:26,650
function and tell what a non

2415
02:04:24,969 --> 02:04:31,750
cryptographic hash really needs to do

2416
02:04:26,649 --> 02:04:33,939
right and so while it's true we could

2417
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:36,550
just say well a cryptographic hash this

2418
02:04:33,939 --> 02:04:37,809
probably has to have properties that

2419
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:39,640
would be good for non cryptographic

2420
02:04:37,810 --> 02:04:41,770
hashing so in that sense they're sort of

2421
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:45,760
equivalent in a sense that's really not

2422
02:04:41,770 --> 02:04:49,000
true like we don't really have any real

2423
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:51,010
reason to think in that way it just kind

2424
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,198
of happens that if it's hard to figure

2425
02:04:51,010 --> 02:04:55,090
out collisions then therefore it must

2426
02:04:53,198 --> 02:04:55,839
also be unlikely that they could happen

2427
02:04:55,090 --> 02:05:01,630
by accident

2428
02:04:55,840 --> 02:05:04,000
I guess right but it's just really hard

2429
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:10,060
and I think that that that problem is

2430
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:11,920
you know it's just non cryptographic

2431
02:05:10,060 --> 02:05:14,949
hashes are just a really ill-defined

2432
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:17,739
problem because by definition their goal

2433
02:05:14,948 --> 02:05:20,319
is to make it unlikely that particular

2434
02:05:17,738 --> 02:05:22,299
corpuses will collide and that's just

2435
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:25,948
not very well-defined it's just an

2436
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:29,800
intrinsic property of the corpus you

2437
02:05:25,948 --> 02:05:31,750
could you could you could almost think

2438
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:35,350
of non cryptographic hashes a lot like

2439
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:37,510
image filters they're good if they work

2440
02:05:35,350 --> 02:05:39,310
good on the images that you have you

2441
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:41,680
know I mean that's what they are and

2442
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:44,289
they don't end it's very similar to

2443
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:45,789
compression like I said compression is

2444
02:05:44,289 --> 02:05:48,130
good if it happens to do a good job

2445
02:05:45,789 --> 02:05:49,960
compressing the input and that's all you

2446
02:05:48,130 --> 02:05:54,100
can really say about it there's there's

2447
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:56,050
a few little parts of it that follow the

2448
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:58,539
same thing as like the hash where you

2449
02:05:56,050 --> 02:06:00,760
can look at them and say well given that

2450
02:05:58,539 --> 02:06:03,100
we want to encode some set of symbols

2451
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:06,430
then we can say things about the

2452
02:06:03,100 --> 02:06:08,650
optimality of the encoding and the same

2453
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:09,250
is true for hashes if we decide that we

2454
02:06:08,649 --> 02:06:11,500
want

2455
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:13,180
generally speaking modifications of bits

2456
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:14,859
to affect all the bits in the hash we

2457
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:18,219
can then say how good a particular hash

2458
02:06:14,859 --> 02:06:19,809
is at doing that but that doesn't speak

2459
02:06:18,219 --> 02:06:25,239
to whether the thing is effective for

2460
02:06:19,810 --> 02:06:26,800
the particular corpus really right and

2461
02:06:25,238 --> 02:06:28,359
so it's just a very it's much like

2462
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:31,090
compression it's just a very ill-defined

2463
02:06:28,359 --> 02:06:32,229
concept and there's a lot more black art

2464
02:06:31,090 --> 02:06:36,159
to it I think

2465
02:06:32,229 --> 02:06:38,189
then then science really although

2466
02:06:36,159 --> 02:06:42,340
obviously there is some science to it

2467
02:06:38,189 --> 02:06:45,189
exactly like compression so that's what

2468
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:47,470
I'd say all that being said I'm not a

2469
02:06:45,189 --> 02:06:50,819
hashed construction guy I happened to

2470
02:06:47,470 --> 02:06:53,820
figure out a good hash it was largely

2471
02:06:50,819 --> 02:06:53,819
luck

2472
02:07:07,109 --> 02:07:12,279
looking through the rest of questions

2473
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:14,230
here do you happen to know how different

2474
02:07:12,279 --> 02:07:16,359
embedded C programming is compared to

2475
02:07:14,229 --> 02:07:18,939
simple C programming they're basically

2476
02:07:16,359 --> 02:07:21,849
the same except for you have more hard

2477
02:07:18,939 --> 02:07:24,179
Hardware constraints like timing number

2478
02:07:21,850 --> 02:07:26,110
of cycles that you have to do things in

2479
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:29,170
the amount of memory is tightly

2480
02:07:26,109 --> 02:07:30,759
constrained and so on but in other ways

2481
02:07:29,170 --> 02:07:32,890
they're a lot more fun because you know

2482
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:34,659
exactly what you're doing and I like

2483
02:07:32,890 --> 02:07:36,070
that one of the most annoying things

2484
02:07:34,659 --> 02:07:38,139
about program windows is specifically

2485
02:07:36,069 --> 02:07:40,659
that I don't know how much memory I have

2486
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:41,829
to work with B I have no idea how cycles

2487
02:07:40,659 --> 02:07:43,630
are counted or how they're going to be

2488
02:07:41,829 --> 02:07:45,069
applied see I have no idea when the

2489
02:07:43,630 --> 02:07:47,079
operating systems going to interrupt me

2490
02:07:45,069 --> 02:07:48,369
D I have no idea what else is running on

2491
02:07:47,079 --> 02:07:49,689
the system and blah blah blah blah so

2492
02:07:48,369 --> 02:07:51,039
embedded program is actually a lot more

2493
02:07:49,689 --> 02:07:52,689
satisfying even though it's more

2494
02:07:51,039 --> 02:07:54,310
limiting because sometimes those limits

2495
02:07:52,689 --> 02:07:55,599
are very refreshing you know what's

2496
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:57,490
going on and a lot of times you have a

2497
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:59,410
lot more control or system so I would

2498
02:07:57,489 --> 02:08:01,059
say that it's six of one half-dozen to

2499
02:07:59,409 --> 02:08:02,649
the other there are some parts that you

2500
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:04,180
don't get to do like can't just allocate

2501
02:08:02,649 --> 02:08:06,250
huge blocks of memory and party on it

2502
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:07,390
like we can on a Windows machine because

2503
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:10,329
you always have just gobs and gobs

2504
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:11,410
memory to work with but you do have

2505
02:08:10,329 --> 02:08:13,000
situations where you know how much

2506
02:08:11,409 --> 02:08:14,229
memory you have and you do you can make

2507
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,060
decisions about it's reasonable you

2508
02:08:14,229 --> 02:08:17,289
don't have to show up and go well there

2509
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:18,400
might be this much there might not be

2510
02:08:17,289 --> 02:08:19,479
this much I don't know the operating

2511
02:08:18,399 --> 02:08:26,559
system might be doing this it might be

2512
02:08:19,479 --> 02:08:27,939
doing that right that's where we're

2513
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,740
adding a fun section of handmade network

2514
02:08:27,939 --> 02:08:31,869
to be a viable short-term solution hami

2515
02:08:29,739 --> 02:08:36,039
Network us already funded by a fund it's

2516
02:08:31,869 --> 02:08:38,170
right here the handmade hero fund or the

2517
02:08:36,039 --> 02:08:39,609
handmade fund I should say allows you to

2518
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:42,909
contribute and we have been funding

2519
02:08:39,609 --> 02:08:44,679
things CDBG would definitely be next on

2520
02:08:42,909 --> 02:08:46,720
our list the problem right now for it is

2521
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:48,400
I don't think we can provide any

2522
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:50,440
realistic amount of money to them that

2523
02:08:48,399 --> 02:08:51,699
would really help at this point the

2524
02:08:50,439 --> 02:08:55,689
handmade fund just isn't big enough for

2525
02:08:51,699 --> 02:08:57,760
that you know right now we traffic in a

2526
02:08:55,689 --> 02:08:59,349
few hundred dollars it would need to be

2527
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:01,030
several thousand dollars before we could

2528
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:03,100
really provide anyone what would amount

2529
02:09:01,029 --> 02:09:05,859
to be a living wage for doing things

2530
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:08,440
like CDBG so we have this option

2531
02:09:05,859 --> 02:09:09,579
available there just we don't the level

2532
02:09:08,439 --> 02:09:14,099
of contributions for stuff like that

2533
02:09:09,579 --> 02:09:14,100
just isn't that large so

2534
02:09:15,039 --> 02:09:19,250
that's good I understand Thanks I just

2535
02:09:17,479 --> 02:09:20,659
wasn't talked about the volatile I just

2536
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:23,260
wasn't sure because the wiki says do not

2537
02:09:20,659 --> 02:09:25,340
use it for inter thread communication um

2538
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:26,869
yes so I guess what I would say about

2539
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:28,670
that is there's a lot of misinformation

2540
02:09:26,869 --> 02:09:31,250
floating around there about volatile

2541
02:09:28,670 --> 02:09:35,480
that if you want one of the main reasons

2542
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:37,698
to treat stack overflow as a purely

2543
02:09:35,479 --> 02:09:39,319
random resource that may have some

2544
02:09:37,698 --> 02:09:41,509
things to think about but never taken as

2545
02:09:39,319 --> 02:09:42,619
actual answers if you look at the kinds

2546
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:47,420
of things that are said about volatile

2547
02:09:42,619 --> 02:09:50,659
on there they're almost all wrong yes it

2548
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:52,550
is true that volatile doesn't solve your

2549
02:09:50,659 --> 02:09:55,760
inter thread communication problems

2550
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:58,070
because that's not what it does it is

2551
02:09:55,760 --> 02:10:00,909
also not true that it isn't for inter

2552
02:09:58,069 --> 02:10:03,738
thread communication it absolutely is

2553
02:10:00,909 --> 02:10:05,180
volatile is a crucial component of inter

2554
02:10:03,738 --> 02:10:07,909
thread communication and without it

2555
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:11,000
internet communication won't work I if

2556
02:10:07,909 --> 02:10:13,460
you're trying to say - - you tap two

2557
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:15,529
threads that need to share access to a

2558
02:10:13,460 --> 02:10:17,480
particular piece of information you had

2559
02:10:15,529 --> 02:10:19,039
better be marked volatile otherwise you

2560
02:10:17,479 --> 02:10:21,859
can probably just compile it straight on

2561
02:10:19,039 --> 02:10:23,810
out right so it's crucial to understand

2562
02:10:21,859 --> 02:10:25,159
what it doesn't it doesn't do is a very

2563
02:10:23,810 --> 02:10:26,780
important tool for multi-threaded

2564
02:10:25,159 --> 02:10:28,279
programming it's just not the only tool

2565
02:10:26,779 --> 02:10:29,719
and so I think a lot of times when

2566
02:10:28,279 --> 02:10:31,399
people get confused is they've been

2567
02:10:29,719 --> 02:10:33,260
warned about volatile not doing

2568
02:10:31,399 --> 02:10:35,269
everything for them that's not the same

2569
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:37,310
as saying it's not necessary it is but

2570
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:39,170
no it doesn't solve the problem it's

2571
02:10:37,310 --> 02:10:42,460
just one part of the solution to an

2572
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:42,460
inter thread communication problem

2573
02:10:42,550 --> 02:10:46,400
Lori master a really good lossy

2574
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:49,219
compressor is a decent hash function

2575
02:10:46,399 --> 02:10:51,170
absolutely that's 100% correct you could

2576
02:10:49,219 --> 02:10:54,380
think of a hash function as a very very

2577
02:10:51,170 --> 02:10:56,920
lossy but hopefully good lossy

2578
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:56,920
compressor

2579
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:06,940
you mentioned many times you're not a

2580
02:11:05,890 --> 02:11:08,590
game designer and that it would be ideal

2581
02:11:06,939 --> 02:11:10,929
if Tom Flo would design the game do you

2582
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:12,340
plan on having him on an episode or two

2583
02:11:10,930 --> 02:11:15,190
to talk about gameplay related stuff

2584
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:16,960
specifically relate to the zine he seems

2585
02:11:15,189 --> 02:11:18,339
to be very pressing I imagine proper

2586
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:21,340
game design does not just happen like a

2587
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:23,319
dare to yeah so no I am NOT putting up

2588
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:25,360
doing that and specifically because

2589
02:11:23,319 --> 02:11:28,029
that's not really the hard part of game

2590
02:11:25,359 --> 02:11:31,719
design so you know the extent to which

2591
02:11:28,029 --> 02:11:34,029
John could contribute abstract guidance

2592
02:11:31,719 --> 02:11:36,369
to the game is stuff that I can that I

2593
02:11:34,029 --> 02:11:39,460
could do myself because that is not hard

2594
02:11:36,369 --> 02:11:41,229
that's more like game criticism or game

2595
02:11:39,460 --> 02:11:42,550
reviewing and game thinking about games

2596
02:11:41,229 --> 02:11:45,819
and that's actually stuff I'm

2597
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:48,279
comfortable with the part of game design

2598
02:11:45,819 --> 02:11:50,469
that is hard and the part that for

2599
02:11:48,279 --> 02:11:53,880
example John excels at is the actual

2600
02:11:50,469 --> 02:11:59,920
work of experimenting and deciding on

2601
02:11:53,880 --> 02:12:01,930
experiments in the game and that is not

2602
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:03,430
something that you do by having someone

2603
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:05,710
just take a look at something and make

2604
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:09,670
some comments right that's not what that

2605
02:12:05,710 --> 02:12:12,760
is and so I think it would be great if

2606
02:12:09,670 --> 02:12:17,739
John did streams where he shows how he

2607
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:19,150
does game design work in that way that

2608
02:12:17,738 --> 02:12:21,099
would be a wonderful educational

2609
02:12:19,149 --> 02:12:23,019
resource but it would be in depth and it

2610
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:25,960
would be involved it's not a two-day

2611
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:30,219
thing it's a many day thing showing lots

2612
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:32,050
of hard work being done just like the

2613
02:12:30,219 --> 02:12:34,359
engine work in handmade Hiro it's it's

2614
02:12:32,050 --> 02:12:39,239
significant it takes a time investment

2615
02:12:34,359 --> 02:12:41,649
very specific expertise and skills and

2616
02:12:39,238 --> 02:12:45,689
it's not something you can just drop by

2617
02:12:41,649 --> 02:12:45,689
for a day and do that's not what that is

2618
02:12:51,420 --> 02:13:00,190
we're pretty much the end of screaming I

2619
02:12:53,350 --> 02:13:02,050
don't know if there's any Martin's there

2620
02:13:00,189 --> 02:13:03,609
are attackers for non crypto hashes hash

2621
02:13:02,050 --> 02:13:05,140
table lookups can lead to denial service

2622
02:13:03,609 --> 02:13:08,920
attacks when attackers can control the

2623
02:13:05,140 --> 02:13:11,050
data coming into a system well so I

2624
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:16,119
would classify that as a cryptographic

2625
02:13:11,050 --> 02:13:18,550
hash though like if you have an attacker

2626
02:13:16,119 --> 02:13:20,199
it's a cryptographic problem to me so I

2627
02:13:18,550 --> 02:13:23,039
don't think of that as being a non

2628
02:13:20,199 --> 02:13:26,380
cryptographic hash if you're using a

2629
02:13:23,039 --> 02:13:29,140
hash for purposes related to data that

2630
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:31,329
an attacker can control then you have a

2631
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:32,289
cryptographic hash scenario right that

2632
02:13:31,329 --> 02:13:34,090
that is what that is

2633
02:13:32,289 --> 02:13:35,710
so it's no longer appropriate to be

2634
02:13:34,090 --> 02:13:41,110
choosing from a non cryptographic hash

2635
02:13:35,710 --> 02:13:46,710
period that's my opinion on it obviously

2636
02:13:41,109 --> 02:13:49,119
Martin's your opinion may differ and I

2637
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:52,000
would totally respect that but that's

2638
02:13:49,119 --> 02:13:54,670
just not the way I think of it if that

2639
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:56,859
makes sense so I almost think of the

2640
02:13:54,670 --> 02:13:58,690
definition of a non cryptographic versus

2641
02:13:56,859 --> 02:14:00,069
cryptographic hash is are they suitable

2642
02:13:58,689 --> 02:14:03,129
for use in a case where there's an

2643
02:14:00,069 --> 02:14:04,960
attacker and so attacker in this case

2644
02:14:03,130 --> 02:14:07,000
means anyone who can cause damage to the

2645
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:09,670
system by controlling an input to the

2646
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:11,199
system and that totally includes data

2647
02:14:09,670 --> 02:14:12,460
coming in for a denial service attack

2648
02:14:11,199 --> 02:14:17,189
right

2649
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:17,189
I don't know if that makes sense but

2650
02:14:18,779 --> 02:14:21,829
[Music]

2651
02:14:24,189 --> 02:14:33,500
mash is based on a es so in a way it

2652
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:35,960
uses crypto Tec yeah so the way to think

2653
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:37,729
about that would be AES is the cheapest

2654
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:41,899
instruction on a current CPU that can

2655
02:14:37,729 --> 02:14:44,179
mix bits and that's what uses it so it

2656
02:14:41,899 --> 02:14:45,319
definitely uses crypto tech but doesn't

2657
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:48,829
really necessarily use them in a crypto

2658
02:14:45,319 --> 02:14:50,509
way and so while it does take advantage

2659
02:14:48,829 --> 02:14:53,989
of the S boxes in order to get

2660
02:14:50,510 --> 02:14:58,100
propagation of bits out from individual

2661
02:14:53,989 --> 02:15:01,010
bits 128-bit lanes I have taken no care

2662
02:14:58,100 --> 02:15:03,680
to try and make sure that that happens

2663
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:06,170
in a cryptographically secure way so it

2664
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:10,730
is assumed at least by me although I

2665
02:15:06,170 --> 02:15:11,539
have not undertaken any sort of attempt

2666
02:15:10,729 --> 02:15:14,089
to prove it

2667
02:15:11,539 --> 02:15:16,279
but I don't believe that there is

2668
02:15:14,090 --> 02:15:19,880
therefore any cryptographic security to

2669
02:15:16,279 --> 02:15:21,859
it because the way in which the AES bit

2670
02:15:19,880 --> 02:15:24,319
mixing is used in male hash is not

2671
02:15:21,859 --> 02:15:26,750
cryptographically secure in fact I'm

2672
02:15:24,319 --> 02:15:28,519
quite I'm fairly sure it's good

2673
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:29,989
graphically insecure meaning that

2674
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:32,210
someone wanted to reverse the me on hash

2675
02:15:29,989 --> 02:15:34,819
process probably could or could at least

2676
02:15:32,210 --> 02:15:36,920
in some circumstances and so it's not

2677
02:15:34,819 --> 02:15:41,109
equivalent to the way that AES is used

2678
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:41,109
in a cryptographic scenario at all

2679
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:56,920
alright let me just stick last questions

2680
02:15:56,439 --> 02:15:59,079
here

2681
02:15:56,920 --> 02:16:00,699
there's too many questions the SMS or

2682
02:15:59,079 --> 02:16:02,319
github repo talks about percentages of

2683
02:16:00,699 --> 02:16:05,800
bias and distribution for a hash what do

2684
02:16:02,319 --> 02:16:07,840
those mean so it depends on what exactly

2685
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:09,730
you're talking about in any given part

2686
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:11,199
of a hash test suite but generally

2687
02:16:09,729 --> 02:16:14,469
speaking what we mean by bias and

2688
02:16:11,199 --> 02:16:17,349
distribution is that you have an input

2689
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:20,050
to a hash and then the hash outputs its

2690
02:16:17,350 --> 02:16:22,450
hash value usually it's compressive but

2691
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:25,600
sometimes it's not so sometimes you can

2692
02:16:22,449 --> 02:16:28,090
hash eight bits and turn in 228 bits

2693
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:31,090
right the meow - for example supports

2694
02:16:28,090 --> 02:16:33,639
every size from eight bits up to 2 to

2695
02:16:31,090 --> 02:16:35,739
the 64th right so who knows

2696
02:16:33,638 --> 02:16:38,768
but generally speaking you're typically

2697
02:16:35,739 --> 02:16:40,209
hashing more with a data hash anyway so

2698
02:16:38,769 --> 02:16:42,219
you're typically Aisling at least a few

2699
02:16:40,209 --> 02:16:43,989
k maybe a few megabytes even or even

2700
02:16:42,218 --> 02:16:47,319
gigabytes depending on the circumstance

2701
02:16:43,989 --> 02:16:48,760
and your training in 220 bits so what we

2702
02:16:47,319 --> 02:16:50,949
talk about when we talk about bias and

2703
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:54,130
distribution is that if you look at that

2704
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:58,059
input if I want to talk about a specific

2705
02:16:54,129 --> 02:17:02,199
bit in the input and I change that bit

2706
02:16:58,058 --> 02:17:05,259
right then there's a question about how

2707
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:07,450
those bits might correlate to other bits

2708
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:09,849
to two bits in the output right so if I

2709
02:17:07,450 --> 02:17:12,670
change a bit in the input and I look in

2710
02:17:09,849 --> 02:17:15,370
the hash output and I see that like only

2711
02:17:12,670 --> 02:17:16,899
one other bit changes you would say that

2712
02:17:15,370 --> 02:17:18,790
that has a lot of bias or that the

2713
02:17:16,899 --> 02:17:21,519
distribution is very bad for example

2714
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:24,190
right because it means that certain

2715
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:27,040
ranges of your inputs produce very

2716
02:17:24,190 --> 02:17:31,269
predictable range than your outputs that

2717
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:33,849
makes sense whereas if I flip bits in

2718
02:17:31,269 --> 02:17:35,170
the input and just random bits change in

2719
02:17:33,849 --> 02:17:37,329
the output that seem to have no

2720
02:17:35,170 --> 02:17:38,558
correlation to which bit I'm flipping or

2721
02:17:37,329 --> 02:17:40,229
no predictable one anyway

2722
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:42,670
you would say that that's very unbiased

2723
02:17:40,229 --> 02:17:44,439
right or that it has a very good

2724
02:17:42,670 --> 02:17:46,360
distribution if I feed bunch of inputs

2725
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:47,950
in and they all come out totally

2726
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:51,460
randomly I can't find any correlation

2727
02:17:47,950 --> 02:17:54,059
its distributing very well right so

2728
02:17:51,459 --> 02:17:56,229
basically the idea is just to say that

2729
02:17:54,058 --> 02:17:57,939
depending on what you're measuring and

2730
02:17:56,229 --> 02:17:59,709
bias and distribution could be used in

2731
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:02,980
different ways when you're talking about

2732
02:17:59,709 --> 02:18:05,289
hash so I'm not it depends on exactly

2733
02:18:02,979 --> 02:18:06,309
where they were using it but generally

2734
02:18:05,290 --> 02:18:10,510
speaking what you're and

2735
02:18:06,309 --> 02:18:12,039
is that set of correlations I have a

2736
02:18:10,510 --> 02:18:14,229
certain set of inputs I'm going to make

2737
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:16,000
a structured series of changes to those

2738
02:18:14,229 --> 02:18:18,609
inputs I'm then gonna look at the

2739
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,649
distribution of hash keys and see our

2740
02:18:18,610 --> 02:18:24,881
hash outputs and see whether there's a

2741
02:18:20,649 --> 02:18:26,859
bias to them well distributed outputs

2742
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:28,599
imply that there is not a bias right

2743
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:31,079
because a well distributed set of

2744
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:32,950
outputs should not let me identify

2745
02:18:31,079 --> 02:18:34,950
correlations to things I'm doing the

2746
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:37,600
inputs whether that's flipping bits

2747
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:46,450
changing the order of things right and

2748
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:47,649
so on Jonathan Blow mean offender mark

2749
02:18:46,450 --> 02:18:49,240
that one should never use the standard

2750
02:18:47,649 --> 02:18:51,579
i/o functions but always use OS specific

2751
02:18:49,239 --> 02:18:52,809
i/o functions I do not know why and I

2752
02:18:51,579 --> 02:18:54,130
can't stop thinking about why it could

2753
02:18:52,809 --> 02:18:56,019
be do you know why he could be talking

2754
02:18:54,130 --> 02:18:58,449
about Junichi bearing thanks you would

2755
02:18:56,020 --> 02:19:00,069
have to ask him for his motivation for

2756
02:18:58,450 --> 02:19:01,329
saying that but obviously there's a lot

2757
02:19:00,069 --> 02:19:03,039
of reasons not to use standard i/o

2758
02:19:01,329 --> 02:19:05,921
functions and the main reasons not to

2759
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:07,600
use Sanrio functions usually are because

2760
02:19:05,921 --> 02:19:09,220
it's an extra layer of indirection that

2761
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:13,329
could do all sorts of things you may not

2762
02:19:09,219 --> 02:19:15,039
want to do number one when you're

2763
02:19:13,329 --> 02:19:15,671
actually creating a data stream of some

2764
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:18,460
kind

2765
02:19:15,671 --> 02:19:20,500
most of the flags that you're provided

2766
02:19:18,459 --> 02:19:22,209
by a standard i/o don't map exactly to

2767
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:23,860
the i/o flags of the actual hardware

2768
02:19:22,209 --> 02:19:26,139
that's underlying enough the hardware

2769
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:28,631
operating system that's underlying so

2770
02:19:26,139 --> 02:19:30,789
for example if you're going to call open

2771
02:19:28,630 --> 02:19:32,380
or F open you will have a much more

2772
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:34,150
restricted set of options that you could

2773
02:19:32,380 --> 02:19:36,159
use generally speaking then if you call

2774
02:19:34,149 --> 02:19:39,579
create file on Windows which gives you a

2775
02:19:36,159 --> 02:19:42,459
lot of other options right so that's

2776
02:19:39,579 --> 02:19:45,880
number one is in direct mapping that

2777
02:19:42,459 --> 02:19:48,760
reduces functionality number two there

2778
02:19:45,880 --> 02:19:51,100
may be buffering or unwanted

2779
02:19:48,761 --> 02:19:52,569
transformations of the input or unwanted

2780
02:19:51,101 --> 02:19:55,750
copies of the input that are unnecessary

2781
02:19:52,569 --> 02:19:57,550
introduced by the layer so if you call

2782
02:19:55,750 --> 02:20:00,069
for example F open and then you use F

2783
02:19:57,550 --> 02:20:01,539
right or if read you will oftentimes be

2784
02:20:00,069 --> 02:20:04,000
going through an intermediate buffer

2785
02:20:01,540 --> 02:20:07,421
which just adds an extra copy for no

2786
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,890
reason that is not necessary right and

2787
02:20:07,421 --> 02:20:10,989
so typically speaking you don't want to

2788
02:20:08,890 --> 02:20:12,640
do that for no reason because unless you

2789
02:20:10,989 --> 02:20:14,380
actually want the buffering you're just

2790
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:19,630
wasting the CPUs time and making your

2791
02:20:14,380 --> 02:20:20,108
i/o slower for no reason number three

2792
02:20:19,630 --> 02:20:22,809
you

2793
02:20:20,109 --> 02:20:24,908
using resources that don't actually need

2794
02:20:22,809 --> 02:20:27,969
to be there so if you take a file

2795
02:20:24,908 --> 02:20:30,068
pointer that's opened by F open or a

2796
02:20:27,969 --> 02:20:32,108
file descriptor open by open that's

2797
02:20:30,068 --> 02:20:34,538
necessarily maintaining a table or a

2798
02:20:32,109 --> 02:20:37,328
structure interior to the C runtime

2799
02:20:34,539 --> 02:20:39,189
library that itself then has to maintain

2800
02:20:37,328 --> 02:20:41,439
a pointer to the operating systems

2801
02:20:39,189 --> 02:20:43,568
version anyway in order to issue the

2802
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:45,340
real calls so essentially what you're

2803
02:20:43,568 --> 02:20:48,248
doing is you're creating a management

2804
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:50,439
layer that's using up extra resources

2805
02:20:48,248 --> 02:20:53,078
and taking extra time extra cash space

2806
02:20:50,439 --> 02:20:54,760
etc etc for doing nothing other than

2807
02:20:53,078 --> 02:21:00,878
forwarding your i/o functions to the

2808
02:20:54,760 --> 02:21:03,369
correct actual place right those are

2809
02:21:00,879 --> 02:21:05,140
some reasons don't know whether any of

2810
02:21:03,369 --> 02:21:10,959
those were the ones that he was thinking

2811
02:21:05,139 --> 02:21:12,158
of but they might be all right thank you

2812
02:21:10,959 --> 02:21:13,869
everyone for joining me for an episode

2813
02:21:12,158 --> 02:21:16,538
of hand made here it has been a pleasure

2814
02:21:13,869 --> 02:21:17,680
coding with you as always if you would

2815
02:21:16,539 --> 02:21:19,329
like to follow along the series at home

2816
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:22,300
you can always pair the game on handmade

2817
02:21:19,328 --> 02:21:26,590
hero org it comes to the source code so

2818
02:21:22,299 --> 02:21:29,738
you can play with it yourself and well

2819
02:21:26,590 --> 02:21:31,389
learn from it add features do the sorts

2820
02:21:29,738 --> 02:21:34,180
of things that you might do with

2821
02:21:31,389 --> 02:21:35,680
experimental programming that's about it

2822
02:21:34,180 --> 02:21:37,930
for this week I'll be back next week

2823
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:42,010
when we'll take a look at getting our

2824
02:21:37,930 --> 02:21:43,720
assets structures having the correct

2825
02:21:42,010 --> 02:21:45,728
sort of alignment and sizing stuff in

2826
02:21:43,719 --> 02:21:47,228
them that we want so that when things

2827
02:21:45,728 --> 02:21:49,988
get important to the game they look

2828
02:21:47,228 --> 02:21:51,788
correct for multi-part entities which is

2829
02:21:49,988 --> 02:21:54,430
really what we're missing at the moment

2830
02:21:51,789 --> 02:21:55,779
in terms of placing entities that's

2831
02:21:54,430 --> 02:21:58,119
about it

2832
02:21:55,779 --> 02:21:59,319
hope see you back here for that until

2833
02:21:58,119 --> 02:22:00,069
then have fun programming I'll see you

2834
02:21:59,318 --> 02:22:02,639
everyone the Internet

2835
02:22:00,068 --> 02:22:02,639
take it easy everybody
