1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,229
hello everyone and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,189
here oh sure we code a complete game

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:12,259
live on stream we almost didn't make it

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:16,649
today the we moved we did an office move

5
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:18,570
and can't stop moving who was the moving

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:21,209
company I would not recommend this

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,859
moving company they destroyed the

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,689
handmade hero desk it's one of those

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,679
like desks that has a height adjustable

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,810
height on it and they like I probably

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,320
tried to ram it through a door without

12
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,929
realizing that it has a control on it

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,409
and it just like shattered like the

14
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:42,058
control board was fractured out of the

15
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:44,369
rubber housing and like one of the

16
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:49,949
capacitors or I guess my circuit board

17
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:53,280
knowledge is not very good but like the

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,829
the actual there was like a coiled wire

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,370
and like what looked like a capacitor

20
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,698
cap or something which just split in

21
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:05,938
half and all the wire could come out so

22
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,560
it was it was pretty bad so I was super

23
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,019
depressed and I'm like oh man what am I

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,900
gonna do cuz that desk like it's pretty

25
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,509
old all the desks at my rocket were from

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,180
the old days and they took a long time

27
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,390
to get and they're pretty expensive and

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,950
so I was like oh this is terrible but

29
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,710
then like you know John blow recently he

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,570
had spent some time in Seattle and he

31
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:33,919
had actually gotten a desk one of these

32
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:36,719
desks it was a Jarvis desk it was from a

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,549
company called fully and it was a pretty

34
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,780
cool desk and it had high just - like Oh

35
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,310
where'd you get this desk and did it

36
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,450
take a long time to get it cuz I'm still

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,250
thinking in the old days and he's like

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,299
now he's ordered online it shows up but

39
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,340
I'm like oh that's awesome

40
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,430
so I'd had that in my head and I like

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,079
idly mention this I'm like well I don't

42
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,250
know this desk is probably toast and I

43
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,269
there's no way I'm gonna be able to

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,030
repay the circuit board I don't know

45
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:59,280
anything about hardware so I'm just like

46
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,390
I'm probably you know probably screwed

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,030
we're not gonna be able string handmade

48
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,560
here for like weeks but man it's like

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,000
well let me just try it let me see if I

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,530
can get one from that company and she

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,780
actually went online and she ordered

52
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,620
this desk and it showed up in two days

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,860
so like clearly the process has gotten

54
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,069
the

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,600
lot better people must use these kind of

56
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,599
desks a lot more now than they used to

57
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,969
so basically this this stream is

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,270
definitely happening thanks to Anna and

59
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:32,639
to John as well for having proved that

60
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,650
you can get these desks nowadays in a

61
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,089
recent amount of time hold on one second

62
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,390
I gotta get my tissues too I don't know

63
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,390
where they went

64
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:54,270
all right so yes so basically the the

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,150
evil moving company tried to thwart the

66
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,060
stream but they were not able to thanks

67
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,219
to the heroics of of john and anna

68
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:06,150
indirectly and so now we are able to

69
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:09,389
resume programming as we as we would

70
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,510
have which is very good all right so in

71
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:17,069
theory everything is working now I

72
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:18,389
checked on the Blackmagic capture card

73
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,039
took us a little while during the pre

74
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:21,479
stream to get it set up properly back

75
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,259
again you kind of got to do a little

76
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:28,048
dance but it looks like it's capturing

77
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:30,179
at 1080p 60 again which means everything

78
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:34,409
should be working okay

79
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,750
and I should be able to just start as if

80
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:39,090
nothing had happened and maybe possibly

81
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,000
who knows could be we'll find out in a

82
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,009
second everything it'll just be fine so

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,509
we'll see I'll try to keep an eye on the

84
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:48,239
streaming - this is the first time using

85
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:50,039
the Internet here so we don't really

86
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,539
know how that's gonna go but so far I

87
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,048
don't see any dropped frames so

88
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:58,919
hopefully everything yeah hopefully

89
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:03,540
everything will be okay let's get

90
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:06,179
started so if you remember where we were

91
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,129
we had kind of done some exploration of

92
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,909
the camera I never I couldn't really

93
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:14,569
find a good way to get the camera really

94
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:16,978
working in a way that I wanted to with a

95
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,319
specified control curve like where we

96
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,569
actually just specified a cubic for it

97
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,038
so what we ended up doing was just

98
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:24,598
falling back to what I said we would

99
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:26,909
fall back to if we couldn't which is a

100
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,599
proportional derivative controller and

101
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,610
those are pretty

102
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,260
good but there's some problems with

103
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,230
proportional derivative controller which

104
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,399
is that the sometimes will do some some

105
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,140
stuff that you don't necessarily want

106
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,659
and you have to tune it to potentially

107
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,610
tune the parameters to be set

108
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,160
appropriately to avoid things like

109
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,620
overshoot or framerate dependent stuff

110
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,180
like that but if you look at how its

111
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,129
behaving now you can kind of see the

112
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,230
cameras pretty nice even so with the

113
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:53,639
proportional derivative controller right

114
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,379
you know we go ahead and bring that up

115
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,879
to full screen you can see that's doing

116
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,519
roughly what we wanted to do which is

117
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,110
that you know it it smoothly transitions

118
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,519
between different camera modes and

119
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,560
doesn't produce a lot of unwanted

120
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,120
artifacts so for example when I'm

121
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,360
hopping around in this scene you can see

122
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,790
that the camera is allowed to roam

123
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,400
freely across the vertical extent of

124
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:17,280
this particular room and you can also

125
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,649
kind of see that it doesn't do that

126
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,689
horizontally and that's by design right

127
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:23,310
we specified that explicitly we have

128
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:28,219
different kinds of rooms there that do

129
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:31,139
that and you can also see here a sort of

130
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,090
ease of transition like when we come in

131
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,029
here it's not tracking any motion of the

132
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:38,429
player it's just a static right it's not

133
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:43,969
doing anything to track where the player

134
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:47,430
is it just focused on the scene directly

135
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,930
and so that it transitions between those

136
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,680
modes nice and seamlessly and that all

137
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,120
feels pretty good and if I go into again

138
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,379
this is another vertical track room if I

139
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,240
go into a room that tracks both

140
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:58,829
directions so I believe this garden area

141
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,960
outside here

142
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:02,669
that's a double track room so it I think

143
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,779
it tracks horizontal and vertical maybe

144
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,310
not it looks like it doesn't track

145
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,559
horizontal I don't know if we have any

146
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,810
rooms that are big enough for that we

147
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,180
probably should have some we'll have to

148
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,649
set those up later but anyway it seems

149
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,900
to be tracking pretty pretty well

150
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:18,810
through there and all that all seems to

151
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:23,609
be pretty good so really what we have

152
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,050
now is we can just choose to say look

153
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,569
that's good enough for our purposes

154
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,860
let's go ahead and double down on the

155
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:30,569
proportional derivative controller and

156
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,340
just look at some of the other things

157
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:35,040
that we need the camera to do and maybe

158
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:38,639
clean them up so for example if you look

159
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,980
at this you probably can't quite feel it

160
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,279
on the

161
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,569
on the stream necessarily depending on

162
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,209
how you're watching this because again

163
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,680
the stream you know isn't a perfect

164
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:51,319
replication of what the players act

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,490
going to see it goes through an MPEG

166
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,139
encoder and decoder and there's some

167
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,329
loss there and you know who knows the

168
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,029
frame rates not 60 I think I stream it

169
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:02,099
like 30 so you guys don't quite see the

170
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:03,299
full 60 frames a second feed and you

171
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,310
don't really need to write we're not

172
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:10,829
this isn't an action gaming stream it's

173
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:13,290
a development stream so that's fine but

174
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:17,099
the point is simply that if you look at

175
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:19,140
what's going on native so what I can see

176
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,180
on a 60 frames a second display and I

177
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,709
think we are running at 60 frames a

178
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,300
second here let me see where's our

179
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:29,129
profile counter stuff here so yeah we

180
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,329
are running at 60 frames a second locked

181
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:35,370
more or less right now and so when you

182
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:37,829
look at it at 60 frames a second what

183
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:42,090
you can see is that when the character

184
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:44,550
hops along it's actually following the

185
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:47,189
character up and down with a certain

186
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,129
amount of that hop and so it's

187
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:53,279
constantly trying to get the exact

188
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:55,709
player location for the axes we tell it

189
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,419
to so if we tell it to do just why or

190
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,189
just X it's not gonna look at the other

191
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,290
axis it's not gonna try to track that

192
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:02,879
axis but it is gonna track the one that

193
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,220
we told it to and it's gonna track the

194
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,990
entirety of the editing motion so if

195
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,150
there's some enemy motion that involves

196
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,519
like hopping it's you're gonna get that

197
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:14,189
wobbling of the camera now you don't see

198
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,599
as much wobble in the camera as you do

199
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,699
in the character like the characters

200
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,400
doing a hop and the cameras only doing a

201
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,659
little bit of a damped motion that's

202
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,879
because the proportional derivative

203
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,360
controller again it's proportional to

204
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:30,629
how far off of correct it is at any

205
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,810
given time and so that's why you're not

206
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:36,059
seeing as bad of a wobble but it is

207
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:38,819
there and so one of the things that we

208
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:43,289
want to do I think here is make it so

209
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:46,440
that we don't generally we don't

210
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:48,990
consider small displacements of the

211
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,490
player to be essential for the camera to

212
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:55,740
track we only consider like large

213
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,519
displacements of the player you know

214
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:02,100
so I think generally what I would say is

215
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,519
there needs to kind of be some sort of

216
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,620
an understanding there about what is and

217
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,949
isn't supposed to be tracked by the

218
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,600
camera system other than that I think

219
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,190
the only thing we really need to do the

220
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,830
camera system is bulletproof it a little

221
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,170
bit against large frame time Delta's so

222
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,660
we want to probably cap the speeds at

223
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:23,789
which the camera might consider changes

224
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:26,339
and the other thing I think we want to

225
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:28,439
do is we would like to make it so that

226
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,960
we have a debug camera again because we

227
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,520
don't currently have a debug camera

228
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,590
right now we actually don't we don't

229
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,860
have any way to look at anything other

230
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,120
than the actual game camera if I switch

231
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,100
remember we've got we slide the right

232
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,769
mouse button will switch we have nothing

233
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,470
now we have no debug camera support

234
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,360
since we modified the camera so those

235
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,399
are some things that we want to get done

236
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,110
I think we could try to shoot for all of

237
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,340
them today because they're not that

238
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,019
complicated

239
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,460
really but some of them are a little

240
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,129
tweaky and weird so I think that's what

241
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,070
we should focus on today and then I

242
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:07,500
think after that we can maybe move on to

243
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,089
something non camera related you'll

244
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,429
notice do we get some interesting things

245
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,310
here we've got an invalid code path here

246
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:20,299
that looks like again we're having some

247
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:22,259
kind of a of an entity count overflow

248
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:24,719
and one of the things that's interesting

249
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:28,200
about that is the entity count appears

250
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,600
to be set to 4096 even though I upped it

251
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,410
to 81 92 because we know we've got porn

252
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,330
movies now um that max enemy count you

253
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,759
know in the future we might be able to

254
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,360
say more specifically that we don't want

255
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,769
a max entity count at all we could

256
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,440
actually say look we'll just handle as

257
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:48,750
many entities as as can fit in memory or

258
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,150
whatever there are gonna be hard bounce

259
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,269
on it because obviously there's you know

260
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:56,399
there's issues with respect to how

261
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:58,289
that's gonna work is this is it just me

262
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:03,360
or is this text a lot smaller than it

263
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:06,120
normally is would you guys say I feel

264
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,110
like this text is really pretty tiny do

265
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,710
you think that's because we didn't

266
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,570
reboot as far as

267
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,250
scaling is concerned or something like

268
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:18,810
that do you want to do a quick reboot

269
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:18,809
let's do a quick reboot let me see here

270
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:24,539
restart

271
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,949
let me restart and get the this

272
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,539
you

273
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:58,729
all right I just want to make sure that

274
00:11:48,019 --> 00:12:05,778
we're not and we can also poops let's

275
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:09,289
see here okay yeah see that's I think

276
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:11,208
the scaling was wrong because we hadn't

277
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:13,730
rebooted that's that's what I think we

278
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:16,219
know it's normally I would have a higher

279
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,310
res monitor and a higher a smaller font

280
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,600
so I could have probably used that but I

281
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,659
think this is what it normally is on

282
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,810
stream just to make sure that everyone

283
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,949
can see it okay so is that I think for

284
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:29,719
those of you who are used to watching

285
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,899
the series does that look more like what

286
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,490
it should look like because I feel like

287
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:36,440
what was happening there was it was it

288
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,940
was getting an incorrect scaling factor

289
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,890
apply that I just want to make sure but

290
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,839
that that looks more like what I spent

291
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:44,689
because usually on hammy hero the font

292
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,529
is much much bigger than it would

293
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,850
normally be look like that it would

294
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:51,950
normally be when if you were actually

295
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,560
programming because of the limitations

296
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,810
of streaming you know and the motion

297
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,969
compression and and all of that but that

298
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,619
that looks like the right size to me so

299
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,620
I'm gonna say that that's about right

300
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:07,310
unless anyone has any objections so

301
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:10,159
let's see yeah okay so let's let's

302
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:19,729
recalibrate here also I should restart

303
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:29,389
the timer there we go

304
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:33,259
what was today five of four type of five

305
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:35,480
maybe let's find out sorry for the delay

306
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:37,129
this always happens when you change when

307
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,800
your setup changes at all because

308
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:44,529
everything's so darn finicky let's take

309
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:53,679
a look here

310
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:56,289
yeah 505 good yeah say 505 what is

311
00:13:53,679 --> 00:14:00,939
YouTube beta have for the last video

312
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:03,159
that was updated yeah 504 okay good so

313
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,790
everything's back to normal now and let

314
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:08,799
me just set this to start what do we

315
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:12,909
start at 115 I think is when we started

316
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:17,500
this session oops

317
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:20,110
alright 505 everything's good alright so

318
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:24,970
back to our program what I was trying to

319
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:26,889
say before was just that we want to kind

320
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,180
of go in there and change from that

321
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:30,490
stuff up so I'm just trying to get

322
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,899
everything yeah just trying to as we go

323
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,320
through and make sure that there's

324
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:37,179
nothing particularly weird in going on

325
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,250
here I'm gonna change the contrast on

326
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:46,299
this monitor a little bit too there we

327
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:49,690
go all right all right looking good so

328
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:53,289
let's see if we take a look inside the

329
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:57,270
entity code I was about to say why is it

330
00:14:53,289 --> 00:15:00,699
using 4096 sorry sim region rather

331
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:02,079
because I don't really know why it was

332
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,120
doing that and you could see in here we

333
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,350
kind of just have some constants for how

334
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,690
many of each of these things were gonna

335
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:14,250
have I'm gonna say that the entity hash

336
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:17,020
here just looking at how this was going

337
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,379
it looks like that I don't know why we

338
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,069
have this working this way that was fine

339
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:24,850
actually

340
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,410
the way that that works so this is

341
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:31,990
actually what controls how many we have

342
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:33,490
and it gets pushed on dynamically so we

343
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,259
can actually change the number of these

344
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,690
that we have at any given time pretty

345
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:40,689
easily right and we don't really have to

346
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,970
worry too much about that but looking

347
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,380
you know we may want the hash tables to

348
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,790
be a bit bigger so there's no hunting

349
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:47,200
through them that's the only reason I

350
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:49,000
was saying you know maybe so maybe this

351
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,280
does make sense because you don't really

352
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,659
want there to be a lot of collisions in

353
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,039
the hash you want there to be some empty

354
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,750
space in it so that you're not all

355
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,099
everyone stepping on top of each other

356
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,948
but again that's all stuff we can tune

357
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,300
little bit later so I'm gonna again

358
00:16:00,948 --> 00:16:04,008
focus on the camera today then because

359
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:05,389
I'd like to get that into a stable place

360
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:07,370
where we don't really have to think

361
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:09,948
about it much till maybe much further

362
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,480
into the development process and the

363
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:12,740
other thing that we do have that we

364
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,889
might want to create and I could do one

365
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,230
of those now is when we interact with a

366
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:20,240
character like let's say here if we end

367
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,259
up interacting with one of these orphans

368
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,549
or whatever because we're gonna go

369
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:25,459
through and create some of that stuff

370
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:28,008
and we're gonna do a bunch of gameplay

371
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:29,119
related stuff soon and so we kind of

372
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:32,180
have to start thinking about how all

373
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,250
that stuff's gonna play out I want to be

374
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,120
able to have it too so that if there's

375
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,860
an interaction

376
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,470
maybe it's oom Zin on the interaction a

377
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,180
little bit too and we added support for

378
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,980
that there's sort of this notion of

379
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:48,349
camera special camera regions involved

380
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,839
and you can see inside the entity struct

381
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:54,079
there's like different things here where

382
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,449
you kind of get like the camera

383
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,739
behaviors for entities are you know

384
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:00,109
there's they're sort of like this notion

385
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:04,400
of special camera information that

386
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:06,650
happens and inside the entity code I'm

387
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,589
sorry inside the sim region code where

388
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,538
we do the update camera for entity

389
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:13,788
movement one of the things you can see

390
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:18,429
here is when it goes through and looks

391
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:23,000
at sort of what kind of stuff is being

392
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:24,380
what kind of enclosures the user is on

393
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,349
right what's kind of enclosures the

394
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,450
player is on you can see here that

395
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,668
there's a notion of a special camera in

396
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,950
addition to an inn room so you can kind

397
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:35,450
of see that like to where when we go

398
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,759
through the entities and look at which

399
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,440
ones we overlap with you can see that

400
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,298
there's room entities that we could

401
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,700
overlap with and those room entities are

402
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:45,650
things that we will then use but in

403
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,259
addition to that we also have this

404
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,210
notion that different other kinds of

405
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:52,279
entities that we might be interested in

406
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,679
can also have camera behaviors

407
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,109
associated with them and those camera

408
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,780
behaviors can be things that we maybe

409
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:02,000
like like that say to zoom in or

410
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:05,569
whatever so we may want to you know

411
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,308
create one of those where we so we can

412
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:10,700
test to make sure that that's working

413
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:11,509
properly and so we can see whether or

414
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,039
not

415
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:14,960
sorts of things still work because we

416
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,119
would like those sorts of things to work

417
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,680
so I want to put in one of those and if

418
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,259
you look you can see the special camera

419
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,090
there's like some stuff here where we

420
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:24,559
say like oh you know there there's an

421
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:27,470
inspect and stuff like that

422
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,809
then possibly an offset and so those can

423
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,890
set these target Z's to different values

424
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,500
and they would have been set to you can

425
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,150
see it normally sets one here right and

426
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,910
we've got other things here that we're

427
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,580
doing that set those up one of these you

428
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:44,630
can see is the new target P gets set to

429
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:46,970
the simulation center and we do some

430
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,770
things here to change that right you can

431
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,569
see the camera erna stuff we want to

432
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:52,099
make sure this code flows correctly it

433
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:54,679
probably doesn't flow correct anymore we

434
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:56,149
want to make sure that's correct so

435
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,799
let's go ahead and just read through

436
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,970
that and make sure that's going properly

437
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,289
and then we'll go create one of these

438
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,120
entities and make sure that works too

439
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:04,430
that way we can sort of verify like all

440
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,719
the camera code and kind of hammer on

441
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,610
that a little bit more today just make

442
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,200
sure that's working right so you can see

443
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:11,179
in here once we know which room were in

444
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,309
we're gonna say that there's a volume of

445
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,080
that room and here it is right

446
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:17,389
the you know the collision volume part

447
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,799
of this and we've got this notion of the

448
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,480
simulation center which is what we're

449
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,769
going to simulate around that just gets

450
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,259
set to the center of the room and that's

451
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:26,029
fine right so then in here we sort of

452
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:27,680
set the new target P the simulation

453
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:29,930
center but you know if you look at kind

454
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:34,519
of what happens there it's a little

455
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:37,850
nonsensical really to be honest so yeah

456
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:40,009
you can it's a little bit dumb but it's

457
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:42,199
fine so if you see what's going on here

458
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:44,180
what we say is look let's default to

459
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,069
setting it to the simulation center and

460
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,930
then later we'll do some stuff with the

461
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:50,210
camera arm and stuff like that right I

462
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:53,000
don't really think that's how we want to

463
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:56,090
necessarily do this I think what we want

464
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,650
to do instead is say look the simulation

465
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:59,449
center is always something that we're

466
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,650
gonna set so you can see us doing this

467
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,730
here right we're gonna set the

468
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,600
simulation center and that's

469
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,099
non-negotiable

470
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:06,259
because the simulation center always

471
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:08,779
takes place around the room rooms are

472
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:11,420
sort of our fundamental semantic concept

473
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:13,519
in handmade hyrum and so we want the

474
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,730
player to also be kind of under the

475
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,619
expectation that the game generally is

476
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,180
aware of what room you're in and there's

477
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:21,949
things that happen based on the room

478
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,779
you're in right so you know if you're

479
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,799
inside a cursed room and you can't use a

480
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:26,420
certain magical

481
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,649
or something like that the player

482
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,300
understands that and the game

483
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,610
understands that and so we generally

484
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:33,740
want the concept of the simulation to

485
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:37,009
just be about the room and that's just

486
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,140
how like so this is all just you know a

487
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:40,819
given and it's not gonna matter whether

488
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,400
we're focusing on a particular part of a

489
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:45,859
room or not that that part is sort of

490
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,690
non-negotiable so then we get to the

491
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:49,279
part where were like okay we've got

492
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,630
where do we want to actually look at

493
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,389
with the camera because remember we can

494
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,040
simulate a round of the room but maybe

495
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,090
we're focusing on one part of the room

496
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,980
so those are not necessary the same

497
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,929
thing so we start out by saying well

498
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,980
let's pretend that we are gonna focus on

499
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,170
the center of the room which is the

500
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,059
simulation center and let's pretend that

501
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,710
we're gonna focus on the target offset Z

502
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:09,619
and that's all gonna be fine or whatever

503
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:13,610
right and so that's what we're gonna do

504
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:15,199
here right and let's let's sort of feed

505
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:17,119
for it from there the other thing I want

506
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,360
to do is take a look at how the special

507
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:23,719
camera stuff is working here when we

508
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:25,369
look at the camera behavior okay so one

509
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,680
of the things we also see here is that

510
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:33,619
you know the special camera information

511
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,990
so special camera can be related to the

512
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:38,449
room or it can be related to an entity

513
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,970
so if you look at what happens here room

514
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,630
always gets set by whatever the room is

515
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:46,430
that you're in but the test entity may

516
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,050
have camera behavior and that camera

517
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,230
behavior can get specified whether

518
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:53,029
you're in the room or not now this means

519
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,779
that there's some stuff that we have to

520
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:58,789
do here that we want to make sure we do

521
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:01,490
correctly and right now we're not really

522
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:03,950
doing it correctly so what you can see

523
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,069
is you can see us setting the special

524
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:10,250
camera and we're sending the special

525
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:12,230
camera based on whether or not we had a

526
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,390
room with a special camera or any other

527
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,910
entity with a key special camera that's

528
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:20,570
not really what we want to do because

529
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:23,600
the room itself may overlap the entity

530
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:26,659
as well as a special part of the room

531
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:29,839
may overlap nd so we don't want the room

532
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,820
to override a special camera if there is

533
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,709
one we only want to use the special

534
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:35,629
camera information from the room if

535
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,860
there isn't another special camera

536
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,700
information

537
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:42,740
that we see elsewhere right so what we

538
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,819
want to do here is is almost like an

539
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:49,130
else clause right I think so we want to

540
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:52,428
do some stuff here that that we want to

541
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,460
kind of move this stuff we want to move

542
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,530
how this logics being done and we want

543
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,319
to make sure that the room won't

544
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:02,269
override another special camera so the

545
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,519
easiest way to do this probably is to

546
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:07,730
say look if there's testimony camera

547
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:10,460
behavior on here then when we go into

548
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,599
this loop and we see you know we're

549
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,630
gonna do some stuff to see if this

550
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:18,379
passes if it does pass we want to do a

551
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:22,059
check in here to say look if this is a

552
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:26,840
room right so if you know test entity

553
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:28,369
equals in room or maybe better way to

554
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:33,289
say it would be if it doesn't equal in

555
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:35,629
room right so this is some more specific

556
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:38,000
region of the room we're specifying if

557
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:41,030
it's not equal to in room then okay we

558
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,650
can apply this camera logic just fine

559
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:48,619
right however if it is the in room then

560
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:54,340
we only want to do it we only want to

561
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:56,959
override it if this thing doesn't have

562
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:59,329
if there wasn't already a special camera

563
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,759
so if there wasn't a special camera

564
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:04,668
we'll take it otherwise it it better not

565
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:09,259
be the room now we may want to make this

566
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:11,630
even more specific than that you could

567
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:14,539
imagine circumstances where we actually

568
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,610
have many different camera regions

569
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:19,308
overlapping and we wanted to merge their

570
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:21,379
behaviors together I'd rather wait till

571
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:22,849
we actually have that situation because

572
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,890
I don't have any way to test that right

573
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:26,928
now and so I don't really want

574
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,970
necessarily write code that tries to

575
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:30,769
figure out what you mean if you have

576
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,029
overlapping camera regions you know did

577
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,440
you want to apply both of them or only

578
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:35,779
one of them you know what were you

579
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,900
trying to do and so I'm not really going

580
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:42,109
to get into that right now but I would

581
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:44,090
like to make it so that it works for the

582
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:46,069
for the region inside room case

583
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:49,759
regardless of which order the entities

584
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:51,619
come in so we're gonna do that like this

585
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,359
all right so once we get into the

586
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:56,179
special camera information here and you

587
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,250
can see us specifying that stuff here

588
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,740
what I do want to do is then make sure

589
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:03,619
that this works properly so if you look

590
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,759
here we can update the target axes which

591
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:07,009
is something that we've already tested

592
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:09,319
when the room that self is setting that

593
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:11,420
value but then we also have a thing when

594
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:13,159
there if there's an offset you can see

595
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,900
us saying here like okay what are we

596
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,150
gonna do there and what you can see is

597
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,580
we're taking the X Y and we're changing

598
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:23,720
the camera offset using that X Y I don't

599
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:27,349
like that what I would rather do is I

600
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,950
would rather have that offset for the

601
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:33,500
camera actually be based more on the

602
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:38,000
location of the entity itself which

603
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:40,640
right now it wouldn't be right so right

604
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,829
now that camera offset X Y would be

605
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,009
relative and I don't really want it to

606
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:48,799
be relative if that makes sense so

607
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:50,029
looking in here and there's a couple of

608
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,799
the ways we can write that we could

609
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:54,259
write it as an offset relative to the

610
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:57,649
player as well so I don't know how we

611
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:59,680
want to do that but do you think um

612
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,780
there's a lot of ways you could do this

613
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:07,269
and I think the right way is to say

614
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:11,509
let's make it relative to that to the

615
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:14,059
actual entity the actual enclosure that

616
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:15,650
you've specified for the camera behavior

617
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,029
so when you create the entity that's

618
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,009
like got the bounds that says when

619
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:20,720
you're inside these boundaries use this

620
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:22,789
special camera let's make it relative to

621
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,710
that so in order to do that we don't

622
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,480
want to do simulation center here right

623
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,840
what we want to do is take the test

624
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,630
entity's actual location in X Y which it

625
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,909
has and then we want to add the camera

626
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:38,060
offset X Y so in other words you can

627
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,980
still create an offset if you want but

628
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:40,970
we're gonna start at least in the middle

629
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,860
of that thing because that's probably

630
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,539
where you wanted it generally speaking

631
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:46,309
and if you want to move it one or the

632
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:48,589
other you can do that but will you know

633
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,539
that that sort of an additional thing so

634
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:53,809
we want a cold set that and make that

635
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:55,970
just work and whether or not we want the

636
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:58,549
Z to be based off that based off of that

637
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,900
I couldn't really tell you that's

638
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:03,440
something we're gonna have to think

639
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:06,830
about a little bit more but I suspect we

640
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:15,710
once and after that it's pretty hard to

641
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:18,470
say I don't know yeah I don't know so

642
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,720
the target offset Z should definitely be

643
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,788
this Z cuz that's the one that says kind

644
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,950
of how far you want the camera way what

645
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:27,259
I'm debating is saying okay the new

646
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,538
target P Z rather than being the

647
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:33,230
simulation center that might want to be

648
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:35,480
this so you know I think maybe another

649
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:38,690
way to write this right would be to say

650
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,490
let's maybe just say this so look we're

651
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,259
gonna target whatever this test entity

652
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,288
is that's where where the center is now

653
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:47,480
and then we're gonna take the offset in

654
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:50,028
X Y and we're just gonna apply that on

655
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,769
to the XY as it is placement if you

656
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:53,690
wanted to shift it around most of time

657
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:56,450
they'll be set to zero and then we'll

658
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:58,070
use that Z for the target offset and

659
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:00,169
that's just saying how far you want the

660
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:03,288
camera to be pulled back then when we

661
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:05,538
come through here we've either set the

662
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:07,788
new target P up to be focusing on that

663
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:09,138
candy or we've set it up to be focusing

664
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:10,839
on the room center one of the other

665
00:28:09,138 --> 00:28:13,788
that's you know totally fine either way

666
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:16,369
and then what we'll do is we'll say okay

667
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:19,009
now we've got and remember if this was

668
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:20,268
the room then it'll just do it should in

669
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:23,120
theory just do exactly the same thing

670
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:24,620
although maybe not so no but but you

671
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,678
wouldn't have this flag set four rooms

672
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:31,128
either so that's fine so it's probably

673
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,110
all good so I think all that makes sense

674
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:36,288
I think all that would be fine

675
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:39,168
and and then when we get down here you'd

676
00:28:36,288 --> 00:28:41,569
still create the camera arm which is off

677
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:44,028
of whatever the angle the cameras being

678
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:47,058
set at at the time so I think this all

679
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:50,119
works correctly and there and it should

680
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:52,700
just flow through here and be done in

681
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:54,439
line with everything else so that means

682
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,778
now we have to actually create one of

683
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,808
these like we've got to put a thing into

684
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:02,839
the world somewhere that we can use as a

685
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:05,119
test and we probably want to make some

686
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,339
way of actually seeing as well so we

687
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,048
might want to have some entity bounds in

688
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:10,480
there or something or like some way to

689
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:13,660
visualize camera bounds

690
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,860
I don't know we'll see so probably to do

691
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,480
something like that just to make sure we

692
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:19,089
even have one because we don't really

693
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,370
know otherwise what those would be so

694
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:23,409
anyway test entity is the wrong thing

695
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:27,119
it's special camera I don't know why I

696
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:30,880
said test entity that's what I wanted so

697
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,619
I think that's all good and now we just

698
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:37,990
need to make one of them so when we're

699
00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:39,699
inside the the generation code we need

700
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,440
to put one of those entities in there so

701
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,789
that we know like what that square

702
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:50,140
actually means and so how to do that is

703
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:52,240
probably a little confusing just trying

704
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:57,250
to think about how this would go exactly

705
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,779
so inside room Jen and we've also done

706
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,940
it we're gonna have to look inside

707
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:03,099
worlds in here we have these notions of

708
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,559
placement options right and an option is

709
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:07,119
saying look here's a room that this

710
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:09,549
thing can be placed in you know what I

711
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,559
mean and so if you remember how this was

712
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,809
going inside world Jen we did stuff like

713
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,639
oh well there's different rooms that

714
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:19,899
different orphans can be in or just

715
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:22,840
orphans in general and we have a table

716
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,250
called like look here's where orphans

717
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:26,649
can go and here's where our cats can go

718
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,269
and we haven't really you know looked at

719
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,910
this in too much detail but that's sort

720
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:33,430
of what's going to go go on here and so

721
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:37,000
when we've got this Jen option orphan

722
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:39,009
when when we're inside the room Jen or I

723
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,920
guess I should say when we're inside the

724
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:43,299
the place cat or place orphan thing you

725
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,920
can see us iterating over the options

726
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,659
here and then we say like oh here's the

727
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,980
room and then you can see in here we'll

728
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,590
just say like oh we're gonna place one

729
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,230
of these entities in this room and

730
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:55,389
that's really all that happens the room

731
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,610
gencode then just kind of has to stick

732
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:01,450
one of these things in there

733
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:05,169
and you can see you know where it

734
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:09,160
actually does this where's the placement

735
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:11,860
stuff here it is so you can see here it

736
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,660
says I want to create one of these

737
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:16,750
entities that you told me to place here

738
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:20,290
and I'm gonna tag it up and then move on

739
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:23,079
to the next one you can see in here that

740
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:24,849
each one just takes up one of the spaces

741
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:28,750
on which you can

742
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:31,449
stand right so what we would need to do

743
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:33,160
here is create when you know when we're

744
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,350
placing down a footprint for one of

745
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,670
these things we kind of want to now say

746
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:39,159
look we've got to be able to place

747
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:42,430
things that have a footprint of like two

748
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,160
things right or you know three things or

749
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:48,880
whatever and we're gonna have to do a

750
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:51,820
lot more we're gonna have to do like a

751
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,040
lot more stuff to make sure that our

752
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:56,579
random generation makes sense for

753
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,690
example if you look inside the game here

754
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:00,279
we're gonna have to do things like make

755
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,799
sure exits aren't blocked and things

756
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,119
like that right so when we look at

757
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,460
what's actually going on in there we

758
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:08,769
have to have some way of making sure

759
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,960
that we don't place things in ways that

760
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:13,150
make rooms impossible to play or things

761
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,769
like this so we're gonna need more of

762
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,890
that later but for now we can probably

763
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:20,220
start by just doing a little bit of work

764
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:22,960
to make something that allows us to do

765
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,460
sort of quick and dirty placement of

766
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,059
things in a way that makes a little bit

767
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,740
more sense than what we have right now

768
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:32,139
so for example what I could do here is

769
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,539
say well when we're actually going in

770
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:37,780
here and doing like the generate room

771
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:39,579
call for example let's reintroduce the

772
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:45,279
notion that we had before which is that

773
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:47,649
we could have a like a a grid that we

774
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,599
keep track of locally that lets us know

775
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,490
where we've placed things and where we

776
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,919
haven't placed things so that we can get

777
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,230
it better a quicker way of like looking

778
00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:00,160
up where what we've done and how we

779
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:02,440
might want things to happen right and so

780
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,750
if we go ahead and do that let's say I

781
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,750
create a thing that's like a struct here

782
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:10,029
which is like a room grid right and

783
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:13,000
inside the room grid we know we're gonna

784
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:14,859
have a like an X dimension and a Y

785
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,059
dimension so we're gonna have like X

786
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:22,479
count Y count and then we're gonna have

787
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:22,960
a like gen room you know tile or

788
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,019
something like that

789
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,019
[Music]

790
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:33,290
and this will let us create little local

791
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:35,659
grids of the area that we can look at

792
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:38,659
and do things with so we can see like

793
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:41,029
okay let's create a local tile set for

794
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,680
this thing this will allow us to quickly

795
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:44,599
do things like look where we want to

796
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,920
place things and search in them so that

797
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:47,449
we don't have to keep doing what we're

798
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,279
doing here so you can see the way I

799
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,299
wrote this code cuz we just kind of

800
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,889
hacked it in there because we wanted

801
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:53,599
stuff to work and we weren't working on

802
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:56,360
this code yet we do things like

803
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,519
basically saying okay loop over the grid

804
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:00,829
once so we are effectively looping over

805
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:03,769
the grid and just choose one thing to do

806
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:06,079
for every spot on the grid that avoids

807
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:09,168
us ever having to store what we did

808
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:13,519
right it doesn't make you know any any

809
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:14,989
difference really and so we we you know

810
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,699
it's one way to quickly write this

811
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,928
routine but now that we want to really

812
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:19,908
generate things that are actually

813
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:21,230
playable and more interesting we'd much

814
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:24,079
rather have a way of doing multiple

815
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:26,240
passes on that right so we can place

816
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,159
things search asked questions like can I

817
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,949
get from here to here and if not that's

818
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,360
a problem right things like that we

819
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:36,739
really want to be able to specify this

820
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:39,378
more specifically and so you know maybe

821
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:42,829
we just for now have a b32 that says is

822
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:46,069
this slot open right like can you place

823
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:47,779
something on it is it reversible and

824
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:51,289
like it can either be set to true or

825
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:54,590
false if it is or isn't right and so

826
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:58,159
that's more like what we want to do here

827
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,700
and then we can kind of get you know

828
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,359
more--

829
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:04,159
into it a little bit later we can this

830
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,900
can become a very complicated structure

831
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:09,440
that's tons of information about the

832
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:11,920
tile as we sort of go further on and and

833
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,980
and you know make a little bit more

834
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,630
specificity about that so in here we're

835
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,699
gonna want a way to initialize these and

836
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,380
then ask questions so what do they do is

837
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:22,579
I'm gonna fall back to snuffleupagus

838
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,440
oriented programming because I think

839
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:26,389
that'll work pretty well here where we

840
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,670
basically just say look let's pretend we

841
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:30,889
already had a library or a system in

842
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:33,500
place that does what we want to do let's

843
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:37,460
make calls as if it could just do those

844
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,440
things and then we'll go implement that

845
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,789
library basically right it's like

846
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,849
pretend you add the library

847
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:45,889
you wanted use it and then go implement

848
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:48,259
that library that helps us understand

849
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:50,659
what we actually want to create here and

850
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,670
so what I'm gonna do first is I'm gonna

851
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:55,099
pull out this code and we're not gonna

852
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,349
do it this way anymore so before we were

853
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:59,000
doing a bunch of ifs here and then we're

854
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:00,409
placing these entities what I'm gonna do

855
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,809
is I'm gonna make that happen in a

856
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:05,029
separate pass so that like I said we can

857
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:06,650
look for areas where there's places next

858
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,350
to each other that are accessible and so

859
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,599
on right and so what I want to do is go

860
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:13,789
ahead and have like a for loop here

861
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,429
where we loop over all of the entities

862
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:18,139
that are available and so rather than

863
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,579
setting this thing because you can see

864
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:22,909
here we got this notion of a pending

865
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:26,779
entity when we come into this routine we

866
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:28,339
have already in the pipe we say here's

867
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,280
this room here's all the entities that

868
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,019
the world generator said this is what we

869
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,250
want in this room so what we're gonna do

870
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:36,530
is we're just gonna look at that list

871
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,650
and here's that list right we have the

872
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,190
room specification well it's not through

873
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,930
fuzzification

874
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:44,389
that's a different thing we have the

875
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:47,149
room's placement list this is the first

876
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:50,869
entity let's just go over all of those

877
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:53,240
entities now and place each one of them

878
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:55,909
according to the rules of placement for

879
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:58,879
that entity right so that makes this a

880
00:36:55,909 --> 00:37:02,929
lot clearer - now we can stop doing

881
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,030
these things as well so these have more

882
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:08,239
to do with finding particular cells in

883
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:10,970
the grid that are useful for this value

884
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,669
right useful for this placement that

885
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:16,159
we're trying to do and that's really

886
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:19,070
more what we're going for so here we're

887
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,199
gonna place the entity into a location

888
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,180
and then we're gonna apply the tags that

889
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,460
is exactly the same as it was going to

890
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:28,039
be before and so all we're gonna do now

891
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:31,670
is we're really just trying to look this

892
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:36,920
up right we're trying to get where this

893
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:38,990
pending entity should be placed on like

894
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,680
which entity it's standing on like the

895
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:41,679
floor right

896
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:50,500
like that right and so what we want is

897
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:53,260
we want a way to say look get us some

898
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:57,579
some information about what floor tile

899
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:58,630
we're standing on so that we can so that

900
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:01,179
we can work with that

901
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:03,490
right now right off the bat remember I

902
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:04,839
said you know the reason that we want to

903
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,639
start looking at this in more detail is

904
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,220
sometimes we want to place things that

905
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:11,289
take up more than one tile so I don't

906
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:12,699
really want it to look like this right

907
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,929
and this is the snuffleupagus or a

908
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:15,639
deprotonated pot we're gonna we're

909
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:16,839
looking at the usage code first which is

910
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,949
a great place to start here because

911
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:24,070
it'll help us understand what we

912
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:25,899
actually need if I type this right which

913
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,539
is what I might normally type you know I

914
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:32,170
place I send the room grid down I say

915
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:34,779
hey right find a place to put this

916
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:37,269
entity in in the grid well the problem

917
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:39,070
with that is you can see right away I'm

918
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:41,650
only gonna get back one entity but I

919
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,050
just said I may want to entities I may

920
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,750
want to place two different things down

921
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:50,019
into this area and so that doesn't

922
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:52,719
really help me right I needed more than

923
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:54,190
that I needed more I needed to have

924
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,399
something here that was gonna tell me

925
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:58,510
stuff like how do I get entity with

926
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,190
another thing next to it either

927
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,250
vertically or laterally or something

928
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:06,360
like this right so I think what I want

929
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:08,650
to do here is have a way of saying

930
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:12,010
what's gonna come back is going to be

931
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:14,980
more complicated than this right and so

932
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:16,960
I don't actually know offhand exactly

933
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:23,769
how I want to do this but it would is

934
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:29,800
probably something like this right

935
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:32,800
give me back this thing where I say fine

936
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,750
place to put entity and it's gonna take

937
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,490
the grid and I'm gonna say something

938
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:42,969
like I want you know a place to put an

939
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:46,719
entity with a place underneath it that's

940
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:50,529
like traversable or whatever right and

941
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:54,389
so the query will come back with some

942
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:56,710
information here probably something like

943
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:58,359
men

944
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:02,559
well you know what I think we already

945
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:06,820
have and I constantly this this Jen

946
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:10,059
volume is exactly what we want so you

947
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:12,580
know this would tell us the region in

948
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:16,269
which that would go and you know I might

949
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:23,710
I don't know but I maybe could just do

950
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:25,659
this right it's hard to say I'm gonna

951
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,760
leave it like this for now and the

952
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:29,139
reason I'm going to leave it like that

953
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,810
is because I think we're gonna probably

954
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:40,449
want Jimmy I think we're probably gonna

955
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:44,279
want other information about what

956
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:46,989
happened and you'll see that in a second

957
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:52,120
so let's suppose we have one of these

958
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:53,979
queries when we ask I'm gonna ask for

959
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:58,539
different kinds of things and maybe we

960
00:40:53,980 --> 00:41:01,750
get back something like this so this way

961
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:03,429
I can say look you know find one of

962
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,780
these and if you didn't find one I need

963
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:08,109
to take a days of action or whatever

964
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:10,000
right something like that uh so right

965
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,800
now I could do something like this where

966
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,619
I say assert that the thing that we got

967
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,900
back worked right and maybe I could just

968
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:19,299
use is valid here there could be like a

969
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,789
thing that says does the actual volume

970
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,440
exist but again I just think I might

971
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:26,889
want more information to ride on this

972
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,920
thing like for example maybe these

973
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:31,480
things you know when I when I specify

974
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,860
that region I might want to say and I'm

975
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,659
gonna place in any in one of them but

976
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,710
not in the other things like that and I

977
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,239
would need to know which one is the

978
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,440
place in so you know I just think

979
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,789
there's gonna probably be more

980
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,940
information coming back from that so

981
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:46,000
let's say I you know issue this query I

982
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,579
get this thing back and so then I may

983
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,940
want to do placement that that works

984
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:53,710
across you know multiple things so when

985
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,289
I'm doing one of these pending entities

986
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:59,470
here what I want to do in the world Jen

987
00:41:56,289 --> 00:42:02,349
is say well when I have one of those

988
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:06,989
pending entities and I think those are

989
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:15,328
specified in here aren't

990
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:15,328
I'm not seeing it the gin room

991
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:31,960
Chen entity okay so I guess we put it in

992
00:42:24,338 --> 00:42:33,578
here so yeah you can actually see this

993
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,289
working in here so there's the genitive

994
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:38,109
II next and then there's just the the

995
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:40,230
creator and here's the tags right so

996
00:42:38,108 --> 00:42:42,909
when replacing one of these entities

997
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:46,000
what I wanted to do there was say well

998
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:48,639
we also want to have potentially a way

999
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,469
of saying that this entity has other

1000
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,328
entities that need to be placed next to

1001
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:54,098
it or things like that right because

1002
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:55,089
when you place one of these like let's

1003
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:56,890
say you're gonna place one of these

1004
00:42:55,088 --> 00:43:01,358
orphans or maybe there's other things

1005
00:42:56,889 --> 00:43:04,058
like you're gonna place like a a sign

1006
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,920
that the player can read well when they

1007
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:07,210
hop next to the sign there's like a

1008
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,010
square next to the sign that you

1009
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,720
actually hop on but that is the thing

1010
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,490
that says you can read the sign from

1011
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,828
there you know there's stuff like that

1012
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:16,209
and while you know while there's other

1013
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:18,068
ways we could implement that there's

1014
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,358
ways we could go oh we'll look to see if

1015
00:43:18,068 --> 00:43:23,139
the player is standing next to a sign

1016
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:27,519
implement that way I don't know that I

1017
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:30,808
want it that way because for example I

1018
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:34,838
may want you to hop on two different

1019
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:39,760
squares to say things like yes or no or

1020
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:41,828
pick this or that and you know it's it's

1021
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,520
more logical to make the squares

1022
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:47,470
themselves hold that information I think

1023
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:49,298
so it's just it's it's a tricky

1024
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:50,889
situation and I don't know which one

1025
00:43:49,298 --> 00:43:52,659
will end up using in the actual game but

1026
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:54,699
I want to support that because I want to

1027
00:43:52,659 --> 00:43:56,558
try that and if it turns out that we

1028
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:59,259
don't use it we can always delete the

1029
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:02,260
code later so again you know I I don't

1030
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:05,230
really know which one I want and that's

1031
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:07,480
the point I'm gonna explore and I will

1032
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:10,690
settle on one when I'm done but I don't

1033
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:13,719
want to pick a priority because that's a

1034
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:16,838
sure way of creating something that you

1035
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:18,669
know is maybe suboptimal you haven't

1036
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:20,179
tried all the things so you don't know

1037
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,389
that you've done the right

1038
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:27,139
one so in here what I want to say is

1039
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:31,608
we've got a creator for this entity here

1040
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:34,368
and I want to like daisy chain these

1041
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:37,279
together so in addition to saying like

1042
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:40,220
the next one I want to say like there's

1043
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,349
a child entity basically like so you're

1044
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:44,209
gonna create this entity but then we're

1045
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:47,030
also going to like daisy-chain it to

1046
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:51,289
this other entity that's gonna come back

1047
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:54,710
right and I again don't actually know

1048
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:56,719
exactly how I might want that to work it

1049
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,599
may be that this Creator function wants

1050
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:01,730
to do that in a different way and these

1051
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,190
tags are really more that will get read

1052
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:06,650
out in a way that it's hard to say how

1053
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:10,880
we're gonna do this but we'll see so if

1054
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:14,150
there's a child situation then what

1055
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,769
we'll do is we'll we'll assume for now

1056
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:17,389
that what we're gonna do is place those

1057
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:19,789
two things next to each other right

1058
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:23,539
we're just gonna assume that and what I

1059
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:25,838
also want to do is inside the box math

1060
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:29,058
here we've got these sort of directional

1061
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:31,460
pieces of directional information so I

1062
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:34,040
also kind of want to say well okay if

1063
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:38,179
you were going to place a child right so

1064
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:41,150
you know essentially like this how is

1065
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:43,548
the child like related to you so if i if

1066
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:46,240
i had the place you here you know where

1067
00:45:43,548 --> 00:45:49,219
do i have to place the child you know

1068
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:51,588
going from where you are to like where

1069
00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:54,230
they are or something you know what I

1070
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:56,269
mean and that way I could say like okay

1071
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:58,010
I want you to place a dude here I want

1072
00:45:56,269 --> 00:46:00,980
the child to go you know here or

1073
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:03,710
whatever furthermore I can be even more

1074
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:08,869
Squinkie about that and actually say

1075
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:11,420
like that this is a mask right so you

1076
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:14,690
know you you see how we do it here where

1077
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:17,000
we have these box masks here we could

1078
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,338
say that there's you know placement

1079
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,179
rules that just say this is how you

1080
00:46:19,338 --> 00:46:25,009
place the entity you can you know the

1081
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:26,389
the square could be to the left or it

1082
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:29,119
could be to the right or you know north

1083
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:34,098
south east west whatever so we can have

1084
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:37,849
a flag 30 to here where we basically say

1085
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:41,509
this is a box surface mask that says the

1086
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:44,660
directions like a loud child Direction

1087
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:47,869
something like that or maybe just child

1088
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:49,940
directions so that's where this child

1089
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:51,798
could be placed relative to me and we

1090
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,619
just assume that we chased that whole

1091
00:46:51,798 --> 00:46:57,139
thing down when we do the creation

1092
00:46:54,619 --> 00:47:00,858
making sure that it's legal the whole

1093
00:46:57,139 --> 00:47:03,259
way furthermore while we're in here we

1094
00:47:00,858 --> 00:47:06,199
can also say whether or not this thing

1095
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:08,150
would take up a square meaning when we

1096
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:10,068
actually place it down does it actually

1097
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:12,139
need to stand on this thing or doesn't

1098
00:47:10,068 --> 00:47:14,630
it right and so there's kind of another

1099
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:18,199
piece of information here which is a gen

1100
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:23,960
entity flag which can say something like

1101
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:27,139
you know gen entity occupier or

1102
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,728
something like this and we can sack

1103
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:30,409
other flags in there but basically what

1104
00:47:28,728 --> 00:47:36,439
these are saying oh and we already have

1105
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:45,649
this Flags those are probably not the

1106
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:53,809
same lags though I guess I got ahead of

1107
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:55,639
myself before an entity just take a look

1108
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:59,710
at what we're setting those at Flags

1109
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:59,710
equals okay

1110
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,329
well you know what I have no idea who's

1111
00:48:03,978 --> 00:48:07,368
using this so we're just gonna do this

1112
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:10,910
and find out because I don't know who's

1113
00:48:07,369 --> 00:48:14,568
doing the flags so literally no one is

1114
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:16,759
using those flags like there is no one

1115
00:48:14,568 --> 00:48:19,759
who's actually like doing anything with

1116
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:23,088
those flags first I can tell let me

1117
00:48:19,759 --> 00:48:25,869
double-check that again no so so no one

1118
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:28,130
actually uses the flags at the moment

1119
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:31,700
which means I must have just put them in

1120
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:37,880
there somewhat provisionally I guess so

1121
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:39,468
I'm gonna add them now right so these

1122
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,789
are the JEM flags these are the flags

1123
00:48:39,469 --> 00:48:43,009
that are because you know we could add

1124
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:45,229
there's enemy flags as well you know

1125
00:48:43,009 --> 00:48:47,028
what I mean and so you know maybe those

1126
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:48,048
get set some other time but in here

1127
00:48:47,028 --> 00:48:50,239
we're talking about does

1128
00:48:48,048 --> 00:48:53,630
this thing go on an occupier look does

1129
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:57,170
this thing actually occupy a spot or

1130
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:59,838
doesn't it right and you know if it does

1131
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:02,329
occupy a spot then we know that when

1132
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:03,679
it's placed down no one can move through

1133
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:05,119
that square which is going to be

1134
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,769
important for us when we're reasoning

1135
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,778
about where we can and can't place

1136
00:49:06,768 --> 00:49:11,688
things so things that occupy a square

1137
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:14,838
they can't block doorways they can't

1138
00:49:11,688 --> 00:49:16,578
create like a solid bifurcation of the

1139
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:18,739
room such that no one could get from one

1140
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,369
side to the other there's a lot of stuff

1141
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:21,469
like that

1142
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:23,390
where it's like okay you know we need to

1143
00:49:21,469 --> 00:49:27,619
know when we play something what's it

1144
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:28,818
gonna do so when we have this gem flag

1145
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:30,979
in here that says whether it's going to

1146
00:49:28,818 --> 00:49:33,889
be an occupier then when we're actually

1147
00:49:30,978 --> 00:49:38,868
generating the room we can actually look

1148
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:40,909
here and see if we need to place it or

1149
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:42,349
not so in other words the traversable

1150
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:44,958
reference that the thing gets placed

1151
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:46,969
upon will not get set to anything if

1152
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:50,568
this thing is actually not going to

1153
00:49:46,969 --> 00:49:57,289
occupy that Square it will simply get

1154
00:49:50,568 --> 00:49:59,150
the position like the the it will get a

1155
00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:01,069
position that says this is where the

1156
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:02,929
thing goes in the world but it won't

1157
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:05,630
actually get a standing reference

1158
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:09,170
because it doesn't actually sit on the

1159
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:12,679
square in that way right so for example

1160
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:15,528
if there's just the invisible cage like

1161
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:19,099
for the special camera you know that

1162
00:50:15,528 --> 00:50:20,688
that would be sufficient for example so

1163
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,880
there's a couple of the things we need

1164
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:26,659
to be able to do here but but you know

1165
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,289
that's that's thing one so if the Jen

1166
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:31,068
Flags

1167
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:33,859
say that this thing is an occupier then

1168
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:35,599
you know it's gonna act by it I may

1169
00:50:33,858 --> 00:50:38,058
switch the meaning of this since most

1170
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,130
things that place on squares will occupy

1171
00:50:38,059 --> 00:50:44,390
them I'm thinking that what we probably

1172
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:45,858
want to do is like is not occupier so we

1173
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:49,449
probably want to do something more like

1174
00:50:45,858 --> 00:50:52,068
this where we just say okay you know

1175
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:54,289
does this thing occupy or not and you

1176
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:55,818
know we could do it this way because

1177
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:58,969
that way people don't have to set that

1178
00:50:55,818 --> 00:51:00,558
flag most of the time and we'll just

1179
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:02,659
reverse the meaning of it when we

1180
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,430
we pick it right and that's just an easy

1181
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:06,348
way to make clear to zero work which I

1182
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:08,858
like better zero should generally be the

1183
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:10,519
default and the more unusual

1184
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:13,458
circumstance should be the one where you

1185
00:51:10,518 --> 00:51:15,919
actually set something so in the

1186
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:17,659
occupier case we'll set this up the

1187
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,519
p-value for this we need to get from

1188
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:22,188
somewhere that may come out of the query

1189
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:23,629
itself as well and so that might be

1190
00:51:22,188 --> 00:51:26,688
another C there's another good reason

1191
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:29,749
why that should be happening there

1192
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:31,578
so again other other important reasons

1193
00:51:29,748 --> 00:51:34,429
why we want that to happen

1194
00:51:31,579 --> 00:51:38,089
ensue I'm trying to think of other stuff

1195
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:41,509
that I need to do here where we have

1196
00:51:38,088 --> 00:51:47,420
that grid query oops

1197
00:51:41,509 --> 00:51:51,108
Jen that would have a hmm I guess it's

1198
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:52,639
just a P like a literal is it does it

1199
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,228
take a world position I don't remember

1200
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,509
which one this actually takes

1201
00:51:54,228 --> 00:51:58,879
so inside entity Jen when you actually

1202
00:51:56,509 --> 00:52:10,248
call one of the entity placements

1203
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:14,088
functions like search cat here like

1204
00:52:10,248 --> 00:52:16,368
where we place the cat there it is so

1205
00:52:14,088 --> 00:52:19,849
what do you actually expect this thing

1206
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:21,259
to be Jen create entity right like what

1207
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:25,548
is that actually it takes a world

1208
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:29,208
position right so I guess it would be

1209
00:52:25,548 --> 00:52:33,048
that right I don't actually know why it

1210
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:34,759
takes a real position that might be

1211
00:52:33,048 --> 00:52:36,889
something we want to change cuz when you

1212
00:52:34,759 --> 00:52:39,858
look at when you look at how that dupes

1213
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:41,358
where it has to happen here and we call

1214
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:43,278
place entity isn't this gonna get

1215
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:46,400
circular yeah I mean it this this just

1216
00:52:43,278 --> 00:52:47,688
goes kind of all around its rude all

1217
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,259
kinds of gyrations it doesn't really

1218
00:52:47,688 --> 00:52:53,478
make any sense

1219
00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:54,619
this should probably just be a this

1220
00:52:53,478 --> 00:52:59,058
should probably just be a

1221
00:52:54,619 --> 00:53:01,429
straightforward positional location it

1222
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:03,439
would be simpler and you can see here

1223
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:06,579
when I say this is just garbage I'm not

1224
00:53:03,438 --> 00:53:08,838
kidding it really is just garbage right

1225
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:11,390
because you can see here the entity P

1226
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:13,489
just doesn't affect so really you know

1227
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:14,009
this this place entity call doesn't need

1228
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:17,490
to do the

1229
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:19,850
right it could be just saying hey this

1230
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:23,129
is where this thing is supposed to go

1231
00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:27,210
right it goes there

1232
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:27,539
none of that has to happen you know what

1233
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,579
I mean

1234
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:31,259
and so normally when you're talking

1235
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:34,650
about a placement in the I think that

1236
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:38,000
just works and we don't need any of this

1237
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:41,309
other stuff that you know that NADP

1238
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,230
placement can just occur so I think

1239
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:48,000
that's all we really want to do there

1240
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:52,349
and I think I'm gonna leave it leave it

1241
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,630
at that but going back here to the gem

1242
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:57,329
tracker so this would just be a v3 P

1243
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:59,220
that was coming in here and when you

1244
00:53:57,329 --> 00:54:00,929
call in to this function

1245
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:03,869
these don't normally use the real

1246
00:54:00,929 --> 00:54:06,000
position if they got a standing on value

1247
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:08,489
there so this but this world position

1248
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,440
will will become a v3 instead which is

1249
00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:13,349
relative to whatever the the room

1250
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,200
generation is going to be and so when we

1251
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:19,259
call in here and we say let's place this

1252
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:21,299
thing that will be the query P not a

1253
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:23,220
world position but the actual v3

1254
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:26,070
position of the entity if that makes

1255
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:27,599
sense I'm going to comment this out for

1256
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:31,230
a quick second oops

1257
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,679
know what happened there sorry about

1258
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:34,650
that

1259
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:37,440
I accidentally reinvented everything so

1260
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:40,160
what I want to do now is I want to go

1261
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,690
ahead and push forward through to

1262
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,750
figuring out how this code would

1263
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:47,309
actually work with something that has to

1264
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:50,369
place in multiple locations like I said

1265
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:52,170
we can sort of make that notion work

1266
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:54,809
that says like the child has to go here

1267
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:57,480
or whatever there are some sort of

1268
00:54:54,809 --> 00:55:00,599
issues though that are a little bit more

1269
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:06,090
difficult to address that we sort of

1270
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:08,549
want to figure out how to do when we

1271
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:10,590
place a an entity and then we call the

1272
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:12,690
creation routine for that entity one of

1273
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:14,640
the problems we're going to have is we

1274
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:18,090
find a volume and we kind of want to

1275
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:19,829
fill that volume and it's gonna want to

1276
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,960
use that volume to figure out how it's

1277
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:25,019
going to place its various things in it

1278
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:27,108
so in a sense too I think looking at

1279
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:31,338
this I think it may

1280
00:55:27,108 --> 00:55:35,058
make more sense to say actually you know

1281
00:55:31,338 --> 00:55:37,969
as opposed to doing the standing on

1282
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:40,130
stuff here and so on I wonder if when we

1283
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:44,838
place this thing actually what we want

1284
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:50,599
to do is pass more like the room query

1285
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:53,208
itself so like here's like where you

1286
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:57,140
know this is the placement query that

1287
00:55:53,208 --> 00:56:01,788
the and that the that was done to figure

1288
00:55:57,139 --> 00:56:03,889
out where you were supposed to go and so

1289
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:07,150
that you can see the entire region and

1290
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:10,629
furthermore when you actually get called

1291
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:13,489
you probably need your whole chain of

1292
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:14,900
what all these entities were that you

1293
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:17,749
were placing down you know what I'm

1294
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:22,088
saying so this part is a little bit more

1295
00:56:17,748 --> 00:56:24,738
complicated and confusing to me because

1296
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:27,469
again I'm not really sure exactly how

1297
00:56:24,739 --> 00:56:31,219
this wants to go and another way to look

1298
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:33,469
at it would be maybe the Creator call

1299
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:35,989
you know it's possible that this part

1300
00:56:33,469 --> 00:56:38,059
really doesn't specify an additional

1301
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:38,989
Creator call or maybe it does I don't

1302
00:56:38,059 --> 00:56:40,670
know

1303
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:42,909
so we'll kinda have to see how we want

1304
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:45,440
to structure that code it's tricky right

1305
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:47,629
but you know I'm just gonna continue on

1306
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,059
from where we are here so in terms of

1307
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:52,489
the traversable reference you know when

1308
00:56:50,059 --> 00:56:54,619
we get that back it's like in this case

1309
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:56,150
we may want to say well okay the

1310
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:59,900
traversal reference is something that

1311
00:56:56,150 --> 00:57:02,660
maybe is going to happen more inside

1312
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,309
that query as well right so this part

1313
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:06,588
here where we're saying you know we're

1314
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:08,869
on this floor ID and that sort of stuff

1315
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:10,278
you know this part may also be something

1316
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:14,749
that has to get handled in a more

1317
00:57:10,278 --> 00:57:17,838
specific way again not sure just saying

1318
00:57:14,748 --> 00:57:19,458
we're gonna figure it out as we go so

1319
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,139
when the query comes back maybe it has

1320
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:22,518
all of this different stuff in it so

1321
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:24,288
that when you get this placement corey

1322
00:57:22,518 --> 00:57:27,679
you actually get all of this stuff here

1323
00:57:24,289 --> 00:57:30,589
and this is the standing on piece and so

1324
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:33,048
when you're actually called to do that

1325
00:57:30,588 --> 00:57:36,558
generation then what we're going to do

1326
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:38,150
is inside the room gem call right we're

1327
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,910
going to actually pass you the query

1328
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:42,889
that we use to find out where you should

1329
00:57:40,909 --> 00:57:46,179
go and you're gonna have to take it from

1330
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:49,429
there you know what I mean

1331
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:50,789
so that seems you know relatively

1332
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:54,089
reasonable to me

1333
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:54,090
[Music]

1334
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:09,048
I think that all makes reasonable sense

1335
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:18,380
and like looking at how these things are

1336
00:58:09,048 --> 00:58:26,409
gonna get tagged it looks like this also

1337
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:33,798
is sort of a cascading process so hmm

1338
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:37,248
the main thing I'm not sure about is is

1339
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:42,670
how this actually unwinds for people who

1340
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:42,669
get you know multiple parts of the query

1341
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,449
so let's push a little bit further on

1342
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:55,130
this because I'm again I want to make

1343
00:58:53,449 --> 00:58:56,599
sure that this works relatively well but

1344
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:58,369
I can see a lot of issues that are

1345
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:00,769
probably gonna happen with it here's

1346
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:05,059
what I'm gonna say let's suppose that

1347
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:08,659
what we do is we run through the sub

1348
00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:13,099
entities here so we look at the like

1349
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:14,569
root entities in series right and these

1350
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:20,210
are the things that are on the main

1351
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:22,940
chain so each entity kind of goes goes

1352
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:27,019
through that goes through this process

1353
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:31,329
right for each root entity we find a

1354
00:59:27,019 --> 00:59:33,469
place to put it probably like this and

1355
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:36,829
then we assert that we can actually find

1356
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:39,109
it we maybe don't actually do this we'll

1357
00:59:36,829 --> 00:59:41,210
see what we do about that a little bit

1358
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:45,980
later then in here we go

1359
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:51,079
through a place entity or you know

1360
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:54,740
source entity call and that just starts

1361
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:59,299
with the rune attiny and goes through to

1362
00:59:54,739 --> 01:00:02,269
each child something like that because

1363
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:04,070
we're gonna go to the child but I guess

1364
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:06,380
we want to go okay so that's not quite

1365
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:08,180
right we do the root entity but then we

1366
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:15,829
do the children of the root entity as

1367
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:20,569
separate calls so it's more like this we

1368
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:27,559
start at the root entity and we say that

1369
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:29,870
like the next entity you know I don't

1370
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:31,789
like to look at that loop either so I

1371
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:38,509
would almost argue that it should look

1372
01:00:31,789 --> 01:00:40,759
more like this I would argue that we're

1373
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:42,470
really talking about two things we're

1374
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:49,250
talking about groups of enemies and

1375
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:51,230
those go together like this but they

1376
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:52,909
don't have tags because a group of

1377
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,320
entities can't really have tags although

1378
01:00:52,909 --> 01:00:56,239
you could make something that applies

1379
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,410
multiple tags to multiple entities then

1380
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:00,169
you have entities and those have next

1381
01:00:57,409 --> 01:01:02,618
pointers creators and things like this

1382
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:07,088
right

1383
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:08,890
in here we have first entity right this

1384
01:01:07,088 --> 01:01:13,088
is actually what we're talking about

1385
01:01:08,889 --> 01:01:15,608
here if that makes sense and this entity

1386
01:01:13,088 --> 01:01:17,288
group like I said I'm not sure exactly

1387
01:01:15,608 --> 01:01:21,719
how that wants to be specified in terms

1388
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:21,719
of the footprint that it actually needs

1389
01:01:21,869 --> 01:01:29,140
this may be a bad way to to phrase it so

1390
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,099
it may be that we want to do something

1391
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:32,078
else here but we'll see

1392
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:33,130
well well again we're just gonna play

1393
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:35,229
around it and see what happens

1394
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:36,789
but this is really the structure we have

1395
01:01:35,228 --> 01:01:38,498
I didn't like the previous structure we

1396
01:01:36,789 --> 01:01:40,059
had so this makes a lot more sense

1397
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:42,788
so I mean here you're actually gonna be

1398
01:01:40,059 --> 01:01:44,589
saying look we're gonna go through the

1399
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:46,569
groups of entities that have to be

1400
01:01:44,588 --> 01:01:49,298
placed together because they sort of

1401
01:01:46,568 --> 01:01:51,038
have you know inferred they sort of have

1402
01:01:49,298 --> 01:01:52,659
to be placed in ways that they can

1403
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:55,809
cluster together so they're not they

1404
01:01:52,659 --> 01:01:57,759
can't be placed free of each other and

1405
01:01:55,809 --> 01:02:02,069
so we go through those groups and we say

1406
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:04,659
look the room has a first entity group

1407
01:02:02,068 --> 01:02:08,440
and then we go through as many of those

1408
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:10,210
as the room has right I think I'm just

1409
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,528
going to model the problem correctly I

1410
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:14,170
don't really want to string it together

1411
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:16,329
in some other way so then we say okay

1412
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:19,059
like let's find a place to put this

1413
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:21,190
entity group and here's the entity group

1414
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:23,289
we assert at the moment that we found

1415
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:25,900
one in the future we may have to handle

1416
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:28,960
not being able to find one and do some

1417
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:31,119
kind of fancier footwork there but what

1418
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,278
we can then do is say alright now we

1419
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:36,390
loop through the entities of this group

1420
01:02:33,278 --> 01:02:39,518
so now we say okay we have like a

1421
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:42,400
pending entity and that comes from the

1422
01:02:39,518 --> 01:02:45,159
entity groups first entity and then we

1423
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:48,639
just go through each of those in series

1424
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:49,989
like so and this is much now much

1425
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,509
cleaner so you can see that that now

1426
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:54,460
looks correct so then we place the

1427
01:02:52,509 --> 01:02:56,409
entity from the pending entity like we

1428
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,728
did before this part will have to be

1429
01:02:56,409 --> 01:03:01,389
worked out a little bit exactly how

1430
01:02:57,728 --> 01:03:03,338
that's supposed to go because again I'm

1431
01:03:01,389 --> 01:03:05,259
not exactly sure and so we'll figure

1432
01:03:03,338 --> 01:03:07,568
that out in a second but that's roughly

1433
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:09,159
what we need to do there and then as we

1434
01:03:07,568 --> 01:03:11,349
go through those entities we can apply

1435
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:14,048
the tags to them as we were applying

1436
01:03:11,349 --> 01:03:15,710
those tags before and all of that should

1437
01:03:14,048 --> 01:03:19,159
just work you know totally

1438
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:22,760
fine that makes sense so what I want to

1439
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:24,469
do now is just say well forget all the

1440
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,330
rest of the stuff we just want to get

1441
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:29,618
this working in a basic you know

1442
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:31,699
rudimentary fashion so let's try to

1443
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:33,650
implement this just for the case we

1444
01:03:31,699 --> 01:03:35,659
already had and then we'll try to

1445
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,670
implement it for the more complicated

1446
01:03:35,659 --> 01:03:41,899
case of having two things next to each

1447
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:44,450
other right so let's go ahead and switch

1448
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:47,630
back now to the room case so in the room

1449
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:49,399
Jen code will actually guess it's in the

1450
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:52,099
world Jen code where we set things up

1451
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,690
originally we have in here this notion

1452
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:55,010
of identity it's really gonna generate

1453
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:56,720
any group now and we're gonna have first

1454
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:58,609
in the group so let's just deal with the

1455
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:01,759
code that had the group entities

1456
01:03:58,608 --> 01:04:03,469
together first and we'll fix that and

1457
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,010
then we'll go from there if that makes

1458
01:04:03,469 --> 01:04:08,389
sense we also want the room tile query

1459
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:10,400
stuff I don't really know what we're

1460
01:04:08,389 --> 01:04:11,598
gonna be calling here I think maybe what

1461
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,579
I'll do is I'll switch it back

1462
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:17,359
temporarily to what we were talking

1463
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:19,940
about before so just to just to again

1464
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:21,500
get it working in a rudimentary fashion

1465
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:23,630
and then we'll look you can kind of go

1466
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:36,440
from there so this is a what a

1467
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:38,150
traversable reference so we'll just get

1468
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,039
that working temporarily and then we'll

1469
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:41,750
kind of push forward through the

1470
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:44,389
different ways in which that's gonna go

1471
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:45,619
by will ping-pong over to the other side

1472
01:04:44,389 --> 01:04:47,029
of the implementation where we're

1473
01:04:45,619 --> 01:04:48,650
actually creating entity will see what

1474
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:50,119
we want there and then we can figure out

1475
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,680
how we want to wire them up together

1476
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,300
because that's gonna give us a very good

1477
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:56,659
idea of how those two pieces should look

1478
01:04:53,300 --> 01:05:00,980
once we've seen both sides so here's our

1479
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:02,509
first entity stuff that we're gonna

1480
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:05,599
place an Indian room we got this sort of

1481
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:07,640
first entity whatever nonsense right so

1482
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,920
if we're just placing an ear in a room

1483
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:10,879
by itself so we essentially are saying

1484
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,470
we're just putting an end in this room

1485
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,960
that means it sort of needs to have a

1486
01:05:12,469 --> 01:05:17,358
self creating group if that makes sense

1487
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,280
so because we're just placing one so

1488
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:21,259
that's totally fine we just say here's

1489
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,140
the group this is like a single group

1490
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:28,450
right and so all we need to do is just

1491
01:05:24,139 --> 01:05:31,029
say like add entity group to this room

1492
01:05:28,449 --> 01:05:34,299
this is the room in question and then

1493
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:36,070
after we add that then we add the we

1494
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:41,320
place the entity in a particular group

1495
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:45,030
right place Kennedy and instead of a

1496
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:48,088
room we just say like gin entity group

1497
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:50,230
so it's saying put it into this group

1498
01:05:48,088 --> 01:05:52,779
and in order to do that it just looks

1499
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:56,800
like this it's the same exact code it

1500
01:05:52,780 --> 01:06:02,950
just now it's on the it's on the group

1501
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:04,119
instead right so now we just start

1502
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:06,489
chaining them on to the end of this

1503
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:08,980
group instead if you call place entity

1504
01:06:06,489 --> 01:06:11,259
with into a room it will just add the

1505
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:13,088
group for you automatically and write

1506
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:16,740
this code it's trivial code right all it

1507
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:16,739
does allocate that structure and return

1508
01:06:17,429 --> 01:06:31,809
and so this then we'll just thunk

1509
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:32,890
through the place entity like so all

1510
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:35,679
right

1511
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:37,989
police entity in this case just daisy

1512
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:39,219
chains on so all of that stuff should be

1513
01:06:37,989 --> 01:06:42,189
fine

1514
01:06:39,219 --> 01:06:43,389
when we place the entity group here what

1515
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:45,818
that's going to do is just use the

1516
01:06:43,389 --> 01:06:48,759
temporary memory that's that's set up in

1517
01:06:45,818 --> 01:06:50,380
ghent entity to make sure that it can

1518
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,970
access one of these or get you know

1519
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:54,608
storage temporary storage space for one

1520
01:06:51,969 --> 01:06:57,009
of these but that's about it so all its

1521
01:06:54,608 --> 01:06:59,338
gonna do is do a push direct write and

1522
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:05,619
it's gonna do that on the gent a memory

1523
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:08,049
like so I and it's just gonna push on

1524
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:12,640
room for one of those it's then going to

1525
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:19,710
set it up I and Link it in I don't think

1526
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:19,710
there's any actual information in there

1527
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:30,869
so there isn't right it's just the next

1528
01:07:29,369 --> 01:07:32,429
pointer in a first and a so right now we

1529
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:34,289
don't have any actual information there

1530
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:35,819
in the future we probably will put some

1531
01:07:34,289 --> 01:07:36,710
information in there we just don't know

1532
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:40,830
what it's gonna be

1533
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:42,570
offhand so anyway you know it's next

1534
01:07:40,829 --> 01:07:45,239
pointer it's basically this exact same

1535
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:50,789
code so we just say okay the rims first

1536
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:52,679
entity group is us and the rooms first

1537
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:54,000
entity group then will point to us right

1538
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:55,349
so our next pointer just points to

1539
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,280
whatever was on the chain before so

1540
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:59,190
again it's just simply a linked list

1541
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:01,650
pushing it on there so that's pretty

1542
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:04,590
trivial right nothing fancy going on

1543
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:06,180
there I and in terms of this code now we

1544
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:08,190
just need to actually implement

1545
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:11,759
something that finds an empty spot in

1546
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:12,960
this grid and so now we get to the part

1547
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,510
we actually care about which is the grid

1548
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,039
implementation so let's start there

1549
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:18,600
again this is going to be pretty

1550
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:22,079
straightforward so when we come through

1551
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:26,280
here we have the notion of temporary

1552
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:28,619
memory that we're using here which you

1553
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:30,899
know inside this temporary memory you

1554
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:36,500
will all get unwound so we can pretty

1555
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:39,619
trivially just take this right after

1556
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:42,539
trying to say it's a little more cleanly

1557
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:43,649
we have a giant set of scratch memory

1558
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:45,810
that we can just use while we're

1559
01:08:43,649 --> 01:08:48,149
building the world and this grid is a

1560
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:50,730
totally temporary structure so we know

1561
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:52,469
that we can push this grid on trivially

1562
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:55,679
by just using the temporary memory that

1563
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:58,560
we have here so all I'm gonna do is just

1564
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:02,909
say alright we're gonna create a room

1565
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:06,750
grid like so so I'll push that struck

1566
01:09:02,909 --> 01:09:12,420
down here where we say all right let's

1567
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:14,819
push the the dejenne remember it on we

1568
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:17,789
know how big the room is right because

1569
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:20,549
we actually have this information we

1570
01:09:17,789 --> 01:09:22,550
have like min tile X min to Y and I

1571
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:26,579
guess technically we've got Z as well

1572
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:29,670
right so we have the X count the Y count

1573
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:32,640
in the Z count those all exist and since

1574
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:34,588
we have this V this gen v3 thing where

1575
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,190
we've got the dim and everything feels

1576
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:39,269
like we should probably use it as well

1577
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:43,139
so

1578
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:44,850
maybe we can just do this and so in here

1579
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:47,490
we can just say look the dimensions of

1580
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:51,450
the grid are exactly the dimensions that

1581
01:09:47,489 --> 01:09:53,429
we had to begin with and then the tiles

1582
01:09:51,449 --> 01:09:55,349
is just going to be an array that can

1583
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:58,619
store all that right

1584
01:09:55,350 --> 01:10:01,350
so we'll say look allocate in the temp

1585
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:04,170
memory something that actually just

1586
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:09,180
gives us this dimension all played out

1587
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:12,720
right so give us a solid volume filled

1588
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:16,710
with that much stuff and clear it so we

1589
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:19,170
can use it and by the way each one of

1590
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:21,390
them should be one of these so we this

1591
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:22,409
is how much room we want to store in

1592
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:25,619
there right

1593
01:10:22,409 --> 01:10:29,069
so that would allocate the tiles for us

1594
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:32,729
and then as we sort of march on through

1595
01:10:29,069 --> 01:10:36,090
here what we can do is say the tile that

1596
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:41,459
work that's in question here is just you

1597
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:42,840
know whatever tile comes from you can

1598
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:44,670
see what's going on here these are tiles

1599
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,319
in the real world but we just want the

1600
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:49,230
tiles relative to the grid so we're just

1601
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:51,299
gonna say X and X Y and X right our Z

1602
01:10:49,229 --> 01:10:53,789
index is always gonna be 0 for now I

1603
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:56,250
think we don't seem to set up a Z index

1604
01:10:53,789 --> 01:10:58,369
for whatever reason I'm just trying to

1605
01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:02,819
look here to see it looks like we just

1606
01:10:58,369 --> 01:11:05,430
we just don't use Z at the moment and so

1607
01:11:02,819 --> 01:11:10,829
when we come through here to do our

1608
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:13,800
placement I it looks like it looks like

1609
01:11:10,829 --> 01:11:15,539
we just used this floor tile Z so the

1610
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:19,880
floor tile Z is just always the Minzy

1611
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:25,260
which is always 0 so you know in a sense

1612
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:29,869
it's that this makes sense or I should

1613
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:29,869
say it's that right

1614
01:11:30,029 --> 01:11:36,569
so really the tile in question is this

1615
01:11:32,069 --> 01:11:38,159
tile right it's it's this and another

1616
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:41,489
way I could do that is to say to the Z

1617
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:44,220
index is 0 and that again is just the

1618
01:11:41,489 --> 01:11:48,000
relative to the grid so X Y Z and that

1619
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:49,770
would return the tile to us ok now we

1620
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,199
don't have to care how we index this

1621
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:53,580
thing it's entirely at artists

1622
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:55,979
because we made the array and we can

1623
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:57,840
index it however we want so all we

1624
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:59,489
really have to do is make sure that

1625
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,130
everything is in bounds and assuming

1626
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:06,000
that everything is in bounds and I don't

1627
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:12,390
know if we have do we have a in array

1628
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:15,239
bounds so really all we need to do here

1629
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:17,010
is assert that all of these things are

1630
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:19,619
in bounds because we want to catch any

1631
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:21,630
errors that we may be making here that

1632
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:23,489
might otherwise be a little bit hard to

1633
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:25,500
catch don't ask me why that's a greater

1634
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:27,359
than I man

1635
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,899
so really we just want to make sure that

1636
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:33,059
all these things end up flowing properly

1637
01:12:29,899 --> 01:12:36,839
okay so in here we sort of have this

1638
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:39,180
notion okay there's a gen room grid it

1639
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,920
here's the grid the dimensions of the

1640
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:43,500
grid are specified by the stem for

1641
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:46,850
ammeter so off the go and maybe I'll

1642
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:48,899
just pull that out so here's the the

1643
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:50,880
dimension of the grid which I pull out

1644
01:12:48,899 --> 01:12:52,199
then I assert that you know the things

1645
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,760
within range and then I just try to

1646
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:57,149
figure out okay well if that's the tile

1647
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,579
that you wanted then all I need to do is

1648
01:12:57,149 --> 01:13:02,129
to take the tiles and offset them by you

1649
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:04,649
know these so we have the Z index the Y

1650
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:07,380
index the X index these will be

1651
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:10,559
multiplied by their respective values so

1652
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:12,960
you know this is a standard dimensional

1653
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:17,940
writing that we always do so for example

1654
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:20,789
the Z index here for every Z index it

1655
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:23,309
will go by the X and the y and for every

1656
01:13:20,789 --> 01:13:27,029
Y index it will go by the X right so X

1657
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:29,880
is primal Y a secondary Z is is tertiary

1658
01:13:27,029 --> 01:13:32,039
right again doesn't matter how you

1659
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:35,279
choose to index these at all it may

1660
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:37,500
affect things like you know how fast the

1661
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,149
caches or how well loops can be

1662
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:41,489
constructed or things like that there

1663
01:13:39,149 --> 01:13:43,949
are reasons to care about them in

1664
01:13:41,489 --> 01:13:46,050
performance situations we're not in one

1665
01:13:43,949 --> 01:13:48,809
of those situations yet so literally as

1666
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:51,300
long as you map an X Y and a Z to

1667
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:52,830
uniques one of the tiles you could have

1668
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:56,520
done this any way you wanted you could

1669
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:57,989
have had X be tertiary and z be primal

1670
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,060
here you could have done all sorts of

1671
01:13:57,989 --> 01:14:01,829
things as long as you map them some way

1672
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,570
I just chose to map them with X

1673
01:14:01,829 --> 01:14:05,579
things that are neighboring in X go

1674
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:05,799
sequentially things that are neighboring

1675
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:08,559
in

1676
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:10,809
why go by X pans and things that are

1677
01:14:08,559 --> 01:14:13,570
neighboring and C go by XY plates

1678
01:14:10,809 --> 01:14:16,389
basically right and you can see that in

1679
01:14:13,569 --> 01:14:18,340
the map here so there's me getting a

1680
01:14:16,389 --> 01:14:20,078
tile out of the room so when I get one

1681
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:22,480
of these tiles now I can fill it in with

1682
01:14:20,078 --> 01:14:23,710
information as necessary so now is the

1683
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:25,569
part we can start to fill out this

1684
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:27,609
struct with what we might actually store

1685
01:14:25,569 --> 01:14:30,099
here so it seems pretty clear what I

1686
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:31,868
would want to store here at the moment I

1687
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:33,699
add all this stuff in there and really

1688
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:36,880
what I need to know is okay did not you

1689
01:14:33,698 --> 01:14:40,598
know did I add a traversable right did I

1690
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:42,219
put something in there can it be stepped

1691
01:14:40,599 --> 01:14:44,739
on and all that sort of stuff right I

1692
01:14:42,219 --> 01:14:46,210
need to know that information so what I

1693
01:14:44,738 --> 01:14:48,698
want to know when I go to place this

1694
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:54,130
entity I want to know all that stuff so

1695
01:14:48,698 --> 01:14:56,198
for example I want to know the

1696
01:14:54,130 --> 01:15:00,130
structural entity the floor right this

1697
01:14:56,198 --> 01:15:02,078
thing I want to know that so the tile

1698
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:05,050
structural entity should be this entity

1699
01:15:02,078 --> 01:15:06,939
I probably also want to know if it's

1700
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:09,340
open or closed right

1701
01:15:06,939 --> 01:15:12,118
and so the open or closed status of this

1702
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:15,789
thing it's gonna be related to this

1703
01:15:12,118 --> 01:15:18,488
thing I said before and again this now

1704
01:15:15,789 --> 01:15:20,710
we can actually start to make this part

1705
01:15:18,488 --> 01:15:22,118
of the routine a lot cleaner because as

1706
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:24,789
we're gonna be able to use things on a

1707
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:26,679
grid we don't need quite so many things

1708
01:15:24,789 --> 01:15:29,439
happening all on top of each other we

1709
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:31,599
can do things that maybe will operate in

1710
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,098
passes on the grid that will just clean

1711
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:34,869
up the code and make it easier for us to

1712
01:15:33,099 --> 01:15:36,909
work with it doesn't really change its

1713
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:39,279
correctness but it will add power and

1714
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:40,359
and ease of use to it for us which is

1715
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:41,769
going to be important because this is

1716
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:43,929
gonna be these routines are gonna be

1717
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:47,290
central to the game design process and

1718
01:15:43,929 --> 01:15:49,149
I'm not a game designer so I don't want

1719
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:50,889
to speak to this aspect of it but just

1720
01:15:49,149 --> 01:15:54,149
what I can tell you from having observed

1721
01:15:50,889 --> 01:15:57,489
and spoken with great game designers I

1722
01:15:54,149 --> 01:16:00,908
can tell you that having the code in

1723
01:15:57,488 --> 01:16:03,669
that's involved in design be flexible is

1724
01:16:00,908 --> 01:16:07,479
is critical but you can't you really

1725
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:10,149
don't want pieces of the design facing

1726
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:12,488
code to be brittle or confusing that

1727
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:17,439
will limit the amount of iteration you

1728
01:16:12,488 --> 01:16:19,638
can do and it limits the amount of sort

1729
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:21,319
of experimentation that will go on

1730
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:23,149
just because the designer is being

1731
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:24,708
hamstrung and forced in directions they

1732
01:16:23,149 --> 01:16:26,809
don't want to go by what is hard and

1733
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:28,609
what is easy in the codebase and so

1734
01:16:26,809 --> 01:16:30,229
again that'll be something we'll talk

1735
01:16:28,609 --> 01:16:32,299
about more later as we go to start

1736
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:34,309
iterating on design things you'll see me

1737
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,599
I'll say that multiple times I won't

1738
01:16:34,309 --> 01:16:37,639
have a lot of advice for you on the

1739
01:16:35,599 --> 01:16:39,679
design side of things but I will mention

1740
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:41,118
things like that where I'm like trust me

1741
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,849
on this one from having work with great

1742
01:16:41,118 --> 01:16:47,029
designers before don't deliver them code

1743
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:49,610
that is hard to work with in the that

1744
01:16:47,029 --> 01:16:51,018
they have to tweak right so that is just

1745
01:16:49,609 --> 01:16:55,248
something that you'll get you'll hear me

1746
01:16:51,019 --> 01:16:57,168
say multiple times as we go so now you

1747
01:16:55,248 --> 01:16:58,728
can see me filling out these tiles at

1748
01:16:57,168 --> 01:17:01,458
this point that means that when we issue

1749
01:16:58,729 --> 01:17:03,800
one of these clear queries we can start

1750
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:08,059
to do stuff that will actually work here

1751
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:09,110
if I wanted to re-enable this this code

1752
01:17:08,059 --> 01:17:11,029
here where we get one of these

1753
01:17:09,109 --> 01:17:15,078
traversable references that thing goes

1754
01:17:11,029 --> 01:17:18,288
through here what I can do is this on

1755
01:17:15,078 --> 01:17:20,448
floor entity now I can look that up I

1756
01:17:18,288 --> 01:17:23,418
can look up into the grid who we

1757
01:17:20,448 --> 01:17:24,948
actually found so I can say here and you

1758
01:17:23,418 --> 01:17:26,269
know we can even put that back in there

1759
01:17:24,948 --> 01:17:28,398
in the query of some percent but I

1760
01:17:26,269 --> 01:17:29,719
probably don't want it because you can

1761
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:31,219
get back a volume and you may want to

1762
01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:33,559
look at all the tiles in the volume and

1763
01:17:31,219 --> 01:17:36,739
do stuff with them so when I get back a

1764
01:17:33,559 --> 01:17:39,288
found here what I want to do is for each

1765
01:17:36,738 --> 01:17:43,578
of the entities in question I would like

1766
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:47,658
to then go through and figure out which

1767
01:17:43,578 --> 01:17:50,208
of these things we were doing like who

1768
01:17:47,658 --> 01:17:54,618
were we placing on if that makes sense

1769
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:57,288
and there's a lot of kind of subtlety

1770
01:17:54,618 --> 01:17:58,759
here that I'll go into in a second but

1771
01:17:57,288 --> 01:18:00,469
basically what I want to do is say well

1772
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,149
look let's see whether or not this

1773
01:18:00,469 --> 01:18:05,059
thing's an occupier and if it is we'll

1774
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:08,449
pass down the reference what I could say

1775
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:10,340
is since we don't need to do a standing

1776
01:18:08,448 --> 01:18:14,268
on transaction I don't know that we

1777
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:16,099
really need this so the occupier flag is

1778
01:18:14,269 --> 01:18:18,619
really gonna be more for the query I

1779
01:18:16,099 --> 01:18:21,168
think we can always prepare this anyway

1780
01:18:18,618 --> 01:18:22,639
so we just need to say look whatever the

1781
01:18:21,168 --> 01:18:24,979
structural entity is that you are

1782
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:27,168
standing on that's the thing that it

1783
01:18:24,979 --> 01:18:29,929
would be and we don't really need to go

1784
01:18:27,168 --> 01:18:30,769
into more detail than that at the moment

1785
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:33,880
anyway

1786
01:18:30,769 --> 01:18:39,800
so we'd really just be talking about

1787
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:41,119
let's get one of those tiles we know

1788
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:44,110
which tile we're going to get because

1789
01:18:41,119 --> 01:18:47,470
we're going to essentially start right

1790
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:50,389
at a tile position that top position is

1791
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:52,579
the the query that comes back is going

1792
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:55,550
to give us a P that P is the top

1793
01:18:52,579 --> 01:19:01,819
position oh sorry that's not true it's

1794
01:18:55,550 --> 01:19:04,039
the gen volume min so we know that that

1795
01:19:01,819 --> 01:19:05,779
minimum value is where we would be

1796
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:07,310
starting placing things just just for

1797
01:19:05,779 --> 01:19:09,829
the moment against twice a week and I

1798
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:11,120
gotta work this in phases because we got

1799
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:13,069
to figure out how that stuff's gonna

1800
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:16,430
look a little bit later on um so we're

1801
01:19:13,069 --> 01:19:18,859
gonna sort of take that that volume in

1802
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:20,329
piece there and move that little bit

1803
01:19:18,859 --> 01:19:22,729
forwards then what we're gonna say is

1804
01:19:20,329 --> 01:19:24,319
this standing on thing doesn't need to

1805
01:19:22,729 --> 01:19:27,019
actually need to happen that can come

1806
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:32,380
out here so here we create the reference

1807
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:32,380
what we can do is say look the tile oops

1808
01:19:32,649 --> 01:19:37,219
the structural entity for that tile is

1809
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:39,590
what's your gonna be standing on we can

1810
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:41,270
make this predicated on whether there is

1811
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:43,279
anything to stand on there which makes a

1812
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:45,710
little more sense but normally there

1813
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:49,939
would be then it gets placed and added

1814
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:52,279
and it's done right now this should work

1815
01:19:49,939 --> 01:19:53,299
for single entity placement but of

1816
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:54,739
course we want to get to multiple

1817
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:57,650
interview placement so we'll do that in

1818
01:19:54,739 --> 01:19:59,389
a minute here but what we need to do

1819
01:19:57,649 --> 01:20:05,449
here is like a to do

1820
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:07,369
that's like update the tile P because we

1821
01:20:05,449 --> 01:20:10,309
need to kind of move through the volume

1822
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:12,590
so we kind of need that to work a little

1823
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:13,970
bit better as we go forwards all right

1824
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:16,069
so let's take a look at where we're at

1825
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:18,400
this needs to take the grid which is

1826
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:20,989
good we've got the grid so that's fine

1827
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:22,759
pending entity here that's not important

1828
01:20:20,989 --> 01:20:25,010
anymore cuz that was just a check to see

1829
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:26,659
we were making sure we have into place

1830
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:27,949
we're placing the separate loop now so

1831
01:20:26,659 --> 01:20:29,599
that's not part of whether it's open

1832
01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:31,130
open is now a separate thing it's just

1833
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,329
saying would we be able to play

1834
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:34,159
something on here if we had some of the

1835
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:35,180
place the check doesn't need to include

1836
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:37,039
whether there something to place in the

1837
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:38,750
first place because that will only this

1838
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:40,789
loop will only iterate over things we do

1839
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:42,529
have to place we haven't even to this

1840
01:20:40,789 --> 01:20:44,569
function yet so we will about in a

1841
01:20:42,529 --> 01:20:48,529
second the get tile function here just

1842
01:20:44,569 --> 01:20:50,058
needs to actually take the tile P and

1843
01:20:48,529 --> 01:20:51,708
and what I really want to do here is

1844
01:20:50,059 --> 01:20:54,469
actually have an ability to call this

1845
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:55,998
directly with a tile P that comes as a

1846
01:20:54,469 --> 01:20:57,800
gen b3 because that's just going to be a

1847
01:20:55,998 --> 01:20:59,448
little bit easier to work with and so I

1848
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:03,920
probably want this to look something

1849
01:20:59,448 --> 01:21:06,618
more like this most of the time and so

1850
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:11,599
what I can do here is just say you know

1851
01:21:06,618 --> 01:21:14,170
let's thunk through and this is just a

1852
01:21:11,599 --> 01:21:19,998
literal funk right it doesn't do

1853
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:22,880
anything else that's it alright so

1854
01:21:19,998 --> 01:21:25,248
that's that's that we're down to just

1855
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,949
this and this function actually is

1856
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:29,420
really easy for us to implement if we

1857
01:21:27,948 --> 01:21:30,438
don't want to take into account let me

1858
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:32,208
move over here so my head's not in the

1859
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:34,130
way if we don't want to take into

1860
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:35,630
account the sort of harder next-level

1861
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:38,150
stuff that we want to actually do with

1862
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:40,519
it it's pretty trivial because what I

1863
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:46,158
can do here is just say well alright you

1864
01:21:40,519 --> 01:21:50,360
know if this is the genuine grid here's

1865
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:52,728
that entity group that I want to place

1866
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:54,228
if all I need to do is find a place and

1867
01:21:52,729 --> 01:21:56,449
I'm just going to say a priori that

1868
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:58,849
we're gonna just find one empty square

1869
01:21:56,448 --> 01:22:01,578
to place this thing on again not doing

1870
01:21:58,849 --> 01:22:04,429
the stuff I actually need to do what I

1871
01:22:01,578 --> 01:22:09,259
can do is just set this stuff up here a

1872
01:22:04,429 --> 01:22:10,630
little bit more straightforward just

1873
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:13,458
going to go through and set the stuff up

1874
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:21,349
where we just set the min and the max

1875
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:25,578
equal to the same location which is the

1876
01:22:21,349 --> 01:22:28,958
XYZ that we found that was open so it's

1877
01:22:25,578 --> 01:22:28,958
basically going to look like this and

1878
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:35,779
once we find that it's open we'll also

1879
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:37,998
set it to closed so don't place anything

1880
01:22:35,779 --> 01:22:40,448
else here right now we may want to do

1881
01:22:37,998 --> 01:22:40,448
this somewhere else

1882
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:49,789
I don't know how exactly one do that

1883
01:22:47,989 --> 01:22:53,769
we'll probably play around that a little

1884
01:22:49,789 --> 01:22:58,340
bit later but you know we'll see

1885
01:22:53,770 --> 01:23:01,220
so here's our found results where we're

1886
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:03,860
gonna say that we found a location the P

1887
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:08,000
location in this case I think we want to

1888
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:10,309
do a we want to probably assert here

1889
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,810
that there's a structural tile because

1890
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:13,340
if the thing is open it means there's

1891
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:15,860
something to stand on so we kind of need

1892
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:17,960
that to be structural at that point and

1893
01:23:15,859 --> 01:23:21,589
so then what I would do is I would say

1894
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:26,750
like get sim space reversible for this

1895
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:32,510
this one let me just see how that's

1896
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:34,550
happening in in at each end so that

1897
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:37,579
takes a traversable reference actually

1898
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:40,400
if that makes sense I think that's what

1899
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:43,630
we want the P placement to be is

1900
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:45,799
wherever that traversable is I think

1901
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:49,220
that's my story and I'm sticking to it

1902
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:51,289
and so you know I think this is actually

1903
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:57,440
we probably want to create this thing

1904
01:23:51,289 --> 01:24:02,420
like this probably so we probably want

1905
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:07,279
to do something like that so we create

1906
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:11,119
one of these first we create the P from

1907
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:14,119
that we set the location here and so I

1908
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:17,750
think that's mostly all we really needed

1909
01:24:14,119 --> 01:24:20,149
to do so again we're gonna search in the

1910
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:20,989
worst way possible and we'll work our

1911
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:24,409
way up from there

1912
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:27,409
so we're literally just going to take an

1913
01:24:24,409 --> 01:24:30,769
X and these can actually be you thirty

1914
01:24:27,409 --> 01:24:33,430
twos because you all because they can be

1915
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:33,430
although I

1916
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:36,599
I'll leave them as necessary - for now

1917
01:24:35,489 --> 01:24:44,250
all right

1918
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:48,450
so if we just go through here like so I

1919
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:51,659
can search throughout all of these cells

1920
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:53,609
and again this will be slower and we

1921
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:55,139
will probably have to think about how we

1922
01:24:53,609 --> 01:24:57,719
might want to do this faster in the

1923
01:24:55,140 --> 01:25:00,060
future but it's you know it's relatively

1924
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,400
tricky stuff to do good spatial

1925
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:06,870
placement queries it gets a little

1926
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:08,579
complicated so don't feel bad all we

1927
01:25:06,869 --> 01:25:11,309
really want to do here is say all right

1928
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:14,069
there's a tile let's get the towel we

1929
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:15,570
could step the top pointer more directly

1930
01:25:14,069 --> 01:25:17,099
I'm not going to do that right now

1931
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:18,449
because again that's an optimization

1932
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:20,130
that's an optimization I don't really

1933
01:25:18,449 --> 01:25:23,309
need to do right now and I'm not so that

1934
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:24,779
I'm not going to and we don't want to do

1935
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:26,970
that because it complicates matters and

1936
01:25:24,779 --> 01:25:28,769
leads to potential bugs and so until we

1937
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:31,110
actually look at how we want to optimize

1938
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:33,240
things I don't want to do anything there

1939
01:25:31,109 --> 01:25:36,210
that could be introducing error

1940
01:25:33,239 --> 01:25:41,639
erroneous or errors in the sort of in

1941
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:46,920
the errors and how things are working if

1942
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:50,579
that makes sense so entity traversable

1943
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:56,279
point is actually probably not what I

1944
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:58,289
want I want that I assume yeah and so

1945
01:25:56,279 --> 01:26:00,059
now let's debug just this part of the

1946
01:25:58,289 --> 01:26:01,289
code and then like I said let's ping

1947
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:07,220
pong into making this do the more

1948
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:07,220
complicated thing that makes sense

1949
01:26:07,489 --> 01:26:18,710
what is our dim Z here oh that's a

1950
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:23,060
little bit of a failure to update there

1951
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:23,060
it's gonna say that doesn't seem bright

1952
01:26:25,069 --> 01:26:30,509
all right so let's take a look at what's

1953
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:33,570
going on now there's us looking for the

1954
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:35,550
grid we're getting back a statement that

1955
01:26:33,569 --> 01:26:38,130
it wasn't actually found correctly and

1956
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:40,020
so it's unable to place like one of its

1957
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:41,520
things in there so that doesn't really

1958
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:43,590
make a lot of sense because we should

1959
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,120
always be able to play stuff because

1960
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:46,800
we're just looking for tiles that are

1961
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:49,409
marked as open

1962
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:56,449
and and then we should set the result to

1963
01:26:49,409 --> 01:26:59,760
true oh I also needed to do this so I

1964
01:26:56,449 --> 01:27:01,260
lied about that that would actually have

1965
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,850
gone through and filled them all up so

1966
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:05,670
things that had two entities in them

1967
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:07,890
wouldn't have worked all right so let's

1968
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:09,899
see if we placed our entities properly

1969
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:12,510
it looks like we did right there they

1970
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:14,519
are and so there are people getting

1971
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:16,650
place now and so now we can try to

1972
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,720
upgrade that to placing things more

1973
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:21,210
intelligently in there so that we get

1974
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:25,980
two things next to each other the way

1975
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:29,130
that we wanted so the critical part here

1976
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:31,829
is you can see once I get into here and

1977
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:36,960
I would want to do a tile open like I'd

1978
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:38,760
want to occupy this tile right what I

1979
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,010
need to be able to do now is search

1980
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:43,409
through the entities that are involved

1981
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:45,630
in this entity group and see whether or

1982
01:27:43,409 --> 01:27:48,180
not they could be placed down in the

1983
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:50,640
location specified so if there's only

1984
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:54,060
one entity it would just work if there's

1985
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:55,980
more than one entity it would have to

1986
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:57,360
look to see whether the neighboring

1987
01:27:55,979 --> 01:28:01,019
squares in the directions that are

1988
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:04,500
listed would actually be plausible or

1989
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:06,120
not in terms of being able to place

1990
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:09,569
entities there right so we'd have to see

1991
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:10,099
whether they were open nearby if that

1992
01:28:09,569 --> 01:28:14,670
makes sense

1993
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:17,880
so yeah in terms of doing that process

1994
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:21,960
and also another thing we I wanted to

1995
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:28,199
look at here what are we doing for Jen

1996
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:33,090
top so we get the query P and we send

1997
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:36,239
that down so yeah you know like so

1998
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:41,550
looking at this for example when we're

1999
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:44,729
placing these when we're placing these

2000
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:51,329
entities I'm just trying to think

2001
01:28:44,729 --> 01:28:57,649
through how they would actually go in we

2002
01:28:51,329 --> 01:28:57,649
don't probably need that query P there

2003
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:10,560
because this would get that for us so I

2004
01:29:06,369 --> 01:29:10,559
kind of feel like that's just an own

2005
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:21,220
yeah I'm not really sure how we want to

2006
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:26,829
do this but I do think maybe that

2007
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:30,760
doesn't really happen I think this is

2008
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:34,510
probably more aware that should go out

2009
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:42,280
here so when we actually create this we

2010
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:46,840
would make a v3 this sort of thing I'm

2011
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:48,460
Sam and that would get passed down and I

2012
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:51,730
think that flows a little bit more

2013
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:54,369
correctly there and we do have the

2014
01:29:51,729 --> 01:29:58,269
problem of if we don't have a location

2015
01:29:54,369 --> 01:30:09,069
for this thing so you know it's probably

2016
01:29:58,270 --> 01:30:11,200
more like this and what we want to do

2017
01:30:09,069 --> 01:30:13,179
here is initialize this value to

2018
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:15,010
something that would be sensible in the

2019
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:17,260
case where we have absolutely no idea of

2020
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:20,170
what is actually going here here what I

2021
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:22,449
mean and that's a little bit more tricky

2022
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:27,340
so for now I'm just gonna clear but I'm

2023
01:30:22,449 --> 01:30:28,420
gonna remind us here right you know what

2024
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:32,140
I'm gonna do I'm gonna do even one

2025
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:34,329
better than that I'm just gonna say look

2026
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:35,650
we didn't implement this yet that way in

2027
01:30:34,329 --> 01:30:37,510
the case where we actually placed

2028
01:30:35,649 --> 01:30:39,849
something in a non structural way like

2029
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:41,770
this code will just fault and we'll come

2030
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:43,570
clean it up because this needs to get

2031
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:47,230
better yeah that's not going to be

2032
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:48,789
sufficient to actually get us through to

2033
01:30:47,229 --> 01:30:53,649
a final piece of code so we know we're

2034
01:30:48,789 --> 01:30:55,420
gonna be back there alright so what I

2035
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:58,809
want to do now is think about the dual

2036
01:30:55,420 --> 01:31:02,079
entity placement case and so I want to

2037
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:04,660
create this notion of a you know a text

2038
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:07,059
box or whatever if you will a place

2039
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:08,529
where we can put like bubble balloons or

2040
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:10,600
something so you know if you're on this

2041
01:31:08,529 --> 01:31:11,109
square you can hop on the square and it

2042
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:14,050
will

2043
01:31:11,109 --> 01:31:15,639
like you know line of dialogues that

2044
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:17,710
kind of thing like I want to talk to

2045
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:19,570
this player or something like that just

2046
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:21,550
I don't know if that makes sense

2047
01:31:19,569 --> 01:31:24,819
so what I want to do is I want to find

2048
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:26,890
some way of getting that worked in here

2049
01:31:24,819 --> 01:31:29,199
and like I said we need some way now

2050
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:32,740
placing two entities this is a little

2051
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:35,260
harder than it seems and the reason for

2052
01:31:32,739 --> 01:31:39,069
that is because as you'll see when I go

2053
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:42,340
to place the camera entity it's gonna

2054
01:31:39,069 --> 01:31:44,199
want to encompass both the other the

2055
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:45,369
person you're talking to and the square

2056
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:53,019
you would stand on when you're talking

2057
01:31:45,369 --> 01:31:55,720
to them I think maybe it won't but at

2058
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:58,840
the very least it would need to well I

2059
01:31:55,720 --> 01:32:02,409
don't know let's let's just do it and

2060
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:04,329
we'll see what happens all right so

2061
01:32:02,409 --> 01:32:06,699
let's suppose we did this stupidest

2062
01:32:04,329 --> 01:32:09,189
possible thing first here is a fine

2063
01:32:06,699 --> 01:32:12,899
place to put entity group call loops

2064
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:17,229
over the x and y of this thing right and

2065
01:32:12,899 --> 01:32:20,379
what I want to do here is I want to do

2066
01:32:17,229 --> 01:32:23,589
effectively a search to find what else

2067
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:26,920
is nearby to the various people here

2068
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:29,440
right so I want to do a thing that's

2069
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:36,899
like returns the success or failure

2070
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:42,609
criteria and I want to do like a

2071
01:32:36,899 --> 01:32:43,779
recursive open tile search and what I'm

2072
01:32:42,609 --> 01:32:47,439
going to do is I'm going to take the

2073
01:32:43,779 --> 01:32:50,229
first entity of the tile group and I'm

2074
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:54,879
going to conduct the search from there

2075
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:58,419
so I'm effectively gonna say okay I know

2076
01:32:54,880 --> 01:33:00,699
that the location I'm at is this gen v3

2077
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:03,210
here so I in fact I can actually just do

2078
01:33:00,699 --> 01:33:03,210
this right

2079
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:18,408
right so I want to say hey if I pass a

2080
01:33:14,139 --> 01:33:21,109
tile P down and I pass this grid down so

2081
01:33:18,408 --> 01:33:25,908
I say like you know recursive open tile

2082
01:33:21,109 --> 01:33:27,948
search do you know work your magic and I

2083
01:33:25,908 --> 01:33:30,049
want you to return me true if you can

2084
01:33:27,948 --> 01:33:31,819
place this and false if you can't then

2085
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:35,989
what would happen here is we'd say well

2086
01:33:31,819 --> 01:33:39,500
if you know recursive open tile search

2087
01:33:35,988 --> 01:33:44,169
and you know really even this I could do

2088
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:44,170
even more succinctly probably this way

2089
01:33:45,399 --> 01:33:52,460
where we actually call into this thing

2090
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:58,010
first right so if if the thing works out

2091
01:33:52,460 --> 01:34:00,109
oh my then you know we do this otherwise

2092
01:33:58,010 --> 01:34:02,350
we don't etcetera etcetera up something

2093
01:34:00,109 --> 01:34:02,349
like this

2094
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:08,329
and so now instead of just assuming that

2095
01:34:05,658 --> 01:34:10,279
we can place on an open tile we're

2096
01:34:08,329 --> 01:34:13,219
actually going to call through to this

2097
01:34:10,279 --> 01:34:15,469
function and we're gonna give it in

2098
01:34:13,219 --> 01:34:21,529
addition to the location to start at I'm

2099
01:34:15,469 --> 01:34:27,198
also gonna give it the first entity okay

2100
01:34:21,529 --> 01:34:29,479
and so this will actually be the entity

2101
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:32,238
that we're trying to place and we'll go

2102
01:34:29,479 --> 01:34:35,750
from there so here's that call will now

2103
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:37,819
get called off the tile P there and this

2104
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:40,729
you know will happen however happens

2105
01:34:37,819 --> 01:34:42,500
we'll see in a second so let's suppose

2106
01:34:40,729 --> 01:34:45,379
we were gonna make the call structured

2107
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:47,630
like that so the reason I want this to

2108
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:49,880
be recursive is because when we look

2109
01:34:47,630 --> 01:34:53,420
back at how we've spent set up the

2110
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:56,029
entity groups we have this notion that

2111
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:58,310
there's a next pointer and the next

2112
01:34:56,029 --> 01:35:01,009
pointer off of an entity group is going

2113
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:07,639
to have to say where the next person

2114
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:14,449
could have been placed right so here are

2115
01:35:07,639 --> 01:35:16,550
the allowed directions for next so what

2116
01:35:14,448 --> 01:35:19,618
we want to do is say if we were going to

2117
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:23,039
place an entity here on this tile

2118
01:35:19,618 --> 01:35:25,649
who do we have to place next and when we

2119
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:28,069
go to place that next entity where are

2120
01:35:25,649 --> 01:35:30,960
the locations that we could place them

2121
01:35:28,069 --> 01:35:33,329
okay you can see why this is relatively

2122
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,158
complicated but again we're just going

2123
01:35:33,329 --> 01:35:36,569
to brute force it for now so what we're

2124
01:35:35,158 --> 01:35:39,269
gonna say is when we go to do this

2125
01:35:36,569 --> 01:35:41,099
search we're gonna say all right if we

2126
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:46,080
found an open tile that we can place our

2127
01:35:41,099 --> 01:35:50,670
cells on right then what we're going to

2128
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:54,710
do is say if our next entity like

2129
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:54,710
whatever the next entity would had been

2130
01:35:57,349 --> 01:36:08,969
if the next entity could have been

2131
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:10,830
placed as well into the next tile P then

2132
01:36:08,969 --> 01:36:13,139
we're good right and we can break out of

2133
01:36:10,829 --> 01:36:18,179
this and we can finish the the placement

2134
01:36:13,139 --> 01:36:19,949
otherwise we can't make sense I and we

2135
01:36:18,179 --> 01:36:21,149
also want to make sure we put on here we

2136
01:36:19,948 --> 01:36:29,158
need to put an additional thing on

2137
01:36:21,149 --> 01:36:31,229
probably that looks like this I'll talk

2138
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:31,948
a little bit that in a second so why

2139
01:36:31,229 --> 01:36:33,629
don't we do is I'll call this

2140
01:36:31,948 --> 01:36:35,579
recursively and a path entity in

2141
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:37,440
question right we're gonna look up where

2142
01:36:35,579 --> 01:36:38,819
it was supposed to be placed if it could

2143
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:40,079
have been placed there oh and the other

2144
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:41,549
thing we want to do is to terminate this

2145
01:36:40,079 --> 01:36:44,988
we want to make sure that the entity

2146
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:44,989
actually can be placed at all

2147
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:59,909
it's something like this we assume you

2148
01:36:57,029 --> 01:37:05,369
can't place the entity but you know in

2149
01:36:59,909 --> 01:37:06,389
here we actually would do this and so

2150
01:37:05,369 --> 01:37:08,460
what we're doing now is saying look I

2151
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:10,950
assume you can't place the entity go in

2152
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:12,239
find the tile if it's open we're

2153
01:37:10,949 --> 01:37:13,380
starting a structural for now because we

2154
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,609
don't really know what we would do in

2155
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:15,869
the cases where it wasn't but we'd

2156
01:37:14,609 --> 01:37:18,239
probably eventually have to do something

2157
01:37:15,869 --> 01:37:21,059
there once we know more about that now

2158
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:23,550
say assume this tile was occupied keep

2159
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:25,710
trying to place future entities if they

2160
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:27,390
all play successfully all the way down

2161
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:29,579
the recursive chain when we get here

2162
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:32,160
we'll say okay we succeeded and will

2163
01:37:29,579 --> 01:37:34,229
break out otherwise we would end up here

2164
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:36,720
and we'll set this the tile that we

2165
01:37:34,229 --> 01:37:38,459
marked as closed back to open because we

2166
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:40,050
didn't actually use it right and we'll

2167
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:42,659
keep going

2168
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:43,980
if there was no entity to place that

2169
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:44,699
meant we hit the end of the enemy

2170
01:37:43,979 --> 01:37:46,739
placement change

2171
01:37:44,699 --> 01:37:49,409
so therefore the result is true because

2172
01:37:46,739 --> 01:37:51,689
we know by the you know we know we've

2173
01:37:49,409 --> 01:37:53,970
gotten all the way down to all the

2174
01:37:51,689 --> 01:37:55,679
previous entities we replaceable and so

2175
01:37:53,970 --> 01:38:00,090
now we're down to nothing and we just

2176
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:01,380
say ok that means it worked right so the

2177
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:03,180
only other thing we have to do now is

2178
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:04,949
figure out how to update this next tile

2179
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:07,470
P right because we're not doing that so

2180
01:38:04,949 --> 01:38:10,889
we need some way of saying what would

2181
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:12,780
the next tile P be given that the first

2182
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:14,190
tile P that we started with was here and

2183
01:38:12,779 --> 01:38:15,449
that we have a flag that says which

2184
01:38:14,189 --> 01:38:17,819
directions we can go here

2185
01:38:15,449 --> 01:38:20,010
well we know we have some number of

2186
01:38:17,819 --> 01:38:22,439
directions we can go from a tile right

2187
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:25,110
and we just don't know which ones we can

2188
01:38:22,439 --> 01:38:27,839
use but we can pretty easily find out

2189
01:38:25,109 --> 01:38:33,750
all we have to do and in fact I guess I

2190
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:36,239
could even just do it this way right so

2191
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:38,729
when we break out of the loop here well

2192
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:40,409
setting this back I guess we can't

2193
01:38:38,729 --> 01:38:41,849
because the way that that breaks out of

2194
01:38:40,409 --> 01:38:46,289
the loop makes it so we can't do it we

2195
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:47,460
don't want this to happen in there so

2196
01:38:46,289 --> 01:38:49,500
the way that we'd want to do this right

2197
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:51,630
is we want to go through all of the box

2198
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:55,140
directions that we have and for each box

2199
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:57,420
direction we want to check to see

2200
01:38:55,140 --> 01:39:01,130
whether it can go there or not right and

2201
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:01,130
so this is you know something like this

2202
01:39:01,489 --> 01:39:05,750
so we would say okay during the x equals

2203
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:08,680
zero durand x's

2204
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:13,520
lesson counts for each direction index

2205
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:15,920
we will say if and remember we have sort

2206
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:18,260
of a useful routine sir that help us

2207
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:22,579
with this so we can sort of say look

2208
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:25,280
what's the mask for this so we can just

2209
01:39:22,579 --> 01:39:31,239
say you know whatever this direction

2210
01:39:25,279 --> 01:39:36,009
index is here for whatever this one is

2211
01:39:31,239 --> 01:39:38,960
if we're allowed to go that direction so

2212
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:42,199
effectively we would say look if our if

2213
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:49,000
our child what do we want to call this

2214
01:39:42,199 --> 01:39:52,760
here I can't remember what I called it

2215
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:56,989
allowed directions for next so if the

2216
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:58,430
allowed directions that our next pointer

2217
01:39:56,989 --> 01:40:02,779
like when we move to the next one

2218
01:39:58,430 --> 01:40:05,630
if those allowed directions are valid

2219
01:40:02,779 --> 01:40:08,029
right for this if it would allow this

2220
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:10,250
direction to to be one of the place

2221
01:40:08,029 --> 01:40:13,670
directions then we will actually update

2222
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:16,039
it for that direction and try to

2223
01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:18,560
continue placement if it isn't then we

2224
01:40:16,039 --> 01:40:21,800
just don't right because we can't even

2225
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,390
do we can't even try right because we're

2226
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:26,180
not allowed to look in that direction

2227
01:40:23,390 --> 01:40:28,220
not to see whether that's okay or not

2228
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:34,400
and so then here what we would want to

2229
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:37,460
do is say okay you know we just look to

2230
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:40,579
see here if we've got one that gives us

2231
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:44,600
back the Delta it doesn't look like we

2232
01:40:40,579 --> 01:40:47,000
do actually at least not in here so we

2233
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:51,560
would want something in the gen so in

2234
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:52,039
the in the gen math which is this right

2235
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,720
here

2236
01:40:52,039 --> 01:40:56,060
we would want to be able to get a

2237
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,980
directional vector based on one of those

2238
01:40:56,060 --> 01:41:04,460
so we'd want to have a thing here that

2239
01:40:57,979 --> 01:41:07,489
was like gen v3 get direction and this

2240
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:10,119
would take a box surface index of

2241
01:41:07,489 --> 01:41:10,119
direction

2242
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:18,420
and I might do it like this you can't

2243
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:21,510
iterate through enums for some stupid

2244
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:30,180
reason in C++ as as is always the case

2245
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:31,770
in C++ so if I do that right that tells

2246
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:35,310
me that I can go that direction and then

2247
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:42,780
what I would do is say well for the next

2248
01:41:35,310 --> 01:41:44,970
tile P what I want to do is figure out

2249
01:41:42,779 --> 01:41:49,859
what that direction actually is so

2250
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:53,039
that's this I would pass the derp index

2251
01:41:49,859 --> 01:41:55,559
there and it would just add to whatever

2252
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:56,880
my top he was right and I don't know

2253
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:58,350
that we have and we don't actually have

2254
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,619
an operator plus so I would throw an

2255
01:41:58,350 --> 01:42:02,730
operator plus in there as well right

2256
01:42:00,619 --> 01:42:04,109
so I would need to do that and in order

2257
01:42:02,729 --> 01:42:07,589
to do that you can see the way that

2258
01:42:04,109 --> 01:42:11,729
we've got this set up here where the

2259
01:42:07,590 --> 01:42:14,069
it's like set up in this sort of the

2260
01:42:11,729 --> 01:42:16,159
axis index and then the positive or

2261
01:42:14,069 --> 01:42:22,289
negative so it's sort of like saying

2262
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:24,149
here's here's which axis we're talking

2263
01:42:22,289 --> 01:42:27,119
about and here's whether or not that

2264
01:42:24,149 --> 01:42:29,729
axis is positive or negative so we don't

2265
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:33,710
really need to be so specific about

2266
01:42:29,729 --> 01:42:37,829
what's going on we can actually just say

2267
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:42,420
give us the parameters for this surface

2268
01:42:37,829 --> 01:42:45,239
index which is that right that will tell

2269
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:48,109
us the axis index so if we just

2270
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:55,800
initialize the result to zero we can say

2271
01:42:48,109 --> 01:42:58,199
whichever one of these we're on then if

2272
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:00,779
it's positive or negative is all we need

2273
01:42:58,199 --> 01:43:04,050
to know it's either gonna be this for

2274
01:43:00,779 --> 01:43:05,909
this right on that axis or I should say

2275
01:43:04,050 --> 01:43:08,250
this for this because it's scalar right

2276
01:43:05,909 --> 01:43:11,699
so then I can just say all right if it's

2277
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:17,609
positive it's one otherwise it's

2278
01:43:11,699 --> 01:43:19,949
negative one and that's it so that gives

2279
01:43:17,609 --> 01:43:24,029
us the direction we would step to pretty

2280
01:43:19,949 --> 01:43:26,670
easily and what I need to do now in here

2281
01:43:24,029 --> 01:43:30,868
is just say well alright once I get in

2282
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:33,630
next top P I probably want to check to

2283
01:43:30,868 --> 01:43:36,509
make sure it's in bounds to get that

2284
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:40,739
tile back now what I think I want to do

2285
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:43,500
is maybe something I don't know why

2286
01:43:40,738 --> 01:43:46,979
there's not an internal on there Oh God

2287
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:48,779
the flash of death what I probably want

2288
01:43:46,979 --> 01:43:51,448
to do here when I call that get tile

2289
01:43:48,779 --> 01:43:54,750
function is I want to have one that

2290
01:43:51,448 --> 01:43:56,939
actually checks the bounds and so if you

2291
01:43:54,750 --> 01:44:00,710
look at what goes on here you know maybe

2292
01:43:56,939 --> 01:44:04,368
the better way to look at this right I

2293
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:08,969
use that there's a test tile or a like

2294
01:44:04,368 --> 01:44:10,380
check tile not sure how to phrase it but

2295
01:44:08,969 --> 01:44:14,309
basically I want something that will

2296
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:16,170
return zero when it's out of bounds you

2297
01:44:14,309 --> 01:44:18,239
know what I mean so maybe you know what

2298
01:44:16,170 --> 01:44:21,389
I could argue that that should just be

2299
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:32,698
always what happens so you know maybe

2300
01:44:21,389 --> 01:44:33,989
this just looks like this because a lot

2301
01:44:32,698 --> 01:44:35,399
of times you're gonna do a fetch and you

2302
01:44:33,988 --> 01:44:36,808
just want to say is there a tile there

2303
01:44:35,399 --> 01:44:39,509
you know I don't know because I'm like

2304
01:44:36,809 --> 01:44:42,449
procedurally doing some stuff you know

2305
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:47,730
what I mean and so you may actually want

2306
01:44:42,448 --> 01:44:50,308
to do something more like this you know

2307
01:44:47,729 --> 01:44:52,468
what I mean so there were we get to do a

2308
01:44:50,309 --> 01:44:55,279
get tile in here we would do an

2309
01:44:52,469 --> 01:44:58,050
assertion because it has to always be

2310
01:44:55,279 --> 01:45:00,719
true but in other parts of the code we

2311
01:44:58,050 --> 01:45:05,460
would not do that we would say okay it's

2312
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:06,868
not always going to be accurate or sorry

2313
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:10,260
there's not always gonna be a tile there

2314
01:45:06,868 --> 01:45:13,529
and that's actually fine so when I do

2315
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:15,329
this call again working all the way

2316
01:45:13,529 --> 01:45:18,538
through now what I would do is I'd say

2317
01:45:15,328 --> 01:45:23,908
look let's go ahead and get a genuine

2318
01:45:18,538 --> 01:45:28,229
tile there's the tile I would use a get

2319
01:45:23,908 --> 01:45:30,658
tile for next tile P if the tile is

2320
01:45:28,229 --> 01:45:32,638
valid then we do this otherwise we don't

2321
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:35,908
and that handles the case where we were

2322
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:38,038
looking over the edge somewhere in sort

2323
01:45:35,908 --> 01:45:43,078
of the placement scheme

2324
01:45:38,038 --> 01:45:44,309
and off we would go right okay so the

2325
01:45:43,078 --> 01:45:46,259
last thing we want to do here is we

2326
01:45:44,309 --> 01:45:49,050
really don't want to do most of this

2327
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:53,340
stuff in the case where the entity

2328
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:55,288
actually doesn't exist so if the child

2329
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:57,599
doesn't exist we want to just consider

2330
01:45:55,288 --> 01:45:59,729
it done and so looking at this it's not

2331
01:45:57,599 --> 01:46:01,920
quite as nice as I would like it to be

2332
01:45:59,729 --> 01:46:03,779
if that makes sense

2333
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,449
and so I probably need to do this a

2334
01:46:03,779 --> 01:46:11,189
little bit more carefully that way and

2335
01:46:06,448 --> 01:46:16,578
so what I would do here is probably say

2336
01:46:11,189 --> 01:46:21,078
something like alright let's suppose

2337
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:25,558
when you call into this with an entity

2338
01:46:21,078 --> 01:46:31,259
maybe what it does is it says when it

2339
01:46:25,559 --> 01:46:33,360
gets down here we will set the tile in

2340
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:39,480
question this is actually the next tile

2341
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:42,569
right so maybe what we'll do here is say

2342
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:43,618
oh well maybe we passed the tile in

2343
01:46:42,569 --> 01:46:45,630
there

2344
01:46:43,618 --> 01:46:48,448
hard to say or well you know what we

2345
01:46:45,630 --> 01:47:01,498
could do - we could actually also pass

2346
01:46:48,448 --> 01:47:04,169
in the Delta like this that would

2347
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:09,929
probably work - so what we would do

2348
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:15,630
there is we just say okay yeah the tile

2349
01:47:09,929 --> 01:47:19,319
comes by saying it's this plus D tau P D

2350
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:25,199
tau P comes from here right we don't

2351
01:47:19,319 --> 01:47:26,998
ever do this that doesn't happen and we

2352
01:47:25,198 --> 01:47:29,759
set the tile open or closed stuff a

2353
01:47:26,998 --> 01:47:38,550
little bit more specifically so we do

2354
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:44,998
this like so and probably what we would

2355
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:49,170
do in here is say that we look and if

2356
01:47:44,998 --> 01:47:51,380
this never returns false then we assume

2357
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:56,069
the result was true

2358
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:58,529
something like this that's not quite and

2359
01:47:56,069 --> 01:48:00,449
I love that either we need we want to

2360
01:47:58,529 --> 01:48:02,969
make this the simplest we can so we're

2361
01:48:00,449 --> 01:48:05,099
doing the least amount of work it seems

2362
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:08,270
like maybe we need this to always pass

2363
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:13,140
an enemy so we want to do this check

2364
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:23,750
maybe inside so we maybe want to do

2365
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:30,900
something like this so we would say yeah

2366
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:34,560
in the case to see if this flows a

2367
01:48:30,899 --> 01:48:37,679
little better so in here would say

2368
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,940
here's the tile P I guess the detail P

2369
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:40,829
could even be rolled into there I

2370
01:48:38,939 --> 01:48:50,009
suppose it's fine we don't actually need

2371
01:48:40,829 --> 01:48:52,619
to do that there right that's fine so if

2372
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:55,650
we'd say okay look up that tile if it's

2373
01:48:52,619 --> 01:48:58,409
open then we go ahead and close it

2374
01:48:55,649 --> 01:49:00,210
we then see if there's nothing else to

2375
01:48:58,409 --> 01:49:02,489
place we assume them then we're good to

2376
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:06,480
go like go ahead and exit out like

2377
01:49:02,489 --> 01:49:08,219
unwind the stack and you're done if if

2378
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:10,769
we do have another entity to place then

2379
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:12,180
let's step through each of these and we

2380
01:49:10,770 --> 01:49:14,010
won't assume the results true we'll

2381
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:16,650
assume we have to place it so we'll test

2382
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:18,210
each one to see if we can we will look

2383
01:49:16,649 --> 01:49:21,989
for where it should have been placed and

2384
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:24,680
then we'll actually you know recall the

2385
01:49:21,989 --> 01:49:30,479
recursive function to keep that going

2386
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:33,539
that seems good so I think that's all

2387
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:35,609
fine we can if we want to be a little

2388
01:49:33,539 --> 01:49:37,560
prophylactic here and just say look if

2389
01:49:35,609 --> 01:49:40,139
there's nothing to place then we're just

2390
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:42,270
not going to return we're gonna return

2391
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:48,390
false because that's just a bad thing

2392
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:50,520
so we'll just nullify that out right so

2393
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:53,369
that seems fine the I guess the other

2394
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:54,980
way we could do this is allow that so

2395
01:49:53,369 --> 01:49:59,809
maybe in here we could do something like

2396
01:49:54,979 --> 01:50:03,599
look if the entity group first entity

2397
01:49:59,810 --> 01:50:04,650
doesn't exist then just don't try to

2398
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:08,600
place it what does the

2399
01:50:04,649 --> 01:50:08,599
assume that the answer is true right

2400
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:18,329
right that seems good enough to me

2401
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:20,250
although I can't imagine what you'd even

2402
01:50:18,329 --> 01:50:22,198
be calling it for at that point so that

2403
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:24,020
kind of seems busted I'm just going to

2404
01:50:22,198 --> 01:50:26,129
go ahead and say let's let that fault

2405
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:27,659
because why are you calling the function

2406
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:30,329
who what exactly you think you're going

2407
01:50:27,658 --> 01:50:34,799
to place that point so I think that's

2408
01:50:30,329 --> 01:50:38,819
all we really need there and I think

2409
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:41,340
that gives us what we want when we

2410
01:50:38,819 --> 01:50:44,158
actually go now to unwind this and we've

2411
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:48,119
found everything we want to probably now

2412
01:50:44,158 --> 01:50:50,819
set this allowed direction here to be

2413
01:50:48,119 --> 01:50:53,819
the one we actually used so we probably

2414
01:50:50,819 --> 01:51:00,389
want to set the mask so like we'd do

2415
01:50:53,819 --> 01:51:04,109
this so now we know that that's the

2416
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:11,219
direction it's actually going in maybe

2417
01:51:04,109 --> 01:51:13,679
we don't quite want to do that maybe you

2418
01:51:11,219 --> 01:51:15,539
want this and then what we could do is

2419
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:18,029
say well you know when we loop through

2420
01:51:15,539 --> 01:51:20,969
these we then want to know where did we

2421
01:51:18,029 --> 01:51:24,899
actually place the thing and so in here

2422
01:51:20,969 --> 01:51:29,010
we could just say well here's the

2423
01:51:24,899 --> 01:51:30,960
direction I actually used then we can

2424
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:37,619
finally answer this question down here

2425
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:41,279
right where is it when we actually need

2426
01:51:37,619 --> 01:51:43,869
to go to update tile P we can just do

2427
01:51:41,279 --> 01:51:46,670
that because we can say well tau P

2428
01:51:43,869 --> 01:51:51,920
[Music]

2429
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:54,390
equals tile P plus def direction and

2430
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:59,210
it's whatever direction we actually used

2431
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:59,210
so the place entity Direction used

2432
01:52:00,198 --> 01:52:08,399
something like that and so I think

2433
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:12,210
that's roughly what we would need let me

2434
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:14,899
just go through these one by one that's

2435
01:52:12,210 --> 01:52:14,899
actually that

2436
01:52:15,279 --> 01:52:28,599
that's all fine what else we got the

2437
01:52:26,319 --> 01:52:30,399
plus we need to implement and the Plus

2438
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:31,539
me with us so we knew that we had to do

2439
01:52:30,399 --> 01:52:33,819
that and so that's the only other thing

2440
01:52:31,539 --> 01:52:36,130
we've got there and so that's just the

2441
01:52:33,819 --> 01:52:37,989
operator for these two so that's

2442
01:52:36,130 --> 01:52:39,699
basically just an operator plus between

2443
01:52:37,989 --> 01:52:44,469
these two which is pretty easy to

2444
01:52:39,699 --> 01:52:57,880
implement right it's just this here's

2445
01:52:44,470 --> 01:53:00,250
the result so that just says look just

2446
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:06,250
add them the way you would you know

2447
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:09,100
normally next Direction used is not a

2448
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:13,810
member of place entity is that really

2449
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:16,960
true next direction used oh you're right

2450
01:53:13,810 --> 01:53:19,750
sorry I didn't mean place entity I meant

2451
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:22,899
pending entity because we're actually

2452
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:31,899
talking about the placement instructions

2453
01:53:22,899 --> 01:53:35,529
not the result sooo anyway now we should

2454
01:53:31,899 --> 01:53:42,159
be able to place double double with

2455
01:53:35,529 --> 01:53:45,250
things and so for example in theory if I

2456
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:50,559
wanted to place the cat so that it was

2457
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:53,680
below the like below the orphan for

2458
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:57,160
example I should theoretically be able

2459
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:59,500
to do that we're pretty much out of time

2460
01:53:57,159 --> 01:54:01,269
for this stream so I don't want to go

2461
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:03,819
too long we ended up doing a bunch of

2462
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:07,420
good generator work stuff that I wanted

2463
01:54:03,819 --> 01:54:09,250
to do so that was good

2464
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:11,050
but we won't really have time to get to

2465
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:13,840
the camera part that I wanted to do but

2466
01:54:11,050 --> 01:54:15,100
we'll do that tomorrow so but I would

2467
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:17,500
like to just test to see if this is

2468
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:20,289
working or so that we know whether we've

2469
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:23,439
got debugging to do or not and so on so

2470
01:54:20,289 --> 01:54:25,269
in here if I wanted to actually put a

2471
01:54:23,439 --> 01:54:28,308
little bit more specificity in here

2472
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:31,039
kuden excuse me

2473
01:54:28,309 --> 01:54:33,619
when we do this place whorfin call what

2474
01:54:31,038 --> 01:54:40,009
you can see here is it's placing you

2475
01:54:33,618 --> 01:54:43,219
know this a Danity call right when I

2476
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:47,150
create one of those I'm interested to

2477
01:54:43,219 --> 01:54:51,229
potentially add it to the group

2478
01:54:47,149 --> 01:54:54,649
that's getting constructed here and so I

2479
01:54:51,229 --> 01:54:59,780
could choose to place an orphan and the

2480
01:54:54,649 --> 01:55:02,779
cat right and so I'm interested to see

2481
01:54:59,779 --> 01:55:07,819
what would happen if I did that so if I

2482
01:55:02,779 --> 01:55:10,578
was to do say this and I just said all

2483
01:55:07,819 --> 01:55:13,099
right we're we're gonna do like the

2484
01:55:10,578 --> 01:55:16,038
orphan placement thing here I'm gonna

2485
01:55:13,099 --> 01:55:20,719
create also a cat so there's gonna be

2486
01:55:16,038 --> 01:55:24,889
like a child entity here you and I'm

2487
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:27,408
saying how would I do that there's gonna

2488
01:55:24,889 --> 01:55:29,809
be cats on cats on cats you know what

2489
01:55:27,408 --> 01:55:33,049
I'm saying just lots and lots and lots

2490
01:55:29,809 --> 01:55:36,849
of cats so if I wanted to create lots

2491
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:40,429
and lots of cats how would I do that

2492
01:55:36,849 --> 01:55:42,199
let's let's just take a look if I want

2493
01:55:40,429 --> 01:55:43,969
to string it on to this I would

2494
01:55:42,198 --> 01:55:51,098
basically say like you know a pen or

2495
01:55:43,969 --> 01:55:51,099
something I guess actually it's here

2496
01:55:56,380 --> 01:56:00,440
right

2497
01:55:57,559 --> 01:56:04,880
so I basically say add it to this one

2498
01:56:00,439 --> 01:56:06,859
maybe I don't know if I love that syntax

2499
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,690
exactly we may want to play with that a

2500
01:56:06,859 --> 01:56:10,399
little bit but it'd be something like

2501
01:56:08,689 --> 01:56:13,819
this and then I would have to give it

2502
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:15,198
some information about in fact I think

2503
01:56:13,819 --> 01:56:17,389
I'd prefer it like this which means I

2504
01:56:15,198 --> 01:56:20,058
should probably flip the way it's doing

2505
01:56:17,389 --> 01:56:23,059
here as well meaning I think rooms

2506
01:56:20,059 --> 01:56:24,979
should probably come first but anyway in

2507
01:56:23,059 --> 01:56:29,510
here I would need to give it that mask

2508
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:30,829
so inside the mask stuff here I would

2509
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:33,889
need to say like what directions it can

2510
01:56:30,828 --> 01:56:36,469
be placed and so maybe I say like look

2511
01:56:33,889 --> 01:56:38,599
it's gotta be it's always got to be to

2512
01:56:36,469 --> 01:56:43,130
the south so if you place an orphan you

2513
01:56:38,599 --> 01:56:47,440
gotta place a child to the south makes

2514
01:56:43,130 --> 01:56:51,529
and so what I need is a call that will

2515
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:54,619
enforce that rule and so that's pretty

2516
01:56:51,529 --> 01:56:56,988
simple all it's basically saying here is

2517
01:56:54,619 --> 01:56:59,630
look I'm appending to this the group

2518
01:56:56,988 --> 01:57:01,908
that this child's in and so I should be

2519
01:56:59,630 --> 01:57:05,510
able to just string it to the end of

2520
01:57:01,908 --> 01:57:07,779
that with with really I don't think

2521
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:11,420
there's really much more to it than that

2522
01:57:07,779 --> 01:57:18,920
so here's the parent here's the child

2523
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:21,859
here's the mask and so all we be saying

2524
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:29,449
here is all right the parent next equals

2525
01:57:21,859 --> 01:57:31,939
the child child next equals the parent

2526
01:57:29,448 --> 01:57:33,559
next that sort of thing so we just kind

2527
01:57:31,939 --> 01:57:34,939
of like lump it on there I'd have to

2528
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:37,340
assert that this doesn't already have a

2529
01:57:34,939 --> 01:57:38,979
chain so we may want to do this a little

2530
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:41,060
bit differently in the future we'll see

2531
01:57:38,979 --> 01:57:45,250
but really that's all we're talking

2532
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:47,750
about and then we would need to set that

2533
01:57:45,250 --> 01:57:50,420
allowed directions for next needs to be

2534
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:53,569
this this direction mask you know what I

2535
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:55,640
mean but I think that's it I don't think

2536
01:57:53,569 --> 01:58:02,448
there's very much else to do there it's

2537
01:57:55,640 --> 01:58:04,489
stup not super complicated so it should

2538
01:58:02,448 --> 01:58:06,319
be pretty pretty simple to build this

2539
01:58:04,488 --> 01:58:08,089
change chains now whether or not they

2540
01:58:06,319 --> 01:58:12,189
work that's a that's another question

2541
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:12,190
oops that was supposed to be a knot

2542
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:27,090
okay

2543
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:28,710
so oh yes so I was supposed to check to

2544
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:30,029
see whether that tile was valid because

2545
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:35,010
again remember that's gonna look

2546
01:58:30,029 --> 01:58:36,630
off-the-grid potentially so I said I

2547
01:58:35,010 --> 01:58:38,730
needed to do that and then I didn't do

2548
01:58:36,630 --> 01:58:41,579
it so unsurprisingly

2549
01:58:38,729 --> 01:58:43,879
it didn't work so when we're searching

2550
01:58:41,579 --> 01:58:47,789
here this is actually supposed to be

2551
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:51,920
that meaning if there is a tile there

2552
01:58:47,789 --> 01:58:51,920
and the tile is open then we can proceed

2553
01:58:52,729 --> 01:58:58,649
and off we go so it looks like it didn't

2554
01:58:55,649 --> 01:59:00,719
find anything for a placement here which

2555
01:58:58,649 --> 01:59:03,420
means that it's it since it should be

2556
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:06,600
able to find something I think that

2557
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:09,539
means we screwed up right I'm not sure

2558
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:11,039
how we screwed up exactly so we're gonna

2559
01:59:09,539 --> 01:59:13,019
kind of have to step through there and

2560
01:59:11,039 --> 01:59:14,670
see but I don't think there should have

2561
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:16,320
been any cases that it couldn't resolve

2562
01:59:14,670 --> 01:59:17,850
because all we're doing is placing like

2563
01:59:16,319 --> 01:59:20,399
two entities in two rooms with tons of

2564
01:59:17,850 --> 01:59:24,570
empty tiles so in theory this should

2565
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:27,089
have worked just fine and yeah I don't

2566
01:59:24,569 --> 01:59:35,239
know what would have been what did I end

2567
01:59:27,090 --> 01:59:35,239
up passing here Bach's mass

2568
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:50,570
so being able to place that to the South

2569
01:59:47,079 --> 01:59:58,369
should have been fine and so something

2570
01:59:50,569 --> 02:00:01,099
in here is is just not correct this is

2571
01:59:58,369 --> 02:00:01,670
wrong so that could actually be part of

2572
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:03,440
the problem

2573
02:00:01,670 --> 02:00:05,539
so yeah in fact it's almost certainly a

2574
02:00:03,439 --> 02:00:07,039
problem so when we set open equal to

2575
02:00:05,539 --> 02:00:09,649
false we need to then check to see

2576
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:14,989
whether or not we've actually placed so

2577
02:00:09,649 --> 02:00:17,449
if we haven't placed the thing then the

2578
02:00:14,989 --> 02:00:19,639
tile open should set back to true right

2579
02:00:17,449 --> 02:00:21,289
if we if we were not able to place it if

2580
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:32,000
that makes sense

2581
02:00:21,289 --> 02:00:34,670
so I think that's probably fine so let's

2582
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,079
see if we got what we wanted it looks

2583
02:00:34,670 --> 02:00:37,250
like we did so you can see there's

2584
02:00:36,079 --> 02:00:40,100
ghosts cats

2585
02:00:37,250 --> 02:00:42,170
well not ghosts cats but Hannah's being

2586
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:44,630
placed to the south of each one let's

2587
02:00:42,170 --> 02:00:46,520
try briefly switching it to north just

2588
02:00:44,630 --> 02:00:47,690
to make sure that that worked and then I

2589
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:52,420
think we're done for the day

2590
02:00:47,689 --> 02:00:52,419
I'll take brief Q&amp;A so here's north

2591
02:00:58,779 --> 02:01:02,170
and so this should have flipped yeah it

2592
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:04,149
did

2593
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:06,250
um so that's great I think that's all I

2594
02:01:04,149 --> 02:01:08,019
really wanted and that's good we can use

2595
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:10,479
that for lots of things so I'm pretty

2596
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:11,020
happy with that and so we will go from

2597
02:01:10,479 --> 02:01:12,969
there

2598
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:14,560
all right let's go to a brief Q&amp;A just

2599
02:01:12,970 --> 02:01:16,240
to see if anyone has any questions about

2600
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:18,460
what we did there again that was just

2601
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:19,779
we ended up poops it's not what I wanted

2602
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:23,920
to type you want to type it in here

2603
02:01:19,779 --> 02:01:24,489
you okay oops that's cute yes that won't

2604
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:34,359
help

2605
02:01:24,489 --> 02:01:37,359
come on Q eh okay so there we go

2606
02:01:34,359 --> 02:01:40,329
if anyone has any questions I will be

2607
02:01:37,359 --> 02:01:41,739
happy to answer them and so again the

2608
02:01:40,329 --> 02:01:43,210
reason I want to get that done is

2609
02:01:41,739 --> 02:01:45,789
because I'd like to put in squares you

2610
02:01:43,210 --> 02:01:48,310
can hop on and that are related to the

2611
02:01:45,789 --> 02:01:50,050
orphans and then they can pop up some

2612
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:54,690
dialog and stuff like that and so I just

2613
02:01:50,050 --> 02:01:54,690
wanted that that to work and the camera

2614
02:01:54,899 --> 02:02:01,539
will you know will just be a good way to

2615
02:01:58,119 --> 02:02:02,710
test that out and it will also let us

2616
02:02:01,539 --> 02:02:06,149
make sure that our camera code is

2617
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:06,149
working properly which I also want to do

2618
02:02:10,029 --> 02:02:13,109
any questions

2619
02:02:38,979 --> 02:02:47,019
haven't done much on tumf yes its

2620
02:02:41,289 --> 02:02:48,550
pending a rewrite in Odin okay seems

2621
02:02:47,020 --> 02:02:50,230
like you had it all working why would

2622
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:54,430
you want to rewrite it in a different

2623
02:02:50,229 --> 02:02:57,969
language could you make an elevator in

2624
02:02:54,430 --> 02:03:00,159
the game sure I don't think I will

2625
02:02:57,970 --> 02:03:02,050
because I don't tend to like elevator as

2626
02:03:00,159 --> 02:03:03,789
much so I don't know that we would have

2627
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:11,020
an elevator we might have some things

2628
02:03:03,789 --> 02:03:12,970
that that move around like inside a room

2629
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:24,730
that are going around like this that you

2630
02:03:12,970 --> 02:03:26,770
would jump on they'd move but I wrestled

2631
02:03:24,729 --> 02:03:28,179
deBeer hey case you have topic is it

2632
02:03:26,770 --> 02:03:29,920
beneficial performance-wise you switch

2633
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:31,510
statements instead of if-else blocks as

2634
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:33,489
far as I can understand from disassembly

2635
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:34,840
using the switch statement allows that

2636
02:03:33,488 --> 02:03:36,488
to compute where to jump to directly

2637
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:38,980
without invoking comp instruction for

2638
02:03:36,488 --> 02:03:42,539
each case is that correct if the answer

2639
02:03:38,979 --> 02:03:45,939
is it it's actually kind of complicated

2640
02:03:42,539 --> 02:03:49,119
the it depends very heavily on the

2641
02:03:45,939 --> 02:03:50,889
optimizer technically speaking there's

2642
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:52,869
really no reason that the optimizer

2643
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:55,329
can't just take a series of if-else

2644
02:03:52,869 --> 02:03:56,800
blocks and turn them into a switch

2645
02:03:55,329 --> 02:03:58,449
statement if they tend to test

2646
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:01,449
sequential values the question is just

2647
02:03:58,449 --> 02:04:03,189
whether it does or not furthermore a lot

2648
02:04:01,449 --> 02:04:05,079
of compilers actually don't optimize

2649
02:04:03,189 --> 02:04:06,579
switch statements into jumps unless

2650
02:04:05,079 --> 02:04:13,359
there's more than a certain number of

2651
02:04:06,579 --> 02:04:16,269
switches so the I hate to sound like a

2652
02:04:13,359 --> 02:04:18,819
broken record but as I often say with

2653
02:04:16,270 --> 02:04:23,770
performance things unless you test it

2654
02:04:18,819 --> 02:04:25,659
you don't know every time like pretty

2655
02:04:23,770 --> 02:04:29,050
much every time you're gonna if you care

2656
02:04:25,659 --> 02:04:36,039
about that which one it does you're just

2657
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:39,610
gonna have to look and see because you

2658
02:04:36,039 --> 02:04:42,850
know it it will it will basically it be

2659
02:04:39,609 --> 02:04:44,259
entirely dependent on what the optimizer

2660
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:46,510
chooses to do and you'll probably get

2661
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:48,570
different results between different

2662
02:04:46,510 --> 02:04:50,960
compilers

2663
02:04:48,569 --> 02:04:50,960
so

2664
02:05:00,319 --> 02:05:03,920
off-topic but I watched her 30 million

2665
02:05:02,359 --> 02:05:05,989
lines of code and was wondering whether

2666
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:07,489
you think that Intel and other hardware

2667
02:05:05,989 --> 02:05:08,929
manufacture be more likely to adopt an

2668
02:05:07,489 --> 02:05:10,729
ice ax as a response to consumer

2669
02:05:08,930 --> 02:05:12,289
unfriendly policies from Microsoft if

2670
02:05:10,729 --> 02:05:14,089
they're scared of the consumer PC market

2671
02:05:12,289 --> 02:05:17,569
collapsing um

2672
02:05:14,090 --> 02:05:20,060
I don't know because the decision-making

2673
02:05:17,569 --> 02:05:22,130
process inside companies like Intel or

2674
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:23,810
AMD it's very opaque to me and I don't

2675
02:05:22,130 --> 02:05:25,850
really you know you have to understand

2676
02:05:23,810 --> 02:05:28,039
that large corporations like that aren't

2677
02:05:25,850 --> 02:05:29,300
it's not just like I'm like I'm sitting

2678
02:05:28,039 --> 02:05:30,949
around and I say something and it

2679
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:32,659
happens right it's like there's a lot of

2680
02:05:30,949 --> 02:05:34,279
meetings there's shareholder meetings

2681
02:05:32,659 --> 02:05:37,039
there's boards of directors there's all

2682
02:05:34,279 --> 02:05:38,960
these sorts of things and so large-scale

2683
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:41,329
strategic decisions aren't things that

2684
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:42,920
don't that just happen because someone

2685
02:05:41,329 --> 02:05:45,380
thinks it's a good idea they have a lot

2686
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:47,890
of buy-in and there's a lot of social

2687
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:51,369
and political implications of them

2688
02:05:47,890 --> 02:05:55,820
inside the company and so I have no idea

2689
02:05:51,369 --> 02:05:57,949
would be my answer in terms of arguments

2690
02:05:55,819 --> 02:06:02,229
I have made it's definitely one I make

2691
02:05:57,949 --> 02:06:06,260
often I'm like look why do you want to

2692
02:06:02,229 --> 02:06:08,179
rely on Microsoft to deliver you the

2693
02:06:06,260 --> 02:06:09,590
platform you need to succeed why not

2694
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:12,740
just deliver that platform yourself

2695
02:06:09,590 --> 02:06:13,819
right why not just make an Intel chip

2696
02:06:12,739 --> 02:06:16,489
that just runs

2697
02:06:13,819 --> 02:06:21,880
why do you what Windows does nothing

2698
02:06:16,489 --> 02:06:25,369
it's it's almost completely useless it's

2699
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:27,020
you know Intel already ships things that

2700
02:06:25,369 --> 02:06:30,590
have like Linux built into them for

2701
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:35,110
example like the Knights landing what

2702
02:06:30,590 --> 02:06:35,110
they call it the Xeon Phi right just you

2703
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:42,620
know why don't you want to just ship

2704
02:06:38,210 --> 02:06:43,550
apart it just works you know why who

2705
02:06:42,619 --> 02:06:47,510
needs it

2706
02:06:43,550 --> 02:06:48,829
you know it's it's not good why not

2707
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:50,300
start shipping something that runs out

2708
02:06:48,829 --> 02:06:52,519
of the box and see if people adopt it

2709
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:54,529
worst cases they don't you have billions

2710
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:56,330
and billions and billions of dollars it

2711
02:06:54,529 --> 02:06:57,979
would be a small investment to make and

2712
02:06:56,329 --> 02:07:00,340
it seems like really good security and

2713
02:06:57,979 --> 02:07:03,379
really good insurance and why not and

2714
02:07:00,340 --> 02:07:07,670
again it's just an argument there's just

2715
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:09,500
an argument I'm making I but but I don't

2716
02:07:07,670 --> 02:07:11,510
know you know I don't know what sorts of

2717
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:12,460
things resonate with them and what sorts

2718
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:14,949
don't

2719
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:17,739
to be completely honest with you I think

2720
02:07:14,949 --> 02:07:20,829
in their mind we're the small part of

2721
02:07:17,738 --> 02:07:22,479
the wheel of cheese because their

2722
02:07:20,829 --> 02:07:24,850
highest margins stuff is server stuff

2723
02:07:22,479 --> 02:07:27,339
that all runs Linux anyway none of its

2724
02:07:24,850 --> 02:07:32,140
gonna run Windows and they know that

2725
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:33,610
going forwards right and the other part

2726
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:34,869
is they they really want to be in like

2727
02:07:33,609 --> 02:07:36,729
phones and stuff right they they're

2728
02:07:34,869 --> 02:07:40,238
trying to produce low-power chips now

2729
02:07:36,729 --> 02:07:43,629
right they're not thinking desktop so I

2730
02:07:40,238 --> 02:07:44,889
don't while I think it is important to

2731
02:07:43,630 --> 02:07:46,539
their business and they should care

2732
02:07:44,890 --> 02:07:47,980
because there is money there and they're

2733
02:07:46,539 --> 02:07:49,300
making that money right now and that

2734
02:07:47,979 --> 02:07:51,488
money could go away and that should be

2735
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:54,369
scary I think sometimes companies are

2736
02:07:51,488 --> 02:07:57,279
both more focused on their new markets

2737
02:07:54,369 --> 02:08:00,909
and they forget to consolidate their

2738
02:07:57,279 --> 02:08:03,099
gains sometimes and keep hold of them I

2739
02:08:00,909 --> 02:08:06,130
mean it's how Microsoft lost a lot of

2740
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:07,329
its market right now a lot of how a lot

2741
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:09,850
of the market for Windows went away is

2742
02:08:07,329 --> 02:08:12,909
they failed to see the threats to that

2743
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:14,380
market and that's why there's huge

2744
02:08:12,909 --> 02:08:18,130
segments of the market now that run on

2745
02:08:14,380 --> 02:08:23,640
things like iPad like iOS you know or

2746
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:23,640
whatever and Linux for service

2747
02:08:29,569 --> 02:08:33,429
or all the rooms going to be generated

2748
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:35,330
yes

2749
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:37,640
have you played in any of the souls

2750
02:08:35,329 --> 02:08:38,630
games what do you think of them I don't

2751
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:41,680
know if I asked this question before I

2752
02:08:38,630 --> 02:08:41,680
have not played them now

2753
02:08:49,850 --> 02:08:55,430
is the game granny containing both 2d

2754
02:08:51,590 --> 02:09:02,270
and 3d assets not really there are 3d

2755
02:08:55,430 --> 02:09:03,650
cubes but no other shapes probably don't

2756
02:09:02,270 --> 02:09:06,880
quote me on that maybe we'll add another

2757
02:09:03,649 --> 02:09:10,670
shape someday but we only allow

2758
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:13,069
structural cube tiles basically and then

2759
02:09:10,670 --> 02:09:15,859
everything else is a spray so it's 2d

2760
02:09:13,069 --> 02:09:26,210
assets only really even though there is

2761
02:09:15,859 --> 02:09:27,589
some 3d in it regarding until shipping

2762
02:09:26,210 --> 02:09:29,210
their own platform that just runs how

2763
02:09:27,590 --> 02:09:31,880
would that look would there be a

2764
02:09:29,210 --> 02:09:33,649
minimalistic OS boot once you power on

2765
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:34,400
the machine sorry if this is obvious but

2766
02:09:33,649 --> 02:09:36,949
I don't quite get it

2767
02:09:34,399 --> 02:09:41,449
yeah I mean one way to look at it would

2768
02:09:36,949 --> 02:09:45,500
be if you take a look at the actual

2769
02:09:41,449 --> 02:09:53,119
hardware spec so if there's USB there's

2770
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:57,890
nvme and there's the GPU that they're

2771
02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:59,599
shipping that together comprises

2772
02:09:57,890 --> 02:10:02,420
basically a complete operating system

2773
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:04,880
API without actually having much else in

2774
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:06,409
there there's a little bit you might

2775
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:07,730
want to do for task management but you

2776
02:10:06,409 --> 02:10:10,760
could also just leave that up the people

2777
02:10:07,729 --> 02:10:14,419
writing the software for it right this

2778
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:17,630
is a hypervisor part and so what what

2779
02:10:14,420 --> 02:10:21,619
I'm sort of suggesting is just write a

2780
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:24,409
minimal write a 50,000 line program that

2781
02:10:21,619 --> 02:10:30,140
is just a bare-bones operating system

2782
02:10:24,409 --> 02:10:35,779
that runs your chip write publish source

2783
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:39,320
code and let's go from there you know we

2784
02:10:35,779 --> 02:10:42,019
can solve these problems but there's

2785
02:10:39,319 --> 02:10:44,479
such a huge buy-in cost when nobody will

2786
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:47,210
commit to an actual Hardware interface

2787
02:10:44,479 --> 02:10:48,469
that it's just never gonna happen I mean

2788
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:50,390
you can even bake that stuff into the

2789
02:10:48,470 --> 02:10:53,060
BIOS firmware and that's not my favorite

2790
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:55,430
answer but like suppose you did that

2791
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:57,830
just even that then we would at least be

2792
02:10:55,430 --> 02:11:00,530
back to the dass days where you could

2793
02:10:57,829 --> 02:11:02,359
write something that boots directly from

2794
02:11:00,529 --> 02:11:03,380
startup and basically just uses BIOS

2795
02:11:02,359 --> 02:11:09,649
calls no

2796
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:11,270
right for the most part so it's really

2797
02:11:09,649 --> 02:11:14,589
just I'm just saying look give us

2798
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:14,590
something you know

2799
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:21,170
I because I feel like we I feel like we

2800
02:11:19,158 --> 02:11:25,119
could have a good chance of making

2801
02:11:21,170 --> 02:11:29,389
something reasonable if we just could

2802
02:11:25,119 --> 02:11:30,590
take the ridiculously huge driver space

2803
02:11:29,389 --> 02:11:32,779
we currently have to deal with and

2804
02:11:30,590 --> 02:11:35,150
shrink it down to just unknown set that

2805
02:11:32,779 --> 02:11:36,529
people would agreed to support going

2806
02:11:35,149 --> 02:11:40,579
forward I think we could do some good

2807
02:11:36,529 --> 02:11:41,899
work that's all so I don't even it

2808
02:11:40,579 --> 02:11:44,149
doesn't even need to be settled it just

2809
02:11:41,899 --> 02:11:46,549
needs like like work with us right like

2810
02:11:44,149 --> 02:11:49,519
work with people like us who want to do

2811
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:51,440
this low-level stuff let's see if we can

2812
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:53,780
work something out right is all I'm even

2813
02:11:51,439 --> 02:11:56,210
saying so we don't even we don't even

2814
02:11:53,779 --> 02:11:58,939
need to agree on the specifics yet just

2815
02:11:56,210 --> 02:12:00,350
let's let's get together let's have some

2816
02:11:58,939 --> 02:12:02,928
streams where we talk about it you know

2817
02:12:00,350 --> 02:12:08,239
let's just let's just go take a baby

2818
02:12:02,929 --> 02:12:09,739
steps right because I don't care exactly

2819
02:12:08,238 --> 02:12:11,629
what form it takes I have my opinions

2820
02:12:09,738 --> 02:12:13,399
about what I'd like to see but you know

2821
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:15,139
I don't have to get my way

2822
02:12:13,399 --> 02:12:18,379
I just want to see something I want to

2823
02:12:15,139 --> 02:12:21,730
see something happen that gets us off of

2824
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:24,440
these big monolithic unwieldy

2825
02:12:21,729 --> 02:12:25,129
problematic unreliable breaks all the

2826
02:12:24,439 --> 02:12:27,019
time

2827
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:29,329
spies on you blah blah blah blah blah

2828
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:31,960
like listing every all these things that

2829
02:12:29,329 --> 02:12:31,960
happen right

2830
02:12:37,819 --> 02:12:44,569
favorite cheese oh I can't pick sorry

2831
02:12:42,618 --> 02:12:46,899
there's a lot of really good cheese's

2832
02:12:44,569 --> 02:12:46,899
out there

2833
02:13:05,850 --> 02:13:09,640
so that's basically it any more office

2834
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:11,980
moving drama in sans cher has the reason

2835
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:13,180
to move and talked about oh well we we

2836
02:13:11,979 --> 02:13:22,569
just had there was a better cheaper

2837
02:13:13,180 --> 02:13:25,719
opportunity so we took it there wasn't

2838
02:13:22,569 --> 02:13:30,569
really any more drama though it was just

2839
02:13:25,719 --> 02:13:30,569
the movers were terrible i was really it

2840
02:13:48,479 --> 02:13:54,179
alright looks like we're out of time I'm

2841
02:13:51,269 --> 02:13:55,320
gonna wrap it up thank you for joining

2842
02:13:54,179 --> 02:13:56,639
me for another sort of handmade here

2843
02:13:55,319 --> 02:13:58,408
it's what a pleasure coding with you as

2844
02:13:56,639 --> 02:13:59,609
always if you would like to following

2845
02:13:58,408 --> 02:14:01,408
series at home you can always peer to

2846
02:13:59,609 --> 02:14:03,118
the game on handmade hero or come to the

2847
02:14:01,408 --> 02:14:05,429
source code so you can play around with

2848
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:06,839
it and follow the series

2849
02:14:05,429 --> 02:14:08,429
it also comes the source code for all

2850
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:09,748
the previous days so if you want to look

2851
02:14:08,429 --> 02:14:11,578
at a particular day you can always jump

2852
02:14:09,748 --> 02:14:13,439
back there and play around with

2853
02:14:11,578 --> 02:14:17,340
something from a particular time period

2854
02:14:13,439 --> 02:14:19,169
as well that's about it for today I will

2855
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:21,929
be back here tomorrow to then do the

2856
02:14:19,170 --> 02:14:23,130
camera stuff because we decided we

2857
02:14:21,929 --> 02:14:25,498
wanted to put in some entity stuff today

2858
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:26,760
so we did that but I still want to do

2859
02:14:25,498 --> 02:14:28,859
the camera code stuff that I talked

2860
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:30,958
about the beginning of the stream so we

2861
02:14:28,859 --> 02:14:33,238
will give that a shot tomorrow and we'll

2862
02:14:30,958 --> 02:14:35,458
use the entity code we created to place

2863
02:14:33,238 --> 02:14:36,928
some special camera markers that we can

2864
02:14:35,458 --> 02:14:38,429
then test to make sure that the camera

2865
02:14:36,929 --> 02:14:40,679
code actually respects them and does

2866
02:14:38,429 --> 02:14:41,849
them properly and then we'll sort of

2867
02:14:40,679 --> 02:14:43,408
start tweaking the camera code a little

2868
02:14:41,849 --> 02:14:45,150
bit more I mentioned some things we want

2869
02:14:43,408 --> 02:14:46,319
to do to it so I'd like to do that and

2870
02:14:45,149 --> 02:14:48,359
kind of get that to a point where I'm

2871
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:49,828
happy with the camera code so see back

2872
02:14:48,359 --> 02:14:51,839
here for that same time same place

2873
02:14:49,828 --> 02:14:53,368
although we won't be delayed we're

2874
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:55,739
delayed by an hour today hopefully

2875
02:14:53,368 --> 02:14:57,268
tomorrow will be smooth because hey it

2876
02:14:55,738 --> 02:14:59,638
looks like the streams working good so

2877
02:14:57,269 --> 02:15:01,619
hopefully everything's fine hope to see

2878
02:14:59,639 --> 02:15:03,389
you back here for that till then have

2879
02:15:01,618 --> 02:15:04,288
fun programming everybody and I'll see

2880
02:15:03,389 --> 02:15:07,670
you on the Internet

2881
02:15:04,288 --> 02:15:07,670
take it easy
