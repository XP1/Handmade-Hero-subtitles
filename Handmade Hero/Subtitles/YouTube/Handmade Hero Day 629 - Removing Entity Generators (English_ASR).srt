1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,080
all righty

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,759
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,120
hero sure we code a complete game

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,960
live on stream uh i have no idea

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,399
what we want to do today um to be

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,320
completely honest with you

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,679
i'm not sure um we probably

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,359
i would guess uh should continue our

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,039
why did that not i don't even know how

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,880
the new four coder thing works with

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,480
builds i i have never been able to

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,960
figure it out it's extremely confusing

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,118
to me

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,239
i have a project and i thought it would

15
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,320
build

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,238
when i tried to hit build but it doesn't

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,600
build and i don't really know why

18
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,640
and i haven't really bothered to figure

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,480
it out so if you just start by

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
being in a file that's part of the

21
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,959
project and you hit build it does build

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,399
i i don't know i don't know only alan

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,439
orion could tell me the answer to those

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,799
questions um

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,399
well that's not true we could go find

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,198
out ourselves if we were so motivated

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,558
i'm not

28
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,280
so we're just gonna say that's what it

29
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:59,679
does and then uh we're gonna go in here

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,719
and run the game now i'm assuming what i

31
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,558
would want to do today

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,840
is work on the pressure plates now

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,759
the other thing we might want to do is

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,118
is work on combat because at this point

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,760
we're kind of just talking

36
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,519
um about things that are involved in

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,759
making gameplay stuff happen

38
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,359
like in the dungeon areas and whatever

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,599
and another thing that i think i

40
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,959
probably want to do is have a convenient

41
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,239
shortcut switch

42
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,559
that i can use uh in order to start

43
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,158
myself off like in the dungeon

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,920
because i don't really want to have to

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,560
hop here every time when i'm testing

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,040
things

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,920
um it's we have hot code reloading so i

48
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,320
can just like

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,400
reload code when we're standing around

50
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,399
here but the problem is that reloading

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,240
code is not really gonna help

52
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,000
uh when we're when we're looking at like

53
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,679
generator stuff you know

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,200
um so so to a first approximation

55
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,000
we're gonna need something that gets us

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,600
started faster

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,599
so i guess what i would say is we have a

58
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,399
couple things uh we would probably want

59
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,879
to do there

60
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,478
and uh you know i don't have a strong

61
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,319
opinion on any of them so i think maybe

62
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,200
the first thing we should start with

63
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,000
is uh before we start working on tiles

64
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
again

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,759
right uh we probably want to that was

66
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,758
kind of interesting

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
it seems like it is that because it

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,360
doesn't know what room it's in if you go

69
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,520
down low enough

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,280
the camera kind of looks like it went up

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
higher to above the

72
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
the camera like went upward but i don't

73
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,000
know why the camera went upward

74
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,439
it's interesting probably because it

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560
doesn't have a room at that point it's

76
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,680
outside

77
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,800
any room geometry anyway uh that doesn't

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,080
really matter

79
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,080
we don't care about that at the moment

80
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,400
but the point is uh

81
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,000
so i should probably just start by doing

82
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,360
a quick startup thing so that we can

83
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,199
make sure that we just start

84
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
in like a dungeon room because if we

85
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,839
don't just start in the dungeon room all

86
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,439
the time

87
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,598
we're gonna waste all our time like

88
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,719
hopping down here because we want to be

89
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,878
able to quickly see

90
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,400
like when we work on the room generation

91
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,000
stuff or anything else like that

92
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,239
we want to be able to make sure that we

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,080
can quickly go ahead and get ourselves

94
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,200
like re-situated right we want to be

95
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,840
able to

96
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,719
to like restart right in in an area

97
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,120
that's relevant

98
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,080
and you know hot code reloading can't

99
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,840
really help us

100
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,280
if it's world generation stuff because

101
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,439
when we hot reload code

102
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,959
we keep the same the world the way it is

103
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,280
right

104
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,959
um we could add a key that like destroys

105
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,959
the world and creates a new one

106
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,319
um but again that would pop us back to

107
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,479
the beginning of the game so like for

108
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,719
example if i did that

109
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,679
we've created a new world now but the

110
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,598
problem is

111
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,879
we're back at start so we still have to

112
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,798
hop all the way down

113
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:38,399
right so uh that seems to me like

114
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,640
something we should probably

115
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
work on right like something where we're

116
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,439
actually going to have

117
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,000
an easy time showing up in a place that

118
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,439
actually makes

119
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,120
sense uh and you know

120
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,719
i assume that we could just make it so

121
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,519
that the world generator just skips the

122
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:59,199
generation of the orphanage altogether

123
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,239
that's probably fine um because

124
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,598
i would assume that like you know

125
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,519
we don't need the orphanage to get

126
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,079
generated when we're just working on the

127
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,239
dungeon area

128
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,200
so for example in here well actually you

129
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,759
know we don't skip the

130
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,839
it doesn't even matter we can still

131
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,279
generate the orphanage we'll just place

132
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,918
the hero somewhere else so you can see

133
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,959
here like we do a dungeon

134
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:28,240
create dungeon like that and if we

135
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,918
look at the dungeon data you can see

136
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,120
that there's an entrance room

137
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,680
so i think that if we just did this

138
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,399
where we said okay there's a start room

139
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,519
equals

140
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,719
dungeon entrance room

141
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,839
we can just do that and now it will

142
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,639
start us

143
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,679
in right where the dungeon is i think

144
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,680
right

145
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,879
um i take it back that does not

146
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,879
look like it worked at all

147
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,720
oh never mind

148
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,959
that is not what that is

149
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,160
that is the room we start laying out at

150
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,439
that's cool so that started laying out

151
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,000
at a totally different place

152
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:21,279
but it still placed us in the same place

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,478
that's interesting okay so actually

154
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,638
it's this that we care about and this

155
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,879
places the camera there

156
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,879
which i guess is what we care about you

157
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,639
can see us even we had one in here for

158
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,279
placing ourselves in the forest so i

159
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,120
guess we can just do this

160
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,319
the same thing um and just say all right

161
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,000
there's a

162
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,000
volume here that we're going to place

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the hero at and and off we go

164
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
there we go um so this starts us off in

165
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,478
this room here

166
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,079
the the entrance room that we're talking

167
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,758
about which seems good

168
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,839
i feel like the entrance room shouldn't

169
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,360
have a door because it's an entrance way

170
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,879
so i don't know that you should have to

171
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,639
hop on a door to get in there

172
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,959
maybe you do maybe you don't i don't

173
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,960
know but that's something to think about

174
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,478
um but okay so now that we're starting

175
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,399
here we got a lot of stuff we can do now

176
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,439
so the first thing i'd like to do

177
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,439
um probably just looking at it is we

178
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,680
need to actually place these tiles

179
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,319
in actually interesting patterns in the

180
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,680
rooms right

181
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,240
so when you like when you look at one of

182
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,360
these things the idea is that these

183
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,918
those tiles want to be placed

184
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,160
in the room and they want to be placed

185
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:40,879
in some kind of gameplay

186
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,880
relevant way right uh

187
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,479
so like to be honest i don't

188
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:56,000
really think that they want to be placed

189
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:58,079
next to each other even like they don't

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,720
really want to be contiguous

191
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,000
like this i think they more want to be

192
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,840
placed kind of randomly

193
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,720
throughout the room um

194
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,279
using some kind of a like you know

195
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,280
scattering

196
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,400
because the idea is you have to hop

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,120
on the various tiles to open up the next

198
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,038
door

199
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,199
and we don't really want them to be all

200
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,759
next to each other probably

201
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,120
um i mean maybe sometimes they can be

202
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,840
next to each other

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,840
but i don't know that

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,840
yeah you know it's it's that's a pretty

205
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,318
tough one i don't really know

206
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,799
um maybe they do kind of want to be more

207
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,240
like in a pattern

208
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
because i could see that being kind of

209
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,840
fun like you have to kind of hop through

210
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,439
the pattern so so all right

211
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,560
um so yeah i guess i would say

212
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,879
uh maybe maybe i take it back maybe they

213
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
are

214
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,720
supposed to be in a pattern and then

215
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,800
maybe like

216
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,520
how that works is we try to place the

217
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,079
pattern

218
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:18,719
in the room like we're doing now um

219
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,478
we just need the thing we don't have is

220
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,840
right now the pattern is like

221
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:26,959
always right

222
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,959
placed the in the it searches you can

223
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,038
imagine it's starting

224
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,639
up here right like if you look at what's

225
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,598
going on in here

226
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,598
um you can kind of see like okay we

227
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,000
start at the upper corner of a room

228
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:45,039
right and we just go until

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,038
ah camera

230
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,360
it'd be nice if there was some way to

231
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,399
like not have the camera do

232
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,399
that thing um

233
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,919
to to have the camera not show these

234
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,000
upper rooms

235
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,599
uh when we're in debug mode they

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,039
automatically fade out in game play but

237
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,759
they don't in debug mode anyway point

238
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,679
being

239
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,799
what you can kind of see here if we look

240
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,479
at these rooms

241
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,079
um is that you get all it always puts it

242
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
in the top corner and the reason for

243
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
that

244
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,000
is just that it just starts in the top

245
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,760
corner and then

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,639
uh keeps trying until it can find a

247
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,958
place to put it

248
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,159
and since it pretty much can always put

249
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,239
it in the top corner

250
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,399
like there's no reason it will ever fail

251
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,839
to put it in that top corner

252
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,679
it just always ends up in the top

253
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,360
quarter so even once we make kind of

254
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,719
more interesting patterns

255
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,120
it will really it will be like really

256
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,040
heavily biased towards the top corner of

257
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,679
the room

258
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,439
if we don't do something about that now

259
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,278
one question is do we want it to

260
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
actually be biased like do we want it to

261
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,240
just always place the pattern like in

262
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,958
the middle of the room

263
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,240
and then keep trying till it can find a

264
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,359
place to put it

265
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,200
uh that like spirals outward

266
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,959
from the middle of the room for example

267
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,360
because we could do something like that

268
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,000
and you know maybe that's what we want i

269
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,039
don't know

270
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,480
i would say maybe let's try that

271
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:11,278
just because i can't really think of

272
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,278
any reason not to um

273
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,078
let's let's take a look so if we if we

274
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,480
look

275
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,120
um at one of these like pending entity

276
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200
things

277
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,959
and you know this might be an

278
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
opportunity for us to do

279
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,199
uh

280
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,240
this might be an opportunity for us to

281
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,880
do one of the things that i was

282
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,440
thinking we wanted to do right which was

283
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,480
create

284
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,800
a thing that houses these uh

285
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
like bundles them up into bundles

286
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,078
basically

287
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,000
so that rather than getting gen entities

288
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,278
back from things you get like a gen

289
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,559
entity group

290
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:53,039
right like this thing um

291
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,119
you get one of these back for everything

292
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,519
so everything is an entity group and

293
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
then

294
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,879
the thing that was the entity group is

295
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,839
actually a group of groups

296
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,919
right or a list of groups because we now

297
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,519
are pretty much always placing sort of

298
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,199
templates of things that have multiple

299
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,120
entities in them and it was kind of a

300
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,800
pain in the butt to use this thing

301
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,919
so i think we might want to do that as

302
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,278
well and this would give us an

303
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,120
opportunity to do that because you would

304
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,399
end up with something more like this

305
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,120
where you say like all right there's a

306
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:23,759
gen entity group

307
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,759
um you you have

308
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,439
you know and it could be like a genetic

309
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,439
list maybe is a better way to do it

310
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
or or pattern you know something like

311
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,240
that and

312
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,239
you have that

313
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:43,759
and these are actually what you

314
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,879
stack up so instead of this

315
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:51,439
it's actually a pattern you know

316
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,439
and that way you would just say these

317
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,320
we build the pattern itself could store

318
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,759
some information

319
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,560
like about uh you know

320
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,159
where it wants to start so you know

321
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,599
there would be something like

322
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:12,559
a uh like a starting

323
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,040
you know like a flag that says where in

324
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,599
the

325
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,319
where in the room you want to start

326
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,959
roughly

327
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,240
it could even be like a uv kind of like

328
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,078
a bias sort of a thing

329
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,360
it could be something like you know

330
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,039
start p

331
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,000
bias where we basically say or start p

332
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,599
u v or something like that where we say

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,039
okay

334
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,560
given the room zero zero you know point

335
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,719
five point five would be the center zero

336
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,958
zero be upper or lower left corner or

337
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,200
something you know whatever it is

338
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,609
and we would just say that's gonna be

339
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,959
our

340
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,278
[Music]

341
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,278
the way in which we go about laying

342
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,919
these things out

343
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,639
they're gonna they're gonna follow that

344
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,519
pattern

345
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,959
right so if we assume that's the case

346
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,720
you could see making these entity

347
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,838
patterns and saying i want to place this

348
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,759
starting in the middle starting in the

349
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,320
upper corner starting the other corner

350
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,319
you know something like that um

351
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,879
and and the rest of this would just

352
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,159
remain the same you know there

353
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,919
we wouldn't have to do anything else i

354
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,078
don't think

355
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:25,519
and so maybe that works okay

356
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:29,120
um and the only problem that i have

357
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,120
here is just that like

358
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:40,639
you sort of have a boundary

359
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,560
like this this template sort of has a

360
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,799
size to it

361
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,759
and it's a little confusing because if

362
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,078
you allow

363
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,000
the thing to be a little bit flexible

364
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,919
with how the pattern is generated

365
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,039
it's tough to sort of see how it gets

366
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,879
placed

367
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,879
if if the pattern is always rigid

368
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,519
which i'll be honest seems like it might

369
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,839
need to be

370
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,839
um

371
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,959
so you can sort of see maybe why i'm

372
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,560
not sure what to do about this and and

373
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,838
this may just be a case

374
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,919
of us over complicating things like

375
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,720
maybe i just need to change

376
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,399
this stuff and so instead of doing this

377
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,040
where you do like

378
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,759
ins it could be that i've done this one

379
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,120
level too

380
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,919
low right so maybe the answer is

381
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,360
look we should not have entity creators

382
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,399
that was just a bad idea

383
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,959
what we have is pattern creators and

384
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,919
pattern creators are just custom written

385
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,439
right

386
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,958
because the more i think about this i'm

387
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,800
just like how are we ever going to get

388
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,198
this to work we basically have to encode

389
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,359
so much smarts into this thing you know

390
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,879
what i mean

391
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,759
that it just doesn't make a whole lot of

392
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,958
sense how that's ever gonna work

393
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,039
you know so i feel like what we want is

394
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,319
instead of doing what we did here where

395
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,759
we're sort of saying look

396
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,519
let's buffer up all the stuff that's

397
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,198
going to get created and then have this

398
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,039
thing try to create it in the room

399
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:18,319
maybe what we'd rather do is say all

400
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,919
right for every

401
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,839
thing that's a collection that's a call

402
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,278
into a function that knows how to create

403
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,199
that thing and it

404
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,559
does its own probing to figure out like

405
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:32,479
where to put stuff

406
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,479
you know um

407
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,560
and the reason i say that is just

408
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,198
because thinking about how complicated

409
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,958
this would get

410
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,559
once you're trying to do gameplay stuff

411
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,599
you have so many metrics you might want

412
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,799
to take account in there

413
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,680
it just feels like we're going to have

414
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,958
to create our own kind of hacky code

415
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,239
to do some of these things because

416
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,000
there's not going to be like a good

417
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,440
formal way to describe

418
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,958
what we're trying to accomplish there

419
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,959
without just making a whole programming

420
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,000
language inside this pattern generator

421
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,439
thing

422
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,320
you know so it kind of seems to me

423
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,160
like maybe this was just a bad idea so

424
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,800
maybe that's the goal for today

425
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,559
convert this to something that does not

426
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,599
work that way right

427
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:14,319
so convert this into something where

428
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,920
instead of gen entity group and this

429
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,240
being gen entity

430
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,198
um i mean maybe we leave these names

431
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,399
because that's

432
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,519
still fine but maybe what we do here

433
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,919
instead

434
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,799
is this gen entity thing actually just

435
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,399
has

436
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:33,439
uh it has a call that's like

437
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,440
pattern creator and it it

438
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,040
takes all that it takes like what kind

439
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,839
of pattern you were trying to create

440
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,159
using a bunch of parameters or something

441
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,560
and then it creates that and this stuff

442
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:48,000
doesn't really exist anymore

443
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,799
so you know uh if we look at all the

444
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,120
places that are

445
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,838
actually doing this right so if we if we

446
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,799
then go

447
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,399
into the room generator where this stuff

448
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,439
is actually called

449
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,198
uh and you can see like there's a couple

450
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,600
places where you know we're doing sort

451
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,639
of

452
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,519
uh generating trees and stuff like this

453
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,120
right

454
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,119
these would just turn into calls

455
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,359
directly to those things

456
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,879
so like add inanimate or whatever would

457
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,519
just get called directly and that's

458
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,959
better

459
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,639
that seems just better period right

460
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,160
and then this stuff here where we're

461
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,199
generating things

462
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,360
um the the door stuff

463
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
would just call that obstacle but then

464
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,639
this thing where we

465
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,160
where we loop through the group this

466
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,400
rather than calling

467
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,919
find place to put entity group would

468
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,919
just call the function

469
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,360
it just straight up calls the function

470
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,799
right there

471
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:43,839
you know what i'm saying um

472
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:47,839
so let's try that

473
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,839
that seems

474
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,280
that seems like what i want

475
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,639
that seems like what i want so i'm going

476
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:06,960
to go into gen entity

477
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,960
um or sorry entity gen

478
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,000
and right here we've got the gen create

479
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,759
entity thing that wraps

480
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,440
these calls and i'm gonna say that

481
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,679
that's not a thing anymore

482
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,440
so uh well okay i don't even have to do

483
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,798
that i can just say

484
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,840
that there's a gen create entity uh

485
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,918
like pattern uh

486
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,199
something like that right or gen create

487
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,600
pattern

488
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,480
and uh it probably should be an indie

489
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,798
pad

490
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,839
and we say the name and in here what

491
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,798
happens is

492
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,639
we call this function which is like you

493
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:45,038
know whatever it is

494
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,559
and it gets past basically just

495
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,720
the region and then the thing

496
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:50,720
so

497
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,759
the spec i guess whatever you want to

498
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,679
call it and it will get

499
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,798
all of the data that this thing needed

500
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,280
so when it was

501
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,639
coming through here all of the stuff

502
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,918
that this was using

503
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,559
it will receive so for example it will

504
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,840
take

505
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,839
uh the grid

506
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,479
i don't know what this thing was called

507
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,840
there's like this weird grid thing we

508
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:24,558
made to help with construction

509
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:27,759
edit grid so it'll take the edit grid

510
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:30,399
um and the sim region the

511
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,038
the edit grid probably has the sim

512
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,600
region

513
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,839
in it yeah so actually it just needs the

514
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,599
edit grid

515
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:42,959
um it needs the spec that it was given

516
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,558
so the thing that the the entity like

517
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,240
pattern you know maybe this is called

518
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,798
the pattern

519
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,440
uh so you do gen pattern you call this

520
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,720
thing

521
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,400
with the pattern it creates all of the

522
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,079
entities that it needs

523
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,200
and hopefully that's kind of it

524
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,480
so then in here at the bottom of this

525
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:09,200
we just have some of these right

526
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,200
so in like in here

527
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:15,200
uh we would have one for each of the

528
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,919
things that we're currently creating

529
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,640
so all of the places that we're doing

530
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,759
stuff

531
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,640
in like world gen now that created those

532
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:27,119
just become calls to these rather than

533
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,559
what they were doing before

534
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:34,399
so for example uh when

535
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:38,720
we go down to

536
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,840
where's like it's like this stuff

537
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,480
yeah so when we look at this like from

538
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,038
now on

539
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,679
like there wouldn't be like anything

540
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,720
happening

541
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:53,200
inside place cat right

542
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,120
um so instead and this would also i

543
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,519
guess get us out of this iterate options

544
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,119
stuff

545
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,960
as well um so the options thing that

546
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,959
looks for places to put things that

547
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,360
probably doesn't have to happen anymore

548
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,200
because now we can just look at the time

549
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,158
so this might simplify things i don't

550
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,480
really know

551
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,200
um so we'll see but you can see here

552
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,319
we've got

553
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,360
four of these that we would do

554
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:20,798
right so i think what happens

555
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:25,678
is we just say yeah okay

556
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:31,839
there's the cat placement thing

557
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,840
which just literally does this i think

558
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,319
okay so no i take it back the option

559
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,480
thing is fine because that's just

560
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,759
picking which room it is

561
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:51,360
right so that's actually fine

562
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:54,000
so uh this right here uh

563
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,839
is probably all we really need to do so

564
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,839
it's it's it's like this

565
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,839
right

566
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:07,200
so when we do

567
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:10,319
place cat it just says cr

568
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,279
you know i don't know what this is this

569
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,879
is the cat

570
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:19,119
function or whatever um

571
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,120
we would just say add pattern

572
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,839
um add cat

573
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,279
right and then the thing that actually

574
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,079
adds the cat

575
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,639
because it's it would just get welded in

576
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,839
right

577
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,840
so it would just be this

578
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:42,558
i think

579
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,840
right and the nice part about this is a

580
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,038
lot of the stuff gets simpler because

581
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,399
now it's actually just creating an

582
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:47,839
entity and we don't have to duplicate

583
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,038
all of that stuff

584
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:53,439
so we can just create the entity um

585
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,079
using the region that comes in on the

586
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,200
grid

587
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,319
we can add the flags that we want for

588
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,519
the cat

589
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:04,639
we can use the um

590
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:06,000
the base asset can just come from that

591
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,720
pattern structure

592
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,919
so we can preserve that concept because

593
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,240
that still works well

594
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:18,000
like um this tags thing

595
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,000
i guess would be it so

596
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,839
i guess in here

597
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,919
i guess in there i'm not really sure

598
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,839
how much

599
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,278
i don't want to change too much at once

600
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,038
but i feel like that stuff can be really

601
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,640
simplified now as well because we have

602
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,919
sort of those more convenient things for

603
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,840
working

604
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,080
with the with the um classes and all

605
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,278
that

606
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:55,599
but you know oh oh well

607
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,038
so let me take it one step at a time but

608
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,798
anyway so we're going to add an entity

609
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,400
here we'll do this work we'll pretend we

610
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,119
have one of these base asset things

611
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,919
which we don't really have

612
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,839
uh it would come from from this uh and

613
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,440
then we would just create it in here

614
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,439
uh and that would just be things that

615
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
you specify on the cat that you actually

616
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,120
want

617
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,359
um and we know that it has to be a cat

618
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,519
so that tag thing could also be

619
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:22,319
specified there

620
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,319
i suppose

621
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,519
and it's a little annoying that you have

622
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,200
to do you still have to do this

623
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,960
thing you know what i mean

624
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,640
i don't know it has to loop over that

625
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,278
gen thing but it seems like it's a

626
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
little annoying

627
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,480
we could pr it seems like we should be

628
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,679
able to get rid of this you know what

629
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,120
i'm saying

630
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,200
like i feel like this should be able to

631
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,678
go away

632
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,120
um so we'll see i'm just gonna go slowly

633
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,440
for a little while and we'll see what

634
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:54,639
ends up happening

635
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,640
so uh

636
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,720
this can just go away now

637
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,000
these are actually now i think just

638
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,960
straight up calls right so

639
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,798
we don't really need them to be yeah we

640
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,200
don't really need them to be

641
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,079
uh function pointers anymore i don't

642
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,519
think

643
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,278
we'll leave them that way for now

644
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,038
because there's no reason not to

645
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,480
but we don't actually need to do that so

646
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,400
when you create one of these you just

647
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,839
have the entity piece asset

648
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,840
base asset thing um entity piece asset

649
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,360
is a tag hash and a variant so you can

650
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:39,839
see why this doesn't really make

651
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:42,798
much sense to me um an asset tag hash

652
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,399
is just one of these things and you can

653
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:45,200
you know you can munch them however you

654
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,360
want

655
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,720
so i'm not sure we care about that

656
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,719
either so

657
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,798
i kind of feel like this gennady tag

658
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,360
builder thing should go away

659
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,000
it doesn't really make any sense anymore

660
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:57,519
and

661
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,679
i don't think we really need it for

662
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,440
anything so

663
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,278
i would suspect that we can we can

664
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,640
eliminate that too

665
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:08,319
um just by thinking it through a little

666
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,900
bit better

667
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:14,058
so yeah um

668
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,059
[Music]

669
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,360
let's just go whole hog

670
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,599
let's just go whole hog so let's just

671
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:24,798
get rid of all this stuff

672
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:29,119
so we have asset tag hash here

673
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:31,119
and the thing with asset tag hash is

674
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,399
we want to be able to generate that

675
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,599
thing

676
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,080
um conveniently

677
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:39,199
and and modify it right and i'm pretty

678
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,439
sure

679
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,600
that we have uh hash stuff for that so

680
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,600
like

681
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,960
you can see us doing stuff like getting

682
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,678
tag ashes here and you can extract

683
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,000
things from it

684
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,600
it's just an it just it just builds

685
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
these things up right you can see it's

686
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,918
like category plus some

687
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,599
some hash stuff there right it's it's

688
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,640
pretty straightforward what's happening

689
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:10,079
so i feel like you know we can just

690
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,840
we can just do that so i think what

691
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,839
we'll do is we'll just say okay entity

692
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,879
tag hash is what we're storing

693
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,639
it's just what's going on um and we'll

694
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,278
leave it like that

695
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,360
when we go through here this is going to

696
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:26,240
be the pattern creator thing now so this

697
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,240
is a type def

698
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:38,240
gen create pattern

699
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,240
and that oops

700
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,880
so that's the pattern and all the rest

701
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:49,679
of this stuff can probably stay the same

702
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:53,120
um facing direction

703
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,519
probably shouldn't be there anymore

704
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,519
i mean

705
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,359
i'm going to leave that out because i

706
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,960
don't know that we care about that

707
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,798
at the moment so we've got gennady flag

708
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,600
with the gen flags allow directions for

709
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:11,038
next

710
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,918
that's just you know not necessary

711
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,759
anymore at all

712
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:19,919
i don't think so this would go away

713
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,919
that would go away um

714
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,079
i think all of this stuff goes away so i

715
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,240
think we're really just looking at this

716
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:35,918
so there's stuff here where you say like

717
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,919
what the tags are coming in as

718
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,679
and we may want to change this a little

719
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,278
bit to something that's like

720
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,919
you know this could even be something

721
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:51,119
more like asset tag id

722
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:54,399
you know id or like

723
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:58,079
tags like that where we just say

724
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,798
these are used by the caller however

725
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,960
they want

726
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,960
and we don't really know uh so the

727
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,679
creator just uses these tags

728
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,240
for something you know what i mean and

729
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,240
we'll see

730
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,839
we may not even need that but but i

731
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,278
think we might just in terms of knowing

732
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,678
which particular assets supposed to go

733
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,319
where

734
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,679
i don't know we'll find out so it'd be

735
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,960
more like this

736
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,960
and uh so the pattern creator thing

737
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,399
would just get called here

738
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,440
and these would all just be functions

739
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,599
right so these just take region

740
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,960
take the region and they add the thing

741
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,879
and that's it

742
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,720
um so they're literally just

743
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,080
they're back to what they used to be

744
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,558
right they're back to just

745
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,278
calls that add entities which again is

746
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:44,960
just about

747
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,440
simplifying life it's trying to make

748
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,319
this less complicated because it was

749
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,720
just getting

750
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,519
it was it was putting too much stuff on

751
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,558
top that didn't really need to be there

752
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:59,839
and so i think it would be fine so this

753
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:02,960
isn't takes an asset tag hash for base

754
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,720
asset so these all look like that and

755
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,480
now we can just make these regular

756
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,880
function calls so that they can actually

757
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,720
take

758
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,039
other things as well depending on what

759
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,720
they are so they're just more flexible

760
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:23,839
as well if that makes sense

761
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:23,839
so i think that should be fine

762
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,679
um

763
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,000
that all looks fine

764
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,678
i think we said we wanted to be able to

765
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,319
steal heads from orphans so this should

766
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,640
probably

767
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,639
change

768
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,480
while we're at it

769
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,960
we said we want to be able to steal

770
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,839
heads from orphans or swap heads with

771
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,200
orphans

772
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:55,439
um so so that should probably change

773
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,440
uh

774
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,798
you know do you swap heads or do you

775
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,399
swap bodies

776
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,240
in this game it would make more sense

777
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,518
thematically if you swap bodies

778
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,079
so like you hop you do the swap and you

779
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,319
swap

780
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:14,000
your head with

781
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,839
with their body and then you hop around

782
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,519
on their body would probably make more

783
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:21,918
sense

784
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,919
you know

785
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,720
[Music]

786
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,479
that would probably make more sense but

787
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,360
i don't know doesn't matter either way

788
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,200
you're going to be swapping something

789
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,519
so yeah so you know in here where we add

790
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,399
orphan it should really probably be two

791
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,640
entities

792
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,239
right and those entities should be just

793
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,840
linked together

794
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,359
like the hero is so at some point we

795
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,519
should do that it's just something to

796
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,719
remember to do

797
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,720
all right so

798
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,079
back to our story so yeah these are just

799
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,839
gonna be

800
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,839
like this now

801
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,880
and

802
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:13,599
now we've got all of our creation code

803
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,199
looking a little bit better uh this

804
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,759
stuff

805
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,798
gen entity at p is just setting the

806
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,879
result p

807
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,158
to something which doesn't seem super

808
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,600
useful but

809
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,760
you know whatever um so i think

810
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,278
that probably doesn't really need to be

811
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:32,240
here none of this stuff does

812
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:34,720
these probably would rather just be a

813
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,798
call that places something somewhere

814
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,480
so you can say like place and then you

815
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,119
do whatever the thing is what you're

816
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,720
going to

817
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:47,518
be placing so you know

818
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,519
maybe this is just place entity at p

819
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,159
you know what i mean uh and it

820
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:02,720
presumably

821
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,720
doesn't need anything but that

822
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,518
you know what i'm saying um and we could

823
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:13,519
even do this as

824
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,640
an operator if you wanted i don't think

825
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,919
i want to go that far because we don't

826
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,360
really do that in handmade hero but we

827
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:25,038
could

828
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:28,158
uh same thing here so if you do like nd

829
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,158
and we say

830
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,000
i guess we don't care about

831
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,880
about that part because we would just

832
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,079
not call this so we do something more

833
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,559
like

834
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:53,839
um place entity at traversable

835
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:53,839
and place entity on traversible

836
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:07,839
so this would just be a traversal

837
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:07,839
reference standing on

838
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,039
so something like this

839
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,878
and the difference between and on would

840
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,719
just be whether or not they occupy it

841
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,480
right so you put it there and you either

842
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:35,838
occupy it or you don't right so

843
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:35,838
here's that this would just be

844
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,079
exactly what it looks like

845
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:49,838
right

846
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,159
that sort of thing um so we've got

847
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,039
monstar and familiar here

848
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,760
which we're not really using at the

849
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,000
moment

850
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,680
so we'll just leave those up at the top

851
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,440
because maybe we want to add monstar

852
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:09,199
and familiar at some point um

853
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,960
that all looks fine and then we just

854
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:14,480
have the actual pattern

855
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,000
generation stuff right so now where you

856
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,559
do play snake

857
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,599
or whatever it is this stuff right

858
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,719
this just goes away because the play

859
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,519
snake thing

860
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,559
is just gonna be inside the gen the

861
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,838
entity creator

862
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,838
part right

863
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:47,599
so literally you would just say

864
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,598
this whole thing

865
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:59,839
goes in here

866
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,358
right uh and this would create

867
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,358
everything

868
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,838
and

869
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:27,838
we would just call stuff like add

870
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,838
snakehead directly

871
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,960
so the and then we just

872
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:36,480
we just need to start thinking about how

873
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,440
we want to try to create these patterns

874
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,519
but they can be

875
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,358
a lot smarter now than they used to be

876
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:42,559
uh and we can start hacking them and

877
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:43,920
it's just it's a lot of code

878
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,599
unfortunately like that we'll have to

879
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,400
write but i don't know really any way

880
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,838
around it

881
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,960
because we need something that's pretty

882
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:54,078
flexible right

883
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,838
that makes sense um so anyway

884
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,839
uh that all looks fine

885
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,640
that all looks fine

886
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:04,880
[Music]

887
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:09,759
um this could probably be simplified to

888
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:12,000
just say use the brain id

889
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,680
of the head so this would just be add

890
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,679
brain

891
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:21,598
here um

892
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:24,960
undead and bones is just what the tag is

893
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:37,119
right and so

894
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:40,159
we can i think do this

895
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,880
and skip this whole ad tag thing you can

896
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,639
see why

897
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,920
i want to do this because this this code

898
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,679
is just too much

899
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,838
there's too much code that's not doing

900
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:49,358
anything other than bookkeeping

901
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:52,320
and so i'm just going to try to keep

902
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:55,039
collapsing this down until it's smoother

903
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,079
that's the real goal here is to smooth

904
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:00,239
it out

905
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,240
you know what i'm saying um

906
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:09,679
so yeah in add snakehead um

907
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:10,400
in this case you can see that it's just

908
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,199
gonna do

909
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,760
all of the basic stuff we needed it to

910
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,439
do

911
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,760
and then we're gonna set the brain up

912
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,159
here then we're gonna place the entity

913
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,839
at

914
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:23,838
a p um actually this is going to be a

915
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,119
non-traversable kind of a thing right

916
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,440
and this is the part that's going to be

917
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,440
hard

918
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,880
and then we will just try to create

919
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:37,039
these segments

920
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:41,200
and we will go through and

921
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,199
do add snake body for each segment

922
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:47,838
and

923
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:02,880
and i think that gets rid of that code

924
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,009
this stays the same

925
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,010
[Music]

926
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:17,519
we don't know what that will do

927
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,440
we don't care about this anymore that

928
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,000
goes away

929
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,960
so i think now we're yeah so you can see

930
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,920
like basically

931
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,960
this stuff now is more what we wanted to

932
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,200
write

933
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,159
and furthermore we can probably just

934
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,960
collapse these

935
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,879
we can snake heads and bodies are

936
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,960
presumably all getting generated by the

937
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,240
snake pattern generator anyway

938
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,480
we could even collapse those down right

939
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,479
so now basically what we're doing is

940
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,000
we're regressing the code

941
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,440
now that we've got a new routing in

942
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,880
place we're trying to get the code back

943
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,838
to the simplicity that it was at

944
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,119
originally

945
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,960
where you just kind of created this

946
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,800
stuff in

947
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:00,400
line right um

948
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,720
and that's the goal so yeah you can see

949
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,720
here like where we added the head

950
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:05,919
so here we would just say okay the head

951
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,239
is there

952
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,240
um

953
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:11,838
like so

954
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:20,000
um we made a collision volume for it

955
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,358
for whatever reason we add this piece to

956
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,559
it

957
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:29,119
which is the body piece we add the light

958
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:39,838
to it we connect this to the world

959
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:39,838
and we give it some hit point oops

960
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,118
um we will call this headlight

961
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:58,318
and that uh lets us just create

962
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,439
this thing in line right then for each

963
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,639
segment

964
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,159
we would say take the snake body and put

965
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,239
that in here

966
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,239
i don't know why those have lights so i

967
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,318
might suggest that we just don't do that

968
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:13,118
anymore

969
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,679
um so then in here we would say okay

970
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:20,079
snake segments

971
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:22,318
does what it does um

972
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,519
this collision volume and that collision

973
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,880
volume

974
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:31,358
are like the same collision volume so

975
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,358
maybe we just use the same one for now

976
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:49,838
and then uh when we're actually

977
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:49,838
making the visual piece here which

978
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,880
actually no that's not true so it's this

979
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,760
visual piece that gets connected to the

980
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,800
world here this

981
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,839
this part uh

982
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,359
this is just the head the headpiece it's

983
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:08,639
not the headlight

984
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,400
this is the headlight okay um so this is

985
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,519
just the body piece

986
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,519
or the seg piece it's kind of annoying

987
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,960
how you have to make both those calls

988
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,119
i feel like these should be a little bit

989
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,000
more condensed like it's just too much

990
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,280
work

991
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,280
right but anyway there's a segment

992
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,079
this goes away that stays in

993
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,519
[Music]

994
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,880
um and so there's our snake creator and

995
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,559
we could do better i think we can

996
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,880
collapse some of these down a little bit

997
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,159
they're a little bit too verbose in my

998
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,880
opinion

999
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,318
um but now it's nicely condensed it's

1000
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,039
not strewn all over the place like it

1001
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,039
was before

1002
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:53,039
so i think that's better

1003
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:59,838
um i guess that's an on the cat does

1004
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:59,838
take up a square

1005
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,559
so i think that's better i'm happier

1006
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,480
with that

1007
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:10,639
and so then

1008
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,679
yeah if okay so if we look at the base

1009
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:13,679
asset now

1010
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,960
then probably what we would do is say

1011
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,000
tag zero

1012
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:27,119
goes here and that was undead

1013
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:28,559
and uh and then bones right

1014
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,318
so you can see that would pull the base

1015
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:30,719
asset out and then switch it each time

1016
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:33,759
which

1017
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:35,919
maybe means yeah maybe we do maybe we

1018
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,440
can just make that be

1019
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:43,358
um locked in there

1020
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,358
where this can just be an asset tag hash

1021
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,839
um and maybe there are multiple of these

1022
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,239
eventually

1023
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,279
i don't know so maybe we do do that and

1024
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,959
we just say

1025
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,000
okay uh you pass in

1026
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:04,159
what kind of a snake you wanted right

1027
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,159
and then we pull that out of the pattern

1028
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,559
like so

1029
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,960
so then when you say that you wanted a

1030
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:12,960
snake

1031
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:21,919
which somebody does

1032
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,480
yeah so then when you when you wanted a

1033
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,880
snake

1034
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,318
we could say something like uh place

1035
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,200
pattern

1036
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,199
or add pattern

1037
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,598
um and it would be something like this

1038
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,838
right

1039
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,078
you see what i'm saying so you'd go like

1040
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,760
okay add this pattern we want a snake

1041
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,880
pattern in this room

1042
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:04,640
uh we want it to be we want to have this

1043
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:07,599
these tags um it goes in this room

1044
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,799
something like that and if i need my

1045
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,079
four coder

1046
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,318
indentation to get better i need like

1047
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:19,280
somebody needs to remind me off stream

1048
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:22,318
to go talk to ryan and alan

1049
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,400
and update to the newest stuff because

1050
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,838
i'm behind and i think they fixed this

1051
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:32,079
stuff

1052
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:36,000
i just am behind unfortunately

1053
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:39,039
um so that is what we're talking about

1054
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,039
right um

1055
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:47,838
and maybe

1056
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:55,119
maybe it's something like

1057
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:01,838
this

1058
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,820
actually you know

1059
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,929
um

1060
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,929
[Music]

1061
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,200
maybe that's maybe that's what we're

1062
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,480
talking about

1063
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:20,480
and then similarly like

1064
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,920
this would be would actually be more

1065
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:29,838
like

1066
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,440
that

1067
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,838
seems like a plan

1068
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,318
okay

1069
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:57,599
wait so which one is which the previous

1070
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:58,960
room

1071
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,079
the snake goes in this room the priest

1072
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,039
room yeah okay so that we don't really

1073
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,680
we don't care about what

1074
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,639
how that we can deal with that later

1075
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:08,318
okay

1076
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:12,719
so this is going to be a tile pattern

1077
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:12,719
um for a switch pattern

1078
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:20,078
tile switch pattern i don't know

1079
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,439
so we just do something like this where

1080
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,318
we add these things

1081
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,440
and then we you know we make them do

1082
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:27,920
whatever it is that they

1083
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,039
do or something it's fine doesn't matter

1084
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,880
point being

1085
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,480
uh we create those and then we can set

1086
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,200
these things which get passed through as

1087
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,599
parameters

1088
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,480
and then they get called later when we

1089
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,838
actually need to

1090
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,838
add those things to the room

1091
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,598
um and you know the only thing i would

1092
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,039
say

1093
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:50,400
is that i i suspect we're probably going

1094
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:50,400
to end up wanting to put

1095
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,040
this stuff in a more like

1096
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,639
my suspicion is that this is all just a

1097
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:06,558
gigantic waste of our time

1098
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:08,639
um i'm gonna do it in these steps anyway

1099
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,319
to take it slower but i'm guessing that

1100
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,719
what we're actually going to want to do

1101
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:13,440
is get rid of this entirely and they'll

1102
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,159
eventually

1103
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,559
this thing will eventually just be a

1104
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,039
giant flags field or something

1105
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,720
that just says here's all the stuff

1106
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:23,920
that's supposed to be in this room

1107
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,439
because we're probably going to want to

1108
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:30,559
do stuff that goes oh if there's snakes

1109
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,880
and switches then do this

1110
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,000
right so it's probably going to have to

1111
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,000
be like you call

1112
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,679
gen room and gen room is this giant

1113
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,480
function that's like does all this crazy

1114
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:42,558
stuff

1115
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,920
right but we're gonna wanna do that

1116
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,680
checking so i think this was probably

1117
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,680
just a bad idea because

1118
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:51,279
although the world um can probably get a

1119
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:52,799
you know maybe can get away with how we

1120
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,079
did it i think

1121
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:58,000
rooms can't be cannot because of

1122
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,800
their they're like the central aspect of

1123
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,880
the gameplay they have to be

1124
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,920
sort of knowledgeable about all the

1125
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,240
things that are going on

1126
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,639
in them so i really don't know that this

1127
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:12,558
makes sense as a thing

1128
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:16,000
right but we'll see

1129
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,880
so anyway i think that's all of the

1130
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,318
things that have that sort of pattern

1131
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,559
like thing happening

1132
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:23,358
so in here then when i when i make one

1133
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,800
of those

1134
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:30,000
gen create entity pattern

1135
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:34,400
tile switch pattern i can now take this

1136
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,400
out and dump it in

1137
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,280
and

1138
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,598
uh we've got this place orphan thing and

1139
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:49,440
that's really a gen

1140
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:52,480
create entity pattern uh this is like a

1141
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,838
it's it's not really an orphan pattern

1142
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:59,838
per se um it's sort of

1143
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:59,838
it's sort of more like a

1144
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:06,159
it's it's sort of more like a npc

1145
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,039
pattern so like this doesn't probably

1146
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,159
need to be

1147
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:14,079
specific in that way

1148
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:16,960
um it can probably be

1149
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,960
more like

1150
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,759
where does orphan name tag go in this

1151
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:27,838
by the way

1152
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:44,880
it's here

1153
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:48,318
okay um so if we make this pattern

1154
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:51,838
the orphan name tag thing i guess

1155
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,318
goes at the beginning of the orphan so i

1156
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:55,599
guess

1157
00:50:52,318 --> 00:51:00,318
it's like gen entity

1158
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:02,559
pattern or canonity

1159
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:03,519
orphan or i don't even know what's the

1160
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,280
result i guess

1161
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:11,119
result equals add

1162
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,119
pattern um

1163
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,400
we call these patterns so npc pattern

1164
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,960
so we're going to add an npc pattern

1165
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,680
here and then i think we just do result

1166
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,720
base asset equals get tag hash and it's

1167
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:31,039
going to be orphan

1168
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:33,679
name tag uh and asset none

1169
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:33,679
probably

1170
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:38,639
i mean i don't really know i'm not sure

1171
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:39,919
how this thing was supposed to work and

1172
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:41,440
i don't care

1173
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,599
so anyway uh it's gonna be something

1174
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,760
like this where you

1175
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,359
where you have just that first pat part

1176
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,040
of it there

1177
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:52,558
um and then this that's literally all

1178
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,000
this thing does

1179
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,000
and you can see that this is kind of

1180
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
stupid like these are not

1181
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,838
these really make any sense and they're

1182
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,440
kind of dumb

1183
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:05,679
so uh if we move on from there

1184
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,880
and and this is probably this is extra

1185
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:09,199
stupid

1186
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,880
like all this stuff is really stupid and

1187
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:14,558
we should probably

1188
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:17,440
change it um whatever point being

1189
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,000
if we look at this these are the same

1190
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,200
you know these

1191
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,239
are these are the same the same code

1192
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,239
so it's it's just this

1193
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,400
it's it's something like that right and

1194
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:35,838
we'll work on that later

1195
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,318
so when we do place cat and place orphan

1196
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,880
these are actually just place npc you

1197
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:40,880
know what i'm saying

1198
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:47,838
oops

1199
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,159
and i don't think we want uh this stuff

1200
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,480
because you know this this should just

1201
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:05,759
be tag hannah

1202
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,800
tag fred and tag molly

1203
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,359
you know this this should not be none of

1204
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,240
this stuff

1205
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:14,078
should be the way it is so placing npcs

1206
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,919
in the world should just be like

1207
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:19,599
you know i don't know

1208
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,440
why we did it this way but you know it's

1209
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,880
not not necessarily bad but there's

1210
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,880
the you know the people

1211
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:29,440
and the cats and so those are all placed

1212
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,800
around

1213
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:36,720
and we should

1214
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:40,839
then say i don't know

1215
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:43,838
uh here's the place npc

1216
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:43,838
pattern

1217
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,240
and

1218
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,760
it wouldn't be add orphan

1219
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:59,919
it would just be like add this npc

1220
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:59,920
um

1221
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,720
and and i don't know we're just gonna

1222
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,039
we're just gonna dump this crap

1223
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:08,399
directly in here is what we're actually

1224
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,838
gonna do

1225
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,400
like that um so here we create the

1226
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:16,318
actual orphan

1227
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,920
tag orphan should really be in there on

1228
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,400
the npc pattern

1229
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,639
so this like npc should be like tag

1230
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,480
orphan probably although is orphan even

1231
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:26,799
in there i don't know

1232
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,519
let's look at what the tags are because

1233
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,000
we probably want to update those

1234
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:32,000
as well

1235
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,800
like where is tag orphan is that even in

1236
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:39,838
here

1237
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:53,119
so it's orphan and then the thing and

1238
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,760
then what are the cats

1239
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,280
yeah so like this like this stuff i

1240
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,880
don't know

1241
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,240
that doesn't really make any sense so i

1242
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,680
think this should be more like that's

1243
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:07,358
fred

1244
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:09,759
you know that's hannah um

1245
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:11,598
and that's molly and when you look at

1246
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,040
these i don't know

1247
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:18,079
if they really need like cat

1248
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:18,079
put in front of them

1249
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,160
you know it doesn't really make much

1250
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,400
sense because it's just

1251
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:26,318
that that's just the character same with

1252
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,400
these like i don't know

1253
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,798
that you actually need these to say

1254
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:34,079
orphan because it's just

1255
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:36,079
whoever the person is you know

1256
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,200
and putting i don't know what putting

1257
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,480
orphan in front of it

1258
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:43,039
does for you other than just make

1259
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,280
matters more complicated for no reason

1260
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:49,440
so i do wonder if we want to just do

1261
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:53,200
something more like this

1262
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,920
um right because i'm not sure what the

1263
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:56,879
point is

1264
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,200
of over complicating the tags because i

1265
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:03,838
think the tags were just kind of dumb

1266
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:03,838
and we only really need them

1267
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,920
we only really need them to do stuff for

1268
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,838
us that we actually care about

1269
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,838
so if we want to say like here is

1270
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:16,000
the body of the thing and the head of

1271
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:17,920
the thing then it makes sense to have a

1272
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,880
separate tag that's like what part is it

1273
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,079
so it's dylan

1274
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:24,480
head dylan body or whatever right

1275
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,680
that stuff makes a lot of sense the

1276
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,838
other stuff doesn't and

1277
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:28,879
furthermore the fact that there's asset

1278
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,279
type

1279
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,880
with base like that stuff is dumb we

1280
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,240
should get rid of that as well

1281
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,440
it should just be the tags here are like

1282
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:40,798
layered body or body layered those are

1283
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,400
the two tags we needed

1284
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,798
the rest of this stuff was just a waste

1285
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:49,358
of time right

1286
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:50,480
um so yeah we just we have a tremendous

1287
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,639
amount of work to do

1288
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,838
uh to clean all this stuff up that's

1289
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:57,279
just the nature of the beast

1290
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:59,119
like it's fine you know i don't mind uh

1291
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,880
but when you actually can start to see

1292
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,039
how things should be working

1293
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,720
you want to do it right you don't want

1294
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,400
to just go oh we didn't do it that way

1295
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:07,199
before so we're not going to do it that

1296
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,119
way now

1297
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,118
you know what i mean um

1298
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,720
that's just a bad excuse

1299
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:25,200
so we have molly fred and hannah now um

1300
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,318
and they're gonna be in there and i

1301
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:28,879
don't remember

1302
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:31,838
uh where do we have our there it is i'm

1303
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,838
like wait no we've got a

1304
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:37,599
so let's do molly

1305
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:44,400
fred hannah

1306
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:44,399
and

1307
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,079
there we go now these are all

1308
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,920
capitalized but in the game ht they're

1309
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,920
lower case so i guess these tags are

1310
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,400
case insensitive

1311
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,400
i guess

1312
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,880
not sure why but that's what we did so

1313
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:06,240
it is

1314
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,400
okay um so

1315
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:09,598
getting rid of like orphan in here

1316
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,480
because it's not

1317
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,480
useful oops

1318
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,960
i'm just going to remove it just looking

1319
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,160
i'm just going to remove it manually

1320
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,838
because i don't

1321
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:25,679
really want to remove it automatically

1322
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:29,119
right now because i

1323
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:31,358
want to see where this is actually being

1324
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,358
done

1325
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,000
why would that ever be the default i'm

1326
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,159
so confused about why

1327
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,079
the default is to delete up to the thing

1328
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,159
and then if you hit it again it deletes

1329
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,680
the rest of it like that makes it

1330
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:45,679
impossible to ever delete

1331
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:46,719
one thing using that hotkey it kind of

1332
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:49,279
makes the hotkey

1333
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:50,719
worthless but somehow that's the default

1334
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,559
it's really weird

1335
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:54,719
at least it seems like it is i don't

1336
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:58,400
know maybe it's not

1337
00:58:54,719 --> 00:59:01,759
um so i think that's

1338
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,519
fine uh for now we don't have to look at

1339
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,720
the rest of this stuff

1340
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:11,280
that's all is what it is

1341
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:15,439
yeah um okay so

1342
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,440
let's keep going here so let's

1343
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:19,838
do a structs

1344
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,639
like so um

1345
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:28,239
[Music]

1346
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:32,400
and the recursive open tile search thing

1347
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:37,439
like i said i don't really know

1348
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:39,838
um that we want to keep doing this

1349
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,519
so i'm just going to say that that goes

1350
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:43,519
away like that's going away

1351
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:53,760
as is this um well

1352
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:55,199
so i guess i don't know no because i

1353
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,599
don't even want to go in that order

1354
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:57,598
anyway

1355
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:03,279
so those are all going away goodbye um

1356
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:08,078
i don't care about any of this i don't

1357
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:28,078
think

1358
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:31,200
let me look at where that's used

1359
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,599
yeah so so all of that stuff i can

1360
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:34,318
i think i can just do directly now so i

1361
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,838
probably

1362
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:42,798
will do all that stuff directly

1363
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:46,719
now yeah what's this stuff

1364
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:49,679
yeah so all of this stuff is pointless

1365
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,639
and we can get rid of it so lots of code

1366
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:54,480
can go away

1367
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:54,879
which is great um so get piece asset can

1368
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,280
get

1369
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,280
can get removed goodbye

1370
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,200
and goodbye

1371
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,480
alrighty so in here where we're doing

1372
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,040
entity visible piece and we do the chain

1373
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,119
testing

1374
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:16,318
all we have to do here is just say oh

1375
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,640
well just call get tag hash

1376
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:19,920
because now you can build the tags uh

1377
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:25,838
directly

1378
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:25,838
right and

1379
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,659
we should be able to make that work

1380
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:35,750
right

1381
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:35,750
[Music]

1382
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:39,838
um

1383
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:54,960
and i thought we had one of these

1384
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:54,960
that specifically works

1385
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:02,160
nope yeah

1386
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,399
i thought we had one of these that

1387
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:05,519
specifically did the changing of the

1388
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,639
hash

1389
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:08,639
from the actual hash

1390
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,440
did we not

1391
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:24,160
oh weird so it's just called get tag

1392
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,159
hash

1393
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:30,159
there you go

1394
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:35,838
um

1395
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,000
what does ad piece take

1396
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:51,280
oh weird and any visible pieces take

1397
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,480
those this is so crazy what we're

1398
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,079
looking at here

1399
01:02:52,480 --> 01:03:03,519
so so this is all and that's just an

1400
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:05,920
asset tag hash plus a variant

1401
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:05,920
okay

1402
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:18,880
this is crazy

1403
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:20,480
this is so crazy because you're looking

1404
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,400
it's like the entity visible piece

1405
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:26,159
already has a variant

1406
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,160
in it right here

1407
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:35,599
right

1408
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,599
so that's all really kind of nuts um

1409
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:44,240
yeah we need to simplify this stuff this

1410
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:45,440
is my this is just two nuts

1411
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:46,879
all right so we're going to have to take

1412
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,358
this slow because there's way too much

1413
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,519
crap

1414
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:53,838
in here right so when we add these

1415
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:54,798
these don't have any variants anyway

1416
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:57,199
right

1417
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:58,079
so anytime you do an ad piece call you

1418
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:00,399
should be fine

1419
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,480
to just not pass that right and i have

1420
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,039
no idea what's going on with the variant

1421
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,039
stuff

1422
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,319
because why would you need an additional

1423
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,480
variant

1424
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:10,159
right like it doesn't make any sense so

1425
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,280
we must have done that and kind of only

1426
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:13,440
half finished it

1427
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,839
because there's a variant value right

1428
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,318
here and then there's one right here

1429
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:20,400
as well you know what i mean and so

1430
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:23,279
maybe that was meant to be welded in

1431
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,599
or maybe it wasn't i don't know but it

1432
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,880
doesn't really make a lot of sense

1433
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,880
why you would need to do that

1434
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,078
i think it was probably just because we

1435
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,920
had such a long conduit we thought we

1436
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,920
would save ourselves time by doing that

1437
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:43,440
right

1438
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,440
but forget that

1439
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,839
because now that we're actually creating

1440
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:52,719
these things directly where they're

1441
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:54,960
actually spec'd

1442
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:56,399
we shouldn't need to do that anymore

1443
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:00,240
right

1444
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,690
so we can grab the variant here

1445
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:03,759
and

1446
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,760
[Music]

1447
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:12,639
we can get the bitmap match there

1448
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:16,880
and be done uh okay

1449
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:23,838
so get tag hash add piece

1450
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:23,838
blah blah blah blah um

1451
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,838
here's a bunch of ad piece nonsense with

1452
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,760
assets

1453
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:34,318
uh i don't know what these other ad

1454
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:37,839
piece calls are okay so they're these

1455
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:37,838
so it's just

1456
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:47,759
that and i think we're probably good now

1457
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:51,920
so kind of just a pain in the butt

1458
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:53,039
but you know it's always seems obvious

1459
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,318
once you do stuff

1460
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,319
this goes away

1461
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:05,759
um gen create

1462
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:09,440
entity pattern

1463
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,440
we've got to get rid of the semicolon

1464
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:18,639
and we're back so change hash just isn't

1465
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:20,959
a thing anymore it's just get hash

1466
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:20,960
uh

1467
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,720
i don't know what that is complaining

1468
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,720
about

1469
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,920
oh it doesn't know what the base asset

1470
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,199
is

1471
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:40,318
so that's actually in the

1472
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:43,439
gen in the pattern

1473
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:46,239
so it's it's just the pattern right

1474
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,400
is where that is so that's pretty easy

1475
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:50,078
so here's the thing we don't know

1476
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,318
when we add the cat we're not really

1477
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:57,200
sure where it's gonna go

1478
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:57,199
um here's the snake pattern and

1479
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,240
i guess this is technically like the cat

1480
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:05,920
pattern

1481
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:05,919
right um

1482
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,480
and really i guess it's npc pattern now

1483
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,599
so i guess we don't even need cat

1484
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,240
pattern maybe

1485
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,280
i mean maybe we do maybe we don't we'll

1486
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:18,959
we'll look at that

1487
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,359
i guess later but i'm gonna remove that

1488
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,358
for now

1489
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,318
so okay uh

1490
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:28,798
[Music]

1491
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:30,480
should be kind of okay here except for

1492
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:31,358
the placement part i would think that

1493
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:36,240
would be the only

1494
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:40,838
real thing that's broken um

1495
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:44,318
because everything else should be okay

1496
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:46,000
and so really we should just be left

1497
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:50,480
with the placement calls

1498
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,519
in red which is exactly what we have

1499
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,519
um these don't return anything so that

1500
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:58,559
doesn't need to happen

1501
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:02,079
um same here

1502
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:04,720
so the tile switch pattern now

1503
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,960
uh we can just do exactly what this is

1504
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:10,798
doing

1505
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:14,240
uh this none of this

1506
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:16,719
has to happen so so now all we're really

1507
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:19,759
going to be doing

1508
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,560
is looking at that particular element of

1509
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,920
the grid

1510
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:25,120
so so the code that used to have to

1511
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,640
happen

1512
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:32,399
in here uh happens

1513
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:39,838
outside of here now right so basically

1514
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:39,838
this code

1515
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:45,119
um is now what's happening

1516
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:53,759
it's what's happening uh none of that

1517
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:55,679
happens anymore

1518
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,640
in fact this and this code will be going

1519
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,640
away right

1520
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:02,319
so this is the actual code that we need

1521
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:05,358
to to now

1522
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:06,000
call in here we get the content

1523
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,679
structural

1524
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:13,039
thing so this part it's it's this right

1525
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:14,000
we are going to look through uh the area

1526
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:16,319
that we're at

1527
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,880
which is like the part we don't know is

1528
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:22,159
where it is but we're gonna get it

1529
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:24,880
we don't need that um

1530
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,158
we're going to take the brain slot of

1531
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,440
that thing

1532
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:33,278
so you know

1533
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:34,238
uh this part will be coming from the

1534
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,199
pattern

1535
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:38,959
whatever it told us the brain was and

1536
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:42,479
then the slot keeps going i

1537
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:45,520
suspect i'm just going to say

1538
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:48,959
that this is probably not in there

1539
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:52,000
it's probably just that now um

1540
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:55,039
we don't care about that

1541
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,520
we don't care about this or that because

1542
01:09:55,039 --> 01:10:01,039
that's all fixed now

1543
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,080
this is the part we need to set for this

1544
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:05,439
thing

1545
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:05,439
we don't need any of this

1546
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:18,480
we do need any of this

1547
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,480
no no right

1548
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:23,760
so all of that is fine and

1549
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,199
this is just the entity that we're going

1550
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:32,480
to edit so

1551
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:32,479
this is i think all we need uh

1552
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:45,840
and and that just works right

1553
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:51,359
that seems good

1554
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:55,920
um then we get down to here so now we're

1555
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:58,479
into

1556
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,239
placing we got to do the stuff for

1557
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:01,759
placing the npcs we're almost done with

1558
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:04,399
these so that's good so again

1559
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,320
not too bad a pretty major code

1560
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:06,879
reorganization but but really not too

1561
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:09,920
bad

1562
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,840
you know not not super horrible

1563
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:15,520
probably finish it next weekend right

1564
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,520
not not not too long of a thing

1565
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,600
it's probably like a three hour three

1566
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:22,158
hour reorg roughly

1567
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,159
something like that

1568
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:26,799
all right so then we get into here and

1569
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,640
uh yeah

1570
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,560
later this will become fancier because

1571
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,640
we'll probably have like actual edit

1572
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,480
like actual tag stuff we'll set but for

1573
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,880
now again we don't we just modify the

1574
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:36,879
places

1575
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:42,960
and so in here we say npc pattern okay

1576
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,960
we've got the orphan

1577
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:49,759
we don't really need that uh we

1578
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,279
we don't really need any of this so

1579
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,039
now we have like what's our facing

1580
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:55,198
direction going to be well we'll just

1581
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:59,119
store that in a variable

1582
01:11:55,198 --> 01:12:02,319
and then we'll try to put this entity

1583
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:03,279
in in places so there's one entity with

1584
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:07,198
a body and a head

1585
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:10,559
looks like how that works the pieces

1586
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:14,000
for their facing direction um

1587
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:17,520
need to have that set so

1588
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,279
i assume that the entity just sets its

1589
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,880
facing direction i think that we don't

1590
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:23,840
need to set it on individual pieces they

1591
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,840
all inherit it right

1592
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:28,639
it's just like a transform hierarchy so

1593
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:31,279
they get it from their parent

1594
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:34,079
so that's all fine uh this should just

1595
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:34,079
work i think

1596
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,559
right all that's fine

1597
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:46,960
yeah actually i think all that just

1598
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,960
works

1599
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,840
right

1600
01:12:52,158 --> 01:13:00,319
the base asset comes from the pattern

1601
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:04,480
so that's done and then

1602
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:07,759
yeah we're we're where we are

1603
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:10,238
and inside this uh

1604
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,239
append entity thing like this none of

1605
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:15,039
this has to happen so

1606
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:16,399
we just need the the part where we

1607
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:19,439
actually place this stuff

1608
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:21,599
in the world so like this stuff here

1609
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:23,119
um is is what we would be talking about

1610
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,079
and it's like

1611
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:27,920
this kind of a thing so we would place

1612
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:30,079
uh the entity

1613
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,440
on a traversible and we don't know how

1614
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:33,119
to do that yet

1615
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:35,198
and we would place this one at a

1616
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:37,519
traversible and we don't know how to do

1617
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,519
that yet

1618
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,440
so those are the two parts we don't we

1619
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:44,640
don't know

1620
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:47,119
as far as ad conversation is concerned

1621
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,760
i don't know that we need that to really

1622
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:51,279
be

1623
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:55,840
a uh callable thing but we might

1624
01:13:51,279 --> 01:14:01,840
so i'm gonna leave it that way i don't

1625
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,840
think there's a base asset for that

1626
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:09,199
in fact it doesn't use it right so

1627
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,199
so it's just that

1628
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,079
oops and obviously we don't need

1629
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:17,600
any of this so it's literally just

1630
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:29,840
placing that thing

1631
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:29,840
somewhere and we just don't know where

1632
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,640
so the dialog gets placed there and so

1633
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:36,559
yeah i'm going to think we're pretty

1634
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,000
much we've pretty much ported all of

1635
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,360
that code now and the

1636
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,560
main thing we need to do now is start

1637
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:41,279
thinking about how those patterns will

1638
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,640
actually work

1639
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,960
so let's go ahead and clean up some of

1640
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:48,320
this stuff

1641
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,359
before we do that um and then you know

1642
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:51,599
then at that point i think we'll

1643
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:54,079
probably call it a day so

1644
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,120
this ad entity call is really now an ad

1645
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:58,079
pattern call

1646
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:58,640
and it takes the gen entity pattern

1647
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:01,679
thing

1648
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:03,360
or whatever it is uh i don't

1649
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,760
even remember what's called gen crate

1650
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:05,759
pattern

1651
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,679
um

1652
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:17,279
so it's like that and

1653
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,279
add tag is not a thing

1654
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,000
and

1655
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,600
append entity is also not a thing

1656
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:34,560
uh place entity is

1657
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,560
also not a thing

1658
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,840
um

1659
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:45,279
right so

1660
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:53,839
hold on

1661
01:15:54,719 --> 01:16:07,840
yeah so it's really that

1662
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,119
yeah and so really this thing doesn't

1663
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:21,840
need to look like this

1664
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:21,840
either so

1665
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:35,840
so why why are there even two of these

1666
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,679
what what even is the point of that

1667
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:44,399
anyone want to tell me because i don't

1668
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,000
really see it

1669
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:47,679
so like when we place one of these

1670
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,079
things

1671
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:52,399
why are we not just saying look the add

1672
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:55,198
the pattern to this room

1673
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:57,839
like that's what we're doing right so

1674
01:16:55,198 --> 01:17:00,799
when we say add pattern

1675
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,279
it should just be like you add it to the

1676
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,640
room

1677
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:08,319
because where else are you gonna put it

1678
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:11,360
right um and you always know

1679
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:14,479
which one you're doing really

1680
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:17,839
i mean i guess we could stratify it

1681
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:17,839
out but like

1682
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,000
so so i don't know like this this

1683
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:26,158
doesn't

1684
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,479
like i think i could be really wrong

1685
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:30,559
about this but i feel like

1686
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:32,158
you're adding these groups and the

1687
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,480
groups are now

1688
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:36,238
all you need you don't need another

1689
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:40,000
level down

1690
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:43,039
right because a room has a set of these

1691
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,880
and there aren't multiple of these

1692
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,399
so i'm pretty sure really what we're

1693
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,400
looking at is this

1694
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:56,719
right um

1695
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:02,719
so let's just do it

1696
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,719
let's just finish it off

1697
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:13,439
damn i gotta fix this thing

1698
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:15,679
um

1699
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,678
it's the weirdest thing like i wish i

1700
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:20,880
knew what the logic was for that

1701
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:21,520
it makes no sense to me you go back one

1702
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,920
token

1703
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,320
it thinks that was a token but in no

1704
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:30,960
universe could that possibly be a token

1705
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:33,920
but then if you have like this

1706
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:36,480
and you delete it deletes the comma and

1707
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,480
the token

1708
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:42,880
it's so weird it's like it's it's

1709
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:43,439
on underscores it's super conservative

1710
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,359
and on

1711
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:46,639
commas it's super aggressive and i have

1712
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:48,238
no idea where that

1713
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,800
why that's happening or why you would

1714
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:52,479
ever want that more importantly

1715
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,159
like i mean i guess there must be some

1716
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:56,399
reason but

1717
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:58,079
i i'm just i'm not sure why that why

1718
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:00,960
that would be a thing

1719
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:00,960
you would ever do

1720
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:09,039
okay so we've got our little patterns

1721
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:10,479
here and

1722
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:12,719
i'm just going to say that that's what

1723
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,319
happens so you do add pattern

1724
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:15,920
and you give it the room that you're

1725
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:20,158
adding the pattern on

1726
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:24,000
like so it does this garbage

1727
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:28,079
here like so and it just says

1728
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:31,439
okay like here's the pattern

1729
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,559
that you asked for that's really

1730
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:35,359
annoying

1731
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,560
um and then you just go like okay

1732
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:41,519
results

1733
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:44,880
result results this goes away

1734
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:48,840
and we do

1735
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:52,480
first pattern first

1736
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:57,360
pattern and

1737
01:19:52,479 --> 01:20:01,119
that okay so we create one of these

1738
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:05,759
we set the next we make the room oops

1739
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:08,079
we make the room by tommy wiseau

1740
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,079
uh

1741
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,119
add that on and now i think we are good

1742
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:17,280
to

1743
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:19,840
go okay okay so what else we got

1744
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:19,840
um

1745
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:33,119
okay that all looks fine

1746
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:34,960
uh place nbc looks like the only thing

1747
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:38,960
that's actually doing the search

1748
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:40,719
that way so that's probably fine um

1749
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,960
that all looks fine here's the ad

1750
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:44,000
pattern uh this is the room so we need

1751
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,679
to pass

1752
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:51,279
past the room with tom erwiseau

1753
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:53,119
and then i think those are the placement

1754
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:56,559
things which we know we need to

1755
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:58,880
fix anyway uh this is just a genetic

1756
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:02,480
pattern

1757
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:05,679
otherwise i think it's what it

1758
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:08,079
should be that all looks right

1759
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,079
um

1760
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:17,439
that's just a spelling error so

1761
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:17,439
looks good

1762
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:21,759
and

1763
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,880
looks like we added like a chair at some

1764
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:35,359
point i don't

1765
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,359
who cares about that at all

1766
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,039
um

1767
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:48,238
all right so

1768
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:49,359
here's the part that we actually were um

1769
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:51,039
this is where we actually had the

1770
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:52,158
variant stuff so let's try and clean

1771
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:53,600
this up now so we can

1772
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:54,799
we can figure out what the heck we want

1773
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,000
to do because it's all going to be

1774
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,920
inside generate room like

1775
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,158
that's where all of the garbage is going

1776
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,158
to be

1777
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:06,560
so uh forget tree tags

1778
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,600
you can see already we've got the piece

1779
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,600
here we're creating

1780
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,840
i don't even really know like that's not

1781
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:16,079
in the cube this is adding

1782
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,199
the tree entity so i'm pretty sure we

1783
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:21,119
just change all this

1784
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:23,839
and just say we just call add tree right

1785
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:24,399
is what actually happens here so i think

1786
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,079
this

1787
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,960
this should all be simplified quite a

1788
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:30,960
bit right it's just because this code

1789
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,880
like you know we've never really spent

1790
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,480
any time we just dump stuff into it

1791
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,520
and never spend any time looking at

1792
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:41,198
going like how should this actually work

1793
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:43,280
so uh get tree tags is fine

1794
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:45,198
um but i don't know that we really need

1795
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:47,439
it i think what we can do instead

1796
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:50,158
is just have a thing that's like add

1797
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:53,279
tree or whatever it needs to be

1798
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:54,719
yeah um so let's try that i'm gonna go

1799
01:22:53,279 --> 01:22:57,359
over into energy gen here

1800
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:59,520
and i'm just gonna have up here like an

1801
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:01,198
ad tree call for now

1802
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,560
where we do an internal thing where

1803
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:04,879
we're just like okay

1804
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,000
add the tree here's the thing that you

1805
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,239
know does

1806
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,560
whatever random randomization we were

1807
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:12,319
doing before

1808
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,080
so i don't have to think about it and

1809
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:18,000
this is just like

1810
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:21,439
add tree and

1811
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,439
you know it it adds the tree uh

1812
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:24,638
for right now we're just gonna we're not

1813
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:25,359
even gonna pass anything in because we

1814
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:27,039
don't even

1815
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:28,399
pass in data about what kind of tree it

1816
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:29,840
should be i guess although

1817
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:31,119
you know we'll see if we actually did

1818
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,319
have some of that in here we can pass it

1819
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:33,439
through but for now we're gonna assume

1820
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:34,960
we don't because i don't know that we

1821
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,839
did

1822
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,319
um and then we're just gonna say like

1823
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,880
okay

1824
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:42,399
you can see here like the way that we're

1825
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,159
adding this stuff on here

1826
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:45,839
we we just need to change the way that

1827
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:48,559
we're looking at this because

1828
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,920
we we don't just stack up tags randomly

1829
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,520
and throw it into a tag matcher anymore

1830
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,719
there's like specific tags that go with

1831
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,080
specific things

1832
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,840
so we're going to want to fix the way

1833
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:57,039
this thing is doing what it's doing and

1834
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,480
that's fine

1835
01:23:57,039 --> 01:24:01,679
but first things first let's deal with

1836
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:04,079
the tree part

1837
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:05,119
so you can see here this is the tree

1838
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:06,719
thing so

1839
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:09,760
what we would do here is just do add

1840
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,760
tree right

1841
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:18,960
so we would do add tree and

1842
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,960
we would place the tree so

1843
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:25,679
we do that and then like place tree

1844
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:27,439
on traversible or sorry place entity on

1845
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,960
traversible

1846
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:33,359
and that's the traversible i don't

1847
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,560
really know what that is about or why we

1848
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,439
care

1849
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:39,199
um but it'd be something like this and

1850
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:41,439
when we add the tree

1851
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:41,439
uh

1852
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:46,479
it would i mean that would be it right

1853
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,400
it just adds the tree

1854
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:58,718
and and there's the tree so i think

1855
01:24:50,399 --> 01:25:03,119
uh it's something like this

1856
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,119
uh where this

1857
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:09,198
where we do add uh inanimate that

1858
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:11,439
creates

1859
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:12,319
uh one of these things so the first

1860
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:15,439
piece

1861
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:17,599
uh wants to have a variant set for it

1862
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:19,439
um and so we could even just have it so

1863
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,320
that if this is just you know this is

1864
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:21,919
just a variant

1865
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:23,599
comes in here and it's normally set to

1866
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:26,319
zero we can even just do that

1867
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,520
if we want to select body variants

1868
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:30,158
equals variance

1869
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,880
something like that so that in here

1870
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:34,319
where we do

1871
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,319
add tree we can say

1872
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:38,319
add obstacle

1873
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:43,679
the variant is some random number

1874
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:52,239
whatever it is uh and then the

1875
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:55,840
asset tag hash is just

1876
01:25:52,238 --> 01:25:55,839
i you know this this thing

1877
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:10,320
and that's it so i mean man like

1878
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:12,399
so much sort of crazy bookkeeping

1879
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:14,158
gets eliminated which i think is just a

1880
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:17,439
good sign

1881
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:18,799
um we we

1882
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:21,198
don't know what we're doing with this

1883
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:23,039
stuff yet i mean to be sure

1884
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:24,879
so we're pretty far from out of the

1885
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:26,158
woods on the placement side of things

1886
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,359
but that's the part that we know is

1887
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:28,638
going to be hard anyway because we just

1888
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:30,000
have to write code that does

1889
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:32,000
intelligent stuff for that which is

1890
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,920
going to be tough

1891
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,359
um but anyway so if we go ahead and do

1892
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,119
add obstacle here again

1893
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:41,198
rather than having to make these calls

1894
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:45,760
we just do the actual thing

1895
01:26:41,198 --> 01:26:45,759
in place which i think is way better

1896
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,440
so we do it uh the tag hash here uh the

1897
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:56,159
ref

1898
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:58,158
part of this is is it the placement call

1899
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:05,839
right so this would just be

1900
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:05,839
uh place unity on traversible

1901
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:10,399
i mean i'm just gonna call it lamp

1902
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:22,158
and uh you know

1903
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,679
that's it that's that's all we're doing

1904
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:28,158
um

1905
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:30,800
so yeah let's fix this up uh asset hash

1906
01:27:28,158 --> 01:27:32,559
random choice tag winter tag none uh

1907
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,880
what's the complaint is you don't know

1908
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:37,920
who jen is

1909
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,400
ah so it needs the entropy um so this

1910
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,719
needs

1911
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:42,079
a way to get entropy uh for the

1912
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:45,198
randomization

1913
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:48,479
so i'm going to have it pass the

1914
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:51,039
like jen whatever those

1915
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:51,039
world gen

1916
01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:01,840
the i don't even know what what's that

1917
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:01,839
thing called

1918
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:07,439
world generator

1919
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:11,600
so i'm going to have the thing take the

1920
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,198
world generator because it needs

1921
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,840
entropy and we're just going to say that

1922
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:18,719
that's fine but it needs that

1923
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,760
um for add obstacle asset hash

1924
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:22,319
unilateral

1925
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,320
gen hp

1926
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:32,239
that seems okay though

1927
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:32,238
uh oh whoops

1928
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:36,719
there we go

1929
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:42,560
and we don't really need to do that like

1930
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:45,679
we could just go in and set the variance

1931
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,960
ourselves but i felt like yeah just pass

1932
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:48,800
it through i mean who cares

1933
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,000
i don't know that may be a mistake we

1934
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:54,560
may just want to

1935
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,560
to set it after the fact but

1936
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:59,360
anyway okay so now we've got tags where

1937
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:02,399
we're doing like

1938
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:04,559
wall or floor which one we're doing

1939
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:05,839
right so what i'd rather do here is just

1940
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:10,000
say like okay

1941
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:13,600
there's an asset tag uh

1942
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,800
for the type like what the actual

1943
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:20,639
like squ like tile is like

1944
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:23,279
tile type or something right and

1945
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,480
we're gonna assume i suppose that it's a

1946
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:27,519
floor

1947
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:28,638
um but we'll set it in both cases so

1948
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:32,560
tile type

1949
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:39,840
equals wall here and tile material

1950
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:39,840
equals wood or whatever right

1951
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,679
because these have to go in order or

1952
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:47,039
they at least have to be

1953
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:49,199
like sane now they're not as just random

1954
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:50,840
as they used to be so you kind of have

1955
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:53,759
to

1956
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:58,079
actually um

1957
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:58,079
specify them in a particular way

1958
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:07,840
so that seems fine

1959
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,638
and then uh and these could actually be

1960
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,840
things that are specified a little bit

1961
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:16,079
in a little bit more interesting a way

1962
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,480
as well but uh it doesn't matter

1963
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:19,600
point being we go through here and then

1964
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:23,678
when we actually

1965
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:26,719
create the thing which would happen

1966
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:30,079
here right

1967
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:33,279
um piece variance is going to be

1968
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:35,198
the unilateral there and the

1969
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:36,399
when we do this add piece this would

1970
01:30:35,198 --> 01:30:39,759
just be like get tag

1971
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:43,679
hash um from

1972
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:46,079
our tile type and tile material right

1973
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,960
so it actually reads better too like you

1974
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:48,559
can even

1975
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,239
even just with that you can now see

1976
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,440
what's going on there's like two

1977
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:53,039
tags that you're setting and you're

1978
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:54,638
setting them based on some you know

1979
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:57,039
parameters you had

1980
01:30:54,639 --> 01:31:00,000
and now you could pass one in as well so

1981
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:02,238
like you know we had this thing

1982
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,600
uh in here where we were like gen room

1983
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:06,079
and it was like what was the type

1984
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,280
of the room or something like that uh

1985
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,639
where it was like stone

1986
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:12,559
floor that could now that could now

1987
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:14,239
actually just be like what's the type of

1988
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,920
tile you want on the floor

1989
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:17,519
right or something so you could see how

1990
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,840
you could like it makes things better

1991
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,800
too

1992
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:22,480
in a way but anyway it is it actually

1993
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:26,400
makes more flexible i should say

1994
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:29,439
easier to make like parameterized

1995
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:32,079
so when we do add tree

1996
01:31:29,439 --> 01:31:33,759
we need to send down the generator thing

1997
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:35,039
there because we don't it can't get the

1998
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,480
entropy that it needs

1999
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:40,158
i don't know what this is complaining

2000
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:40,158
about this add obstacle call

2001
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:50,159
um it looks like it doesn't

2002
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:53,198
like the oh that's why there you go

2003
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:54,238
uh so other than the placement stuff

2004
01:31:53,198 --> 01:31:56,079
what else we got

2005
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:57,599
uh so generated first of all so this at

2006
01:31:56,079 --> 01:31:58,000
when you're creating the door now we can

2007
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,880
literally

2008
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,679
just do this directly um where we do an

2009
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,719
ad obstacle

2010
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:07,760
i don't know why we're adding a tree for

2011
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:10,639
doors uh but we are maybe that

2012
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:12,880
can change now like since we can add an

2013
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:17,119
obstacle much more easily

2014
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:20,800
maybe we do a get tag hash

2015
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:23,760
here and where we were doing the

2016
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,199
uh asset block thing with the materials

2017
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:29,039
like maybe in here we say

2018
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:32,638
like okay uh it's a it's a it's a

2019
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:37,600
um a wall

2020
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:40,880
uh made of stone i don't know

2021
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,440
don't look at me i look at program games

2022
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,760
to you

2023
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:48,879
no uh so anyway when we do add obstacle

2024
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:52,719
uh we would just pass the

2025
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,719
the region that we're using

2026
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:59,840
and then we just need to place it on

2027
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:01,039
this location so we just oops so we just

2028
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,159
need to do a place

2029
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:06,479
entity on traversible

2030
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:06,479
and

2031
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:12,639
and it goes like on top of the thing i

2032
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:17,439
think that's how we decided to do it

2033
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:17,440
so we would just say place the door

2034
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:23,519
on that on that traversible and that's

2035
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:27,840
it

2036
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:31,199
yep so then

2037
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:37,360
uh we just loop through the patterns now

2038
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:40,559
and we let each pattern generator uh

2039
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:43,039
there we go uh we let each pattern do

2040
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,039
its thing

2041
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:49,198
and this is the part that we need to

2042
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:50,079
still do but you know this gets a lot

2043
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:53,759
simpler

2044
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:56,559
as well um so this stuff here

2045
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:58,000
you know we probably want to keep a

2046
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:01,760
little bit of it just so we can see

2047
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,679
like what we were doing um

2048
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,360
when we go to to like implement the

2049
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:08,158
search code

2050
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:09,119
uh but basically what we're really gonna

2051
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:11,759
do now

2052
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:12,479
is is just call it's just a dispatch

2053
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,000
list

2054
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:15,759
we're just saying look everyone in this

2055
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,719
list gets a chance to do something to

2056
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,039
the room

2057
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:21,039
but that's all right so it's it's

2058
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:24,238
literally just that

2059
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:24,880
um and you pass like the construction

2060
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:28,479
grid

2061
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:28,480
and the pattern you were trying to make

2062
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:37,359
um and off it goes right

2063
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:38,399
um so yeah like i think we're basically

2064
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:41,839
done

2065
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:45,439
uh with all of the porting at that point

2066
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:48,159
um and we now just need a way

2067
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:49,759
of of actually placing these things

2068
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:51,439
which is like i said the hard part but

2069
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,960
we've organized it so now that's like in

2070
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:56,479
more control

2071
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:59,600
a more controlled thing that's happening

2072
01:34:56,479 --> 01:35:01,118
when replacing the apron here you can

2073
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:06,000
see that we want to place

2074
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:08,079
tiles uh that's really easy for us to do

2075
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,158
when we do this add piece this is just a

2076
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:13,198
get tag hash

2077
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:14,638
right um and

2078
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:16,638
i think that's literally all we need to

2079
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:19,279
do to that code um

2080
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:21,118
and then that last bit there where we're

2081
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:24,158
adding a tree

2082
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:27,279
would again just just create the tree

2083
01:35:24,158 --> 01:35:28,559
uh by calling it add tree call and then

2084
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:31,599
a like place

2085
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:33,679
entity on traversible where

2086
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:35,600
it's oh and it's it's actually not it's

2087
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,840
just a place entity

2088
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,760
at p because that that is actually not a

2089
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:43,760
traversable

2090
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:46,000
so uh again pretty simple

2091
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,000
um

2092
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:58,879
much simpler than it was before

2093
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,880
and so that all seems good

2094
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,399
so now we are just left with the problem

2095
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:09,678
did i do something wrong here um

2096
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,520
oh so it doesn't even need the region

2097
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:15,600
right

2098
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:18,320
so i think that's it um

2099
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,679
pretty much everything else is now just

2100
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:22,960
the fact that we don't

2101
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:25,840
know where the things are in

2102
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:27,600
the room because we've gutted that piece

2103
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,119
of the code which was the entire point

2104
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,800
of that whole

2105
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:35,839
epic adventure and what we'd like to do

2106
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:38,960
here is find a way to

2107
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,760
uh you know we'd like to find a way to

2108
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,880
sort of

2109
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:44,560
have some utility code that subsequently

2110
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,480
does the same stuff like the greedy

2111
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,480
search stuff for example

2112
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:50,319
was a crappy version of it we'd like to

2113
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:53,839
find some stuff that we can use to

2114
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:53,840
quickly build

2115
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:58,559
pattern finding like that

2116
01:36:57,359 --> 01:36:59,920
and that's going to be a topic for a

2117
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,480
different day because we don't have time

2118
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:05,118
for that

2119
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:07,039
obviously um but what we can do here

2120
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:09,279
is we could just make a thing that like

2121
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:13,279
searches like spirals outward

2122
01:37:09,279 --> 01:37:16,559
or something from from where we are

2123
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:18,800
try some things um and you know

2124
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:20,159
we just if we can't find a place to put

2125
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:22,560
something we fail

2126
01:37:20,158 --> 01:37:23,519
you know so you could imagine something

2127
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,800
that was like

2128
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:30,320
okay we want to place

2129
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:35,279
entities on traversibles here

2130
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:38,639
um and

2131
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:38,639
you know like

2132
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:47,359
you can imagine the crappy stuff

2133
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:48,880
that just kind of does the same thing it

2134
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:51,519
used to do

2135
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,319
uh but now maybe it places it more

2136
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,840
towards the center of the room or

2137
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:56,000
whatever so we can we can even

2138
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,159
make it a little bit better already but

2139
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:02,238
in general we would just say like

2140
01:37:58,158 --> 01:38:04,799
you know find random

2141
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:06,238
open tile or something like that and we

2142
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:09,520
would just say

2143
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:10,879
here's the construction grid and that

2144
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:14,080
would give us back

2145
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:17,600
you know one of those uh edit tile

2146
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:20,960
placement things or i don't

2147
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:26,960
quite remember exactly but it's like

2148
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:30,960
you know there's like a relative

2149
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:33,198
this this thing you know

2150
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,198
so

2151
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,279
this

2152
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:46,719
is is like what we would do i guess

2153
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:48,079
and we would just say can you please

2154
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:51,760
place that

2155
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:54,960
um place the thing

2156
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:56,159
on there you know and i'm pretty sure we

2157
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:59,679
have an is valid

2158
01:38:56,158 --> 01:39:02,000
on those so we can just do

2159
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:02,000
like

2160
01:39:04,399 --> 01:39:07,039
this kind of thing

2161
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:11,279
so i think that's fine i mean it's it's

2162
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:13,118
not the best thing

2163
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:15,118
but at the moment we'll just try it like

2164
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:16,158
this and then we'll try to just expand

2165
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:17,839
this code

2166
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:20,000
and see what we can do because you know

2167
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,800
i don't know i don't have a strong

2168
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,560
opinion

2169
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:23,920
i don't have an idea right now about how

2170
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,159
we will go about doing this

2171
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,158
but

2172
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:41,840
so we'll do something like this

2173
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:58,880
um yeah

2174
01:39:55,679 --> 01:40:02,399
maybe like that and we'll just do the

2175
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:05,840
head tile where we

2176
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:09,519
start is where we look from

2177
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:13,279
you know something like that

2178
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:16,239
uh and we then

2179
01:40:13,279 --> 01:40:16,238
just do

2180
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:23,840
this each time

2181
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,159
and so that is like the super duper

2182
01:40:27,118 --> 01:40:31,920
crappy

2183
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:34,158
version um and this maybe takes one of

2184
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:37,440
those

2185
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:40,000
like box mass planer things

2186
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:41,919
uh and this maybe takes a like where did

2187
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,719
you want to start from

2188
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:50,880
kind of thing something like that

2189
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:53,600
uh oop no no no

2190
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,600
i meant

2191
01:40:54,639 --> 01:41:01,440
there and like that's

2192
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:01,439
just what happens

2193
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:08,079
you know what i'm saying and uh

2194
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:10,000
and then we'll just go from there and

2195
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:11,679
and we'll see if we can make things that

2196
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,679
allow you to look for little patterns

2197
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:16,960
and you can test like some locations

2198
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:18,000
or something um but we like i said we

2199
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,399
may even have to move

2200
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,920
it out one more level above that into

2201
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:23,679
the room stuff that will like

2202
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:24,960
actually carve up the space in an

2203
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:27,520
intelligent way

2204
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,639
so this is just step one and step two

2205
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:32,480
will probably be

2206
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:33,679
like creating more of a unified thing um

2207
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:34,959
just because i think it's going to have

2208
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:36,639
to be that way i don't know why i didn't

2209
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,920
think of that originally

2210
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:39,920
when i started breaking it up like this

2211
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:42,239
was probably just dumb but

2212
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:44,319
you know you program on a project only

2213
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:45,279
once a week or twice a week or something

2214
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:48,158
your brain is not

2215
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:49,759
like super with it you know it doesn't

2216
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:53,039
doesn't think of all the

2217
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:56,079
um pieces as well as

2218
01:41:53,039 --> 01:42:00,399
you would like you know what i mean

2219
01:41:56,079 --> 01:42:03,519
uh so you know we just go all right

2220
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:05,759
this thing needs to create a

2221
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,760
uh

2222
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,880
this thing needs to create a a place for

2223
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,000
the mpc

2224
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:16,079
to live and you know maybe npcs are kind

2225
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,479
of supposed to be up more towards the

2226
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:19,920
top

2227
01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:20,718
i don't it felt like our it feels like

2228
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,719
our grid is

2229
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:24,239
like backwards or something because i'm

2230
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:26,840
not sure why it was

2231
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:29,678
going the other way oh maybe it goes

2232
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,440
though

2233
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:32,880
you know normally i would say that is

2234
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:34,879
higher like like y

2235
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,159
goes into the screen so i don't know i'm

2236
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,800
going to leave it like that we'll we'll

2237
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:38,158
deal with it

2238
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,360
let's go make sure what we know what the

2239
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:44,158
coordinate system is first but

2240
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:45,839
that'll be a different thing uh anyway i

2241
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:49,439
would then say okay let's

2242
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,440
let's do oh you know um

2243
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,399
yeah i could see this getting cool yeah

2244
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,600
so i i think we're in we're okay

2245
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:58,879
[Music]

2246
01:42:55,600 --> 01:43:02,320
don't worry everything's fine um so

2247
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:07,679
we'll have the the care tile and

2248
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:07,679
we'll have the um the tactile

2249
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:12,239
uh and

2250
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:20,799
this is like south i guess

2251
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:20,800
i guess um

2252
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:26,239
right and assuming they're both valid we

2253
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,560
place the thing down

2254
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:28,559
oops

2255
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,199
and then we just say yeah man

2256
01:43:34,238 --> 01:43:41,839
uh and stuff

2257
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:45,439
bro and we say

2258
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:48,159
keratile and tactile like that

2259
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:49,599
and those both come through here and

2260
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:52,719
everyone loves it

2261
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:55,860
it's freaking great

2262
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:58,079
um and off you go and

2263
01:43:55,859 --> 01:44:02,639
[Music]

2264
01:43:58,079 --> 01:44:06,319
i think that's everything

2265
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:09,600
that we need there

2266
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:13,920
this one is the same as this so

2267
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:21,840
that's just going to go like that

2268
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:21,840
and it will do like

2269
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:26,638
like well actually no i don't know what

2270
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:28,319
this is gonna do yet

2271
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:31,920
because we haven't thought about that so

2272
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:35,599
actually this is just gonna do that

2273
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:38,719
you know like find me a random open tile

2274
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,719
just do it please

2275
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:49,118
uh and then i don't actually know oh

2276
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:53,520
uh and then i can just do this

2277
01:44:49,118 --> 01:44:53,519
um i don't know that

2278
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:03,679
how is this supposed to work like if you

2279
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,800
can't get the tile

2280
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:09,679
from the tile what kind of tile are we

2281
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,679
even talking about

2282
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:15,519
like if you have the concept of an edit

2283
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:17,759
tile

2284
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:20,639
aren't you supposed to be able to use

2285
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,639
that somehow

2286
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:31,840
like that doesn't make a lot of sense

2287
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:31,839
does it folks

2288
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,520
like you can see this was being used as

2289
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,000
a loop but how do you actually get the

2290
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,360
tile

2291
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,238
out of it it's kind of dumb right um

2292
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:44,639
because you're supposed to be able to

2293
01:45:42,238 --> 01:45:47,519
get the tile contents you would think

2294
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:47,520
this is

2295
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:54,159
oh wait no you can oh okay

2296
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:56,079
it's just it takes a pointer

2297
01:45:54,158 --> 01:45:58,638
that's fine i'm not going to complain

2298
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:01,760
about that

2299
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:04,000
that's fine um

2300
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,600
so at that point i don't know what we

2301
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,639
want to do but i'm just going to throw

2302
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:12,000
these in there for now because why not

2303
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:15,039
so if we have both of these and then

2304
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,198
we go take the place entity at

2305
01:46:15,039 --> 01:46:20,560
traversable and on traversable and

2306
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:22,719
and that kind of stuff right um

2307
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,679
then what we can do is just create

2308
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:27,679
facsimiles

2309
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:31,679
of these two things like so

2310
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:34,158
uh and you know i guess we only need on

2311
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:35,359
at the moment uh where what we would do

2312
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:40,399
is we'd say okay

2313
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:43,519
you know this takes the edit grid

2314
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:46,879
uh the entity you're trying to place and

2315
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:50,080
then it takes the uh the tile

2316
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:52,880
you know and then what you would do

2317
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:55,840
is you would call place entity on

2318
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,840
traversible

2319
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:01,760
and you would pass the grid region the

2320
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:03,920
entity

2321
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,880
and then the traversable reference that

2322
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:08,079
actually

2323
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:11,600
goes there right

2324
01:47:08,079 --> 01:47:15,519
um and and that

2325
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:19,119
is the code that we had in room gen

2326
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:23,840
right that is just this code and so

2327
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:23,839
i think we just do this for now

2328
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:40,480
um

2329
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:43,520
right so we say okay

2330
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:46,959
you know we get the tile

2331
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:51,840
uh contents which we get directly from

2332
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:51,840
this instead you know

2333
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:58,399
uh we get the structural reference

2334
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:01,359
garbage

2335
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:02,319
out of that and then we place it using

2336
01:48:01,359 --> 01:48:05,439
the

2337
01:48:02,319 --> 01:48:07,118
the information we extract i think

2338
01:48:05,439 --> 01:48:10,559
that's it

2339
01:48:07,118 --> 01:48:14,000
then these are just functions

2340
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:19,840
that try to pick tiles

2341
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,840
and you know uh

2342
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,760
i mean maybe this is even just like hey

2343
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:31,439
it starts from the center by default

2344
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:32,719
um and

2345
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:35,439
and we're gonna do this in like the

2346
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:40,800
dumbest possible crappiest

2347
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:40,799
work most worthless way uh

2348
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,760
and

2349
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:49,198
and i probably shouldn't have deleted

2350
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:52,639
that code because we probably actually

2351
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:52,638
could have just cut and pasted it

2352
01:48:54,158 --> 01:49:00,559
so that was dumb and i admit that

2353
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:01,919
that was really stupid um

2354
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:04,000
because we actually already had the code

2355
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,719
for this it was just the interior of

2356
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:10,319
those recursive loops that we were doing

2357
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:12,239
so that's pretty stupid uh but you know

2358
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:14,000
what are you gonna do we could go back

2359
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:18,000
to source could we could

2360
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
go back to source code control

2361
01:49:18,079 --> 01:49:21,519
and grab it but i'm not sure that it's

2362
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,719
worth it

2363
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:29,840
especially because we're not logged in

2364
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:29,840
i don't think

2365
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,480
although

2366
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:40,399
actually i guess we are i mean we're not

2367
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:43,279
you know what i mean so

2368
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:44,079
actually we do have it here don't we

2369
01:49:43,279 --> 01:49:46,460
because

2370
01:49:44,079 --> 01:49:48,079
if we look at

2371
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:49,840
[Music]

2372
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:51,760
i don't even know where that code was

2373
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:53,440
but if we look at the get

2374
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:55,440
version since i haven't pushed anything

2375
01:49:53,439 --> 01:49:58,638
to it

2376
01:49:55,439 --> 01:50:00,719
it still has it there now i don't know

2377
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:03,199
where the heck that code was

2378
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:05,039
so i don't actually know where we're

2379
01:50:03,198 --> 01:50:11,839
even looking

2380
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:11,840
but if we look for what was it like um

2381
01:50:12,158 --> 01:50:15,598
i was like find place to put entity or

2382
01:50:14,079 --> 01:50:18,559
whatever well it's not gonna find it in

2383
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:18,560
there obviously um

2384
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:21,679
yeah so i don't know where that code

2385
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:25,198
even was

2386
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:27,520
but uh if we look in there we can pull

2387
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:28,638
it back out so maybe we do that uh i'll

2388
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,000
look for a second

2389
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:32,159
and then if it takes me too long to find

2390
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,639
it i'll just write it again

2391
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:36,399
so yeah uh it was like find place to put

2392
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:53,840
entity or something like that

2393
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:53,839
i don't even know um

2394
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:59,359
so this is all for room placement

2395
01:51:04,238 --> 01:51:12,559
and it doesn't look like it's in there

2396
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:15,359
right so it's not in there

2397
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:16,719
uh it's presumably it could be in the

2398
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:21,118
edit grid i guess

2399
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:24,560
or it could be in the room no oh no

2400
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:27,598
no no no

2401
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:30,719
oh please stop no no no

2402
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:31,279
no no don't do that the worst thing in

2403
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:34,239
the world

2404
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:35,920
is if visual studio opens that's like

2405
01:51:34,238 --> 01:51:36,559
when you know you're having a really bad

2406
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:38,239
day

2407
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:40,320
when visual studio it's like when an

2408
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:40,879
artist accidentally hits the thing that

2409
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:44,158
says

2410
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:45,679
open in bridge and they just scream you

2411
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:48,559
can hear them

2412
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:50,079
it's like adobe bridge opens up and it's

2413
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,119
like the worst thing that happens in

2414
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:53,439
their day

2415
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:55,598
that's like when visual studio opens

2416
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:57,519
right

2417
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:59,119
uh when visual studio opens it's just

2418
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:01,679
the work it's just the worst

2419
01:51:59,118 --> 01:52:03,279
and it's like the same is true of of you

2420
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:05,199
know

2421
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:06,719
of adobe bridge they're like these these

2422
01:52:05,198 --> 01:52:08,319
products that you know

2423
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:10,239
if you accidentally click the thing that

2424
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:13,198
opens them

2425
01:52:10,238 --> 01:52:14,479
you're just really unhappy right because

2426
01:52:13,198 --> 01:52:15,678
it's going to take forever to load and

2427
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:16,718
then you're not going to actually want

2428
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:20,000
it to be there

2429
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:22,319
okay so it's this thing um

2430
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,679
so we can just copy and paste this code

2431
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:26,079
out

2432
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:27,440
because this is actually all we need and

2433
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:29,840
we can just

2434
01:52:27,439 --> 01:52:31,279
use a very simplified version of it

2435
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:36,079
right

2436
01:52:31,279 --> 01:52:39,599
so in here all we're doing is no

2437
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:42,719
copy okay um

2438
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:46,319
so in

2439
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:49,439
in this where we have uh you know find

2440
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:53,519
place to put blah blah or whatever it is

2441
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:53,519
find random open tile you know

2442
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,920
uh what we can do here is just say all

2443
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,279
right do exactly what you were doing

2444
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:02,560
before

2445
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:05,599
um but you know take take a distance

2446
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:08,800
metric uh and and

2447
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:09,760
figure out uh whether or not the thing

2448
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:14,239
that you're looking

2449
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:14,239
at is um

2450
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:21,520
it is closer to the starting area you

2451
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:23,198
were asked to produce

2452
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:25,040
you know what i'm saying just take the

2453
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:28,638
distance

2454
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:31,840
and that's all we really need to do

2455
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:35,679
i think so that's fine

2456
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:41,840
so we'll do that uh and then

2457
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:41,840
for find adjacent tile oops

2458
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:47,839
um we want this code here where we're

2459
01:53:46,079 --> 01:53:50,079
doing like

2460
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:50,079
um

2461
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:56,799
where really it's just this

2462
01:53:59,439 --> 01:54:03,198
right so we're still using more or less

2463
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:06,319
the same

2464
01:54:03,198 --> 01:54:09,279
code to a certain extent

2465
01:54:06,319 --> 01:54:11,118
you know but we're just not calling it

2466
01:54:09,279 --> 01:54:14,319
in the same way

2467
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:16,559
so we loop over all of the tiles in the

2468
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:19,439
region that we're asked to

2469
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:20,719
we would get the tile here and we would

2470
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:25,839
see if it's open

2471
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:25,840
so what we really need is like

2472
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:30,239
we need the thing that says whether this

2473
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:34,239
thing is open or not

2474
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:37,439
is the problem and

2475
01:54:34,238 --> 01:54:42,879
i guess the way we were

2476
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:42,879
doing that is by setting it

2477
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:51,840
is that what we were doing

2478
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:59,440
yeah so in the edit tile contents thing

2479
01:54:56,079 --> 01:55:02,880
we have like a b32 open

2480
01:54:59,439 --> 01:55:04,079
and that probably we just don't want

2481
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:07,359
anymore

2482
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:09,198
so probably what we want to do here

2483
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:11,598
is something more like put the

2484
01:55:09,198 --> 01:55:13,759
traversible reference directly into the

2485
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:18,319
edit tile

2486
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:19,760
you know what i mean um

2487
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:22,238
because we're just going to place these

2488
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:23,679
things in in waves we're not going to

2489
01:55:22,238 --> 01:55:25,279
try to do rip up and replace

2490
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:28,319
because i just don't think it's

2491
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:30,880
plausible right

2492
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:31,759
so for edit tile contents yeah this b32

2493
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:33,760
open thing

2494
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,960
i think we just want to do a like is

2495
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,719
open so

2496
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:40,800
for each one of these we would do

2497
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:40,800
something like if you know is open

2498
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:48,320
uh or or traversible

2499
01:55:45,198 --> 01:55:50,799
is open or whatever and

2500
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:51,759
this tile p thing here where we do the

2501
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:53,679
gen v3

2502
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:55,440
i think what we actually want to do is

2503
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:56,079
just be able to pass an edit tile for

2504
01:55:55,439 --> 01:55:57,678
that

2505
01:55:56,079 --> 01:56:00,079
so there'd basically there'd just be a

2506
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:05,199
thing that's like you know b32

2507
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:05,198
is open and

2508
01:56:07,279 --> 01:56:11,519
and that would take the edit tile

2509
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:15,920
so assuming that we have that this

2510
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:18,079
really just wants to be a thing that

2511
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:22,079
creates the edit tile from that

2512
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:26,079
and uh this is a relative

2513
01:56:22,079 --> 01:56:29,198
it's relative it's it's a relative uh

2514
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:34,158
one right so you can see it here i think

2515
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:34,158
is how it would work and um

2516
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:43,840
the only thing i'm not certain about

2517
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:43,840
it's always relative right

2518
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,360
it looks like it's always relative so

2519
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:56,319
i'm pretty sure all we

2520
01:56:49,359 --> 01:57:00,000
have to do is

2521
01:56:56,319 --> 01:57:04,479
is loop over all of the tiles

2522
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,479
precisely that way

2523
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:10,960
yeah so i'm pretty sure this is

2524
01:57:08,399 --> 01:57:11,269
where's the thing that bundles this up

2525
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,279
uh

2526
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:16,960
[Music]

2527
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:17,599
i guess it's here and i guess this is

2528
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:19,439
you know

2529
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,199
why did i even bother with this that's

2530
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:22,559
kind of dumb so i didn't even need to

2531
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:24,238
cut and paste that out this is just

2532
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,560
iterate as planar tiles

2533
01:57:24,238 --> 01:57:26,559
right

2534
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:35,039
so so actually this

2535
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:38,560
thing here does what we want already

2536
01:57:35,039 --> 01:57:41,679
um this is what we actually want

2537
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:43,920
so we can just do this

2538
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:44,880
right and that's that's actually what we

2539
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:49,118
want

2540
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:52,880
and then we just say if it's open

2541
01:57:49,118 --> 01:57:58,158
um then we do something if it's not

2542
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:58,159
it's not uh and

2543
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:03,519
the result here is like nothing

2544
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:11,520
and what we probably want to do is say

2545
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,520
there's a best distance

2546
01:58:17,198 --> 01:58:21,439
like that and what we'll do is we'll

2547
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:24,238
check the distance here

2548
01:58:21,439 --> 01:58:25,279
like how far is this thing from whatever

2549
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:29,759
the person

2550
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:33,359
uh gave us as a start right

2551
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:34,960
and we know um because we have this tile

2552
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:39,279
count stuff

2553
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:39,279
what we can do is we can say

2554
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:44,480
we don't care about z distance at the

2555
01:58:43,039 --> 01:58:47,679
moment

2556
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:51,198
so we just have grid tile count y

2557
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:51,199
and grid tile count x

2558
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:57,599
yeah which i think is just that

2559
01:58:55,279 --> 01:58:57,599
oops

2560
01:58:59,039 --> 01:59:02,158
and what we should be able to do is if

2561
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:04,719
we take that tile count

2562
01:59:02,158 --> 01:59:06,559
we should be able to produce like a

2563
01:59:04,719 --> 01:59:07,679
center point or an inverse like a

2564
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:10,000
scaling factor

2565
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:12,158
that can produce things in the same

2566
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,560
space as the start from thing

2567
01:59:12,158 --> 01:59:15,198
right barry centric coordinates for the

2568
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,080
room

2569
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:20,000
if you will the room being the room by

2570
01:59:18,079 --> 01:59:23,599
tommy wiseau

2571
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,880
so if we just say what's the inverse of

2572
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:28,319
this thing

2573
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:28,319
right um

2574
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:35,359
like that that's the room scale

2575
01:59:33,279 --> 01:59:37,679
and so from there i should just be able

2576
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:39,198
to say whatever the tile's relative

2577
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:43,599
index is

2578
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:47,839
that x y times the inverse room scale

2579
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:50,000
is the uv and then i can just do

2580
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:50,000
a

2581
01:59:51,760 --> 02:00:00,480
a distance

2582
01:59:58,238 --> 02:00:00,479
so

2583
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:05,439
the vector from the starting the place

2584
02:00:03,118 --> 02:00:08,158
that it told me to start to where

2585
02:00:05,439 --> 02:00:09,919
this particular tile is in barycentric

2586
02:00:08,158 --> 02:00:13,198
coordinates

2587
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:16,639
i can then just take that and

2588
02:00:13,198 --> 02:00:18,960
you know it's

2589
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:20,400
it's hard to say whether you want what

2590
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,679
distance measure you want do you want a

2591
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:24,158
very centric distance

2592
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:25,118
which is what this is or do you want a

2593
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:28,479
distance

2594
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:30,158
that's in the room in in real world

2595
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:32,399
distance

2596
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:34,079
and i just don't know which one you

2597
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:41,839
would want so i'm just going to use this

2598
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:41,840
i'll put it to do

2599
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:53,360
but we could do it the other way around

2600
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,479
if we wanted to

2601
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:58,799
you know um in fact you know what let's

2602
02:00:56,479 --> 02:01:00,000
yeah i'm sorry i'm just i'm fascinating

2603
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:03,119
a little bit

2604
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:06,719
we could just do it the other way around

2605
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:06,719
there um so

2606
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:11,519
the start p is is just the hadamard

2607
02:01:10,479 --> 02:01:14,559
product of the

2608
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,560
you know start uv

2609
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:22,400
um and the and the the tile count right

2610
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:24,399
so that now we've got a physical

2611
02:01:22,399 --> 02:01:26,719
placement that just felt a little bit

2612
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:28,960
better i don't know i don't have

2613
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:31,118
i don't have any reason why i'm picking

2614
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:32,560
this i'm literally just going like hey

2615
02:01:31,118 --> 02:01:34,839
yeah that seems okay right because i

2616
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:38,239
don't i don't have an idea for why

2617
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:40,560
um uh i don't have an idea for why

2618
02:01:38,238 --> 02:01:41,439
why i would want that or not so you know

2619
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:44,880
it is what it is

2620
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:47,359
so i think that gives us a distance

2621
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:48,560
um and then we would just do oops and

2622
02:01:47,359 --> 02:01:51,439
then we would

2623
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:53,760
oh do we not have a xy pick out of these

2624
02:01:51,439 --> 02:01:53,759
things

2625
02:01:56,238 --> 02:02:03,359
what's up with that somebody tell me why

2626
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:08,238
we don't have that

2627
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:08,238
um gen v3 where is that

2628
02:02:08,319 --> 02:02:11,840
oh it's just a v3s

2629
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:21,440
oh my

2630
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,440
really

2631
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:36,959
i see

2632
02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:41,039
anyway uh so yeah there's a v2

2633
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:45,118
s oh well that's why

2634
02:02:41,039 --> 02:02:47,039
never mind because we don't have v2s's

2635
02:02:45,118 --> 02:02:48,719
so we wouldn't be able to slice them out

2636
02:02:47,039 --> 02:02:51,760
that way okay that's fine

2637
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:54,719
i don't have a problem with that so

2638
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:54,719
here we can just do

2639
02:02:55,599 --> 02:03:01,520
this then right convert it to a v3 and

2640
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:05,920
then take the xy out of it

2641
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:09,840
uh that's fine uh same thing here

2642
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:12,719
right uh and and that should be fine

2643
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:14,000
so let's see traversible is open we

2644
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:15,920
don't have yet uh

2645
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,679
no overlord upper tile i agree

2646
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:19,599
wholeheartedly

2647
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:21,440
and then we just need to do like look if

2648
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:23,279
the best distance squared is greater

2649
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:24,238
than this distance squared then this is

2650
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:28,158
the tile for

2651
02:03:24,238 --> 02:03:31,118
us sir um

2652
02:03:28,158 --> 02:03:33,679
and uh and we should capture the the

2653
02:03:31,118 --> 02:03:36,880
particular tile in question

2654
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:40,399
um as the results right

2655
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:42,480
so i think that's all we need um and

2656
02:03:40,399 --> 02:03:44,559
and then the find adjacent part of

2657
02:03:42,479 --> 02:03:45,198
things just needs to be modified a

2658
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:47,440
little bit

2659
02:03:45,198 --> 02:03:48,399
uh i don't know why this is taking an

2660
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:50,719
edit grid

2661
02:03:48,399 --> 02:03:51,598
because it wouldn't do that it would

2662
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:54,639
take the

2663
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:54,639
base tile right

2664
02:03:54,719 --> 02:04:01,840
and then it would say all right uh the

2665
02:03:58,078 --> 02:04:04,639
dur mask comes in here we would do

2666
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:05,440
get direction from that we would then

2667
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:08,560
say

2668
02:04:05,439 --> 02:04:12,479
uh we want to step

2669
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:16,079
that in like one tile in that direction

2670
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:16,078
so this

2671
02:04:16,238 --> 02:04:20,638
is the tile to look for or to look at

2672
02:04:19,198 --> 02:04:23,198
rather

2673
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:24,000
uh and we would see whether we we got it

2674
02:04:23,198 --> 02:04:27,198
or not so we

2675
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,039
would say okay there's no tile that

2676
02:04:27,198 --> 02:04:32,238
starts

2677
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:35,359
we would say that we

2678
02:04:32,238 --> 02:04:38,718
would look to see um if it's open

2679
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:40,460
if it's open then we use it

2680
02:04:38,719 --> 02:04:43,698
right

2681
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:43,698
[Music]

2682
02:04:45,359 --> 02:04:48,399
and and this is probably wants to be

2683
02:04:47,439 --> 02:04:50,399
biased so

2684
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:52,399
we probably want to change that dur mask

2685
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:54,719
at some point to say like look

2686
02:04:52,399 --> 02:04:54,719
you know

2687
02:04:56,479 --> 02:05:03,118
either we do these in a random order

2688
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:05,359
or uh we pass in an array

2689
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:21,839
so that you know it's not always picking

2690
02:05:05,359 --> 02:05:21,839
one preferably so

2691
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:35,920
so that's just a separate thing but

2692
02:05:34,158 --> 02:05:37,118
that's neither here nor there

2693
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:39,118
so then what we would do is say all

2694
02:05:37,118 --> 02:05:42,479
right we're going to go ahead and

2695
02:05:39,118 --> 02:05:43,389
get this tile out

2696
02:05:42,479 --> 02:05:47,519
so

2697
02:05:43,390 --> 02:05:49,760
[Music]

2698
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,719
that would literally just be the base

2699
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:55,280
tile

2700
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:59,679
so edit tile check tile equals base tile

2701
02:05:55,279 --> 02:06:04,078
check tile rail index

2702
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:05,118
is is just going to change like that

2703
02:06:04,078 --> 02:06:09,920
and then it's going to be like

2704
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:09,920
traversible is open this check tile

2705
02:06:11,359 --> 02:06:17,519
or something and then

2706
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:19,279
if that's true the result is the check

2707
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:22,800
tile and you're done

2708
02:06:19,279 --> 02:06:24,559
yep uh this doesn't have a plus equals

2709
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:26,480
operator it looks like so maybe we'll

2710
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:30,400
just do this

2711
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:31,439
um the grid is not something we got

2712
02:06:30,399 --> 02:06:35,198
passed in but it

2713
02:06:31,439 --> 02:06:36,638
is like oh and that has the grid in it

2714
02:06:35,198 --> 02:06:38,399
so we wouldn't need that we would just

2715
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:41,679
say that

2716
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:44,719
um so then

2717
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:48,719
uh the only

2718
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:48,719
thing we're missing is this call

2719
02:06:51,118 --> 02:06:53,679
is that true

2720
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:59,840
not quite um

2721
02:07:01,118 --> 02:07:07,439
i don't really like the fact that this

2722
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:07,440
takes a pointer

2723
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:17,119
um

2724
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:21,360
that doesn't make a whole lot of sense

2725
02:07:17,118 --> 02:07:26,559
uh to me furthermore

2726
02:07:21,359 --> 02:07:29,439
why does it even have to do that

2727
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:30,639
like this is dumb because what you would

2728
02:07:29,439 --> 02:07:33,359
actually do

2729
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:34,000
is in here where you do advance you just

2730
02:07:33,359 --> 02:07:37,359
null

2731
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,479
the thing probably

2732
02:07:37,359 --> 02:07:42,799
so that doesn't feel super good

2733
02:07:40,479 --> 02:07:42,799
um

2734
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:49,119
like i don't i don't like anything about

2735
02:07:45,198 --> 02:07:49,118
this uh at all

2736
02:07:49,359 --> 02:07:55,839
that just seems it just seems bad

2737
02:07:53,118 --> 02:07:55,839
um

2738
02:08:02,238 --> 02:08:06,158
yeah so i don't know i don't know how i

2739
02:08:04,158 --> 02:08:09,439
feel about that but probably not great

2740
02:08:06,158 --> 02:08:10,879
if we're honest about it uh probably

2741
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:15,759
what i would want this to do

2742
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:19,199
is say if tile rail index

2743
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:19,840
z is greater than or equal to grid tile

2744
02:08:19,198 --> 02:08:23,279
count

2745
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:26,719
z then tile

2746
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:30,238
you know grid equals zero

2747
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:33,198
right like it's just null

2748
02:08:30,238 --> 02:08:33,678
at that point and so that way when you

2749
02:08:33,198 --> 02:08:37,279
say

2750
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:40,800
uh is valid you would just

2751
02:08:37,279 --> 02:08:45,118
say that

2752
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:51,840
if it has a grid it's valid

2753
02:08:45,118 --> 02:08:51,839
um right

2754
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:22,000
oops

2755
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:25,520
so i would like that to be

2756
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:28,078
you know zeroable basically and so

2757
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:30,000
i just want to say like if the tile that

2758
02:09:28,078 --> 02:09:33,198
you pass in

2759
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,520
has a grid you know

2760
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:35,519
um

2761
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:40,159
then it's valid

2762
02:09:40,238 --> 02:09:51,678
in fact it's just this

2763
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:51,679
you know what i'm saying um

2764
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:54,800
i feel like that's

2765
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:02,880
like that's what i actually wanted

2766
02:10:00,479 --> 02:10:02,879
and

2767
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:17,840
and then these things here

2768
02:10:14,158 --> 02:10:19,279
that iterate over the tiles

2769
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:21,679
those are all fine what is this

2770
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:25,039
complaining about does not take

2771
02:10:21,679 --> 02:10:26,239
find adjacent open tile that doesn't

2772
02:10:25,039 --> 02:10:29,279
need the grid

2773
02:10:26,238 --> 02:10:35,118
is the difference there

2774
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:36,960
um place unity on traversible

2775
02:10:35,118 --> 02:10:39,439
what's wrong with that oh it takes a

2776
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:42,880
grid not

2777
02:10:39,439 --> 02:10:46,000
that find adjacent tile

2778
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:48,319
that's from the care tile

2779
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,319
um

2780
02:10:53,599 --> 02:11:02,639
so that actually has to happen

2781
02:10:57,439 --> 02:11:02,638
here as well so this

2782
02:11:04,158 --> 02:11:09,439
place entity at traversible

2783
02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:11,840
is just a shim right so it takes the

2784
02:11:09,439 --> 02:11:11,839
grid

2785
02:11:12,078 --> 02:11:15,198
um and the tile

2786
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:21,360
uh this part here

2787
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:22,880
it just calls a different thing right we

2788
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:24,399
really shouldn't have done it this way

2789
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:26,960
this was dumb

2790
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:28,799
so we should fix this because the better

2791
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:31,039
way to do it is to just say whether it

2792
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:34,159
occupies the thing or not

2793
02:11:31,039 --> 02:11:36,880
um so like you know

2794
02:11:34,158 --> 02:11:40,238
that way you don't have two of these

2795
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:42,000
it's like the inverse bob martin

2796
02:11:40,238 --> 02:11:43,359
you know like if you heard advice in a

2797
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,880
talk by bob martin just

2798
02:11:43,359 --> 02:11:46,799
think what is the opposite of that

2799
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:48,560
advice and do that you know he says make

2800
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:50,480
a separate function for everything don't

2801
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:50,960
pass flags the opposite's the true thing

2802
02:11:50,479 --> 02:11:52,718
you

2803
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:54,800
pass flags because that's what collapses

2804
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:56,639
the code down and makes it the most

2805
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:58,719
flexible so you can pass

2806
02:11:56,639 --> 02:12:00,719
information through streams without

2807
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:03,760
having the intermediaries be aware of it

2808
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:03,760
right which is what you want

2809
02:12:05,359 --> 02:12:08,399
so we kind of bob martin that but oh

2810
02:12:07,039 --> 02:12:11,920
well uh

2811
02:12:08,399 --> 02:12:12,399
let's go ahead and and uh finish it this

2812
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:13,920
way and

2813
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:16,638
we should probably just just go clean

2814
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:20,399
that code up so it does it's not garbage

2815
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:21,840
um if we look it is valid here uh i just

2816
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:23,759
want to take a look and see how this is

2817
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:26,400
working and clean it up a little bit

2818
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:27,199
uh but i think it's mostly just handles

2819
02:12:26,399 --> 02:12:31,519
itself

2820
02:12:27,198 --> 02:12:35,839
right and yeah so i think we're good

2821
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:35,840
i think all that's fine and

2822
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:39,359
now i think we're just down to debugging

2823
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:40,960
which i probably don't want to do today

2824
02:12:39,359 --> 02:12:45,039
because we've already gone over

2825
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:46,399
time um so you know

2826
02:12:45,039 --> 02:12:48,319
maybe i'll just step through it and

2827
02:12:46,399 --> 02:12:50,960
clean up any immediate

2828
02:12:48,319 --> 02:12:52,479
crashes and things like clean up any

2829
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:54,319
like kind of garbage

2830
02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:56,718
that i just forgot to wire up or

2831
02:12:54,319 --> 02:13:00,238
whatever let's also close this

2832
02:12:56,719 --> 02:13:04,639
notepad thing out um

2833
02:13:00,238 --> 02:13:07,678
so what we want to do is

2834
02:13:04,639 --> 02:13:12,000
run this and

2835
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:12,000
uh like see where we stop

2836
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:20,400
so

2837
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:21,920
this is trying to get okay so

2838
02:13:20,399 --> 02:13:25,519
that looks like i just messed up that

2839
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:25,520
tile thing there um

2840
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:33,760
what's the tile count

2841
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:33,760
179 z

2842
02:13:39,118 --> 02:13:45,839
and that returns zero wait so hmm

2843
02:13:46,319 --> 02:13:51,279
did i mess up the iteration a little bit

2844
02:13:48,078 --> 02:13:51,279
there looks like i did

2845
02:13:56,840 --> 02:14:02,719
somehow

2846
02:13:59,359 --> 02:14:06,000
oh and also we have to finish this sorry

2847
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:06,000
so this does have to

2848
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:10,880
that has to happen otherwise

2849
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:12,638
everything's going to to fall apart

2850
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:13,760
uh so yeah so what was i saying uh if

2851
02:14:12,639 --> 02:14:15,679
the relative z is greater than the

2852
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,800
tripod z then the grid is done

2853
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:20,000
we're not going to iterate over it

2854
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:20,000
anymore so

2855
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:26,159
but that seems fine like why would that

2856
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:28,800
change that doesn't make a lot of sense

2857
02:14:26,158 --> 02:14:30,078
so i'm not sure why that got messed up

2858
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:30,420
there

2859
02:14:30,078 --> 02:14:33,498
um

2860
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:33,498
[Music]

2861
02:14:37,118 --> 02:14:40,319
this is actually false that should be an

2862
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:42,000
and

2863
02:14:40,319 --> 02:14:43,599
that's a separate issue like it should

2864
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,078
only be you should only be able to

2865
02:14:43,599 --> 02:14:47,360
iterate

2866
02:14:44,078 --> 02:14:52,319
over things that have some volume

2867
02:14:47,359 --> 02:14:55,759
right um which we might even have

2868
02:14:52,319 --> 02:14:58,078
a thing for for already i don't know

2869
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:58,079
um

2870
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:13,679
yeah so like this this is

2871
02:15:10,639 --> 02:15:16,719
is that exact thing we want

2872
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:17,840
right so it'd be like it'd be that uh of

2873
02:15:16,719 --> 02:15:21,198
course we don't

2874
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:24,319
i guess we don't really pass that but

2875
02:15:21,198 --> 02:15:26,799
you could just do get total volume

2876
02:15:24,319 --> 02:15:27,679
right and say you know it's got to be

2877
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:29,760
bigger so you know

2878
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:30,960
we probably should have uh loaded that

2879
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:31,760
in there because that that makes some

2880
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,439
sense but

2881
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:34,880
let's actually go see what's going on

2882
02:15:33,439 --> 02:15:35,598
here because i'm not sure why we're

2883
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:38,800
getting this

2884
02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:41,920
this failure so um

2885
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:43,520
so if we look at this we see we're

2886
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:45,920
trying to get the tile that we're

2887
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:47,280
iterating over and it's not working for

2888
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:50,078
some reason

2889
02:15:47,279 --> 02:15:50,639
so if we look at the tile itself here's

2890
02:15:50,078 --> 02:15:52,158
the grid

2891
02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:53,920
and here's the relative index it's

2892
02:15:52,158 --> 02:15:56,960
looking for tiles 0 9

2893
02:15:53,920 --> 02:16:00,158
0 which doesn't make any sense

2894
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:04,000
because it shouldn't be trying to

2895
02:16:00,158 --> 02:16:06,238
get that tile like that's not a tile so

2896
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:08,319
something about the advance call didn't

2897
02:16:06,238 --> 02:16:09,439
work and i'm not sure why because i

2898
02:16:08,319 --> 02:16:13,840
don't think i broke

2899
02:16:09,439 --> 02:16:16,559
it um but i guess i did you know i mean

2900
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:18,800
you know you may not think you broke it

2901
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:20,639
but you broke it

2902
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:22,400
so it looks like these things reset to

2903
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:24,639
zero

2904
02:16:22,399 --> 02:16:24,638
um

2905
02:16:30,479 --> 02:16:36,478
oh this only does planar right now

2906
02:16:34,079 --> 02:16:36,478
okay

2907
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:43,280
that's actually what we needed sorry

2908
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:45,040
um i was thinking this iterated over all

2909
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:47,519
three dimensions but it doesn't it only

2910
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:50,800
does planar at the moment

2911
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:52,800
um so that makes more sense okay uh

2912
02:16:50,799 --> 02:16:54,159
so let's let's do our traversable as

2913
02:16:52,799 --> 02:16:56,318
open call

2914
02:16:54,159 --> 02:16:58,159
uh and so what this has to do is this

2915
02:16:56,318 --> 02:17:02,318
has to get out that

2916
02:16:58,159 --> 02:17:05,920
structural piece right the thing

2917
02:17:02,318 --> 02:17:07,359
uh so the same code that's that's at

2918
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:09,679
work here

2919
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:09,679
this

2920
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:17,679
this has to get has to access the

2921
02:17:14,959 --> 02:17:17,678
traversible

2922
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:29,840
and see whether or not it's open

2923
02:17:39,679 --> 02:17:43,840
wherever that is

2924
02:17:55,040 --> 02:18:00,000
so what we really want is trans is the

2925
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:03,519
transactional occupy

2926
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,519
you know what i mean um

2927
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:08,398
we're just we're just calling this thing

2928
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:10,399
so

2929
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:12,959
when we have the reference once we have

2930
02:18:10,398 --> 02:18:15,920
the reference i think we're done

2931
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:18,000
you know what i mean so traversable open

2932
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:21,599
is just going to call is occupied

2933
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:26,799
on the traversal reference for the thing

2934
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:26,799
and in a sense it just looks like this

2935
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:32,960
edit tile contents

2936
02:18:36,718 --> 02:18:43,598
when you actually do the get tile

2937
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:43,599
on on that

2938
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:49,120
right what it probably should do there

2939
02:18:48,558 --> 02:18:53,840
is

2940
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:53,840
say this

2941
02:19:00,239 --> 02:19:08,879
like so so we can say get the tile

2942
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:10,960
that will give us back the contents if

2943
02:19:08,879 --> 02:19:14,318
there's anything there

2944
02:19:10,959 --> 02:19:21,839
uh we'll just say if it's not occupied

2945
02:19:14,318 --> 02:19:21,840
it's good

2946
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:32,478
and i think that's all we need because

2947
02:19:30,638 --> 02:19:35,518
we already had the call that asks if the

2948
02:19:32,478 --> 02:19:38,558
thing is occupied so

2949
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:42,398
i guess that's just it um

2950
02:19:38,558 --> 02:19:42,879
okay so it looks like here we're calling

2951
02:19:42,398 --> 02:19:46,840
that

2952
02:19:42,879 --> 02:19:50,639
on an entity

2953
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:53,439
that doesn't actually have

2954
02:19:50,639 --> 02:19:53,439
traversibles

2955
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:59,200
which doesn't really make a lot of sense

2956
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:02,640
because presumably

2957
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:05,040
uh the structural entity always

2958
02:20:02,639 --> 02:20:05,920
does so let's take a look at who's

2959
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:17,840
calling that

2960
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:17,840
and why look at the call stack

2961
02:20:19,439 --> 02:20:22,479
so on here

2962
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:26,079
i guess we would need to see if it had

2963
02:20:24,719 --> 02:20:27,599
one because i guess maybe there are

2964
02:20:26,079 --> 02:20:29,280
structural things that don't have

2965
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:33,359
traversibles

2966
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:38,000
so so maybe like actually we want to say

2967
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:45,840
does it have one at all so is occupied

2968
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:45,840
i mean

2969
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:51,439
i guess here we would want to do like

2970
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:51,439
this

2971
02:20:55,280 --> 02:21:00,960
this is really pretty clumsy but

2972
02:20:58,639 --> 02:21:00,959
you know

2973
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:06,000
like we did today eventually we collapse

2974
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:09,359
code down into things that are good

2975
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:09,359
but not before it's time

2976
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:16,000
unfortunately n

2977
02:21:12,719 --> 02:21:17,679
oh well i don't know

2978
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:19,040
why that's happening that's not a good

2979
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:23,359
sign but

2980
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:24,160
it's fine all right so surprisingly

2981
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:28,960
enough

2982
02:21:24,159 --> 02:21:31,680
we still generated like a lot of actual

2983
02:21:28,959 --> 02:21:34,159
stuff which was i was expecting it to

2984
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:36,960
kind of crash and burn there

2985
02:21:34,159 --> 02:21:39,280
um but actually you know looks like it

2986
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:42,559
still generated the world

2987
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:44,159
after all of that um

2988
02:21:42,559 --> 02:21:45,760
so that looks pretty good our only

2989
02:21:44,159 --> 02:21:47,039
problem is our hero looks like he's got

2990
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:50,318
the wrong tags

2991
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:51,439
uh on at the moment so that we want to

2992
02:21:50,318 --> 02:21:52,879
fix

2993
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:54,720
and also it looks like the thing that

2994
02:21:52,879 --> 02:21:56,799
tries to pick more

2995
02:21:54,719 --> 02:21:58,959
tiles isn't working it looks like it the

2996
02:21:56,799 --> 02:22:02,000
the find adjacent tile isn't working

2997
02:21:58,959 --> 02:22:04,639
so let's try to fix those up real quick

2998
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:06,398
um because that's less good and i that

2999
02:22:04,639 --> 02:22:08,159
shouldn't take very long

3000
02:22:06,398 --> 02:22:09,519
i can maybe fix the tags thing too so it

3001
02:22:08,159 --> 02:22:12,239
looks like we mostly

3002
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:13,520
mostly everything just worked um so

3003
02:22:12,239 --> 02:22:16,719
that's good

3004
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:18,319
so in here this is the part that doesn't

3005
02:22:16,719 --> 02:22:19,760
look like it's working so find adjacent

3006
02:22:18,318 --> 02:22:21,840
open tile starts out with an

3007
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:23,600
invalid tile it loops over all of the

3008
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:25,840
directions you could go from a from a

3009
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:27,840
base tile that you pass it

3010
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:29,120
it tries to figure out what direction

3011
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:32,880
that thing would go

3012
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:34,399
in for for a mask you pass in

3013
02:22:32,879 --> 02:22:36,318
and then it says all right i'm going to

3014
02:22:34,398 --> 02:22:40,000
take wherever i was

3015
02:22:36,318 --> 02:22:42,398
at i'm going to move

3016
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,920
the relative index by whatever the delta

3017
02:22:42,398 --> 02:22:45,920
is i'm going to look to see

3018
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:47,680
if that place is open and if it is i'm

3019
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:51,680
going to return the tile

3020
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:53,760
right it looks like that's never working

3021
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:54,880
i mean i could be wrong about that and

3022
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:57,120
it was just not

3023
02:22:54,879 --> 02:22:58,639
working most of the time but since it

3024
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:00,640
looks like it's never working

3025
02:22:58,639 --> 02:23:02,239
i'm guessing i should be able to just

3026
02:23:00,639 --> 02:23:05,279
kind of step in here

3027
02:23:02,239 --> 02:23:08,959
and watch it not work

3028
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:08,960
rather than have to guess right

3029
02:23:12,799 --> 02:23:17,039
that's my assumption so let's take a

3030
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:18,079
look here so this is trying to make the

3031
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:19,840
snake

3032
02:23:18,079 --> 02:23:21,760
uh if we look at what the directional

3033
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:24,639
mask says

3034
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:25,680
uh it's 15 which probably is all four

3035
02:23:24,639 --> 02:23:28,959
planar directions

3036
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:31,359
right so here we go

3037
02:23:28,959 --> 02:23:32,318
uh and hey it looks like we're going to

3038
02:23:31,359 --> 02:23:34,239
try one

3039
02:23:32,318 --> 02:23:36,478
let's see where it thinks we're going to

3040
02:23:34,239 --> 02:23:38,879
go and let's also look at the base tile

3041
02:23:36,478 --> 02:23:39,760
um so we have some idea of where we're

3042
02:23:38,879 --> 02:23:43,438
going so

3043
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:46,800
it's 8 4 0 we

3044
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:49,280
are going negative 1 in x so that should

3045
02:23:46,799 --> 02:23:52,719
produce a check tile that's like one off

3046
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:56,640
yes seven four zero right um

3047
02:23:52,719 --> 02:24:00,000
and then we say okay we've got one

3048
02:23:56,639 --> 02:24:03,840
we we and then have have a valid

3049
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:05,760
check tile so that worked um

3050
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:07,680
so this looks like it is actually just

3051
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:11,680
placing the thing

3052
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:11,680
on it right um

3053
02:24:12,959 --> 02:24:15,839
hmm

3054
02:24:16,318 --> 02:24:23,920
so i guess i don't

3055
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:28,719
know why that's failing

3056
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:31,120
it looked like it was failing before

3057
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:31,119
um

3058
02:24:34,879 --> 02:24:43,438
hmm so that's not what i expected to see

3059
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:46,960
uh i'm not sure

3060
02:24:43,439 --> 02:24:46,960
what's happening

3061
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:55,040
because clearly like

3062
02:24:52,639 --> 02:24:56,318
at least for here there's only one of

3063
02:24:55,040 --> 02:25:01,120
those things

3064
02:24:56,318 --> 02:25:01,119
um only one of those like switches

3065
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:05,680
uh and

3066
02:25:06,959 --> 02:25:13,039
so at least the switch code is bad

3067
02:25:10,799 --> 02:25:16,079
maybe the switch code is just maybe just

3068
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:16,080
the switch code is broken

3069
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:24,880
it could be maybe we forgot to set the

3070
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:28,000
pre-tile

3071
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:30,398
or something um

3072
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:33,280
oh that's just constantly asking find

3073
02:25:30,398 --> 02:25:35,599
random open tile

3074
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:35,600
oh

3075
02:25:36,879 --> 02:25:42,000
right that doesn't that makes sense

3076
02:25:40,559 --> 02:25:44,478
it's always gonna find that because it's

3077
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:53,840
always open

3078
02:25:44,478 --> 02:25:53,840
so yeah um

3079
02:25:56,879 --> 02:26:00,478
so i guess really what we want there is

3080
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:04,840
just find

3081
02:26:00,478 --> 02:26:08,159
random tile with

3082
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:11,680
traversable and then we

3083
02:26:08,159 --> 02:26:15,200
just want to put the pattern

3084
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:17,760
in so okay so that's

3085
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:18,319
fine that's yeah all right so that code

3086
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:20,559
is fine

3087
02:26:18,318 --> 02:26:21,760
so it looks like the only actual problem

3088
02:26:20,559 --> 02:26:24,879
we're having

3089
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:28,559
is when we add the player um

3090
02:26:24,879 --> 02:26:29,920
we we aren't properly setting up the tag

3091
02:26:28,559 --> 02:26:31,680
hashes for the player

3092
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:33,600
and that makes perfect sense because we

3093
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:35,840
got rid of this orphan tag

3094
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:38,159
right so i'm pretty sure it's just tag

3095
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:40,719
hero now

3096
02:26:38,159 --> 02:26:41,840
so wow we we really didn't screw up very

3097
02:26:40,719 --> 02:26:45,519
much did we

3098
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:48,960
um that's that's pretty wild

3099
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:51,520
all right well whatever um

3100
02:26:48,959 --> 02:26:53,279
let's go ahead and just just check uh so

3101
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:54,079
our other orphans are all gonna be

3102
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:56,960
borked

3103
02:26:54,079 --> 02:26:58,799
right uh it looks like that stone wall

3104
02:26:56,959 --> 02:27:00,719
we try to put in place is invisible like

3105
02:26:58,799 --> 02:27:01,679
i couldn't walk through it but it wasn't

3106
02:27:00,719 --> 02:27:05,119
there

3107
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:07,760
so that's a little bit broken as well um

3108
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:08,560
and i'd like to figure out why that's

3109
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:12,478
the case

3110
02:27:08,559 --> 02:27:13,039
uh unfortunately these snakes are so

3111
02:27:12,478 --> 02:27:15,279
good at

3112
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:16,319
they hop all over the there's never

3113
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:17,760
going to be a switch that

3114
02:27:16,318 --> 02:27:19,680
isn't pressed because of these stupid

3115
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:22,960
snakes um

3116
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:24,960
so anyway uh that's all good let's start

3117
02:27:22,959 --> 02:27:28,079
at the orphanage real quick

3118
02:27:24,959 --> 02:27:29,839
and just take a look at uh the orphans

3119
02:27:28,079 --> 02:27:32,239
because they're gonna have to have

3120
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:35,040
different tag settings as well

3121
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:36,079
uh so let's just make sure that we get

3122
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:37,920
those right

3123
02:27:36,079 --> 02:27:39,359
uh and so that we're not sitting around

3124
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:42,159
going like what happened

3125
02:27:39,359 --> 02:27:42,159
to the thing

3126
02:27:42,639 --> 02:27:46,318
this code can just go away so this is

3127
02:27:44,959 --> 02:27:49,919
now just a trivial loop

3128
02:27:46,318 --> 02:27:52,478
which is great uh room connections blah

3129
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:53,200
blah blah blah so all yeah all this is

3130
02:27:52,478 --> 02:27:56,840
good

3131
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:59,840
and this just

3132
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:59,840
needs

3133
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:13,840
wherever that is that thing this just

3134
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:13,840
needs to be um

3135
02:28:16,159 --> 02:28:22,799
all right i don't know why i did that

3136
02:28:20,159 --> 02:28:24,799
why not just use the comment out i don't

3137
02:28:22,799 --> 02:28:28,639
know

3138
02:28:24,799 --> 02:28:28,639
i just didn't so there we go

3139
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:33,039
and now we can go see if any of the

3140
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:35,280
orphans work or

3141
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:36,640
change their tags because we might need

3142
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:40,720
to

3143
02:28:36,639 --> 02:28:44,159
um okay there they are

3144
02:28:40,719 --> 02:28:47,679
and oh so it looks like the that

3145
02:28:44,159 --> 02:28:52,840
thing is still blocking so so right

3146
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:58,000
uh place entity on traversible

3147
02:28:52,840 --> 02:29:01,200
um this is supposed to be place entity

3148
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:08,959
at traversable and i

3149
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:12,960
think we're good now

3150
02:29:08,959 --> 02:29:16,239
it's like bob barker and

3151
02:29:12,959 --> 02:29:19,599
there we go uh that's fine

3152
02:29:16,239 --> 02:29:23,600
and the baby is here hello baby

3153
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:26,880
um handmade baby that doesn't sound good

3154
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:30,800
uh all right there's the orphans

3155
02:29:26,879 --> 02:29:32,478
there's oh there's a puss even

3156
02:29:30,799 --> 02:29:34,879
oh dear the puss doesn't have no head

3157
02:29:32,478 --> 02:29:36,478
though um

3158
02:29:34,879 --> 02:29:38,398
i don't know if we ever set up the puss

3159
02:29:36,478 --> 02:29:42,000
heads

3160
02:29:38,398 --> 02:29:44,398
so uh it

3161
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:45,200
could it could be i don't remember how

3162
02:29:44,398 --> 02:29:49,680
we did this

3163
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:54,079
exactly but uh it could actually just be

3164
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:55,600
that like it could be that we just never

3165
02:29:54,079 --> 02:29:59,680
set those

3166
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:59,680
right um

3167
02:30:02,639 --> 02:30:07,279
yeah it looks like we just never set

3168
02:30:04,159 --> 02:30:07,280
those actually

3169
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:10,239
so like

3170
02:30:16,719 --> 02:30:19,840
i don't know

3171
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:23,520
um

3172
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:32,560
i guess that goes like something like

3173
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:35,920
there

3174
02:30:32,559 --> 02:30:35,920
uh and then the

3175
02:30:36,079 --> 02:30:41,920
the weird head thing that

3176
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:41,920
goes

3177
02:30:43,439 --> 02:30:47,840
like that probably

3178
02:30:48,079 --> 02:30:50,398
um

3179
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:57,040
i don't know if these should have scale

3180
02:30:54,799 --> 02:30:58,478
on them or not

3181
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,479
and i don't know which one would have

3182
02:30:58,478 --> 02:31:03,369
scale on it either

3183
02:31:00,478 --> 02:31:04,959
um so

3184
02:31:03,370 --> 02:31:08,399
[Music]

3185
02:31:04,959 --> 02:31:10,478
i don't i don't know like

3186
02:31:08,398 --> 02:31:12,799
i don't know there's a cat it's not my

3187
02:31:10,478 --> 02:31:12,799
problem

3188
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:19,760
so

3189
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:22,079
so there's a cat and um

3190
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:24,398
and everyone loves cats or they're not

3191
02:31:22,079 --> 02:31:27,280
allowed on the stream

3192
02:31:24,398 --> 02:31:28,000
we have another cat here so we should

3193
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:32,239
probably set

3194
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,239
it it is

3195
02:31:32,799 --> 02:31:43,840
oops it is fred

3196
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,920
and

3197
02:31:52,879 --> 02:31:58,079
looks like that bitmap is actually out

3198
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:00,318
of alignment to be completely honest

3199
02:31:58,079 --> 02:32:00,318
uh

3200
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:13,359
isn't there how do you set like the

3201
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:13,359
default alignment position or you can't

3202
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:21,920
yeah you can so i think we actually want

3203
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:22,800
this one to be set to there because it

3204
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:24,318
was kind of like

3205
02:32:22,799 --> 02:32:26,478
off off-center so i feel like that

3206
02:32:24,318 --> 02:32:27,439
bitmap just wanted to be re-centered

3207
02:32:26,478 --> 02:32:30,000
first

3208
02:32:27,439 --> 02:32:31,439
and then we can place the head on it and

3209
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:34,559
then we can edit the head

3210
02:32:31,439 --> 02:32:39,840
and where that goes uh

3211
02:32:34,559 --> 02:32:39,840
as a separate situation and

3212
02:32:41,439 --> 02:32:44,559
you know i don't know i don't know

3213
02:32:46,719 --> 02:32:51,519
fred's kind of kind of overweight the

3214
02:32:48,959 --> 02:32:54,799
cat was

3215
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:58,159
um his owner

3216
02:32:54,799 --> 02:33:00,000
you know let him let him eat a lot more

3217
02:32:58,159 --> 02:33:01,200
than probably he should have so he's

3218
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,879
he's a bit overweight

3219
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:04,880
he's he's still alive that's a that's a

3220
02:33:02,879 --> 02:33:07,199
real cat fred and he's a little bit

3221
02:33:04,879 --> 02:33:09,438
he's a little bit heavy so that's that's

3222
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:11,120
why he looks bigger than the other cat

3223
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:12,639
which was molly who you've seen on

3224
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:16,319
stream

3225
02:33:12,639 --> 02:33:21,840
um so yeah like everything is

3226
02:33:16,318 --> 02:33:21,840
looking pretty good um

3227
02:33:25,439 --> 02:33:29,760
i feel like

3228
02:33:30,719 --> 02:33:35,840
i don't have a lot of complaints here

3229
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:49,840
let's take a quick second and fix molly

3230
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:49,840
i mean hannah

3231
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:57,760
cause hannah looks like she's in the

3232
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:02,478
wrong place as well

3233
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:06,318
so let's go ahead and add

3234
02:34:02,478 --> 02:34:09,760
some tag giving some alignment points

3235
02:34:06,318 --> 02:34:12,239
in here like so hannah was a very small

3236
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:16,079
cat she was she was really tiny

3237
02:34:12,239 --> 02:34:19,280
um never ate much

3238
02:34:16,079 --> 02:34:21,439
you know um

3239
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:22,399
she was a good puss she's a ghost now

3240
02:34:21,439 --> 02:34:25,120
that's why she looks

3241
02:34:22,398 --> 02:34:28,079
ghostly because she was a she was she

3242
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:28,079
died a few years ago

3243
02:34:28,478 --> 02:34:33,599
all right so i think all that's good

3244
02:34:33,760 --> 02:34:39,680
and uh

3245
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:41,120
you know who knows we can set those

3246
02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:42,239
differently later but at least now all

3247
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:44,240
of our

3248
02:34:42,239 --> 02:34:46,799
sprites have some have some basic

3249
02:34:44,239 --> 02:34:49,199
settings um

3250
02:34:46,799 --> 02:34:51,599
and that seems good uh so so i'm happy

3251
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:54,880
with that and the only thing i might say

3252
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:57,120
is like the lamp stuff

3253
02:34:54,879 --> 02:34:58,318
just for now i don't really want to put

3254
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:01,439
lamps

3255
02:34:58,318 --> 02:35:03,760
in there quite so much potentially

3256
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:03,760
um

3257
02:35:04,639 --> 02:35:13,840
so i was kind of thinking of of maybe

3258
02:35:08,398 --> 02:35:13,840
just changing this a little bit uh

3259
02:35:14,799 --> 02:35:21,199
and going like all right like let's add

3260
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:25,120
a uh a light uh

3261
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:28,560
that's an inanimate object and has no

3262
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:28,560
tags it's invisible

3263
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:34,478
um in fact i think actually not even

3264
02:35:32,879 --> 02:35:37,039
that i think it's just add entity

3265
02:35:34,478 --> 02:35:38,398
right we just want an entity we're going

3266
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:42,960
to place it

3267
02:35:38,398 --> 02:35:45,519
at a location um

3268
02:35:42,959 --> 02:35:45,519
and

3269
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:50,240
and we'll add a light and the light will

3270
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:54,000
be

3271
02:35:50,239 --> 02:35:56,239
fairly large i don't i don't know what

3272
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:58,398
these parameters are because i haven't

3273
02:35:56,239 --> 02:36:01,600
called this function in forever

3274
02:35:58,398 --> 02:36:02,799
it's radius so maybe it's like a large

3275
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:06,159
radius

3276
02:36:02,799 --> 02:36:07,920
light um that's like kind of floating

3277
02:36:06,159 --> 02:36:09,280
up above the ground which it looks like

3278
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:11,520
that would be

3279
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:12,960
with a lamp light and it has like some

3280
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:16,159
fairly high emission

3281
02:36:12,959 --> 02:36:20,559
right and maybe what we do here is

3282
02:36:16,159 --> 02:36:23,439
is we get rid of this on lamp garbage

3283
02:36:20,559 --> 02:36:24,318
um and we just have a lighting pattern

3284
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:26,639
generator

3285
02:36:24,318 --> 02:36:27,600
i'm sorry like this is going wicked long

3286
02:36:26,639 --> 02:36:29,039
um

3287
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:30,880
i'm not even paying attention thing it's

3288
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:35,120
just like this stuff is so easy

3289
02:36:30,879 --> 02:36:37,759
like we might as well do it um

3290
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:39,040
you know there's no reason not to so uh

3291
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:40,079
and it's kind of fun to place things in

3292
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:43,920
the world right it's

3293
02:36:40,079 --> 02:36:47,280
it's you know it feels creative

3294
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:49,040
even though it's not um so

3295
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:50,720
what we might do is is get rid of this

3296
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:53,200
stuff get rid of the on

3297
02:36:50,719 --> 02:36:54,318
lamp nonsense and and just have like a

3298
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:57,840
lighting pattern

3299
02:36:54,318 --> 02:37:01,039
right um or like standard lighting

3300
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:02,079
pattern or something i don't know uh

3301
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:03,439
but we'll have like a standard lighting

3302
02:37:02,079 --> 02:37:04,879
pattern we'll get rid of this stuff the

3303
02:37:03,439 --> 02:37:07,840
on lamp stuff is gone

3304
02:37:04,879 --> 02:37:09,279
you know forget that um you know that's

3305
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:12,159
out of here

3306
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:13,920
uh and then you know when we add rooms

3307
02:37:12,159 --> 02:37:16,719
we'll just add lighting or we won't

3308
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:18,478
right and so when we come through one of

3309
02:37:16,719 --> 02:37:21,760
these things we'll just say add ran

3310
02:37:18,478 --> 02:37:24,079
you know find random open tile and

3311
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:25,760
the only thing about this is like uh

3312
02:37:24,079 --> 02:37:28,398
maybe we just want to say like find

3313
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:29,760
random tile right and not have random

3314
02:37:28,398 --> 02:37:31,119
open tile

3315
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:34,559
because we don't actually care if it's

3316
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:34,560
open um

3317
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:41,600
but uh you know

3318
02:37:38,799 --> 02:37:42,159
we'll just have that for now with a

3319
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:45,359
to-do

3320
02:37:42,159 --> 02:37:48,398
for next time this shouldn't actually

3321
02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:52,800
look for

3322
02:37:48,398 --> 02:37:57,119
open tiles uh

3323
02:37:52,799 --> 02:37:57,119
so we'll get one and if it's valid

3324
02:37:58,318 --> 02:38:02,398
i will just would place one of those on

3325
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:03,920
there like i said i don't

3326
02:38:02,398 --> 02:38:06,079
i don't care about the lamp at the

3327
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:07,520
moment um i don't think i want that so

3328
02:38:06,079 --> 02:38:08,959
we're just going to place a regular old

3329
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:11,359
light

3330
02:38:08,959 --> 02:38:12,000
and we're going to place it at wherever

3331
02:38:11,359 --> 02:38:16,239
the

3332
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:16,239
the tile is that we got back

3333
02:38:18,159 --> 02:38:26,079
and we we've

3334
02:38:22,719 --> 02:38:29,679
we've have it all

3335
02:38:26,079 --> 02:38:32,079
and you know

3336
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:34,000
we get we get back our our lamp and

3337
02:38:32,079 --> 02:38:35,680
everyone and everyone loves it

3338
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:37,040
uh and this is just a way of placing

3339
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:40,239
lights around for

3340
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:44,560
for mood right uh it's

3341
02:38:40,239 --> 02:38:44,559
it's not um

3342
02:38:48,559 --> 02:38:57,840
let me go ahead and just get the

3343
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:57,840
entropy out of this

3344
02:39:04,398 --> 02:39:09,119
right and so now if we ran this like the

3345
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:10,079
world would have no lighting in it

3346
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:12,000
whatsoever because

3347
02:39:10,079 --> 02:39:13,600
nobody adds the standard lighting

3348
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:16,719
pattern to their rooms

3349
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:18,800
right so it'd just be the hero walking

3350
02:39:16,719 --> 02:39:22,079
around with like a little tiny light

3351
02:39:18,799 --> 02:39:25,519
you know like so

3352
02:39:22,079 --> 02:39:27,439
and so then if we wanted to uh

3353
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:29,680
we could then start saying look let's

3354
02:39:27,439 --> 02:39:33,520
add lights to rooms

3355
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:34,800
and to do that we would just say when we

3356
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:38,560
create these rooms

3357
02:39:34,799 --> 02:39:41,438
so like create dungeon um

3358
02:39:38,559 --> 02:39:43,119
and create orphanage or whatever we

3359
02:39:41,439 --> 02:39:47,520
would just add

3360
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:53,840
uh lighting to these rooms

3361
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:53,840
right and

3362
02:40:06,959 --> 02:40:13,438
so like in here for example

3363
02:40:10,239 --> 02:40:14,959
every time we made a room uh

3364
02:40:13,439 --> 02:40:17,359
we would create the standard lighting

3365
02:40:14,959 --> 02:40:21,199
for that room so like here

3366
02:40:17,359 --> 02:40:25,279
we would say you know ad pattern

3367
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:28,479
gen room standard lighting pattern

3368
02:40:25,279 --> 02:40:29,200
you know what i mean uh and i think that

3369
02:40:28,478 --> 02:40:30,799
would add

3370
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:33,200
like lighting to a bunch of the dungeon

3371
02:40:30,799 --> 02:40:36,959
rooms using that lighting pattern

3372
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:39,120
um and then for the orphanage we would

3373
02:40:36,959 --> 02:40:42,398
probably need to like be more specific

3374
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:45,920
because we probably want to like

3375
02:40:42,398 --> 02:40:45,920
talk about the lighting more

3376
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:50,239
and like what kind of lighting should be

3377
02:40:48,879 --> 02:40:52,000
in each room i mean we want to do that

3378
02:40:50,239 --> 02:40:55,760
with the dungeon too but like

3379
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:58,319
i think that adds

3380
02:40:55,760 --> 02:41:00,159
uh lighting to the dungeon right uh

3381
02:40:58,319 --> 02:41:03,840
[Music]

3382
02:41:00,159 --> 02:41:05,920
so you can kind of see there's light in

3383
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:08,318
the room now

3384
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:09,920
um of course the the little hoppy snake

3385
02:41:08,318 --> 02:41:17,840
person

3386
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:17,840
also has lights attached um

3387
02:41:18,318 --> 02:41:22,879
but i'll be honest it looks like the

3388
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:26,000
light is weirdly skewed towards the top

3389
02:41:22,879 --> 02:41:26,959
like i wonder if that's because it had

3390
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:30,879
to find an open

3391
02:41:26,959 --> 02:41:33,278
tile so it had to avoid the snake

3392
02:41:30,879 --> 02:41:34,879
that might have been there i think

3393
02:41:33,279 --> 02:41:36,640
that's probably what happened

3394
02:41:34,879 --> 02:41:38,079
so you know it needs to not do that

3395
02:41:36,639 --> 02:41:45,840
obviously but

3396
02:41:38,079 --> 02:41:45,840
so that's fine um

3397
02:41:46,719 --> 02:41:50,959
so that's all fine um so i think we're

3398
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:54,719
good

3399
02:41:50,959 --> 02:41:58,079
uh and and then if i do the orphanage

3400
02:41:54,719 --> 02:42:02,318
one you know i don't really know

3401
02:41:58,079 --> 02:42:03,680
um i guess we'll just add the standard

3402
02:42:02,318 --> 02:42:05,359
lighting pattern to all these rooms

3403
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:06,960
right now although it would it'll be it

3404
02:42:05,359 --> 02:42:09,200
would be cooler if we actually did

3405
02:42:06,959 --> 02:42:10,879
something real here and had different

3406
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:13,439
rooms have different lightings so you

3407
02:42:10,879 --> 02:42:13,759
know that's the idea is that we would

3408
02:42:13,439 --> 02:42:16,079
not

3409
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:18,559
do this you know the entire time or

3410
02:42:16,079 --> 02:42:22,239
whatever but

3411
02:42:18,559 --> 02:42:22,239
uh so for lights

3412
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:29,359
um here you know i guess what i'm saying

3413
02:42:26,559 --> 02:42:32,478
is i would like to have

3414
02:42:29,359 --> 02:42:32,479
a uh

3415
02:42:34,879 --> 02:42:40,000
i would like to have a way where we

3416
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:41,760
customize the lighting for these rooms

3417
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,200
or something

3418
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:44,800
and we'll have to look maybe it goes in

3419
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:46,640
the room spec

3420
02:42:44,799 --> 02:42:48,559
uh and and then the room spec when you

3421
02:42:46,639 --> 02:42:48,959
gen the room automatically adds one of

3422
02:42:48,559 --> 02:42:52,318
these

3423
02:42:48,959 --> 02:42:56,079
i don't know um but

3424
02:42:52,318 --> 02:42:57,278
i i feel like that's just something we

3425
02:42:56,079 --> 02:43:00,079
can deal with later

3426
02:42:57,279 --> 02:43:02,560
i don't know there's a lot of text

3427
02:43:00,079 --> 02:43:05,279
messages i normally turn my phone off

3428
02:43:02,559 --> 02:43:06,719
and i guess i forgot to turn it off and

3429
02:43:05,279 --> 02:43:07,680
i don't normally get a lot of text

3430
02:43:06,719 --> 02:43:09,760
messages

3431
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:11,200
because i don't really use messaging

3432
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:14,239
much

3433
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:14,240
but apparently

3434
02:43:14,318 --> 02:43:18,559
i'm getting a lot of messages now and i

3435
02:43:16,719 --> 02:43:21,760
don't know what those messages say

3436
02:43:18,559 --> 02:43:22,639
but they probably say something that

3437
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:24,559
doesn't need

3438
02:43:22,639 --> 02:43:27,760
for me to look at it at this immediate

3439
02:43:24,559 --> 02:43:33,039
moment so i'm not going to

3440
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:33,040
and that's all i have to say um

3441
02:43:35,439 --> 02:43:39,439
so that just adds lights and in a really

3442
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:42,159
uninteresting way

3443
02:43:39,439 --> 02:43:44,079
right it just adds lights to rooms and

3444
02:43:42,159 --> 02:43:47,200
so they have lights now

3445
02:43:44,079 --> 02:43:47,200
right um

3446
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:52,159
and no one cares but you know there you

3447
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:55,520
go

3448
02:43:52,159 --> 02:43:56,398
and as we make the lighting system

3449
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:59,279
better

3450
02:43:56,398 --> 02:43:59,278
uh presumably

3451
02:44:00,398 --> 02:44:04,079
uh yeah presumably it will be better um

3452
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:06,239
so i guess

3453
02:44:04,079 --> 02:44:07,680
the other thing i would point out here

3454
02:44:06,239 --> 02:44:11,520
is that you know

3455
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:13,200
so we could when we talk about the

3456
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:18,000
standard lighting pattern thing

3457
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:20,640
um we probably want that to be smart

3458
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,279
or so if you think about what's going to

3459
02:44:20,639 --> 02:44:23,519
happen

3460
02:44:21,279 --> 02:44:25,040
you want to place lights you know more

3461
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:27,040
lights in larger rooms

3462
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:28,399
and less lights and smaller rooms and

3463
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:31,439
crap like that

3464
02:44:28,398 --> 02:44:32,079
you know so what you're probably gonna

3465
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:35,120
do is

3466
02:44:32,079 --> 02:44:40,959
have something that's like a gen

3467
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:40,960
v3 uh that's like your light spacing

3468
02:44:41,279 --> 02:44:46,800
you know and you're gonna say like okay

3469
02:44:44,719 --> 02:44:48,159
you know we we roughly want to place a

3470
02:44:46,799 --> 02:44:51,840
light every

3471
02:44:48,159 --> 02:44:54,478
you know five steps or something

3472
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:56,398
you know i don't know but you're gonna

3473
02:44:54,478 --> 02:44:58,079
have some kind of rule where you're like

3474
02:44:56,398 --> 02:45:01,358
you know this is this is what the

3475
02:44:58,079 --> 02:45:05,039
spacing is that we expect for lights

3476
02:45:01,359 --> 02:45:08,159
uh in 2d or whatever you know who cares

3477
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:09,279
and then you could do a thing where you

3478
02:45:08,159 --> 02:45:15,840
were like

3479
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:15,840
okay i want to loop over

3480
02:45:16,159 --> 02:45:21,359
it take the room figure out how many of

3481
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:25,439
these are going to be

3482
02:45:21,359 --> 02:45:28,800
and space them correctly so i can step

3483
02:45:25,439 --> 02:45:30,479
over them that way right so

3484
02:45:28,799 --> 02:45:32,000
in other words you would get a thing

3485
02:45:30,478 --> 02:45:34,639
where you're like uh

3486
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,680
iterate as planar tiles you can do like

3487
02:45:34,639 --> 02:45:39,199
an iterate

3488
02:45:35,680 --> 02:45:42,398
equally spaced

3489
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:56,800
you know

3490
02:45:42,398 --> 02:46:01,039
so you'd be something like this

3491
02:45:56,799 --> 02:46:05,759
you know what i'm saying so

3492
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:10,240
if you uh if you pass in like a spacing

3493
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:12,639
you get like you get like steppings uh

3494
02:46:10,239 --> 02:46:14,639
that that are like aligned properly for

3495
02:46:12,639 --> 02:46:16,799
that thing

3496
02:46:14,639 --> 02:46:18,478
and i don't know exactly how i would

3497
02:46:16,799 --> 02:46:20,799
want to do that

3498
02:46:18,478 --> 02:46:22,639
per se but it would it would really just

3499
02:46:20,799 --> 02:46:24,398
it would be more like this

3500
02:46:22,639 --> 02:46:26,159
because we're not trying to look for

3501
02:46:24,398 --> 02:46:28,639
tiles we're trying to like strewn

3502
02:46:26,159 --> 02:46:29,359
we're trying to like place lights in the

3503
02:46:28,639 --> 02:46:33,199
world

3504
02:46:29,359 --> 02:46:35,359
you know um and so you know i wouldn't

3505
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:38,560
actually want

3506
02:46:35,359 --> 02:46:40,960
it to look like that it would be this

3507
02:46:38,559 --> 02:46:44,159
sort of thing

3508
02:46:40,959 --> 02:46:47,119
and the light would be placed

3509
02:46:44,159 --> 02:46:48,000
on the tiles that we iterate so if you

3510
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:49,840
imagine

3511
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:51,120
what the planar tile iterator looks like

3512
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:53,520
it's already set up to do

3513
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:55,200
what we want and we can already do this

3514
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:58,479
striation really easily

3515
02:46:55,200 --> 02:47:03,200
actually if we want to by saying

3516
02:46:58,478 --> 02:47:03,199
okay if we do iterate as planar tiles

3517
02:47:04,799 --> 02:47:08,879
we there's no reason why the edit tile

3518
02:47:08,239 --> 02:47:12,000
thing

3519
02:47:08,879 --> 02:47:15,358
can't have a step

3520
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:16,000
associated with it right so we could do

3521
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:18,800
something

3522
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,799
like this

3523
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:23,279
you know what i'm saying where you know

3524
02:47:20,799 --> 02:47:26,478
you're going to step by that much

3525
02:47:23,279 --> 02:47:31,279
so inside this where you have

3526
02:47:26,478 --> 02:47:33,599
um the step you're going to take

3527
02:47:31,279 --> 02:47:34,479
instead of these like plus equals is all

3528
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:37,920
over the place

3529
02:47:34,478 --> 02:47:41,119
you would just do this and

3530
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:44,559
go by the step amount rather than one

3531
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:47,680
all the rest of the code still works

3532
02:47:44,559 --> 02:47:50,000
and uh you could even

3533
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:50,000
you know

3534
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:57,680
you could do this right so you have your

3535
02:47:54,959 --> 02:47:58,639
your step which defaults to one one one

3536
02:47:57,680 --> 02:48:00,720
and in this case

3537
02:47:58,639 --> 02:48:02,719
the the final one isn't used and your

3538
02:48:00,719 --> 02:48:05,599
base which defaults to zero zero

3539
02:48:02,719 --> 02:48:06,159
zero and then your iterator can actually

3540
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:08,720
iterate

3541
02:48:06,159 --> 02:48:11,119
any kind of grid like pattern and you

3542
02:48:08,719 --> 02:48:13,519
didn't actually have to do any more work

3543
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:15,200
you know what i mean it's the same code

3544
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:16,000
for all intents and purposes but you can

3545
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:18,479
call it in like

3546
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:19,920
a bunch of different ways and you get

3547
02:48:18,478 --> 02:48:22,959
like more mileage out of that

3548
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:24,478
you know what i'm saying so this would

3549
02:48:22,959 --> 02:48:27,599
allow us to do

3550
02:48:24,478 --> 02:48:29,840
that quite easily and

3551
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:31,760
i guess this is really just iterate as

3552
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:35,040
planar tiles and then we would have

3553
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:38,000
um the base p here

3554
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:38,000
um like that

3555
02:48:38,639 --> 02:48:45,760
and all we would need to do is say uh

3556
02:48:42,398 --> 02:48:49,358
calculate you know um

3557
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:51,200
calc spacing offset right or something

3558
02:48:49,359 --> 02:48:53,680
like this

3559
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:54,720
and this would give us if we passed it

3560
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:58,000
the spacing

3561
02:48:54,719 --> 02:48:59,760
um calculate you know base p for

3562
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:01,120
offset and you know you'd give it the

3563
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:04,159
grid

3564
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:05,279
um or something like this and then when

3565
02:49:04,159 --> 02:49:06,959
it looked at the grid it would just

3566
02:49:05,279 --> 02:49:08,399
figure out where the first one would be

3567
02:49:06,959 --> 02:49:10,318
and then you know that you step by that

3568
02:49:08,398 --> 02:49:10,959
many each time and then we pass that

3569
02:49:10,318 --> 02:49:14,318
spacing

3570
02:49:10,959 --> 02:49:18,318
in you know um

3571
02:49:14,318 --> 02:49:18,318
each time yeah

3572
02:49:18,559 --> 02:49:23,278
pretty pretty straightforward and so i

3573
02:49:20,799 --> 02:49:24,959
think that would just work

3574
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:26,880
and the only thing that you would need

3575
02:49:24,959 --> 02:49:31,039
to do is

3576
02:49:26,879 --> 02:49:34,559
that when you do iterate as planar tiles

3577
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:37,600
that just takes the base p and

3578
02:49:34,559 --> 02:49:39,439
so when it initializes the thing instead

3579
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:43,279
of the relative index

3580
02:49:39,439 --> 02:49:45,760
um you know it's base rail index

3581
02:49:43,279 --> 02:49:45,760
whatever

3582
02:49:46,559 --> 02:49:50,639
and similarly this is you know space

3583
02:49:49,120 --> 02:49:51,520
real index it's just the same thing you

3584
02:49:50,639 --> 02:49:54,318
passed

3585
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:55,279
you know now we can still make that work

3586
02:49:54,318 --> 02:49:57,359
for everybody else

3587
02:49:55,279 --> 02:49:58,479
by just doing 0 0 0 because that's what

3588
02:49:57,359 --> 02:50:00,318
it would have been anyway

3589
02:49:58,478 --> 02:50:02,398
when they initialize and they'll just

3590
02:50:00,318 --> 02:50:04,478
work and then if we do calc

3591
02:50:02,398 --> 02:50:06,879
base p for offset and we just shove that

3592
02:50:04,478 --> 02:50:06,879
in here

3593
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:10,479
just to make it start working before we

3594
02:50:08,879 --> 02:50:12,639
look at what that calculation actually

3595
02:50:10,478 --> 02:50:16,159
is

3596
02:50:12,639 --> 02:50:23,840
we can just put d step in here

3597
02:50:16,159 --> 02:50:23,840
and the edit grid you know

3598
02:50:28,719 --> 02:50:33,840
okay uh and at that point

3599
02:50:32,159 --> 02:50:35,600
i think this would actually work but it

3600
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:37,200
wouldn't be centered so the pattern

3601
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:39,120
would not be centered in the room like

3602
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:42,399
we would want it to be

3603
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:46,000
um but it will do

3604
02:50:42,398 --> 02:50:51,119
something like that i think right

3605
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:54,239
okay now uh yeah so

3606
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:55,920
one problem we get here is

3607
02:50:54,239 --> 02:50:57,359
we also when we're doing placenta

3608
02:50:55,920 --> 02:50:59,279
traversable we don't actually want to

3609
02:50:57,359 --> 02:50:59,680
place this at traversable we just want

3610
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:02,960
to do

3611
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:06,800
at p um

3612
02:51:02,959 --> 02:51:10,239
right and so

3613
02:51:06,799 --> 02:51:12,559
when we get the tile contents thing

3614
02:51:10,239 --> 02:51:13,600
here we really don't care about that

3615
02:51:12,559 --> 02:51:16,840
what we care about is

3616
02:51:13,600 --> 02:51:18,000
is where this thing is in the world you

3617
02:51:16,840 --> 02:51:32,079
know

3618
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:34,318
so i'm assuming that

3619
02:51:32,079 --> 02:51:37,439
assuming that we just want to use the

3620
02:51:34,318 --> 02:51:37,439
structural entity

3621
02:51:42,559 --> 02:51:47,840
so here we probably want to do

3622
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:50,159
the same thing we were doing before

3623
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:54,159
where we just have one of these

3624
02:51:50,159 --> 02:51:54,159
but it works off of the edit tile

3625
02:51:54,239 --> 02:52:00,318
and we just say get the contents

3626
02:51:57,359 --> 02:52:02,318
of this tile and then instead of this

3627
02:52:00,318 --> 02:52:06,159
content structural thing

3628
02:52:02,318 --> 02:52:06,159
you know you would just do that

3629
02:52:12,840 --> 02:52:15,840
um

3630
02:52:16,159 --> 02:52:18,959
something like that

3631
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:30,880
so i think that's what we would do

3632
02:52:32,879 --> 02:52:38,799
uh and i don't really know

3633
02:52:36,398 --> 02:52:39,840
but i think that's what we do and then

3634
02:52:38,799 --> 02:52:41,759
in theory

3635
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:43,279
you know that places lights regularly

3636
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:45,600
spaced throughout the room and you can

3637
02:52:43,279 --> 02:52:50,720
kind of see that that's happening now

3638
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:50,720
right um you know what i mean

3639
02:52:53,279 --> 02:52:57,200
we've got too much light in the world

3640
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:57,920
now the intensity of these lights should

3641
02:52:57,200 --> 02:53:01,840
probably be

3642
02:52:57,920 --> 02:53:06,079
less because there's so much light

3643
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:08,840
but uh you know that's easy

3644
02:53:06,079 --> 02:53:11,840
just take the light level down a little

3645
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:11,840
bit

3646
02:53:15,439 --> 02:53:20,159
and so then all we need to do is center

3647
02:53:16,879 --> 02:53:22,799
them and that's pretty easy

3648
02:53:20,159 --> 02:53:24,079
but you can see now we sort of have a

3649
02:53:22,799 --> 02:53:26,639
better light distribution

3650
02:53:24,079 --> 02:53:26,639
in the world

3651
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:31,600
and seems okay

3652
02:53:34,559 --> 02:53:39,119
i don't really know how high up these

3653
02:53:36,318 --> 02:53:42,079
lights are

3654
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:43,200
that's a little confusing so the fact

3655
02:53:42,079 --> 02:53:46,719
that we don't draw

3656
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:49,680
lights is is a little

3657
02:53:46,719 --> 02:53:49,679
not good um

3658
02:53:50,478 --> 02:53:55,760
you could imagine wanting to draw the

3659
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:55,760
lights

3660
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:06,318
and that we probably have done this

3661
02:53:59,279 --> 02:54:09,359
so um

3662
02:54:06,318 --> 02:54:12,318
in here where we draw the light you

3663
02:54:09,359 --> 02:54:12,960
could just also push a volume outline

3664
02:54:12,318 --> 02:54:16,318
right

3665
02:54:12,959 --> 02:54:16,318
so if you did

3666
02:54:16,879 --> 02:54:20,000
push light you could just do push volume

3667
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:23,278
outline and say

3668
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:27,439
okay if this is where that thing

3669
02:54:23,279 --> 02:54:27,439
is um

3670
02:54:30,959 --> 02:54:34,079
it's going to be a rectangle with that

3671
02:54:32,879 --> 02:54:49,679
shape

3672
02:54:34,079 --> 02:54:52,000
i guess

3673
02:54:49,680 --> 02:54:53,359
yeah so we're gonna do so this would be

3674
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:56,959
a rectangle three

3675
02:54:53,359 --> 02:54:56,960
oops wrecked

3676
02:54:57,040 --> 02:55:08,240
uh center dim i guess is how this works

3677
02:55:03,439 --> 02:55:08,239
um so it would look like that oops

3678
02:55:09,680 --> 02:55:15,120
and i think that would draw where the

3679
02:55:11,279 --> 02:55:16,720
lights are just so we can see them

3680
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:18,240
and so you can see how they're hovering

3681
02:55:16,719 --> 02:55:20,879
around uh

3682
02:55:18,239 --> 02:55:20,879
and you know

3683
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:31,840
uh and that seems

3684
02:55:32,559 --> 02:55:45,840
is maybe sort of sensible um

3685
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:50,399
it does seem with that many lights we

3686
02:55:48,639 --> 02:55:51,760
get a little bit of to we get a little

3687
02:55:50,398 --> 02:55:53,680
bit of feedback

3688
02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:55,200
which maybe means our we've got a bug

3689
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:56,840
somewhere in our lighting well you know

3690
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:58,000
we've probably got a lot of bugs in our

3691
02:55:56,840 --> 02:56:01,359
lighting

3692
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:03,520
um but uh

3693
02:56:01,359 --> 02:56:05,840
i don't know why this room seems to not

3694
02:56:03,520 --> 02:56:07,359
have any

3695
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:10,000
light except for what's coming from in

3696
02:56:07,359 --> 02:56:10,000
from the ceiling

3697
02:56:10,318 --> 02:56:14,639
but i don't see any i don't see any

3698
02:56:12,398 --> 02:56:15,920
lights in there i guess the entry room

3699
02:56:14,639 --> 02:56:18,478
didn't get any lights

3700
02:56:15,920 --> 02:56:18,478
don't know why

3701
02:56:19,359 --> 02:56:25,200
um so yeah but these rooms all did

3702
02:56:23,600 --> 02:56:28,000
so i'm not sure why that is but i guess

3703
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:29,680
that room the entrance room

3704
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:31,279
at the end of the forest there didn't

3705
02:56:29,680 --> 02:56:34,479
get a light

3706
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:35,680
these rooms all have them and they look

3707
02:56:34,478 --> 02:56:38,079
fine

3708
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:39,760
and maybe so i can take the snake it's

3709
02:56:38,079 --> 02:56:41,200
not really supposed to have a light on

3710
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:43,399
it so maybe i'll take the

3711
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:45,279
snake and

3712
02:56:43,399 --> 02:56:48,799
[Music]

3713
02:56:45,279 --> 02:56:51,840
remove the light from the snake

3714
02:56:48,799 --> 02:56:56,159
because i don't really want the snake to

3715
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:58,880
have a light um

3716
02:56:56,159 --> 02:56:59,840
so add piece light it's there's like way

3717
02:56:58,879 --> 02:57:02,959
too many of these

3718
02:56:59,840 --> 02:57:03,840
maybe the head could still have one but

3719
02:57:02,959 --> 02:57:06,079
just

3720
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:09,840
you know not the not the body segments

3721
02:57:06,079 --> 02:57:09,840
that's just too much

3722
02:57:10,959 --> 02:57:16,079
okay so there we go um

3723
02:57:14,239 --> 02:57:17,680
those are being drawn now i think those

3724
02:57:16,079 --> 02:57:19,039
are roughly as high as they should be i

3725
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:20,840
don't know maybe they should be slightly

3726
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:24,080
higher up

3727
02:57:20,840 --> 02:57:26,159
um it's hard to say

3728
02:57:24,079 --> 02:57:27,600
i'll put i'll leave that in there so

3729
02:57:26,159 --> 02:57:28,398
that we can turn it on anytime we want

3730
02:57:27,600 --> 02:57:32,000
to draw

3731
02:57:28,398 --> 02:57:34,239
the lights um and and i guess that's it

3732
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:37,840
i don't know is there anything else

3733
02:57:34,239 --> 02:57:41,439
uh centering these so when we do this

3734
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:44,639
you know um we're gonna have the grid

3735
02:57:41,439 --> 02:57:47,760
tile tile count

3736
02:57:44,639 --> 02:57:50,719
and if you imagine the tile count x

3737
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:53,520
and you take the d step x and you say

3738
02:57:50,719 --> 02:57:57,199
here's how many they're going to be

3739
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:57,200
so there's like an x count right

3740
02:57:58,639 --> 02:58:01,760
and these are going to be the same thing

3741
02:58:00,318 --> 02:58:03,119
you'll we can collapse them you'll see

3742
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:05,680
in a second

3743
02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:07,200
but we know how many we're going to have

3744
02:58:05,680 --> 02:58:08,398
so like if you say that they need to be

3745
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:10,479
faced five apart

3746
02:58:08,398 --> 02:58:11,680
and the room is like six long then we

3747
02:58:10,478 --> 02:58:12,639
know we're just going to only be able to

3748
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:17,439
put one

3749
02:58:12,639 --> 02:58:20,719
right so we know how many we would have

3750
02:58:17,439 --> 02:58:22,960
and then uh after after we know how many

3751
02:58:20,719 --> 02:58:25,599
we would have

3752
02:58:22,959 --> 02:58:26,079
uh we just need to figure out like how

3753
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:29,600
much

3754
02:58:26,079 --> 02:58:31,039
extra there would be so in a sense we

3755
02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:34,239
could just say well okay

3756
02:58:31,040 --> 02:58:35,760
so however much the steps are we know

3757
02:58:34,239 --> 02:58:38,478
that there's like an

3758
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:41,359
off like like an amount if we take that

3759
02:58:38,478 --> 02:58:43,039
remainder when we divide this thing

3760
02:58:41,359 --> 02:58:45,439
we know there's going to be a remainder

3761
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:49,120
to the d step so if the d step

3762
02:58:45,439 --> 02:58:53,920
is three and the room size is seven

3763
02:58:49,120 --> 02:58:55,680
we know we're gonna have like um

3764
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:57,439
this is probably something better done

3765
02:58:55,680 --> 02:58:59,040
on the on the light board or something

3766
02:58:57,439 --> 02:59:01,439
but you know

3767
02:58:59,040 --> 02:59:02,160
um we know we're gonna have like two

3768
02:59:01,439 --> 02:59:04,479
spans

3769
02:59:02,159 --> 02:59:06,318
like the span that goes from the wall

3770
02:59:04,478 --> 02:59:08,079
from the first wall to the light

3771
02:59:06,318 --> 02:59:09,760
then from the light to the next wall

3772
02:59:08,079 --> 02:59:11,120
there's two spans and we want those to

3773
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:13,840
be equally spaced

3774
02:59:11,120 --> 02:59:15,040
so however many of these are going to be

3775
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:18,079
we want

3776
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:21,680
one more than that right

3777
02:59:18,079 --> 02:59:23,840
is the size that we're trying to divide

3778
02:59:21,680 --> 02:59:29,840
up i don't i don't know if this is

3779
02:59:23,840 --> 02:59:29,840
making any sense you know what

3780
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:38,079
we'll do it next weekend so i can

3781
02:59:36,398 --> 02:59:41,358
actually draw it out

3782
02:59:38,079 --> 02:59:43,840
we're done we're done now we finished

3783
02:59:41,359 --> 02:59:43,840
uh

3784
02:59:44,639 --> 02:59:49,680
and um there was that one other thing

3785
02:59:48,478 --> 02:59:50,639
which was that for some reason we

3786
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:54,318
weren't seeing the

3787
02:59:50,639 --> 02:59:55,680
trees so when we did the door like

3788
02:59:54,318 --> 02:59:58,478
the only other thing i noticed was when

3789
02:59:55,680 --> 03:00:03,040
we did the door it wasn't there

3790
02:59:58,478 --> 03:00:08,159
we tried to put a door like this

3791
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:12,479
right so asset block

3792
03:00:08,159 --> 03:00:17,039
tag wall tag stone or something

3793
03:00:12,478 --> 03:00:17,039
didn't work um

3794
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:20,800
and i think the reason for that is

3795
03:00:19,359 --> 03:00:25,840
obstacle

3796
03:00:20,799 --> 03:00:25,840
is not is not adding a block

3797
03:00:26,799 --> 03:00:30,959
right it's actually a block that we need

3798
03:00:29,600 --> 03:00:35,200
to add

3799
03:00:30,959 --> 03:00:36,079
um so you know this should probably be

3800
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:39,840
something like an

3801
03:00:36,079 --> 03:00:44,799
ad block call

3802
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:44,799
because it's not an obstacle right

3803
03:00:46,398 --> 03:00:53,840
actually i guess i guess it should be

3804
03:00:50,840 --> 03:00:53,840
this

3805
03:01:02,959 --> 03:01:06,799
and so there should be a way to say like

3806
03:01:04,559 --> 03:01:09,840
okay there's a block

3807
03:01:06,799 --> 03:01:10,478
and the block is the blocks i don't

3808
03:01:09,840 --> 03:01:14,000
think do

3809
03:01:10,478 --> 03:01:16,879
connections do they um

3810
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:17,200
well let's take a look let's see what we

3811
03:01:16,879 --> 03:01:21,119
do

3812
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:25,680
here because this is what we want right

3813
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:25,680
um so we're just doing this

3814
03:01:30,559 --> 03:01:35,840
it's it's it's literally just this

3815
03:01:36,559 --> 03:01:42,478
so so i think it'd be okay we would just

3816
03:01:39,920 --> 03:01:43,920
you know add one of these we'd add this

3817
03:01:42,478 --> 03:01:46,959
block

3818
03:01:43,920 --> 03:01:50,318
um with whatever the base asset was

3819
03:01:46,959 --> 03:01:54,079
that you told us to use right

3820
03:01:50,318 --> 03:01:57,439
um and we would add

3821
03:01:54,079 --> 03:01:58,079
the thing for whatever the volume was so

3822
03:01:57,439 --> 03:01:59,920
you'd have to

3823
03:01:58,079 --> 03:02:01,520
you'd have to give us a volume is the

3824
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:03,840
only thing

3825
03:02:01,520 --> 03:02:03,840
and

3826
03:02:07,120 --> 03:02:12,319
i guess i don't know i guess i don't

3827
03:02:10,959 --> 03:02:17,599
know

3828
03:02:12,318 --> 03:02:22,478
how that would work right i'm not sure

3829
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:22,479
where we get those volumes from

3830
03:02:26,559 --> 03:02:30,959
so we would call ad block we would just

3831
03:02:29,279 --> 03:02:31,520
need the volume that you were going to

3832
03:02:30,959 --> 03:02:33,599
use

3833
03:02:31,520 --> 03:02:34,720
and i guess you just have to pass that

3834
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:38,079
in

3835
03:02:34,719 --> 03:02:38,799
because i'm not sure any other way to do

3836
03:02:38,079 --> 03:02:41,200
it

3837
03:02:38,799 --> 03:02:43,119
so you're going to have to do that you

3838
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:46,159
know

3839
03:02:43,120 --> 03:02:49,920
and then the uh

3840
03:02:46,159 --> 03:02:59,520
the variant is passed in

3841
03:02:49,920 --> 03:03:01,200
here and yeah

3842
03:02:59,520 --> 03:03:03,520
i guess this is actually a rectangle

3843
03:03:01,200 --> 03:03:03,520
three

3844
03:03:04,318 --> 03:03:06,959
for the piece

3845
03:03:08,159 --> 03:03:11,200
um

3846
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:14,560
[Music]

3847
03:03:11,200 --> 03:03:14,560
all right and

3848
03:03:19,760 --> 03:03:22,800
i guess that's it

3849
03:03:25,439 --> 03:03:30,159
entity tag hash

3850
03:03:33,279 --> 03:03:38,079
you know dim offset

3851
03:03:38,840 --> 03:03:41,840
color

3852
03:03:42,879 --> 03:03:49,068
and off we go okay so

3853
03:03:45,790 --> 03:03:49,069
[Music]

3854
03:03:50,639 --> 03:03:57,760
when we actually create that door um

3855
03:03:54,159 --> 03:04:00,879
the door should be a

3856
03:03:57,760 --> 03:04:00,880
ad block

3857
03:04:02,478 --> 03:04:08,239
and we would pass you know

3858
03:04:05,520 --> 03:04:09,760
the hash and then we need the other

3859
03:04:08,239 --> 03:04:13,279
stuff

3860
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:16,880
for now um oops

3861
03:04:13,279 --> 03:04:20,800
we have a color that's just white and

3862
03:04:16,879 --> 03:04:24,000
we need to know what the volume is

3863
03:04:20,799 --> 03:04:27,119
of the thing which i guess we'll

3864
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:27,120
get because

3865
03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:32,880
we can look at the tile contents for

3866
03:04:30,478 --> 03:04:32,879
that

3867
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:37,840
because we're getting

3868
03:04:40,478 --> 03:04:45,039
we're getting this crap already like

3869
03:04:44,239 --> 03:04:48,079
this stuff

3870
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:52,800
get volume from minzy

3871
03:04:48,079 --> 03:04:52,799
right so we're already doing this

3872
03:04:57,680 --> 03:05:00,880
for the tile

3873
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:06,960
um so we know which tile it is

3874
03:05:08,159 --> 03:05:10,478
um

3875
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:19,840
right and so we really just need

3876
03:05:16,478 --> 03:05:19,840
this thing

3877
03:05:36,959 --> 03:05:40,159
and it's a little annoying that there's

3878
03:05:38,398 --> 03:05:42,559
so many of these

3879
03:05:40,159 --> 03:05:44,159
i don't know what that's going to do um

3880
03:05:42,559 --> 03:05:46,799
it's kind of annoying that there's so

3881
03:05:44,159 --> 03:05:49,039
many of these though

3882
03:05:46,799 --> 03:05:50,799
like we gotta condense this down this

3883
03:05:49,040 --> 03:05:51,520
should probably just be something that

3884
03:05:50,799 --> 03:05:54,559
you get

3885
03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:56,479
directly out of here and you're always

3886
03:05:54,559 --> 03:06:01,840
working with one of these

3887
03:05:56,478 --> 03:06:01,840
that's what it should really be

3888
03:06:14,799 --> 03:06:29,840
um so i don't really know about that

3889
03:06:36,239 --> 03:06:41,600
okay so the volume

3890
03:06:39,680 --> 03:06:44,960
is really the thing that we don't have

3891
03:06:41,600 --> 03:06:44,960
here and so

3892
03:06:54,840 --> 03:06:57,840
um

3893
03:06:58,239 --> 03:07:04,318
you know this is exactly what we want we

3894
03:07:00,478 --> 03:07:04,318
just don't actually want it to be

3895
03:07:05,760 --> 03:07:14,719
i mean can't can't this just be like

3896
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:17,680
get volume from minzy right um

3897
03:07:14,719 --> 03:07:19,438
we want this to be relative so we really

3898
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:21,760
just want the thing that's like get

3899
03:07:19,439 --> 03:07:24,079
total volume

3900
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:25,760
this is kind of just a waste of our time

3901
03:07:24,079 --> 03:07:27,920
because this entire thing

3902
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:29,120
is just placing it it's just the tile

3903
03:07:27,920 --> 03:07:32,639
dim

3904
03:07:29,120 --> 03:07:35,439
is is like

3905
03:07:32,639 --> 03:07:37,519
all we actually needed right so the

3906
03:07:35,439 --> 03:07:39,760
volume is just that

3907
03:07:37,520 --> 03:07:42,079
and we don't need to do the rest of the

3908
03:07:39,760 --> 03:07:44,000
stuff all we need to do is make sure the

3909
03:07:42,079 --> 03:07:46,478
wall height is correct

3910
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:47,200
you know what i'm saying so that whole

3911
03:07:46,478 --> 03:07:50,478
thing

3912
03:07:47,200 --> 03:07:53,520
is kind of stupid because it doesn't

3913
03:07:50,478 --> 03:07:56,159
really matter

3914
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:56,880
so i think what we want is to just say

3915
03:07:56,159 --> 03:07:58,959
okay

3916
03:07:56,879 --> 03:08:00,318
you know you know we would change the

3917
03:07:58,959 --> 03:08:02,879
height of this thing

3918
03:08:00,318 --> 03:08:04,318
or set dim or something we would want to

3919
03:08:02,879 --> 03:08:08,079
be able to change the dimension

3920
03:08:04,318 --> 03:08:09,680
of it but only the only the z

3921
03:08:08,079 --> 03:08:11,520
right and to to make it be the wall

3922
03:08:09,680 --> 03:08:12,559
height but we'll deal with that in one

3923
03:08:11,520 --> 03:08:15,279
second

3924
03:08:12,559 --> 03:08:16,639
if we just take the tile dim for now we

3925
03:08:15,279 --> 03:08:19,359
should be able to pass this

3926
03:08:16,639 --> 03:08:20,879
and when we do add block add block is

3927
03:08:19,359 --> 03:08:24,000
taking the volume

3928
03:08:20,879 --> 03:08:24,398
as the input so that would be the end of

3929
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:27,840
it

3930
03:08:24,398 --> 03:08:29,119
right so we would just say okay pass the

3931
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:35,840
volume

3932
03:08:29,120 --> 03:08:35,840
pass pass the volume

3933
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:49,840
uh right which is that and we just want

3934
03:08:44,239 --> 03:08:49,840
to center it

3935
03:08:53,520 --> 03:08:56,960
so can we do this

3936
03:08:57,279 --> 03:09:04,960
pass the tile dim in add block

3937
03:09:01,120 --> 03:09:07,920
we base this around the center point so

3938
03:09:04,959 --> 03:09:09,438
um this is actually just the dimensions

3939
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:12,719
of the thing

3940
03:09:09,439 --> 03:09:14,880
uh so this is the v3 dim

3941
03:09:12,719 --> 03:09:17,920
and so in here if we want the radius it

3942
03:09:14,879 --> 03:09:20,799
would just be half times the dim

3943
03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:21,760
and then the center point of it is just

3944
03:09:20,799 --> 03:09:24,639
going to be

3945
03:09:21,760 --> 03:09:25,359
like play you know centered at the z

3946
03:09:24,639 --> 03:09:28,879
base

3947
03:09:25,359 --> 03:09:32,159
so it would presumably just be like uh

3948
03:09:28,879 --> 03:09:35,759
you know um zero

3949
03:09:32,159 --> 03:09:39,119
zero 0.5 times dim z

3950
03:09:35,760 --> 03:09:41,680
you know so it's just like a block

3951
03:09:39,120 --> 03:09:43,600
that's placed at its base wherever you

3952
03:09:41,680 --> 03:09:47,359
happen to actually put the thing

3953
03:09:43,600 --> 03:09:49,040
you know um

3954
03:09:47,359 --> 03:09:51,120
okay so i don't know what that's going

3955
03:09:49,040 --> 03:09:53,520
to do but i feel like we should at least

3956
03:09:51,120 --> 03:09:54,829
hack that in there for now

3957
03:09:53,520 --> 03:09:57,040
and then

3958
03:09:54,829 --> 03:10:00,159
[Music]

3959
03:09:57,040 --> 03:10:02,720
that way we can have doors that actually

3960
03:10:00,159 --> 03:10:03,279
look like doors we can get some art done

3961
03:10:02,719 --> 03:10:05,840
to

3962
03:10:03,279 --> 03:10:06,800
to have a door on it or something i

3963
03:10:05,840 --> 03:10:08,398
don't know

3964
03:10:06,799 --> 03:10:09,599
um and so oh you know what and i don't

3965
03:10:08,398 --> 03:10:10,840
have to hop down there every time to

3966
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:13,840
debug this

3967
03:10:10,840 --> 03:10:17,279
because i can just set up

3968
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:19,520
the um initial camera

3969
03:10:17,279 --> 03:10:19,520
right

3970
03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:30,720
okay so uh our goal now is just to make

3971
03:10:27,439 --> 03:10:33,120
there be a door right there uh hopefully

3972
03:10:30,719 --> 03:10:35,199
and we can also look to see there might

3973
03:10:33,120 --> 03:10:36,560
be doors there that are actually just

3974
03:10:35,200 --> 03:10:37,760
sunk into the geometry so i just wanted

3975
03:10:36,559 --> 03:10:38,799
to check first to make sure that it

3976
03:10:37,760 --> 03:10:41,439
wasn't a placement

3977
03:10:38,799 --> 03:10:41,840
issue but it doesn't look like it right

3978
03:10:41,439 --> 03:10:43,439
so

3979
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:45,920
let's go ahead and get that working so

3980
03:10:43,439 --> 03:10:49,359
in ad block and let me just

3981
03:10:45,920 --> 03:10:49,359
like it's an ad blocker um

3982
03:10:49,439 --> 03:10:52,880
let me also check how we do it we do

3983
03:10:51,600 --> 03:10:55,840
place entity

3984
03:10:52,879 --> 03:10:56,478
on traversable door reference here's the

3985
03:10:55,840 --> 03:11:01,680
door

3986
03:10:56,478 --> 03:11:01,679
uh it's block tag wall stone

3987
03:11:02,478 --> 03:11:10,398
yup and tile dim

3988
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:12,398
is that this is where we're placing it

3989
03:11:10,398 --> 03:11:14,318
there's the color

3990
03:11:12,398 --> 03:11:15,920
the color is just one one one and it's a

3991
03:11:14,318 --> 03:11:18,959
piece type cube

3992
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:21,600
here's the variant to do region

3993
03:11:18,959 --> 03:11:22,079
flags collide so i feel like that

3994
03:11:21,600 --> 03:11:25,359
actually

3995
03:11:22,079 --> 03:11:27,279
should have worked i'm not actually sure

3996
03:11:25,359 --> 03:11:31,920
why it didn't

3997
03:11:27,279 --> 03:11:34,720
we place its position here

3998
03:11:31,920 --> 03:11:35,279
and presumably it is there quote unquote

3999
03:11:34,719 --> 03:11:38,079
meaning

4000
03:11:35,279 --> 03:11:40,079
i can't go through it yeah so it is

4001
03:11:38,079 --> 03:11:42,478
placed there

4002
03:11:40,079 --> 03:11:44,398
i just don't see it for some reason so

4003
03:11:42,478 --> 03:11:46,719
that's the question is why

4004
03:11:44,398 --> 03:11:46,719
right

4005
03:11:47,920 --> 03:11:53,920
if we look in here you can see

4006
03:11:51,040 --> 03:11:55,279
us adding the other one this is how this

4007
03:11:53,920 --> 03:11:57,520
one's added

4008
03:11:55,279 --> 03:11:58,399
and we can look at how the entity is

4009
03:11:57,520 --> 03:12:00,399
placed

4010
03:11:58,398 --> 03:12:01,439
uh and just see if there's any does

4011
03:12:00,398 --> 03:12:04,719
anyone even touch

4012
03:12:01,439 --> 03:12:08,079
that nope it's just ads like ground

4013
03:12:04,719 --> 03:12:08,079
cover and traversibles

4014
03:12:16,840 --> 03:12:20,238
um

4015
03:12:18,478 --> 03:12:23,760
it should probably have an occluder so

4016
03:12:20,238 --> 03:12:26,799
you can't see light from the other side

4017
03:12:23,760 --> 03:12:28,478
but again since we can't actually see

4018
03:12:26,799 --> 03:12:30,639
the thing to begin with i'm not sure

4019
03:12:28,478 --> 03:12:34,079
that matters

4020
03:12:30,639 --> 03:12:38,879
um the entity p will be set

4021
03:12:34,079 --> 03:12:38,879
when it gets placed on the traversible

4022
03:12:43,439 --> 03:12:48,479
so i don't know that should work

4023
03:12:48,639 --> 03:12:51,760
is there some kind of tag thing i don't

4024
03:12:50,799 --> 03:12:53,759
understand

4025
03:12:51,760 --> 03:12:54,800
that like we didn't set the tags right

4026
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:59,279
like

4027
03:12:54,799 --> 03:13:02,238
is there no stone wall

4028
03:12:59,279 --> 03:13:02,880
that could be it actually you know what

4029
03:13:02,238 --> 03:13:04,639
that

4030
03:13:02,879 --> 03:13:06,559
may well be it it might be that there's

4031
03:13:04,639 --> 03:13:10,478
only a stone floor

4032
03:13:06,559 --> 03:13:11,760
um we should probably have a thing that

4033
03:13:10,478 --> 03:13:14,639
if it can't find an

4034
03:13:11,760 --> 03:13:15,760
asset it like draws bright pink or

4035
03:13:14,639 --> 03:13:18,238
something

4036
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:20,238
that's probably going to be useful like

4037
03:13:18,238 --> 03:13:22,159
so that we know the difference between

4038
03:13:20,238 --> 03:13:23,439
those two things

4039
03:13:22,159 --> 03:13:26,159
probably something to put on the to-do

4040
03:13:23,439 --> 03:13:28,559
list it's probably just that we don't

4041
03:13:26,159 --> 03:13:28,559
have

4042
03:13:28,879 --> 03:13:31,599
stone walls

4043
03:13:33,040 --> 03:13:40,800
that's my guess and i'm right

4044
03:13:37,760 --> 03:13:43,600
so here's our like

4045
03:13:40,799 --> 03:13:45,119
you know our door piece you can see that

4046
03:13:43,600 --> 03:13:47,279
it's too high because this is the thing

4047
03:13:45,120 --> 03:13:50,160
where we didn't set the wall height

4048
03:13:47,279 --> 03:13:51,520
so we'd like that to now have its z

4049
03:13:50,159 --> 03:13:53,279
changed

4050
03:13:51,520 --> 03:13:55,279
i don't know like i feel like we should

4051
03:13:53,279 --> 03:13:57,279
have a math function

4052
03:13:55,279 --> 03:13:59,200
that does that that like sets the

4053
03:13:57,279 --> 03:14:01,359
dimensions of a rectangle you know what

4054
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:02,140
i mean

4055
03:14:01,359 --> 03:14:04,800
but um

4056
03:14:02,139 --> 03:14:11,840
[Music]

4057
03:14:04,799 --> 03:14:11,840
i don't know that we do

4058
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:25,840
yeah i don't know that we do um

4059
03:14:24,799 --> 03:14:28,079
i don't know that i want to think too

4060
03:14:25,840 --> 03:14:31,200
hard about it right now

4061
03:14:28,079 --> 03:14:39,840
so what i'll probably do is just say

4062
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:39,840
uh yeah you know we we got the tile dim

4063
03:14:41,279 --> 03:14:47,359
and we'll just we'll just say

4064
03:14:44,719 --> 03:14:47,840
okay if that's the the dimensions of the

4065
03:14:47,359 --> 03:14:50,479
door

4066
03:14:47,840 --> 03:14:51,040
the door dim you know max c equals door

4067
03:14:50,478 --> 03:14:54,879
dim

4068
03:14:51,040 --> 03:15:00,160
min z plus the wall height

4069
03:14:54,879 --> 03:15:00,159
you know it's not real exciting

4070
03:15:04,840 --> 03:15:10,799
um

4071
03:15:07,600 --> 03:15:10,800
it's not oh

4072
03:15:13,760 --> 03:15:16,719
that's even easier

4073
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:24,960
uh so wall height

4074
03:15:21,520 --> 03:15:29,520
is specified in here right

4075
03:15:24,959 --> 03:15:32,238
and i don't know that it

4076
03:15:29,520 --> 03:15:33,520
it gets set depending on the situation

4077
03:15:32,238 --> 03:15:37,039
right

4078
03:15:33,520 --> 03:15:39,520
and so i guess we kind of have to say

4079
03:15:37,040 --> 03:15:40,960
well the wall height quote-unquote is

4080
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:45,439
this thing

4081
03:15:40,959 --> 03:15:45,438
like full wall height

4082
03:15:45,840 --> 03:15:52,799
and the full wall height is two

4083
03:15:50,639 --> 03:15:54,559
that way everybody uses the same

4084
03:15:52,799 --> 03:15:56,159
arbitrary numbers that we just decided

4085
03:15:54,559 --> 03:16:03,840
or how high the walls are

4086
03:15:56,159 --> 03:16:03,840
you know what i'm saying

4087
03:16:07,520 --> 03:16:11,040
all right and i think that's it for

4088
03:16:09,920 --> 03:16:13,439
today

4089
03:16:11,040 --> 03:16:13,439
um

4090
03:16:15,120 --> 03:16:20,319
because i don't want to do anything

4091
03:16:16,238 --> 03:16:24,159
fancy uh since we're so far over time

4092
03:16:20,318 --> 03:16:27,920
so you know there's that the wall um

4093
03:16:24,159 --> 03:16:29,680
and you know it looks like

4094
03:16:27,920 --> 03:16:31,200
maybe the centering the positioning of

4095
03:16:29,680 --> 03:16:33,279
the wall might be slightly wrong

4096
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:35,359
as well uh which again i don't know that

4097
03:16:33,279 --> 03:16:38,399
i care about right now either

4098
03:16:35,359 --> 03:16:41,920
um but you know you

4099
03:16:38,398 --> 03:16:47,039
you can clear it out now at least uh

4100
03:16:41,920 --> 03:16:51,359
and so yeah for doors

4101
03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:54,239
um again we we don't really know

4102
03:16:51,359 --> 03:16:54,880
what we're gonna do with those long term

4103
03:16:54,238 --> 03:16:58,238
but

4104
03:16:54,879 --> 03:16:59,679
you know for now we're just moving them

4105
03:16:58,238 --> 03:17:02,000
out of the way

4106
03:16:59,680 --> 03:17:02,000
and

4107
03:17:05,040 --> 03:17:08,640
it's going to be a problem because if

4108
03:17:06,559 --> 03:17:11,439
they go down that far they might block

4109
03:17:08,639 --> 03:17:12,959
things in the other room like we're

4110
03:17:11,439 --> 03:17:14,398
going to need an actual solution for

4111
03:17:12,959 --> 03:17:17,519
what happens with doors because that's

4112
03:17:14,398 --> 03:17:17,519
not going to cut it right

4113
03:17:17,760 --> 03:17:23,359
but that's where we're at okay so

4114
03:17:21,439 --> 03:17:24,960
i think we're good that'll be it for

4115
03:17:23,359 --> 03:17:27,840
today

4116
03:17:24,959 --> 03:17:27,839
and

4117
03:17:37,760 --> 03:17:41,840
seems good

4118
03:17:46,799 --> 03:17:49,519
all reasonable

4119
03:17:49,920 --> 03:17:57,279
all reasonable okay

4120
03:17:54,159 --> 03:17:58,879
oh that was funny it put the yeah that's

4121
03:17:57,279 --> 03:18:00,079
interesting it put the switch down the

4122
03:17:58,879 --> 03:18:02,398
stairs so you would have had to hit it

4123
03:18:00,079 --> 03:18:02,398
down there

4124
03:18:06,840 --> 03:18:11,120
um

4125
03:18:08,318 --> 03:18:11,119
i think that's it

4126
03:18:17,760 --> 03:18:23,840
i think that's it

4127
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:36,799
maybe it could actually be a gameplay

4128
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:39,120
feature for the door moved to the house

4129
03:18:36,799 --> 03:18:51,840
i mean it could be but i doubt it

4130
03:18:39,120 --> 03:18:51,840
right like

4131
03:18:52,559 --> 03:18:56,159
when plopping down furniture props do

4132
03:18:54,318 --> 03:18:56,719
you want to allow for pattern variations

4133
03:18:56,159 --> 03:18:59,840
e

4134
03:18:56,719 --> 03:19:01,039
example desk above chair below desk lamp

4135
03:18:59,840 --> 03:19:02,478
on the right

4136
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:05,439
another pattern outside wall would

4137
03:19:02,478 --> 03:19:09,760
require completely different arrangement

4138
03:19:05,439 --> 03:19:12,318
um yeah i mean i would assume that

4139
03:19:09,760 --> 03:19:14,398
when we actually plan plop down

4140
03:19:12,318 --> 03:19:17,119
furniture we'll have some

4141
03:19:14,398 --> 03:19:18,079
decision about how we want to do that

4142
03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:19,600
but

4143
03:19:18,079 --> 03:19:22,079
at the moment i don't really care about

4144
03:19:19,600 --> 03:19:24,318
furniture so i just haven't bothered

4145
03:19:22,079 --> 03:19:24,318
right

4146
03:19:29,200 --> 03:19:33,040
can you explain why only one switch is

4147
03:19:30,879 --> 03:19:35,199
being added to room uh yeah so

4148
03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:37,279
the problem with the switches is just

4149
03:19:35,200 --> 03:19:38,960
that what we want to do is just look for

4150
03:19:37,279 --> 03:19:42,720
a pattern that we can play

4151
03:19:38,959 --> 03:19:44,879
that we can like sort of stamp down

4152
03:19:42,719 --> 03:19:47,438
and what's happening at the moment is

4153
03:19:44,879 --> 03:19:51,199
that those those switch patterns

4154
03:19:47,439 --> 03:19:54,398
um they they don't actually

4155
03:19:51,200 --> 03:19:57,680
take up any placement right

4156
03:19:54,398 --> 03:20:00,639
they don't you can walk on the switches

4157
03:19:57,680 --> 03:20:02,398
so when you say find random open tile it

4158
03:20:00,639 --> 03:20:03,840
always returns the same tile because

4159
03:20:02,398 --> 03:20:06,959
when you place this down

4160
03:20:03,840 --> 03:20:10,639
you don't actually occupy it

4161
03:20:06,959 --> 03:20:14,398
right so that's really it

4162
03:20:10,639 --> 03:20:17,039
that's the only reason and so we want to

4163
03:20:14,398 --> 03:20:18,719
actually go code this up next weekend

4164
03:20:17,040 --> 03:20:19,760
probably to like place down interesting

4165
03:20:18,719 --> 03:20:22,719
tile patterns

4166
03:20:19,760 --> 03:20:22,719
as a starting thing

4167
03:20:24,318 --> 03:20:26,398
you're talking about switching bodies

4168
03:20:25,279 --> 03:20:28,640
and switching heads would you be able to

4169
03:20:26,398 --> 03:20:29,920
switch to have a snake body

4170
03:20:28,639 --> 03:20:31,039
that would be pretty cool especially as

4171
03:20:29,920 --> 03:20:32,799
required to accomplish something later

4172
03:20:31,040 --> 03:20:33,359
in the game like using the snake body to

4173
03:20:32,799 --> 03:20:34,959
press down

4174
03:20:33,359 --> 03:20:36,880
on multiple adjacent buttons at the same

4175
03:20:34,959 --> 03:20:43,839
time

4176
03:20:36,879 --> 03:20:43,839
um so we

4177
03:20:46,959 --> 03:20:50,000
i guess the answer is i don't know i

4178
03:20:49,520 --> 03:20:52,640
mean

4179
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:55,600
i'm not a game designer so i don't know

4180
03:20:52,639 --> 03:20:58,000
but it seems like it would be fun

4181
03:20:55,600 --> 03:20:59,520
the problem is we don't have a really

4182
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:02,719
solid understanding of

4183
03:20:59,520 --> 03:21:04,159
what it would mean because you

4184
03:21:02,719 --> 03:21:05,760
like we don't really have a solid

4185
03:21:04,159 --> 03:21:09,279
understanding of what it means

4186
03:21:05,760 --> 03:21:11,279
to be able to swap heads

4187
03:21:09,279 --> 03:21:13,680
so you know we could come up with a game

4188
03:21:11,279 --> 03:21:15,840
design way that that works

4189
03:21:13,680 --> 03:21:17,359
and then yeah because like you can't

4190
03:21:15,840 --> 03:21:18,719
just swap heads with any arbitrary

4191
03:21:17,359 --> 03:21:19,920
monster otherwise then you don't have to

4192
03:21:18,719 --> 03:21:22,719
really fight the monster

4193
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:24,238
right i mean i guess you have to fight

4194
03:21:22,719 --> 03:21:26,639
your body

4195
03:21:24,238 --> 03:21:28,398
with that monster which might be hard if

4196
03:21:26,639 --> 03:21:30,478
you had a good

4197
03:21:28,398 --> 03:21:31,760
i i don't i don't know i don't know how

4198
03:21:30,478 --> 03:21:34,000
to

4199
03:21:31,760 --> 03:21:34,000
like

4200
03:21:34,879 --> 03:21:38,079
think about that but i think yeah if you

4201
03:21:37,439 --> 03:21:40,238
keep your

4202
03:21:38,079 --> 03:21:42,079
head and you can switch to certain

4203
03:21:40,238 --> 03:21:45,119
monsters like maybe

4204
03:21:42,079 --> 03:21:48,478
maybe monsters before they

4205
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:50,800
die or something before they disappear

4206
03:21:48,478 --> 03:21:53,199
if you beat them they're in a dazed

4207
03:21:50,799 --> 03:21:57,358
state temporarily where you can swap

4208
03:21:53,200 --> 03:21:59,279
to their body instead of yours

4209
03:21:57,359 --> 03:22:01,680
for a limited amount of time i don't

4210
03:21:59,279 --> 03:22:04,399
know like sure we can try it

4211
03:22:01,680 --> 03:22:04,398
but i don't know

4212
03:22:04,959 --> 03:22:08,719
will you add normal maps to sprites for

4213
03:22:06,879 --> 03:22:11,920
lighting effects

4214
03:22:08,719 --> 03:22:12,879
um probably not because

4215
03:22:11,920 --> 03:22:20,879
i don't know where i would get the

4216
03:22:12,879 --> 03:22:22,079
normal maps from right

4217
03:22:20,879 --> 03:22:23,920
are you interested for it to be a mix of

4218
03:22:22,079 --> 03:22:26,959
hand authored rooms oh yeah

4219
03:22:23,920 --> 03:22:27,760
i i probably want there to be some hand

4220
03:22:26,959 --> 03:22:29,839
authoring

4221
03:22:27,760 --> 03:22:31,120
and gender like it's there wouldn't be

4222
03:22:29,840 --> 03:22:33,040
like hand authoring like

4223
03:22:31,120 --> 03:22:34,560
where we specifically create a room but

4224
03:22:33,040 --> 03:22:37,520
we're going to create i think

4225
03:22:34,559 --> 03:22:39,199
generators that are fairly specific so

4226
03:22:37,520 --> 03:22:49,840
it's kind of hand authored

4227
03:22:39,200 --> 03:22:49,840
with a limited amount of stuff right

4228
03:22:52,079 --> 03:22:56,639
oh gameplay-wise no the gameplay-wise is

4229
03:22:54,398 --> 03:22:58,799
that the tiles you hop on the tiles

4230
03:22:56,639 --> 03:22:59,840
while fighting the monsters so it gives

4231
03:22:58,799 --> 03:23:01,119
you something constructive you have to

4232
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:03,120
do in the room

4233
03:23:01,120 --> 03:23:04,640
it's not about trying to get monsters to

4234
03:23:03,120 --> 03:23:07,120
jump on them

4235
03:23:04,639 --> 03:23:08,959
there probably will be some things like

4236
03:23:07,120 --> 03:23:10,479
that in the game because why not but

4237
03:23:08,959 --> 03:23:12,719
that's not like the main

4238
03:23:10,478 --> 03:23:14,478
thing you would do the main thing you do

4239
03:23:12,719 --> 03:23:17,358
is try to hop on the tiles yourself

4240
03:23:14,478 --> 03:23:18,559
while fighting

4241
03:23:17,359 --> 03:23:19,680
i've heard you say before it you don't

4242
03:23:18,559 --> 03:23:21,039
believe it's good or necessary to know

4243
03:23:19,680 --> 03:23:22,238
many programming languages because in

4244
03:23:21,040 --> 03:23:23,359
your words program it works from first

4245
03:23:22,238 --> 03:23:24,879
principles

4246
03:23:23,359 --> 03:23:26,000
i do hear all the time though that you

4247
03:23:24,879 --> 03:23:27,199
shouldn't be married to your programming

4248
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:31,840
language and you should always use the

4249
03:23:27,200 --> 03:23:31,840
best science to the problem

4250
03:23:32,719 --> 03:23:37,679
um i would say i just i mean i say i

4251
03:23:35,520 --> 03:23:42,238
don't disagree with that actually

4252
03:23:37,680 --> 03:23:44,559
um what i would say is that

4253
03:23:42,238 --> 03:23:46,398
programming is basically the same no

4254
03:23:44,559 --> 03:23:49,278
matter what language you do it in

4255
03:23:46,398 --> 03:23:50,799
the mental process is and understanding

4256
03:23:49,279 --> 03:23:52,319
what the computer does is all you really

4257
03:23:50,799 --> 03:23:55,519
need to know

4258
03:23:52,318 --> 03:23:57,119
so most of the time

4259
03:23:55,520 --> 03:23:58,720
it really doesn't matter what language

4260
03:23:57,120 --> 03:24:00,479
you use in my opinion

4261
03:23:58,719 --> 03:24:03,278
as long as that language isn't like

4262
03:24:00,478 --> 03:24:06,398
really um

4263
03:24:03,279 --> 03:24:08,238
hamstrung so like you know i wouldn't

4264
03:24:06,398 --> 03:24:09,199
program in javascript most of the time

4265
03:24:08,238 --> 03:24:11,199
because

4266
03:24:09,200 --> 03:24:12,399
you can't really do much with it it

4267
03:24:11,200 --> 03:24:14,960
doesn't really work

4268
03:24:12,398 --> 03:24:16,318
like you can't really do threading and

4269
03:24:14,959 --> 03:24:18,799
you can't really do

4270
03:24:16,318 --> 03:24:19,920
cmd very well like like you just can't

4271
03:24:18,799 --> 03:24:21,278
really use it

4272
03:24:19,920 --> 03:24:23,120
it forces you to go through a garbage

4273
03:24:21,279 --> 03:24:25,040
collector you don't have a choice

4274
03:24:23,120 --> 03:24:27,040
so like you know there's some languages

4275
03:24:25,040 --> 03:24:30,399
like javascript that you just never use

4276
03:24:27,040 --> 03:24:30,399
unless you have to right

4277
03:24:30,478 --> 03:24:35,278
but other than that

4278
03:24:33,520 --> 03:24:37,200
as long as you know a language that's

4279
03:24:35,279 --> 03:24:38,238
fairly capable that you can do most

4280
03:24:37,200 --> 03:24:42,399
things with

4281
03:24:38,238 --> 03:24:43,119
you know c d rust now seems okay

4282
03:24:42,398 --> 03:24:44,318
probably

4283
03:24:43,120 --> 03:24:47,439
although i haven't actually verified

4284
03:24:44,318 --> 03:24:49,760
that myself um

4285
03:24:47,439 --> 03:24:51,439
you know java probably not because it's

4286
03:24:49,760 --> 03:24:53,359
kind of limited like java is kind of

4287
03:24:51,439 --> 03:24:55,040
like javascript in some ways it's it's

4288
03:24:53,359 --> 03:24:56,640
not very good

4289
03:24:55,040 --> 03:24:58,080
at letting you express things like

4290
03:24:56,639 --> 03:25:01,039
probably not python

4291
03:24:58,079 --> 03:25:02,398
again very limited um in what it can

4292
03:25:01,040 --> 03:25:04,080
express

4293
03:25:02,398 --> 03:25:05,439
so there are some languages that i would

4294
03:25:04,079 --> 03:25:08,318
probably stay away from because

4295
03:25:05,439 --> 03:25:09,920
you're very limited if you use them but

4296
03:25:08,318 --> 03:25:11,600
any language that's like generally

4297
03:25:09,920 --> 03:25:14,639
capable

4298
03:25:11,600 --> 03:25:18,880
um it doesn't really matter

4299
03:25:14,639 --> 03:25:23,519
which one you're using right um so

4300
03:25:18,879 --> 03:25:25,199
so i would say i kind of agree

4301
03:25:23,520 --> 03:25:26,960
where i might disagree with the people

4302
03:25:25,200 --> 03:25:28,720
that you're talking about

4303
03:25:26,959 --> 03:25:30,959
is that they think there's these huge

4304
03:25:28,719 --> 03:25:33,679
differences between how good it is to

4305
03:25:30,959 --> 03:25:36,318
program in language a versus b

4306
03:25:33,680 --> 03:25:39,279
and i think they're wrong about that i

4307
03:25:36,318 --> 03:25:41,600
think they drastically overestimate

4308
03:25:39,279 --> 03:25:43,279
the actual benefits you get from these

4309
03:25:41,600 --> 03:25:45,359
different languages

4310
03:25:43,279 --> 03:25:47,359
which is not to say that i don't think

4311
03:25:45,359 --> 03:25:50,720
there could be languages

4312
03:25:47,359 --> 03:25:52,800
that were like so good that

4313
03:25:50,719 --> 03:25:54,799
you really do get a huge benefit program

4314
03:25:52,799 --> 03:25:56,398
i think in the future we'll have those

4315
03:25:54,799 --> 03:25:58,238
right now like people who think that

4316
03:25:56,398 --> 03:26:00,318
like python is way better than

4317
03:25:58,238 --> 03:26:02,799
you know c sharp or something it just

4318
03:26:00,318 --> 03:26:02,799
it's like

4319
03:26:02,959 --> 03:26:06,799
they're just kind of delusional you know

4320
03:26:05,279 --> 03:26:10,800
as to thinking about

4321
03:26:06,799 --> 03:26:12,398
what they've never done any measurements

4322
03:26:10,799 --> 03:26:13,199
to prove that i think is usually what i

4323
03:26:12,398 --> 03:26:19,840
would say

4324
03:26:13,200 --> 03:26:19,840
because it's just not true

4325
03:26:29,680 --> 03:26:32,479
do you find it hard to design the engine

4326
03:26:31,120 --> 03:26:34,720
without the concrete requirements of a

4327
03:26:32,478 --> 03:26:38,159
civic game design

4328
03:26:34,719 --> 03:26:39,920
not really um

4329
03:26:38,159 --> 03:26:41,600
you know engine code is engine code it

4330
03:26:39,920 --> 03:26:43,359
needs to be flexible

4331
03:26:41,600 --> 03:26:44,960
because even if you think you know the

4332
03:26:43,359 --> 03:26:46,880
game design it always changes so you

4333
03:26:44,959 --> 03:26:48,959
can't really

4334
03:26:46,879 --> 03:26:52,159
you know you can't really hard code

4335
03:26:48,959 --> 03:26:52,159
stuff that way anyway

4336
03:26:55,439 --> 03:27:02,238
starco galaxies were shooting for may

4337
03:26:59,120 --> 03:27:04,319
so starco galaxy hopefully will be out

4338
03:27:02,238 --> 03:27:07,279
the very early versions of it will be

4339
03:27:04,318 --> 03:27:07,278
out sometime in may

4340
03:27:08,238 --> 03:27:12,879
is the hope definitely by june something

4341
03:27:11,520 --> 03:27:14,479
will be shipped

4342
03:27:12,879 --> 03:27:17,438
but it's very early so it will be

4343
03:27:14,478 --> 03:27:21,199
updated substantially

4344
03:27:17,439 --> 03:27:22,800
um after that so that's

4345
03:27:21,200 --> 03:27:24,399
it won't be anywhere close to final

4346
03:27:22,799 --> 03:27:26,000
that'll be like the earliest of early

4347
03:27:24,398 --> 03:27:28,719
access for people who want to start in

4348
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:28,719
the beginner's stuff

4349
03:27:29,520 --> 03:27:31,760
so

4350
03:27:39,680 --> 03:27:42,720
how do you avoid overcomplication i

4351
03:27:41,200 --> 03:27:45,120
don't i don't over

4352
03:27:42,719 --> 03:27:45,920
avoid it you watched that today what i

4353
03:27:45,120 --> 03:27:48,010
do is

4354
03:27:45,920 --> 03:27:49,200
as when it gets over complicated we then

4355
03:27:48,010 --> 03:27:52,398
[Music]

4356
03:27:49,200 --> 03:27:57,600
we then work on condensing it right

4357
03:27:52,398 --> 03:27:59,199
like it

4358
03:27:57,600 --> 03:28:01,279
not putting in things that you don't

4359
03:27:59,200 --> 03:28:02,560
need you know you you always want to be

4360
03:28:01,279 --> 03:28:04,079
sensible when you're programming but

4361
03:28:02,559 --> 03:28:05,439
you're always going to make mistakes

4362
03:28:04,079 --> 03:28:06,879
about thinking something should go one

4363
03:28:05,439 --> 03:28:08,079
way and you start going and you realize

4364
03:28:06,879 --> 03:28:10,398
it's just too unwieldy

4365
03:28:08,079 --> 03:28:12,000
just stop condense it right like when

4366
03:28:10,398 --> 03:28:12,719
you see it happening just condense it

4367
03:28:12,000 --> 03:28:16,959
it's

4368
03:28:12,719 --> 03:28:21,679
nobody knows like

4369
03:28:16,959 --> 03:28:23,599
the um nobody knows

4370
03:28:21,680 --> 03:28:26,559
ahead of time the right architecture

4371
03:28:23,600 --> 03:28:29,680
ever unless they've already done it

4372
03:28:26,559 --> 03:28:31,278
and so you don't really want to come at

4373
03:28:29,680 --> 03:28:32,559
it from the standpoint of how do i not

4374
03:28:31,279 --> 03:28:33,920
over complicate my code

4375
03:28:32,559 --> 03:28:36,238
you want to come out from the standpoint

4376
03:28:33,920 --> 03:28:38,238
of how do i identify complexity that

4377
03:28:36,238 --> 03:28:39,680
doesn't need to be there and remove it

4378
03:28:38,238 --> 03:28:41,840
and again it's like what we were doing

4379
03:28:39,680 --> 03:28:43,680
today it's like oh why are we storing

4380
03:28:41,840 --> 03:28:45,359
all this stuff only to unpack it later

4381
03:28:43,680 --> 03:28:46,479
like can we just condense that down and

4382
03:28:45,359 --> 03:28:48,079
do it directly

4383
03:28:46,478 --> 03:28:49,679
can we move that stuff closer to where

4384
03:28:48,079 --> 03:28:51,039
it's actually happening you're

4385
03:28:49,680 --> 03:28:52,639
asking yourself questions like that all

4386
03:28:51,040 --> 03:28:53,439
the time and when you see opportunities

4387
03:28:52,639 --> 03:28:56,079
you take them

4388
03:28:53,439 --> 03:28:57,840
and over time that compacts the code

4389
03:28:56,079 --> 03:29:00,559
back down to something usable

4390
03:28:57,840 --> 03:29:01,920
when you've done something wrong you

4391
03:29:00,559 --> 03:29:05,039
know what i mean

4392
03:29:01,920 --> 03:29:06,079
so it's it's usually less about not

4393
03:29:05,040 --> 03:29:08,080
making mistakes because

4394
03:29:06,079 --> 03:29:09,200
everyone makes mistakes no matter how

4395
03:29:08,079 --> 03:29:10,318
good you get you're going to over

4396
03:29:09,200 --> 03:29:13,200
complicate your code

4397
03:29:10,318 --> 03:29:16,000
sometimes so the important part is to

4398
03:29:13,200 --> 03:29:19,680
recognize when it's got over complicated

4399
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:22,398
and then condense back down right

4400
03:29:19,680 --> 03:29:23,359
pull out that complexity find better

4401
03:29:22,398 --> 03:29:26,398
ways to like

4402
03:29:23,359 --> 03:29:35,840
you know attack that complexity

4403
03:29:26,398 --> 03:29:35,840
when you see it happening

4404
03:29:38,559 --> 03:29:42,559
if i like a low level language like c

4405
03:29:40,639 --> 03:29:43,119
but a syntax feature like member

4406
03:29:42,559 --> 03:29:47,359
function

4407
03:29:43,120 --> 03:29:49,279
what's the solution well i mean

4408
03:29:47,359 --> 03:29:50,720
for the literal thing you just said the

4409
03:29:49,279 --> 03:29:54,399
solution is c plus plus

4410
03:29:50,719 --> 03:29:57,519
because you can take c and

4411
03:29:54,398 --> 03:29:59,039
just program and c exclusively and then

4412
03:29:57,520 --> 03:30:03,840
when you want member functions you just

4413
03:29:59,040 --> 03:30:03,840
use them right

4414
03:30:14,840 --> 03:30:18,398
so

4415
03:30:16,879 --> 03:30:20,000
you need a feature that doesn't exist

4416
03:30:18,398 --> 03:30:21,519
yeah i mean meta program is really your

4417
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:23,120
only choice

4418
03:30:21,520 --> 03:30:25,120
right because if the feature doesn't

4419
03:30:23,120 --> 03:30:26,720
exist in the language that you're using

4420
03:30:25,120 --> 03:30:28,239
you know you've got to figure out a way

4421
03:30:26,719 --> 03:30:31,679
to implement it yourself right

4422
03:30:28,238 --> 03:30:33,680
if that's what you want you know ideally

4423
03:30:31,680 --> 03:30:35,520
ideally you luck out and there's a

4424
03:30:33,680 --> 03:30:36,159
language that has the feature set that

4425
03:30:35,520 --> 03:30:38,000
you want

4426
03:30:36,159 --> 03:30:39,520
but you know it's true that a lot of

4427
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:41,439
times these days most languages don't

4428
03:30:39,520 --> 03:30:45,520
have most features you would want so

4429
03:30:41,439 --> 03:30:47,120
you're usually left unhappy because

4430
03:30:45,520 --> 03:30:48,720
you know you have to make compromises

4431
03:30:47,120 --> 03:30:50,640
that's just programming someday we'll

4432
03:30:48,719 --> 03:30:52,959
have better languages hopefully

4433
03:30:50,639 --> 03:30:52,959
you know

4434
03:30:56,799 --> 03:31:00,799
if you have questions about star code

4435
03:30:58,238 --> 03:31:04,238
galaxy um i would highly recommend

4436
03:31:00,799 --> 03:31:08,799
just going to the discord um

4437
03:31:04,238 --> 03:31:12,079
so this this right here um

4438
03:31:08,799 --> 03:31:15,519
discord.com invite molly rocket just

4439
03:31:12,079 --> 03:31:19,439
just go to this discord

4440
03:31:15,520 --> 03:31:21,439
um and there's a star code galaxy forum

4441
03:31:19,439 --> 03:31:25,200
it's got pinned messages that have

4442
03:31:21,439 --> 03:31:41,840
stuff like that um

4443
03:31:25,200 --> 03:31:41,840
so you know

4444
03:31:50,318 --> 03:31:54,000
when someone notes slash slash to do

4445
03:31:52,159 --> 03:31:57,680
casey does that means to do casey

4446
03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:59,680
noted or to do four cases to do um

4447
03:31:57,680 --> 03:32:00,960
so i don't think there's a standard for

4448
03:31:59,680 --> 03:32:04,639
that

4449
03:32:00,959 --> 03:32:06,879
so i don't know but

4450
03:32:04,639 --> 03:32:08,159
everywhere i've ever done anything like

4451
03:32:06,879 --> 03:32:10,959
that

4452
03:32:08,159 --> 03:32:11,279
and the people that i see who do it we

4453
03:32:10,959 --> 03:32:13,599
all

4454
03:32:11,279 --> 03:32:14,640
tend to mean that it's something we

4455
03:32:13,600 --> 03:32:17,920
noted

4456
03:32:14,639 --> 03:32:21,358
so it's not assigning someone a task

4457
03:32:17,920 --> 03:32:24,398
it's saying casey thought this

4458
03:32:21,359 --> 03:32:25,520
right and then someone else knows

4459
03:32:24,398 --> 03:32:27,358
when they look at that to do they're

4460
03:32:25,520 --> 03:32:28,079
like oh casey thought this should be

4461
03:32:27,359 --> 03:32:30,640
fixed

4462
03:32:28,079 --> 03:32:32,318
they don't think casey's going to fix it

4463
03:32:30,639 --> 03:32:34,079
now probably if casey thought it should

4464
03:32:32,318 --> 03:32:35,760
be fixed casey is going to fix it

4465
03:32:34,079 --> 03:32:38,799
because he's the one who wanted it fixed

4466
03:32:35,760 --> 03:32:41,200
but that's not usually the implication

4467
03:32:38,799 --> 03:32:41,199
i think

4468
03:32:46,318 --> 03:32:49,439
um following up on the question about

4469
03:32:48,318 --> 03:32:50,879
programming languages a lot of people

4470
03:32:49,439 --> 03:32:52,720
seem to think that dynamic languages are

4471
03:32:50,879 --> 03:32:53,920
way more expressive than non-dynamic

4472
03:32:52,719 --> 03:32:55,760
ones in the sense that you can

4473
03:32:53,920 --> 03:32:57,279
accomplish a lot with very little code

4474
03:32:55,760 --> 03:32:58,478
when you say these languages are limited

4475
03:32:57,279 --> 03:32:58,880
do you mostly mean they don't allow you

4476
03:32:58,478 --> 03:33:01,760
to

4477
03:32:58,879 --> 03:33:02,879
okay so so that's nonsense it's just

4478
03:33:01,760 --> 03:33:05,279
complete nonsense

4479
03:33:02,879 --> 03:33:05,920
uh people who think that that you know

4480
03:33:05,279 --> 03:33:07,120
dynamic

4481
03:33:05,920 --> 03:33:08,879
languages are more expressed in

4482
03:33:07,120 --> 03:33:10,160
non-dynamic languages and accomplishing

4483
03:33:08,879 --> 03:33:13,119
a lot of code they're they're just

4484
03:33:10,159 --> 03:33:14,000
you know completely wrong it's full stop

4485
03:33:13,120 --> 03:33:17,439
and

4486
03:33:14,000 --> 03:33:19,920
um you know the

4487
03:33:17,439 --> 03:33:21,120
the reason they think that is because

4488
03:33:19,920 --> 03:33:22,960
they've never actually looked at how

4489
03:33:21,120 --> 03:33:26,479
much code they are i mean

4490
03:33:22,959 --> 03:33:29,519
ask yourself a very simple question

4491
03:33:26,478 --> 03:33:33,840
if i go

4492
03:33:29,520 --> 03:33:35,840
somewhere on the internet okay

4493
03:33:33,840 --> 03:33:37,200
ask yourself how much code it would take

4494
03:33:35,840 --> 03:33:38,880
to produce this in c

4495
03:33:37,200 --> 03:33:40,560
assuming that you're using some kind of

4496
03:33:38,879 --> 03:33:43,759
render library or something

4497
03:33:40,559 --> 03:33:45,600
you know um because

4498
03:33:43,760 --> 03:33:47,279
presumably you know or even if you had

4499
03:33:45,600 --> 03:33:49,760
to implement opengl yourself

4500
03:33:47,279 --> 03:33:51,920
and the message loop and everything it'd

4501
03:33:49,760 --> 03:33:55,600
be like a couple thousand lines of code

4502
03:33:51,920 --> 03:33:58,719
right well if i actually go

4503
03:33:55,600 --> 03:34:01,680
uh in here you know and

4504
03:33:58,719 --> 03:34:03,679
we look at sources and we say like well

4505
03:34:01,680 --> 03:34:05,439
all right well where's all the code like

4506
03:34:03,680 --> 03:34:08,639
let's take a look

4507
03:34:05,439 --> 03:34:12,559
at all the code that's in here

4508
03:34:08,639 --> 03:34:14,398
right this is a dynamic language

4509
03:34:12,559 --> 03:34:16,398
and it's not only a dynamic language but

4510
03:34:14,398 --> 03:34:19,920
it's a dynamic language that like

4511
03:34:16,398 --> 03:34:22,318
was used as an output format right

4512
03:34:19,920 --> 03:34:23,920
i'm sorry i haven't looked at facebook's

4513
03:34:22,318 --> 03:34:25,199
javascript code in a while i'm also not

4514
03:34:23,920 --> 03:34:29,200
familiar with how to do this in

4515
03:34:25,200 --> 03:34:33,279
edge but i just want to pull up some

4516
03:34:29,200 --> 03:34:37,439
some code right uh that's in here

4517
03:34:33,279 --> 03:34:37,439
i suppose i also need to go to an actual

4518
03:34:38,959 --> 03:34:41,839
i suppose i probably should look i mean

4519
03:34:40,478 --> 03:34:43,119
you look at how much stuff is in here

4520
03:34:41,840 --> 03:34:44,000
but this is all stuff that they

4521
03:34:43,120 --> 03:34:45,760
generated so

4522
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:48,398
it's probably not as useful because it's

4523
03:34:45,760 --> 03:34:51,680
tons of tiny little files

4524
03:34:48,398 --> 03:34:53,599
um let me take somebody who maybe didn't

4525
03:34:51,680 --> 03:34:55,040
compress their stuff or maybe shipped it

4526
03:34:53,600 --> 03:34:57,040
more directly

4527
03:34:55,040 --> 03:34:59,520
i don't know let's see if we can find

4528
03:34:57,040 --> 03:34:59,520
somebody

4529
03:35:06,398 --> 03:35:14,318
so let's take a look at

4530
03:35:11,279 --> 03:35:15,920
you know i mean you know i can't even

4531
03:35:14,318 --> 03:35:17,119
really

4532
03:35:15,920 --> 03:35:19,359
assess it because it's all been

4533
03:35:17,120 --> 03:35:20,319
compressed down i can't even look at how

4534
03:35:19,359 --> 03:35:23,040
big it actually

4535
03:35:20,318 --> 03:35:24,000
is because they you know in the old days

4536
03:35:23,040 --> 03:35:25,920
it used to be easier

4537
03:35:24,000 --> 03:35:27,120
to take a look at some of this stuff

4538
03:35:25,920 --> 03:35:29,840
because they don't

4539
03:35:27,120 --> 03:35:31,600
uh smush it all down like this so it's a

4540
03:35:29,840 --> 03:35:35,840
little bit harder to see

4541
03:35:31,600 --> 03:35:38,720
but just look at this

4542
03:35:35,840 --> 03:35:41,279
there are literally like thousands and

4543
03:35:38,719 --> 03:35:46,000
thousands of lines of smushed down code

4544
03:35:41,279 --> 03:35:50,840
in this website and it all it has

4545
03:35:46,000 --> 03:35:53,680
is this it's two buttons

4546
03:35:50,840 --> 03:35:54,960
right um

4547
03:35:53,680 --> 03:35:56,238
yeah i should look for you're right i

4548
03:35:54,959 --> 03:36:00,238
should you know what someone just

4549
03:35:56,238 --> 03:36:00,238
mentioned the chat use the pretty print

4550
03:36:02,318 --> 03:36:08,799
so that's a very good idea thank you so

4551
03:36:05,439 --> 03:36:12,159
look at the code there is

4552
03:36:08,799 --> 03:36:15,358
thousands and thousands of lines of code

4553
03:36:12,159 --> 03:36:15,359
and this is what they got

4554
03:36:16,159 --> 03:36:22,719
so i mean if this were

4555
03:36:19,680 --> 03:36:23,840
20 lines of code in javascript i'd agree

4556
03:36:22,719 --> 03:36:27,199
with you

4557
03:36:23,840 --> 03:36:29,120
and to a certain extent i'm

4558
03:36:27,200 --> 03:36:31,120
i'm beating up on them a little unfairly

4559
03:36:29,120 --> 03:36:32,880
because i could probably do this

4560
03:36:31,120 --> 03:36:34,399
in you know a couple hundred lines of

4561
03:36:32,879 --> 03:36:37,278
javascript code

4562
03:36:34,398 --> 03:36:38,318
soup to nuts actually as a library that

4563
03:36:37,279 --> 03:36:41,680
worked or whatever

4564
03:36:38,318 --> 03:36:43,920
right but

4565
03:36:41,680 --> 03:36:45,359
if you look at how these people actually

4566
03:36:43,920 --> 03:36:49,760
ship code

4567
03:36:45,359 --> 03:36:52,960
before they can ever make that statement

4568
03:36:49,760 --> 03:36:54,639
where they have to be like look at how

4569
03:36:52,959 --> 03:36:56,639
easy it is to program diamond clearance

4570
03:36:54,639 --> 03:36:58,559
everything they ship should be trivial

4571
03:36:56,639 --> 03:37:00,318
it should be like 50 lines of code for

4572
03:36:58,559 --> 03:37:03,600
everything for the like you know

4573
03:37:00,318 --> 03:37:05,519
for the stupid ad cookie for the

4574
03:37:03,600 --> 03:37:06,800
you know the button layout whatever if

4575
03:37:05,520 --> 03:37:07,439
these languages were so much more

4576
03:37:06,799 --> 03:37:09,199
powerful

4577
03:37:07,439 --> 03:37:12,880
why are they thousands and thousands of

4578
03:37:09,200 --> 03:37:17,439
lines of code to do almost nothing

4579
03:37:12,879 --> 03:37:20,079
right so and the answer is because

4580
03:37:17,439 --> 03:37:20,880
no like architecture is what determines

4581
03:37:20,079 --> 03:37:23,200
how few code

4582
03:37:20,879 --> 03:37:24,159
lines you have it's not the language

4583
03:37:23,200 --> 03:37:26,239
really

4584
03:37:24,159 --> 03:37:27,760
and the architectures that they choose

4585
03:37:26,238 --> 03:37:29,840
are so bad you know

4586
03:37:27,760 --> 03:37:31,520
you end up with things like you know

4587
03:37:29,840 --> 03:37:33,439
that this page is probably made in you

4588
03:37:31,520 --> 03:37:36,079
know angular react.js or

4589
03:37:33,439 --> 03:37:38,079
one of these things and it's like yeah

4590
03:37:36,079 --> 03:37:39,920
here's you know 50 000 lines of code

4591
03:37:38,079 --> 03:37:41,600
that we just shove down your face and

4592
03:37:39,920 --> 03:37:42,840
all it can do is like put up a couple

4593
03:37:41,600 --> 03:37:45,520
buttons or something

4594
03:37:42,840 --> 03:37:46,238
right and then they're like well we

4595
03:37:45,520 --> 03:37:48,079
program in

4596
03:37:46,238 --> 03:37:50,079
dynamic languages because look at how

4597
03:37:48,079 --> 03:37:51,920
convenient and easy they are and there's

4598
03:37:50,079 --> 03:37:54,478
so many cuz like no they're not

4599
03:37:51,920 --> 03:37:55,200
it's this huge like debugging these

4600
03:37:54,478 --> 03:37:57,039
things

4601
03:37:55,200 --> 03:38:00,319
must take forever trying to find out

4602
03:37:57,040 --> 03:38:00,319
what's going on right

4603
03:38:00,559 --> 03:38:08,000
and so in general

4604
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:10,559
it's how sensible you code is how

4605
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:11,439
concise the code is you can write a c

4606
03:38:10,559 --> 03:38:14,079
program

4607
03:38:11,439 --> 03:38:15,200
that does a lot of stuff in a thousand

4608
03:38:14,079 --> 03:38:16,879
lines of code

4609
03:38:15,200 --> 03:38:18,479
you can write a javascript program that

4610
03:38:16,879 --> 03:38:20,079
does a lot of stuff in a thousand lines

4611
03:38:18,478 --> 03:38:22,639
of code

4612
03:38:20,079 --> 03:38:24,559
the people who sit around saying stuff

4613
03:38:22,639 --> 03:38:27,278
like javascript is

4614
03:38:24,559 --> 03:38:30,159
takes less lines of code to do stuff

4615
03:38:27,279 --> 03:38:30,159
where's the proof

4616
03:38:30,238 --> 03:38:33,520
where is the proof that they're doing so

4617
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:36,719
much with so little because they

4618
03:38:33,520 --> 03:38:39,760
always seem to take drastically more

4619
03:38:36,719 --> 03:38:40,000
to do drastically less so i think people

4620
03:38:39,760 --> 03:38:43,760
should

4621
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:45,920
stop making claims without metrics

4622
03:38:43,760 --> 03:38:47,840
you want to claim that javascript like

4623
03:38:45,920 --> 03:38:48,799
languages let you be much more compact

4624
03:38:47,840 --> 03:38:50,960
than c

4625
03:38:48,799 --> 03:38:52,398
show me this web page in less than like

4626
03:38:50,959 --> 03:38:55,839
50 000 lines of code or whatever the

4627
03:38:52,398 --> 03:38:55,840
hell it's doing right now right

4628
03:38:59,680 --> 03:39:03,040
so i mean and it gets tiresome because

4629
03:39:01,520 --> 03:39:04,399
it's like you know people have these

4630
03:39:03,040 --> 03:39:06,399
arguments but what are they arguing

4631
03:39:04,398 --> 03:39:07,358
about they have nothing they have no leg

4632
03:39:06,398 --> 03:39:09,519
to stand on

4633
03:39:07,359 --> 03:39:11,279
their stuff is terrible it's slow it's

4634
03:39:09,520 --> 03:39:13,920
buggy it's bloated

4635
03:39:11,279 --> 03:39:15,520
and it takes tens of thousands of lines

4636
03:39:13,920 --> 03:39:17,120
of code to do simple things

4637
03:39:15,520 --> 03:39:18,800
they shouldn't be saying anything they

4638
03:39:17,120 --> 03:39:20,160
should be saying the only thing that

4639
03:39:18,799 --> 03:39:20,840
people who ship stuff like this should

4640
03:39:20,159 --> 03:39:23,760
be saying

4641
03:39:20,840 --> 03:39:24,719
is we have a lot to learn that's what

4642
03:39:23,760 --> 03:39:26,800
they should be saying

4643
03:39:24,719 --> 03:39:28,398
right they should never be advocating

4644
03:39:26,799 --> 03:39:37,840
for anything that they're doing

4645
03:39:28,398 --> 03:39:37,840
because it's obviously not good right

4646
03:39:40,318 --> 03:39:44,159
yeah i'm sorry is another thing they

4647
03:39:41,840 --> 03:39:46,719
could say

4648
03:39:44,159 --> 03:39:47,359
but you should do x or this is better

4649
03:39:46,719 --> 03:39:49,119
than c

4650
03:39:47,359 --> 03:39:50,559
is a stupid thing to say because

4651
03:39:49,120 --> 03:39:53,040
obviously it's not

4652
03:39:50,559 --> 03:39:53,760
like you know you obviously didn't

4653
03:39:53,040 --> 03:39:55,279
succeed

4654
03:39:53,760 --> 03:39:57,359
in whatever the thing is that you said

4655
03:39:55,279 --> 03:40:01,279
you were doing you failed

4656
03:39:57,359 --> 03:40:03,120
so maybe maybe it is true

4657
03:40:01,279 --> 03:40:04,960
that javascript is better than c for

4658
03:40:03,120 --> 03:40:07,439
something right

4659
03:40:04,959 --> 03:40:08,799
but you didn't demonstrate that so you

4660
03:40:07,439 --> 03:40:10,960
should stop

4661
03:40:08,799 --> 03:40:12,079
talking like that until you actually go

4662
03:40:10,959 --> 03:40:15,119
figure it out

4663
03:40:12,079 --> 03:40:16,159
your intuition is worthless because this

4664
03:40:15,120 --> 03:40:19,840
is what we got

4665
03:40:16,159 --> 03:40:19,840
right so

4666
03:40:20,159 --> 03:40:23,199
you know put up or shut up is another

4667
03:40:22,079 --> 03:40:25,920
way to say it like

4668
03:40:23,199 --> 03:40:27,040
you want to make big claims like dynamic

4669
03:40:25,920 --> 03:40:28,000
languages are better than static

4670
03:40:27,040 --> 03:40:31,279
languages

4671
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:32,879
show me right

4672
03:40:31,279 --> 03:40:34,640
you should be if it's so obvious it

4673
03:40:32,879 --> 03:40:36,719
should be easy to prove and this

4674
03:40:34,639 --> 03:40:38,159
is the opposite this proves the opposite

4675
03:40:36,719 --> 03:40:40,478
if anything right

4676
03:40:38,159 --> 03:40:41,199
so you're starting from you got to go

4677
03:40:40,478 --> 03:40:44,639
uphill

4678
03:40:41,199 --> 03:40:46,239
you're shipping real crappy stuff so

4679
03:40:44,639 --> 03:40:47,760
if you want to make claims that there's

4680
03:40:46,238 --> 03:40:50,959
something better about it

4681
03:40:47,760 --> 03:40:53,600
the burden's on you because your output

4682
03:40:50,959 --> 03:40:55,438
sucks right like what you're what you're

4683
03:40:53,600 --> 03:40:58,318
accomplishing is terrible

4684
03:40:55,439 --> 03:40:59,840
so you need to you've got you need to

4685
03:40:58,318 --> 03:41:02,478
start making excuses for yourself

4686
03:40:59,840 --> 03:41:03,920
not claiming that somehow other people

4687
03:41:02,478 --> 03:41:05,438
are making bad choices

4688
03:41:03,920 --> 03:41:07,199
because because it looks like you're the

4689
03:41:05,439 --> 03:41:09,760
one who's making the bad choices right

4690
03:41:07,199 --> 03:41:11,279
so you should start from a place of like

4691
03:41:09,760 --> 03:41:14,159
if you want to explain that away

4692
03:41:11,279 --> 03:41:14,560
go ahead explain it away for me right um

4693
03:41:14,159 --> 03:41:16,000
but

4694
03:41:14,559 --> 03:41:17,840
you know you got to do it with metrics

4695
03:41:16,000 --> 03:41:19,439
you got to prove that what you're saying

4696
03:41:17,840 --> 03:41:20,159
is not hand waving that you're really

4697
03:41:19,439 --> 03:41:29,840
right

4698
03:41:20,159 --> 03:41:29,840
you know

4699
03:41:37,520 --> 03:41:41,600
500 it took me 400 lines of code to

4700
03:41:40,318 --> 03:41:42,000
write a 2d plotting calculator in

4701
03:41:41,600 --> 03:41:43,680
javascript

4702
03:41:42,000 --> 03:41:45,439
i don't know why it takes so much for a

4703
03:41:43,680 --> 03:41:47,920
simple crud website though

4704
03:41:45,439 --> 03:41:49,840
yeah i mean and like um the starco

4705
03:41:47,920 --> 03:41:52,478
galaxy front end is web front end

4706
03:41:49,840 --> 03:41:54,238
so that's written in javascript and it's

4707
03:41:52,478 --> 03:41:55,840
you know i use the same principles i use

4708
03:41:54,238 --> 03:41:58,079
when i'm programming c and it's very

4709
03:41:55,840 --> 03:42:00,880
small compact and very reliable

4710
03:41:58,079 --> 03:42:02,719
unlike the web pages i use which is why

4711
03:42:00,879 --> 03:42:05,839
i say i think

4712
03:42:02,719 --> 03:42:08,799
how much utility how much reliability

4713
03:42:05,840 --> 03:42:09,520
you get out of a piece of code is almost

4714
03:42:08,799 --> 03:42:12,478
always about

4715
03:42:09,520 --> 03:42:12,800
your sensible architecture and not about

4716
03:42:12,478 --> 03:42:14,719
like

4717
03:42:12,799 --> 03:42:15,840
what you're programming in because as

4718
03:42:14,719 --> 03:42:18,238
far as i can tell

4719
03:42:15,840 --> 03:42:19,760
you know if you give twitter any

4720
03:42:18,238 --> 03:42:20,959
language it doesn't matter what the

4721
03:42:19,760 --> 03:42:23,120
language is

4722
03:42:20,959 --> 03:42:24,639
they will give you a thing that's

4723
03:42:23,120 --> 03:42:25,920
terrible right

4724
03:42:24,639 --> 03:42:27,760
it doesn't matter if you hand them

4725
03:42:25,920 --> 03:42:30,879
javascript or rust

4726
03:42:27,760 --> 03:42:33,279
or c or d or c sharp or

4727
03:42:30,879 --> 03:42:34,238
java the thing that will come out will

4728
03:42:33,279 --> 03:42:36,159
be garbage

4729
03:42:34,238 --> 03:42:38,959
right so i don't think it matters

4730
03:42:36,159 --> 03:42:40,879
whether you're using javascript or c

4731
03:42:38,959 --> 03:42:42,238
it doesn't really make a difference

4732
03:42:40,879 --> 03:42:44,238
right

4733
03:42:42,238 --> 03:42:45,279
when you pick a particular task you

4734
03:42:44,238 --> 03:42:48,159
usually just

4735
03:42:45,279 --> 03:42:49,680
have you know a limited set of options

4736
03:42:48,159 --> 03:42:49,920
that are things that you could use you

4737
03:42:49,680 --> 03:42:52,238
know

4738
03:42:49,920 --> 03:42:53,520
you obviously can't use c on a web front

4739
03:42:52,238 --> 03:42:55,119
end because javascript's the only thing

4740
03:42:53,520 --> 03:42:56,399
that it will execute

4741
03:42:55,120 --> 03:42:57,920
although you know soon you might be able

4742
03:42:56,398 --> 03:43:00,478
to right with webassembly you might be

4743
03:42:57,920 --> 03:43:00,478
able to use c

4744
03:43:01,279 --> 03:43:03,920
but basically you should just pick the

4745
03:43:02,639 --> 03:43:06,079
thing that you're most comfortable in

4746
03:43:03,920 --> 03:43:08,318
that has the capabilities that

4747
03:43:06,079 --> 03:43:09,680
you need and then it's the sensible

4748
03:43:08,318 --> 03:43:11,039
architecture that will keep the code

4749
03:43:09,680 --> 03:43:13,199
good it has nothing to do with the

4750
03:43:11,040 --> 03:43:14,800
language that's just language fetishism

4751
03:43:13,199 --> 03:43:16,159
that doesn't really pay off these days

4752
03:43:14,799 --> 03:43:17,840
because most languages

4753
03:43:16,159 --> 03:43:20,079
at the end of the day are just too

4754
03:43:17,840 --> 03:43:21,359
similar and they really don't get much

4755
03:43:20,079 --> 03:43:23,760
leverage

4756
03:43:21,359 --> 03:43:23,760
you know

4757
03:43:25,680 --> 03:43:35,040
all right

4758
03:43:34,000 --> 03:43:36,318
you everyone for joining me for the

4759
03:43:35,040 --> 03:43:37,600
episode of handmade hero it's been a

4760
03:43:36,318 --> 03:43:40,000
pleasure coding with you as

4761
03:43:37,600 --> 03:43:40,640
always if you would like to follow along

4762
03:43:40,000 --> 03:43:42,000
uh

4763
03:43:40,639 --> 03:43:43,519
you can always pre-order the game on

4764
03:43:42,000 --> 03:43:44,478
handmadehero.org and it comes with a

4765
03:43:43,520 --> 03:43:46,960
source code

4766
03:43:44,478 --> 03:43:48,478
so that you can play around with it uh

4767
03:43:46,959 --> 03:43:50,398
we will be back no

4768
03:43:48,478 --> 03:43:51,679
well that's not true i will be giving a

4769
03:43:50,398 --> 03:43:54,238
lecture

4770
03:43:51,680 --> 03:43:55,639
uh for the university of i don't know

4771
03:43:54,238 --> 03:43:58,238
how to say the name

4772
03:43:55,639 --> 03:43:59,119
t-w-e-n-t-e it's in the netherlands and

4773
03:43:58,238 --> 03:44:01,840
i'm sure i will

4774
03:43:59,120 --> 03:44:02,720
butcher their pronunciation um so i

4775
03:44:01,840 --> 03:44:06,159
won't do it

4776
03:44:02,719 --> 03:44:08,000
but i'm giving a lecture on wednesday

4777
03:44:06,159 --> 03:44:09,359
and you can see it's on the schedule

4778
03:44:08,000 --> 03:44:12,719
here

4779
03:44:09,359 --> 03:44:13,279
right there so if you're interested in

4780
03:44:12,719 --> 03:44:16,799
that

4781
03:44:13,279 --> 03:44:20,479
it's going to be about taking a look

4782
03:44:16,799 --> 03:44:24,159
at some work i did on optimizing

4783
03:44:20,478 --> 03:44:26,959
a sort of distribution a grass

4784
03:44:24,159 --> 03:44:27,920
plant and grass distribution system uh

4785
03:44:26,959 --> 03:44:30,159
in the witness

4786
03:44:27,920 --> 03:44:31,520
and it was the thing where i i had

4787
03:44:30,159 --> 03:44:32,879
something

4788
03:44:31,520 --> 03:44:34,319
that i was supposed to take a look at

4789
03:44:32,879 --> 03:44:36,079
that took you know a minute or two

4790
03:44:34,318 --> 03:44:37,600
minutes or something to to complete and

4791
03:44:36,079 --> 03:44:38,559
i was able to optimize it down to real

4792
03:44:37,600 --> 03:44:40,318
time

4793
03:44:38,559 --> 03:44:42,159
and so it was it's just going to be a

4794
03:44:40,318 --> 03:44:44,478
talk about like looking at

4795
03:44:42,159 --> 03:44:45,680
a thing that someone has created that's

4796
03:44:44,478 --> 03:44:49,358
very slow

4797
03:44:45,680 --> 03:44:51,120
and figuring out why it's very slow and

4798
03:44:49,359 --> 03:44:52,640
how when you actually remove all of the

4799
03:44:51,120 --> 03:44:54,319
things that make it slow it's

4800
03:44:52,639 --> 03:44:56,000
it's like you know potentially like a

4801
03:44:54,318 --> 03:44:58,000
thousand times faster right

4802
03:44:56,000 --> 03:44:59,040
than it was because you know a lot of

4803
03:44:58,000 --> 03:45:00,238
times we don't really go

4804
03:44:59,040 --> 03:45:02,319
over stuff like that so i figured it

4805
03:45:00,238 --> 03:45:03,600
would be fun to to sort of go over what

4806
03:45:02,318 --> 03:45:07,119
that looked like

4807
03:45:03,600 --> 03:45:10,960
um so that's what's going to be and

4808
03:45:07,120 --> 03:45:14,319
it's uh it's it's at this time

4809
03:45:10,959 --> 03:45:18,318
and at this it'll be a light board

4810
03:45:14,318 --> 03:45:21,680
it'll be on the light board uh

4811
03:45:18,318 --> 03:45:22,318
so so you know it's it's like a stand-up

4812
03:45:21,680 --> 03:45:24,800
kind of

4813
03:45:22,318 --> 03:45:26,318
thing so that's it that'll be wednesday

4814
03:45:24,799 --> 03:45:28,238
uh hope to be back here for that and

4815
03:45:26,318 --> 03:45:31,198
then next weekend

4816
03:45:28,238 --> 03:45:32,959
uh on saturday again we'll we'll be back

4817
03:45:31,199 --> 03:45:33,439

4818
03:45:32,959 --> 03:45:36,238
