00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,599
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:10,018
hero the show recode a complete game

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,638
live on stream yesterday well that

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,660
yesterday sorry last stream it was

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:17,460
friday i believe we finished doing a

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,019
to-do item on our list i think we

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,640
actually started and finished it we just

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:25,609
wanted to turn off sorting for our debug

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,679
system i believe that was the last

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:32,039
element of that thing on the to-do list

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,590
so i think we're on to a different sort

12
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,929
of segment of stuff we did this disabled

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:42,480
sorting for debug Usos and slow so i

14
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:44,100
think today we are going to be on our z

15
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,779
finishing up our z stuff which we've

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,460
wanted to do for a long time but there's

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,679
just a lot of things that we kept having

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,739
to sort of push up against in order to

19
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,170
really make sure that would work and so

20
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,929
i think now we should be able to kind of

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,609
go over the final pass we've we've kind

22
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:04,019
of got most of it doing what it's

23
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,489
supposed to do and I think we're we even

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,320
sort of did the thing where we have

25
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,969
multiple like render targets for

26
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,978
different like floor levels and stuff

27
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,079
like that so I think we've really done

28
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:17,009
most of the stuff that we would need to

29
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,810
do for you nosy handling but now we just

30
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,659
need the final piece of it which is that

31
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,799
it's kind of a two-part projection and

32
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,380
we want to make sure that that's

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,380
actually working right and so we kind of

34
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:30,899
got to go just just work with that a

35
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:34,170
little bit and just get that into the

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,240
sort of a whit make that sort of a

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,750
little bit more stable so that we know

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,489
what's going on there and along with

39
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,069
that i think we probably want to just

40
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,390
kind of like do a one pass over the

41
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:47,339
renderer now and just kind of look

42
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,840
through it make sure like i kind of got

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,509
the screen world texture coordinate

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,009
stuff listed there can I go through it

45
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,750
and just make sure like okay can we

46
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,099
smooth any of this out there's just a

47
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,438
lot of junk in there at this point

48
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,609
because it's kind of like a crude a lot

49
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,529
of different things that we've tried to

50
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,149
do with it you know can we take a look

51
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,430
at some of that and maybe simplify it a

52
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,049
little bit more what about sort of the

53
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,459
performance of it it's got some things

54
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,679
in there right now that are kind of a

55
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,900
little bit questionable in terms of how

56
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,560
slow they would be and so on you know is

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,349
there any of that stuff

58
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,180
that we want to kind of work out and I

59
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:19,738
think that transitions nicely into

60
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,870
particle systems because really these

61
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,950
are sort of all I think kind of lumped

62
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,390
together because there's nothing

63
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,098
particularly special about particle

64
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:28,500
systems products or particle systems are

65
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:30,869
very very simple usually the complicated

66
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,750
part of particle systems is not writing

67
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,519
the particle system code which is pretty

68
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,989
random and hackish and not particularly

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,819
difficult its just oh I've got all these

70
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,230
little points that I'm moving around

71
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:41,818
that I'm doing simple physics on them

72
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:45,299
whatever it's usually the rendering part

73
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:48,298
that's complicated either because you

74
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,370
just are trying to maximize the the

75
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,200
speed the number of particles you can

76
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,390
get right and you know this this is

77
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,429
something that can take really extreme

78
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:59,339
forms like you know people nowadays will

79
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,230
do particle systems entirely on the GPU

80
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,939
for example to avoid round-tripping from

81
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:05,848
the cpu so that you cut down a bandwidth

82
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,439
sir etc right so there's there's a fair

83
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:08,969
number of things that are involved in

84
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,068
the particles stuff but it's almost all

85
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:14,068
on that sort of rendering side the

86
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:16,619
actual idea of like oh can I move some

87
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,819
particles around you know I kind of

88
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,709
covered that already on hand made here

89
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,229
and it's it's really not super

90
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,170
complicated it usually ends up being

91
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:27,659
kind of the that that second stage how

92
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,250
do i do enough of these how do I you

93
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,959
know maybe light them properly how do i

94
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,150
go out so that's really where more of

95
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,789
the the sort of finesse lies so in terms

96
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,230
of looking at the particle systems even

97
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:40,709
though we have a fairly simplistic

98
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,119
renderer on handmade here obviously we

99
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,859
would still have sort of some of those

100
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,900
same concerns right look we would want

101
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:47,909
to kind of look and go all right how do

102
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,939
we make sure that we can send enough

103
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,340
particles down every frame you know how

104
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,019
can we sort of make sure that we're not

105
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,269
we certainly don't want to dump all

106
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,370
those particles into the sorting system

107
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,810
for example as individual sprites

108
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,759
because that would really tank our

109
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,560
performance if we wanted to scale up the

110
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,629
number of particles to a larger number

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,030
so there's just kind of like stuff like

112
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:11,068
that that's you know I think going to be

113
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,539
worth thinking about and furthermore we

114
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:13,858
kind of have some other things we might

115
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,959
want to look at in terms of particle

116
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:17,519
systems for example may be may be

117
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,139
included in that or sort of some of the

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,810
continuum dynamic stuff like for example

119
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,879
if we wanted to have some low-lying fog

120
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,649
or something like this you know who

121
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,300
knows but something that was more of an

122
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:29,939
implicit surfacey sort of a thing

123
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,710
so they kind of have a number of things

124
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,269
like that and those would all be about

125
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,829
like how do we communicate those to the

126
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:38,128
render they're not really so much about

127
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:40,109
any kind of complicated implementation

128
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:42,180
on in terms of like the theoretical

129
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,158
aspect of it it's mostly all just all

130
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,840
right once we actually know what we're

131
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,519
trying to simulate what the code is here

132
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,228
how do we actually make sure that it's

133
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,478
not a performance problem how do we make

134
00:04:49,228 --> 00:05:01,079
sure that it dovetails nicely with the

135
00:04:51,478 --> 00:05:03,718
rest of the things we're rendering all

136
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,788
right so I'm going to go ahead and jump

137
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:07,168
right into looking at that Z stuff

138
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:09,149
because I'm pretty sure we don't have

139
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:11,250
any open issues at the moment that I am

140
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:12,750
interested in looking at I'm still

141
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,120
waiting for someone to tell me clang

142
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,978
compatibility wise if there are macros

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,750
we can use that would help with the plan

144
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,000
compatibility because I think that it's

145
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,360
only our macros that are causing clang

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,240
to have grumpiness about them so until

147
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,718
then that was kind of on the on the back

148
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,689
burner and these two are not really in

149
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:35,668
fact what I don't know what this means

150
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:38,310
this is a I guess we could say

151
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:41,750
enhancement so I guess I'll say that

152
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:45,509
these are enhancements let's say right

153
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:50,218
did that do ya and then this one is is

154
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:58,158
what is this i don't know this is this

155
00:05:50,218 --> 00:06:05,189
is um compat maybe can I I can't uh uh

156
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:09,899
what but but but no but I want to apply

157
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:11,218
a label well that's not very good are we

158
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,198
basically saying that I can't create my

159
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:15,569
own labels all right well I don't know

160
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,240
doesn't matter anyway point being so

161
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:20,610
these are enhancements and so those are

162
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,110
not really bugs that we have at the

163
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,879
moment that we want to look into but

164
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,528
this guy is and I'm just waiting for

165
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,879
someone with playing to sort of give us

166
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:29,399
that and then we can close out that guy

167
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,009
but I think we're otherwise pretty much

168
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:34,258
good to go here and also i would mention

169
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:38,250
if you if in general if people would

170
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:40,020
please like not report non bugs to the

171
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,160
bug thing like i get a lot of people who

172
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,409
like report stuff that

173
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,330
are just like they don't like the way

174
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,580
something was coated but that's not

175
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:48,930
really a bug right so but you can do

176
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:50,759
those if you want to but I'm just going

177
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,949
to close them immediately is like this

178
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,329
is not a bug so this is really supposed

179
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:57,089
to only be for stuff that we actually

180
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:59,009
care about that's an actual bug meaning

181
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:01,529
that it causes a bad behavior in the

182
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:02,849
program not you didn't like how i casted

183
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:05,459
that pointer or something because that

184
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:13,280
is not a bug that's a preference that

185
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:16,379
make sense alright so if we go to our

186
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,599
render stuff here and take a look at it

187
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:22,170
you can kind of see our particularly

188
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,540
unusual projection stuff here it's not

189
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,970
really what you might normally think of

190
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,569
as projection code it's a little bit odd

191
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,630
right and that's fine because you know

192
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:36,079
we are a 2-d game and we have some kind

193
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:40,079
of weird ways in which we project stuff

194
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:42,539
but if you'll notice we have sort of

195
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,089
already even just at the start because

196
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,100
we had said how we wanted Z to work we

197
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,709
did not want there to be any sort of

198
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:54,689
like dilation x and y dilation as a

199
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:57,000
result of Z within one floor level you

200
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,469
can see that we still even though we did

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,689
all the work of like doing this whole

202
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:04,260
like this thing with the fade in right

203
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:08,790
like that thing we still sort of have

204
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:11,519
this problem that we like we don't have

205
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,080
those stairs lined up the way they're

206
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,870
supposed to be right they are still

207
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,939
going through a transform that makes

208
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,980
them blow out you know it makes them

209
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,750
sort of scale and do what they're not

210
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,400
supposed to do and this is a problem for

211
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,870
multiple reasons one its not how the

212
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,519
game is supposed to look so that's a

213
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,189
problem we have to go fix that so that

214
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,889
they don't have that happen but to it

215
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:34,080
also breaks our sorting because our sort

216
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:35,519
was designed to be kind of a fairly

217
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,360
minimal like we didn't do a very

218
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,460
complicated sort criteria so our sort

219
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,190
criteria isn't really even set up to

220
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,080
handle stuff that's kew like that we

221
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,480
just did a very simple YZ kind of thing

222
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,060
and so you can see that you gets the

223
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,649
sort wrong as well so it creates like

224
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:57,429
problems for everybody really

225
00:08:53,649 --> 00:09:00,188
it makes it's just not a good thing so

226
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:02,378
if we want to fix this we need to start

227
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:04,419
you know we may have to improve the sort

228
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:07,990
criteria as well that's a separate thing

229
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:09,248
obviously because we can always go make

230
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,558
our sort criteria better than it

231
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:14,069
currently is but at the moment we kind

232
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:17,230
of have this problem where okay so those

233
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:19,899
stairs need to stop doing that right

234
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,470
they need to stop having that scale

235
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:26,198
applied to them and so in order to do

236
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,089
that you know we could make all of that

237
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,469
scale and go away if we wanted to

238
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:31,809
because if you take a look at how that's

239
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,809
that's working here you can kind of see

240
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:36,159
that the way that we do our distance

241
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:38,980
killing here is we have like our

242
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,990
distance 2pz and you can see us doing

243
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,009
our projection here where we take one

244
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,480
over just to be Z and we multiply it by

245
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:48,249
sort of the the standard camera

246
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,839
transform that we talked about way way

247
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:55,058
back when and that projected XY is what

248
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,069
you know this distance to PZ part of

249
00:09:55,058 --> 00:10:02,049
that projected XY equation is going to

250
00:09:57,068 --> 00:10:05,078
give us that sort of XY dilation and

251
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:12,128
that is not actually what we want to

252
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:17,948
have happen right now we could turn it

253
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:20,110
off entirely if we wanted to right we

254
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:23,498
could certainly say that instead of

255
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,389
distance to PZ actually including the Z

256
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:27,569
coordinate that we're dealing with we

257
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:30,789
could turn it off entirely by saying hey

258
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:32,769
distance to PZ is just going to be equal

259
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:36,248
to whatever distance above target is

260
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:38,230
right and that's all it is and if you

261
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:39,819
look at what happens there then we do

262
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,249
have sort of what we wanted which is

263
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:44,948
everything flattened down but we don't

264
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:46,600
get the y part of things so we kind of

265
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:48,458
have like these mysterious things in

266
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,369
here which are sort of you know they're

267
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:52,928
they're kind of totally rendered wrong

268
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:55,119
because they don't actually sort of go

269
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:56,828
up the way they're supposed to but at

270
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:59,709
least they don't do sort of that blowing

271
00:10:56,828 --> 00:11:01,838
out right so what we could do is say

272
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,878
well we know we don't ever want the X to

273
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,069
blow out there you know II on a single

274
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,070
floor so if we wanted to we could say

275
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:09,769
well alright

276
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,400
so you know we don't want that but when

277
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:14,840
we go ahead and get this projected XY

278
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:19,250
when we come through here and we do this

279
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:22,550
equation instead of having the projected

280
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,549
XYZ X persist we could overwrite the

281
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:31,479
projected ex-wives X with the original X

282
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:37,159
right or similarly with some sort of a

283
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:42,170
distance 2pz here that was fixed right

284
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:43,939
so we could do something like this of

285
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:51,799
course I have to actually just get the X

286
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:52,970
part of it like so and you can now see

287
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,679
that we're sort of starting to get a

288
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:59,000
little bit better though well you know

289
00:11:54,679 --> 00:12:02,229
what when I said x I meant why I just

290
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,309
said we wanted the X to be the same oh

291
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,070
wait no but that's what I did want

292
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:11,000
nevermind that's what I did one take it

293
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:13,280
back ok so anyway you can see what's

294
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,799
going on here right now the x coordinate

295
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,389
is aligned properly right the X these

296
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,659
things are seeing the same place in X

297
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:23,000
and you can kind of see that as I kind

298
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:25,519
of pop up these guys it's all good right

299
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,779
I can sort of get in there and you know

300
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,240
it looks like what it should look like

301
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:31,970
however you can see that the right side

302
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,919
of it is wrong and the reason that the

303
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,029
right side of it is wrong is because

304
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:43,819
although we are now keeping the

305
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:46,339
exposition proper we are not we are when

306
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,440
we return the scale value we're

307
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:52,129
returning a single scale value for x and

308
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,980
y and that scale value is going to make

309
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:56,600
the thing change size right so although

310
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,690
it's like aligned on the left side

311
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,759
properly it gets too big now since we

312
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,310
don't really want to do any prospective

313
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,220
scaling really all we should have to do

314
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:10,009
here is instead of using the meters two

315
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,230
pixels times the projected XYZ what we

316
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,269
can do here is just make this be a fixed

317
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,789
factor as well right well of course

318
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:19,549
fixed factor is probably we needed to

319
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:20,870
actually be a fixed factor you know what

320
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,240
I can do let me do it this way

321
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:28,149
so let's compute two of these let's

322
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:32,450
compute first something that's more like

323
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:34,909
unscaled XY right something like that so

324
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,350
here we we do the unscaled version right

325
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:39,980
and so then what I can do is stay

326
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:42,440
protected XY x equals unscaled X Y dot X

327
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,720
so now we are not doing any perspective

328
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,630
transform on the x value and then the

329
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,580
scale I do the same thing instead of

330
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:53,269
using the projected XY i'll use the

331
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,490
unscaled XY and then in theory we should

332
00:13:53,269 --> 00:14:02,449
be a little bit better I missed

333
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:04,009
something here there we go okay so now

334
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,050
we have like a nun scaled one in a

335
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,338
scaled one and now you can see that

336
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:10,399
we've got something that's a little bit

337
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,170
better it's it's still there's still a

338
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,419
couple things about it that we that

339
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:16,490
probably would want to fix but you can

340
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:18,919
kind of see that now we have things that

341
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,440
are the right size but if they are

342
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:25,519
higher they actually got sort of higher

343
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,950
and why okay so that's good and we're

344
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,929
sort of we're getting better but we

345
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,150
still have a problem which is that when

346
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:34,519
I hop up these guys you can see what

347
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:37,909
happens is we get a very unsatisfying

348
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:40,220
result there on what happens to the the

349
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:43,549
level above us and the reason for that

350
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:46,639
is because that level above us we do

351
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:48,559
actually want to have that do all of the

352
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,470
XY and the scaling and all that sort of

353
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,809
stuff right and so there you can sort of

354
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,200
finally see where we have this sort of

355
00:14:53,809 --> 00:15:00,199
nasty problem that that we've got which

356
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,620
is that we want it to work this way

357
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,750
inside a layer but then when we get up

358
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,480
you know each individual layer that we

359
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:12,500
get up we then want to do the scaling as

360
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,420
well as we sort of come up to to that

361
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,379
layer right so the layer itself should

362
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:20,838
be scaled differently so that's kind of

363
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:23,870
tricky right and the reason that that's

364
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:28,130
kind of tricky is because we don't

365
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:30,200
really know exactly we don't have a good

366
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:32,419
sort of concept when we get into this

367
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,610
part of the renderer we don't really

368
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:38,269
have a good concept of what that

369
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:41,180
what those slices in NZ will will mean

370
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:44,179
right we don't really know what those

371
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:46,219
are now we could enforce them to be

372
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:48,229
something in particular meaning we could

373
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:52,250
just say that we're going to use some

374
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:54,769
arbitrary set of Z values here and do it

375
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,990
that way but that's not a particularly

376
00:15:54,769 --> 00:16:00,049
satisfying potentially way to go about

377
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:04,278
this right so you know we're sort of

378
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:05,990
left with this this ugly problem of do

379
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:07,669
we have to do something a little bit

380
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,190
more explicit when we're actually

381
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:12,828
passing these things down do we need to

382
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:17,570
send a slice index and that slice index

383
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:19,849
will give us some degree of will go into

384
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,410
the scaling in one way it'll be the

385
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,810
thing that allows sort of the actual

386
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:26,870
scaling to occur and then you know we've

387
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:29,299
got in addition to that we also have the

388
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:32,060
sort of nominal Z which is really just

389
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:36,199
creating a y displacement for our you

390
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:38,289
know orthographic look right uh and so

391
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,860
it's yet it's there's probably a reason

392
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:45,828
why very few games if any games have

393
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,449
ever done something like this because

394
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:50,239
you know it's just kind of finicky but

395
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:52,458
it's not you know it shouldn't be

396
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,259
unachievable to want to do a slicing

397
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:58,129
thing like that we just have to come up

398
00:16:54,259 --> 00:17:00,980
with a relatively easy way of passing it

399
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:03,289
down now we do have some stuff at our

400
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,689
disposal here right we do have the

401
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:08,058
object transform and the object

402
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:10,308
transform itself obviously is passing a

403
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:12,889
bunch of stuff here and you can kind of

404
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:15,139
see that inside the audit transform we

405
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:19,339
do have like a chunk Z thing that's

406
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:21,589
getting passed here and that chunk Z is

407
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:23,948
the piece of information that we kind of

408
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:28,308
want for that additional scaling right

409
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:30,470
that chunk Z I would tell us exactly

410
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:33,319
that piece of information it would tell

411
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:36,558
us how far this thing is in terms of

412
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:39,918
slices and all we would really need to

413
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:44,599
know is how that chunk Z lines up with

414
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:48,140
the Z of that we're looking at right and

415
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:48,859
so if that chunk Z were in terms of like

416
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,809
negative

417
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:56,629
positive and so and so on that might be

418
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:59,720
useful now i'm not sure where that's

419
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:02,210
being said it's been a while so i kind

420
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:07,990
of want to see what's going on in terms

421
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,990
of this piece of information I think

422
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:17,210
yeah so it kind of looks to me like this

423
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,850
is mostly just being used because that

424
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,669
stuff isn't used anymore this was mostly

425
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:25,009
being used just for the sorting right

426
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:28,400
you can see that that's going into the

427
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:31,369
sprite bound there and and it's just

428
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,480
being set to whichever layer we're on

429
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:37,849
and you know that's that's great the

430
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,429
problem with it is it's a it's just an

431
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:43,730
integer offset so it doesn't really tell

432
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:46,759
us all that much about how you know it

433
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:48,019
gives us a rough idea draw this out for

434
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:56,450
you so you don't have to guess what I'm

435
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:59,740
saying oh I tire uh-oh I think Milton is

436
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,740
is not happy

437
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,720
ok

438
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,450
so there's a lot of ways you could do it

439
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,359
we could use that chunk see however I

440
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,340
what I'm thinking in my head is we want

441
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,589
a continuous transfer mob viously and

442
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:34,349
the thing that we're looking for here

443
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:36,419
right is we're kind of looking for some

444
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:38,699
way of having if these are sort of our

445
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,960
levels right and maybe this is where the

446
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:47,009
hero is he's kind of on this level right

447
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:50,279
and no baby there's the glove there and

448
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:54,150
it's not a very good handmade hero maybe

449
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:58,200
it looks like this much better much

450
00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:00,090
better uh so if this is the the floor of

451
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,269
the hero standing on and this is like

452
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:06,209
you know one up from and this is one

453
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:08,519
down or whatever then when we're talking

454
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,269
about a Z essentially what we want to

455
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:14,069
know is we want to know first of all

456
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:16,980
what is its displacement off of its

457
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:19,439
floor right so we're looking for this

458
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:24,809
piece of information because this piece

459
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:28,740
of information right here in fact we can

460
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:32,250
sort of you can sort of talk about this

461
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,109
type of thing this right here that is

462
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,690
sort of an H that's like the height off

463
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:41,159
the ground let's say H is the

464
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:43,650
orthographic portion right that's just

465
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,960
going to displace us in Y and no matter

466
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,930
how far you go up or down if you're only

467
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,579
within that floor we're just just

468
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,580
placing you and why that's what we want

469
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:57,269
to do so then the other thing we want to

470
00:20:53,579 --> 00:21:00,689
know is what is its floors displacement

471
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:02,789
from the camera right so you know if the

472
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,580
camera is looking right here let's say

473
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:07,680
at the time then in addition to this H

474
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:09,359
value we also want to know this other

475
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,390
value which is effectively let's say our

476
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,789
Z value right and the Z value is the

477
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:18,840
perspective part because however far

478
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:20,309
that floor is off of the camera that's

479
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,909
how much the whole thing is going to get

480
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:27,869
you know XY transformed and scaled and

481
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:31,009
all that stuff right so what we want to

482
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:33,129
be able to know is where is the camera

483
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:38,140
relative to the floor

484
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:42,400
of this thing whatever that is and go

485
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:44,680
back to our here here it is so we want

486
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,800
to know that so that we can do our

487
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,560
projected XY portion of things based on

488
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:56,169
that piece of information and then we

489
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:58,419
also want to know what the just what the

490
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:01,930
H value is because the H value would

491
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:04,690
also provide that sort of why dilation

492
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,460
which we could even do explicitly we

493
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,200
really don't need to do the distance

494
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,210
above target focal length thing here and

495
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,059
in fact I think we don't want to because

496
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:15,610
we want that displacement to be constant

497
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:18,730
no matter what's going on so I think we

498
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:21,639
would just want to apply it prior to the

499
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:24,250
projected so just do the constant first

500
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,410
in here and then apply the projection to

501
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,519
it so that it will scale properly along

502
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:33,100
with everything else if that makes sense

503
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:37,000
so really I think all we need to do is

504
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:39,159
perhaps know what the floor know where

505
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,140
the camera is and then know where the

506
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,660
floor height is for any individual

507
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,390
object that we set so that render

508
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,930
transform kind of just wants to know the

509
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:52,450
floor for this guy what his floor value

510
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:54,310
is right or we could call that a z-value

511
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,230
what'swhat's floor value is and then

512
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:58,990
also that H value which is going to be

513
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:01,930
different now we can still pass down

514
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:04,240
absolute xiv al use right so what we can

515
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:07,180
do is we can pass down an absolute xiv

516
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,190
al you just fine for somebody because if

517
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,740
we're also passing down what the floor

518
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:14,620
value is we know that the relative h

519
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:17,289
value the H value would just be whatever

520
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:20,409
that absolute Z whatever that absolute Z

521
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:22,480
is we would just subtract the Z of the

522
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,509
floor away from it and that would give

523
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,120
us the H value that we need right so we

524
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:30,099
can still essentially do almost exactly

525
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,959
the same interface to the render render

526
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:36,969
that we have been doing aight i said

527
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,890
Randor right rander err it's not a

528
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:42,430
random renderer that's kind of like when

529
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:44,380
people say dranks right like you know

530
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,820
when microsoft sent out that recruiting

531
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,960
recruiting letter and said that they

532
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:50,558
would be supplying i think

533
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,850
use the phrase hella drinks or maybe no

534
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,869
you know what i think they said i think

535
00:23:51,849 --> 00:24:01,389
they said just lots of drinks or

536
00:23:55,869 --> 00:24:03,099
something like that yeah microsoft is

537
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,020
just a party animal they're just party

538
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:06,939
animals you don't understand they've got

539
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:08,740
all these dranks you know I'm saying

540
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:12,880
they just have all these drinks at

541
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,899
Microsoft anyway so uh if you don't know

542
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,580
what I'm talking I'm sure someone on the

543
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:17,439
chat can post a link to that ridiculous

544
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:20,470
thing I posted on Twitter it was it was

545
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,788
ridiculous it was crazy anyway um so we

546
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:24,278
should be able to get that value pretty

547
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:26,740
easily and so all we should have to do

548
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:29,019
here is when we set the chunk Z we could

549
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,700
also just set what is the actual Z value

550
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,898
of the floor at that time and then I

551
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,120
think we would have all of the

552
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:37,829
information that we actually needed for

553
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:42,398
this process to work properly right

554
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:44,528
because if you look at how this this

555
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:47,259
transfer works if i get rid of the

556
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:48,669
unscaled XY part of this because i was

557
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:51,250
just sort of doing that for explanation

558
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:54,009
purposes i don't actually need any of

559
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,109
this stuff too to do what it's doing if

560
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:59,349
you imagine that i just reset this back

561
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:00,879
to how it was before right so this was i

562
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:02,908
believe the way that we'd had it

563
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,520
previously up sorry I didn't mean to

564
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:08,740
leave that sort of chunk z-test in there

565
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:11,200
if we take a look at what this was doing

566
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,960
before right we're back to the old way

567
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,690
all I really need to do is say well okay

568
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,730
let's let's do exactly that same thing

569
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,769
keep everything the way that it was

570
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:24,009
going don't do anything different it's

571
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:25,839
just now instead of using this P Z value

572
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:28,450
I'm just going to say well I need some

573
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,699
new stuff here right I need a Z for the

574
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:36,399
floor right I need whatever that value

575
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:43,058
is and then I need like a like a height

576
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:44,500
or something height off floor right

577
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:46,028
something like this I could also say

578
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,950
floor Z maybe that's a better way to say

579
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:49,808
that right so don't know exactly where

580
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,149
I'm going to get those yet but I do know

581
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:54,220
like I said before if I want to this p

582
00:25:52,148 --> 00:25:56,288
value that comes in this P Z value that

583
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,200
I get after I've done sort of my

584
00:25:56,288 --> 00:26:00,339
beginning transform stuff there when i

585
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,230
get that I

586
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:04,209
easily subtract the floors e to get the

587
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,798
hide off floor part that I wanted and so

588
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,840
really it's just the floor Z that's the

589
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:09,908
thing that I need everything else would

590
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,038
work fine and then I'm also saying okay

591
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:13,299
I'm not going to use any of this P Z

592
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:15,339
value here I'm just going to use the

593
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:16,778
floor Z and the floor is e alone to

594
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:19,028
determine how I'm going to do my

595
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:20,619
perspective transform all the rest of

596
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:22,720
this stuff will work the same the only

597
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:26,319
thing that I now need to do is say that

598
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,589
whatever my raw XY is right this Rolex

599
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:32,319
why here uh whatever that raw XY is and

600
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:36,278
also by the way I don't really know why

601
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:38,048
this isn't in there no idea furthermore

602
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:39,640
I suppose this doesn't need to be in

603
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:41,019
there all this stuff is kind of let's

604
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,120
try to clean this up so it's clear

605
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:48,278
what's happening where I don't know what

606
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:51,158
offset Z is I don't know why that's

607
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:52,778
still there in fact why is that term

608
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:57,070
even still there so that was some old

609
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:59,589
term for off offset see I don't do not

610
00:26:57,069 --> 00:27:01,359
know probably some old code when we were

611
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:06,959
doing things that we don't need to do

612
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:10,389
any more anyway uh so yeah point being

613
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,798
we've got that floor Z and now we need

614
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,809
to just find a way to get the floor Z

615
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,250
everything else should work fine the

616
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:18,668
only thing that we need to do now is

617
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:21,130
when we compute our raw XY we just want

618
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:24,190
to take whatever the Y value is and add

619
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,659
to it some displacement based on the

620
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,360
height off the floor and again this is a

621
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:30,970
purely arbitrary personal artistic

622
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:33,339
decision here about how much of an

623
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,579
orthographic displacement we want for

624
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:39,069
each you know bit of Z that you're off

625
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:40,329
okay and so I don't know what that value

626
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:42,099
is going to be we're going to want to

627
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:43,839
tune that value right we're basically

628
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:49,329
going to have a value here which is like

629
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:51,189
why you know what ortho why from Z kind

630
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:52,808
of a thing and we don't know what that's

631
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,210
going to be but we can just tweak it

632
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:56,980
however we want to tweak it so if we

633
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,929
compile this we should have no problems

634
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,819
other than just we need a place to get

635
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:02,500
the floor Z and right now we don't know

636
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:05,019
where to get the floor Z right I have no

637
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,940
idea where to get that floors Ephraim so

638
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:08,769
when i do the object transform bit i

639
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,179
could just add it in there for now so i

640
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:12,879
could just say well we're going to need

641
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,090
a floor z here if you don't specify a

642
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,559
floor z then

643
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:20,599
we can always just make the floor zv 0

644
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:22,278
which would do no transforming at all

645
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:24,439
now what's interesting about that is

646
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:28,099
that would also potentially let us get

647
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,480
rid of some other aspects here but we

648
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:31,069
could probably make the orthographic

649
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,419
stuff a little bit simpler if we wanted

650
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:34,849
to I'm not I'm going to ignore that for

651
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,740
now point being if we just add something

652
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:39,230
to the object transform that says what

653
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,120
the floor Z should be then in theory I

654
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,038
should be able to do something where I

655
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,418
take the object transform grab the floor

656
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,269
as you out of it and although we're not

657
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:49,730
setting it yet we should presumably be

658
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:51,889
able to set that pretty easily because

659
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,409
it's not a particularly complicated

660
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:59,270
thing so if I take a look at where we

661
00:28:54,409 --> 00:29:01,340
actually set these in terms of upright I

662
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:02,869
think it's here you can see default

663
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:05,449
upright transform a default flat

664
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:07,939
transform they don't set the floor Z at

665
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,278
all so it would just be set to zero so

666
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,140
if I actually do this now in theory I

667
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:13,579
think we would get pretty much exactly

668
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,559
what we had before you can see that

669
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:18,079
that's happening where we have that

670
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:22,490
ortho displacement and that's all good

671
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:24,379
but we don't have we still don't have

672
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,149
any scaling right because the floor Z

673
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,549
has just not been set by anybody so

674
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:31,099
let's go ahead and try to set that floor

675
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:33,349
z2 something meaningful now right and

676
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:36,678
all we need to do to do that is we just

677
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:39,439
need some Z value for the floor which we

678
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,240
should know when we're actually putting

679
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,038
these guys out because we had to do

680
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,409
stuff like break them up into layers to

681
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:46,908
begin with so if you take a look at

682
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,830
what's going on here you can see uh

683
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:51,350
we're starting to compute that outside

684
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:54,369
this is back in the M in where we're

685
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:54,369
outputting entities right

686
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,599
so we're we're out putting entities is

687
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,860
where this actually counts will probably

688
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,569
have to clean up some of the other code

689
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:08,789
where these transforms are being set

690
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:10,409
because they might might need to set a

691
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:12,329
floor Z as well like for example when

692
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,410
we're showing debug rectangles and stuff

693
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:15,509
like that those are going to have to

694
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,370
have their floor as you set properly as

695
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:18,329
well but for the time being we only

696
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:19,949
really care about the entities because

697
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:21,869
that's what pretty much all of our

698
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,220
drawing goes through so if we take a

699
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:25,469
look here what happens we have this

700
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,819
object transform that's our entity

701
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:30,329
transform we're generating one of these

702
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:34,849
default upright transforms for it and I

703
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:39,649
you know that that's interesting do we

704
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:39,649
do we ever do a default flat transform

705
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:56,269
wait a minute when we draw are we

706
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,269
drawing all of our things is upright

707
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,680
that's just a total bug right we're

708
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:10,680
supposed to be drawing the floors is

709
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:13,370
flat hey maybe don't send down one

710
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:16,529
hundred percent of the entities as flat

711
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:18,329
that would totally break our sorting i'm

712
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:20,369
not sure why our sorting is even working

713
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:21,599
half as good as it is right now i guess

714
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:23,279
would give ourselves a pat on the back

715
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,319
for having a sorter that's way better

716
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,910
than it should be maybe I'm overreacting

717
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,490
maybe that's not what's going on there

718
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,810
but point being that's a screw-up but

719
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,799
that has nothing to do with what we're

720
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,109
talking about right now so that's fine

721
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:36,480
anyway point being you can see us going

722
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:38,490
ahead here and setting this offset p to

723
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,750
being this is the the distance of off

724
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,339
the camera so that's going to be the

725
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,799
absolute z displacement so now the

726
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:46,909
question is where is the actual floor

727
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:49,139
that this dude would have been on right

728
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:51,900
and so you can see here where we've got

729
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,360
entity z layer and we've got this sort

730
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,150
of chunk Z situation going on here which

731
00:31:54,359 --> 00:32:00,059
is saying like okay where is this guy in

732
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:02,759
terms of floors so we know what the

733
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:05,759
relative layer is here we just don't

734
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:08,940
necessarily know what the actual Z value

735
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:11,240
is for that layer but we know that that

736
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,070
is something that we had computed before

737
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,019
and the reason that we know that that is

738
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:17,000
something that competed before because

739
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:18,769
you can kind of see in this this thing

740
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,569
right here where we were doing like our

741
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:22,789
fogging and all that sort of stuff we

742
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:25,308
already had to compute that right we had

743
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:28,039
to compute the camera relative Ramsey

744
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:30,678
because this is it right here right this

745
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:32,769
is that value so that's the value that

746
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,820
we actually need to set for the sky

747
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:36,829
unfortunately we're not saving it

748
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:39,439
anywhere right so we kind of need to

749
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:49,490
have a thing here which is like camera

750
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:55,880
relative Brown Z and we kind of need to

751
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:57,769
store that for everybody and so that

752
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,540
camera relative Brown Z will keep the

753
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:03,109
value that we actually wanted so there's

754
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:05,240
camera low to ground Z and we just need

755
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:07,759
to be able to set when we set the fog

756
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,440
amount we just also need to be able to

757
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,259
set what this is so that we can remember

758
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,350
it now and now we know where the camera

759
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:16,970
relative ground Z is and the camera

760
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:18,889
elliptic ground Z is the thing that we

761
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,390
have to look up here what we should be

762
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,550
able to do is just verify that this

763
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,710
thing is actually inside the layers that

764
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:27,500
we want we've already done that so that

765
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:30,350
seems fine here so all we should have to

766
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,720
do is in the entity transform when we

767
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:35,839
get down to this point and we verified

768
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,230
that we should be able to set the floor

769
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:42,709
Z here to the cam relative ground Z

770
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:45,620
value for our relative layer so looking

771
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:49,519
up into there where is our fog I'm out

772
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:50,659
there it is so our layer index it should

773
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,759
have been computed somewhere I don't

774
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:58,100
actually know where it is there it is so

775
00:33:54,759 --> 00:34:03,500
just do that here and I think that

776
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:05,509
should be fine ok so I think this should

777
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,700
set the floor height I mean the floor Z

778
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:09,949
properly now so when we come up here we

779
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,929
should see that that scaling happen

780
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:14,388
right and you can see that scaling

781
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,460
happen which is nice so you can see it

782
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,950
it seems to be working fairly correctly

783
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,059
there when we kind of pop up here that's

784
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:21,500
all good of course those guys are

785
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,878
blocking me I don't know why they're

786
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,480
blocking me that's not very nice of them

787
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:25,918
but now we do

788
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,099
have the ability to sort of scale those

789
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,929
two things up properly now obviously we

790
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,639
sort of have a problem just with the way

791
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:33,960
our levels are structured there's

792
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,539
nothing we're ever going to be able to

793
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,039
do to make it render properly here

794
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:40,619
because we sort of have these solid

795
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:42,449
stairs coming up here when I hop up here

796
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,500
if I have another stairwell on top of me

797
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:45,898
I'm not even going to be able to see

798
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,239
myself that's just kind of the way that

799
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:50,159
would actually happen in real life so we

800
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,809
kind of have to work around that in

801
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,039
terms of the earth there's nothing the

802
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:55,259
renderer isn't doing anything

803
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,059
particularly stupid at that point that's

804
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,290
just how that's going to be you know and

805
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:59,759
we could do other things like maybe

806
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:01,170
alpha those that if we wanted to or

807
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,160
something like that but in general right

808
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,570
we'd probably just don't want to

809
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,679
structure our levels that way we

810
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,359
probably don't want to have to

811
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,469
stairwells on top of each other like put

812
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:08,699
the other stairwell on the other side of

813
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:10,980
the screen so that there's a bigger hole

814
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:13,858
there and we can actually see up through

815
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:16,079
it or something like that but I believe

816
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:18,719
that's really all we had to do to get

817
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,190
our Z working properly there and now we

818
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:24,269
just have to deal with the artistic

819
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:26,608
concerns of it and off you go now that's

820
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:29,219
pretty much that entire to do as far as

821
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:31,590
the Z part of things is concerned but we

822
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:33,659
do have another sort of separate problem

823
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:36,510
here which is that I feel like and I

824
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:42,299
could be wrong but I feel like as I just

825
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:46,830
added this right here i am and i'm not

826
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:48,269
flat sorry this is upright I'm a little

827
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:51,509
bit concerned that we never actually

828
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:53,940
have any sprites that aren't being

829
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,970
marked as upright because we do default

830
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,920
upright transform here right but then I

831
00:35:56,969 --> 00:36:01,319
don't know that we ever set it to

832
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,500
anything other than an upright transform

833
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,269
which makes me concerned that all that

834
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,369
stuff we did to handle both kinds of

835
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:09,869
sorting we're never actually taking any

836
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:11,369
advantage of it which means our sorts

837
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:14,840
are all going to be kind of busted all

838
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:18,420
the time no matter what we do I think

839
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:21,329
again maybe I'm misunderstanding

840
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,490
something because you know hey I have a

841
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:24,690
day job and I forget a lot of things

842
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:25,739
about handmade hero while I'm actually

843
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:31,200
working out of their code for eight

844
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:36,009
hours a day but

845
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:38,799
uh that just kind of seems like what's

846
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:41,170
going on you know and so I feel like

847
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,340
these pieces here when we're sort of

848
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:49,420
doing these this stuff when we come

849
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,820
through and do these these pushes I feel

850
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:56,550
like these pushes that we're doing

851
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,550
needed to be marked as flat right and

852
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:02,050
because these like for example these

853
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:04,089
right here these entity transforms these

854
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:06,700
should all have been marked is flat ok

855
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:08,230
so we are ok we're fine because these

856
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:10,299
are these are all below it and we're

857
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,519
only doing those for traversable so all

858
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,740
right whoo ok so that's fine that's

859
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:17,019
gonna say what's going on here I was I

860
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:19,779
thought I thought I was thought I was

861
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:23,489
losing my mind man thought I was losing

862
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:27,970
my mind ok so we're actually fine I

863
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:29,589
think unless because I feel like those

864
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:31,629
are the those are the things that we're

865
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:34,360
actually rendering right because here is

866
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,619
the the occupier tag that turns them the

867
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,349
colors based on whether you're hopping

868
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,420
on them right so it's all good okay I

869
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:43,150
got nervous there for a second I was

870
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:44,860
like what's going on but ok so those

871
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:47,139
those are rendered outside so it's all

872
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:52,170
good everyone can relax and by everyone

873
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:55,539
I mean me right all right so that seems

874
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:58,599
that seems pretty reasonable and I don't

875
00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:00,820
think well we have to really worry about

876
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,440
that now we'll we'll put when you put

877
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,570
the new art in we'll see what happens

878
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,970
we'll try to construct some rooms that

879
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:08,769
have some multi-layer stuff on them but

880
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:11,559
I think we're now probably pretty good

881
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:13,900
in terms of like slight staggering and

882
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:17,529
you know what I could do is I could also

883
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:20,800
just turn if I could I could sort of

884
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:24,730
play with that value a little bit here

885
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:29,410
let me go ahead and scoot up to the part

886
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:31,030
where we actually create rooms and I

887
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:36,069
think we have a thing in here where we

888
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:39,280
kind of did a random sort of like a sort

889
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:41,530
of random variants of the height and you

890
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,760
can kind of see here in fact but where

891
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,170
we were doing this in terms of

892
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,210
staggering things

893
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:50,230
x and y i'm going to enable like a

894
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:52,659
little bit of a stagger in z instead and

895
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:56,199
just to see what happens there just a

896
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:57,429
little tiny bit of of that and I I don't

897
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:00,730
really remember what our convention is

898
00:38:57,429 --> 00:39:03,219
about where the floor is exactly but

899
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,358
yeah so that's you can kind of see what

900
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:06,159
that looks like it's pretty

901
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:08,858
straightforward and now we can kind of

902
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,929
hop along some some sort of uneven

903
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:12,429
terrain just make sure that that is

904
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:13,598
working properly and that that looks

905
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:15,818
fine that looks like what I would have

906
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,579
expected so that's all good I can hop up

907
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:22,119
here here's another level of that and

908
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:24,670
and off we go so that seems correct and

909
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,260
it also seems like we do have a little

910
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,869
bit of leeway there so we can displace

911
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,430
downward and it doesn't get floored to

912
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:33,608
the one below us so I guess there's a

913
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:36,039
little bit of a gutter in there and so

914
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:38,348
that should be fine now we do have one

915
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:40,779
thing that we might want to consider

916
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:43,390
fixing a little bit i think i'll

917
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:47,290
probably let that weight though until

918
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:50,019
the part where i actually care but i

919
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:52,480
think you can see that like the snapping

920
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:55,139
that happens there what happens is when

921
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,949
we transition from one layer to another

922
00:39:55,139 --> 00:40:04,000
we might want a kind of a zone where we

923
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:09,548
apply where we blend between the two Z's

924
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:12,010
that we would use and so you know try

925
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:16,539
and explain what I mean here and and I

926
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:21,190
think maybe by I met tone this down

927
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:22,779
quite a bit I think maybe the right way

928
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,130
to do it is to sort of construct a room

929
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,380
where you can see this happening a

930
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,059
little bit better so what I want to do

931
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:33,670
here is I'm going to try and construct a

932
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:35,769
room that I guess the first thing I'll

933
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,690
do is I'll just turn off the room that's

934
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:41,530
one above us so we can see a little bit

935
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:44,730
more easily let's go down two hand made

936
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,569
that sleepy the coop and they just poppy

937
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:51,599
actually know this would be world and

938
00:40:46,568 --> 00:40:51,599
open it so add standard room

939
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:00,430
there we go so instead of creating

940
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:02,230
forest serene stacked on top of each

941
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:04,358
other i'm just going to create one and

942
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:07,240
then when i only have one if i come down

943
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:09,699
here and hop up words right like this

944
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:12,519
you can kind of see that when i get to

945
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:15,308
the top well I guess I I don't have

946
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:17,108
anywhere to go right okay that's not

947
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:20,589
going to do it kinda i got at least add

948
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:22,929
2 i'll add to and when i add a standard

949
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:29,049
room i guess i'll say something about is

950
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:32,108
there a stairwell so i'll only add the

951
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,818
stairwell by like checking the screen

952
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:36,219
index parity there i'll just see only a

953
00:41:33,818 --> 00:41:39,909
stairwell on the first room and i will

954
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:42,279
add it on the second round right so

955
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:45,879
let's see so what I want to do here is

956
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:49,030
say okay that's stairwell there I think

957
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,280
let's see know what the difference

958
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:54,970
between these two things are to be

959
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:58,809
honest with you the just me or do those

960
00:41:54,969 --> 00:42:00,129
look exactly the same is there any

961
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,960
difference between those two things I

962
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:04,630
have no idea why we have two paths here

963
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,210
people I think we were doing something

964
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,640
here before then we got rid of it anyway

965
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:12,880
so I believe this is the part right

966
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:15,989
that's it creates a stairwell so I'm

967
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,670
going to say if add stairs will do this

968
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:20,969
otherwise that we're just not going to

969
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,970
do it

970
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:33,230
so now in theory I should have a room

971
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,840
above us and that room should not have

972
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,639
anything there yeah although actually I

973
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:42,289
guess that's right I also have to make

974
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:45,949
sure that we don't do it so yeah we

975
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:54,079
would have to not put anything there as

976
00:42:45,949 --> 00:43:01,009
well so I guess I want to do if we don't

977
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:09,289
add stairs then I want to do like a skip

978
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:19,640
false or maybe a dick is true that it is

979
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:22,130
false yeah i mean i should just define

980
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:23,839
to be 32 x in fact why don't i have a be

981
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:26,470
through 22 x does anyone know why we

982
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,470
don't have one

983
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:45,619
okay alright so now in theory there's a

984
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:50,389
hole there right yeah there's the hole

985
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:51,798
there and so I'm going to make an even

986
00:43:50,389 --> 00:43:54,768
bigger hole so you can see it a little

987
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:57,170
more clearly what I'm talking about in

988
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:58,608
terms of the problem and then we can

989
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,349
sort of talk about what we want to do to

990
00:43:58,608 --> 00:44:01,818
solve it I think I don't have very much

991
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:03,559
time left anyway so we might leave it

992
00:44:01,818 --> 00:44:05,298
for tomorrow I just want to put it in I

993
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:08,089
want to put in the stuff so that we can

994
00:44:05,298 --> 00:44:10,809
see very clearly what the problem is

995
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:16,998
that I was kind of talking about okay uh

996
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:24,499
so yeah what I want to do here I think

997
00:44:16,998 --> 00:44:29,149
is say if offset equals three or you

998
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:34,509
know we're not adding stairs and offset

999
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:42,650
x equals 4 so we kind of have a bigger

1000
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:45,048
oops so we kind of have a region to look

1001
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,700
into and I think it might I might

1002
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:48,318
actually want to be one over the other

1003
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:49,429
direction I think about it in terms of

1004
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,088
what would be easier to see because

1005
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:57,199
that's a not quite what I was hoping for

1006
00:44:52,088 --> 00:45:02,119
let's say equals two and maybe we'll

1007
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:03,998
also say here and the offsets rather

1008
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:11,509
than equals negative 2 i'm going to say

1009
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:14,179
the same thing here with offset or add

1010
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:20,829
stairs and offset less than or equal to

1011
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:20,828
3 let's see if that how that treats me

1012
00:45:21,608 --> 00:45:29,989
and let's see so I hop up the stairs and

1013
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:35,930
there you can kind of see we've got a

1014
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:39,318
nice big jump leeway so do you see how

1015
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:43,518
when I when I cross that boundary and my

1016
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:44,838
my dude hops down right I've it's hard

1017
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:47,988
to kind of get him to hop down because

1018
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:49,789
it's a sort of a big way but when I make

1019
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:52,190
that jump the

1020
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:56,150
the transform is discontinuous so I just

1021
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:59,659
I just pop right and like I pop scaling

1022
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:02,210
immediately right which is not probably

1023
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:05,059
what we want so and even though this is

1024
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:06,740
like an exaggerated case it's just it's

1025
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:08,449
just going to be bad right you can say

1026
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:10,069
once the once the art is kind of cleaned

1027
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:11,509
up in there you know you're going to

1028
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:15,559
really see that pop but it's not going

1029
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:17,570
to be fun so the question is you know

1030
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:20,480
what can we do about that particular

1031
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:22,990
situation and I think what we probably

1032
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,440
want to do there is maybe just make that

1033
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:28,939
scaling be like a little bit cleaner

1034
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,400
just give it a little bit more room and

1035
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:35,000
that's not particularly hard to do right

1036
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:38,119
we can if we want to just say well okay

1037
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,090
so you can see what we're doing in terms

1038
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:44,210
of the floor Z here here it is what we

1039
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:47,000
could do is say well if we know what the

1040
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:48,769
floor height in general is then it

1041
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,760
shouldn't be particularly difficult for

1042
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:54,429
us to just take a little bit of that

1043
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,720
range I think I talked about this before

1044
00:46:54,429 --> 00:46:58,250
but to just take a little bit of that

1045
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,980
range and do sort of into some

1046
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,989
interpolation there so for example if

1047
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,510
here is the way that we've been doing it

1048
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:08,539
where it's like okay you know here's the

1049
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:12,440
the location of the dude and so we have

1050
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:15,230
sort of our our floor Z is here right

1051
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:18,920
and this is our height and this would be

1052
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:22,159
the next floor up what we can do instead

1053
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:24,139
is introduced a zone in which we

1054
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:26,690
transition between the two and do a

1055
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:30,109
smoother scaling of that of the entities

1056
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:32,690
in that band right and so how we would

1057
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:35,510
do that is just say well you know if the

1058
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:38,240
H is within these it was within this

1059
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:41,330
bound whatever that is then we don't

1060
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:46,009
care but if the H is above that bound

1061
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:49,789
then we use it's a we map this range 20

1062
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:52,940
21 essentially and we lurk between the

1063
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:55,579
floor Z and the next floor Z up from

1064
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:58,849
what it is before we do the transform

1065
00:47:55,579 --> 00:48:01,549
right so essentially when we do our

1066
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:03,469
transform here when we take our floor Z

1067
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:06,349
that we're going to use for the actual

1068
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:16,789
projection right what we want to do

1069
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:21,559
there is just linear interpolate this

1070
00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:37,159
right so we want to kind of say lurk

1071
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:40,429
between the floor Z and you know floor

1072
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:42,379
height that kind of thing so basically

1073
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:46,460
we would have two things we'd go between

1074
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:48,769
the floor Z and the next floor Z up and

1075
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:52,280
what we would want to do is base that on

1076
00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:54,769
where the PZ was relative to the floor Z

1077
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,170
which means we do actually then want to

1078
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:59,539
compute this a priority right so we do

1079
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:07,340
want to be able to say okay let's figure

1080
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:09,139
that out and right when we do that

1081
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:15,338
computation will then we'll know however

1082
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:15,338
we kind of do need to know I suppose

1083
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:20,210
since we're looping it we want to do

1084
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:22,070
this subtraction afterwards at with the

1085
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:24,289
real floor Z so that that's continuous

1086
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:26,390
as well so really we want this to be

1087
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:29,088
some other thing which is like you know

1088
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:31,819
our test Z where we compute what the

1089
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:35,299
floor Z is relative to the the point the

1090
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:39,019
Z point right so we kind of know like

1091
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:40,910
okay here's here's where we are and now

1092
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:43,940
we just have to see whether that thing

1093
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:45,920
is roughly in the range of this of this

1094
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,858
floor height here right and we've got to

1095
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,650
see what that is so we need some kind of

1096
00:49:48,858 --> 00:49:56,299
an apron there and we just want to know

1097
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:57,800
I suppose you know is you know clamp I

1098
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:03,859
guess really all we want to do is say

1099
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:06,140
clamp 001 map to range right I I think

1100
00:50:03,858 --> 00:50:08,440
that's our sort of all-purpose function

1101
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:08,440
for this

1102
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:18,359
right so this allows us to do a min a

1103
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:21,590
max and a tee so what I think we can do

1104
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:25,650
here is is say that you know our T value

1105
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:28,200
our floor key value in this case in fact

1106
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,760
I guess I don't need to show the test Z

1107
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:32,849
there I could just say that you know

1108
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:36,960
this is the value that we have we know

1109
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:41,969
that we want to to lurk it in a sense I

1110
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:50,099
guess we could say next borzi this is

1111
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:52,109
that next floor up right and so what we

1112
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:53,730
want to do is say well okay we know the

1113
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:56,190
high end of the range that's the next

1114
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:58,349
floor Z but we don't want to use the

1115
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:59,340
actual floor Z as the base of the range

1116
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:01,799
because the whole point of this is just

1117
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,690
to use like a narrow band so essentially

1118
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,000
we just be using like the next floor Z

1119
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:08,220
minus the like the apron value right

1120
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,739
whatever that apron value is and we can

1121
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:12,299
make that beef parametric potentially if

1122
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:13,919
you want to in the future for now let's

1123
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,990
just say we set it to like Oh point one

1124
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,000
or something like that right and then

1125
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:21,239
all we really need to do I don't know

1126
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:29,280
what I call this function tonight did I

1127
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:30,989
just call it work yeah and so when I do

1128
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,000
this object transform now I just need

1129
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:37,859
one other thing which is the floor

1130
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,900
height now I could do floors II and the

1131
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,099
next floor see I suppose I could do it

1132
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,650
that way since those are the two things

1133
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,119
we actually want maybe I since we don't

1134
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:47,639
actually ever use the floor height

1135
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,009
natively maybe we just do that because

1136
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:53,629
then it's a little bit more direct I

1137
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:53,630
suppose right

1138
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:03,969
that definite looks better all right so

1139
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:05,708
let's call it that we compile now that

1140
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:07,929
value is not getting set which is not

1141
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:10,778
going to be good so we need to kind of

1142
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:13,498
go into our entity output again and

1143
00:52:10,778 --> 00:52:15,940
actually make sure that we do specify

1144
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:18,159
what these actually are now this is a

1145
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,019
pretty easy thing to specify all we have

1146
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:26,170
to do is take whatever the floor is he

1147
00:52:20,018 --> 00:52:32,228
was before and just add to it whatever

1148
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:33,608
the height of the floor actually is and

1149
00:52:32,228 --> 00:52:36,009
the height of the floor should be just

1150
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:37,748
in here because we're sort of doing that

1151
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:40,630
computation the typical floor height

1152
00:52:37,748 --> 00:52:43,478
thing and so the renderer would actually

1153
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,979
be supporting you know non-uniform floor

1154
00:52:43,478 --> 00:52:47,169
heights we're not really specify we're

1155
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:48,429
not supporting that here in the entity

1156
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:50,048
output but maybe that something will

1157
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:52,078
change later so I don't want to like

1158
00:52:50,048 --> 00:52:55,329
force the renderer to have to do that

1159
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:58,089
for no reason all right so now when I

1160
00:52:55,329 --> 00:53:05,818
kind of come up here I don't know if

1161
00:52:58,088 --> 00:53:05,818
that's what whoa that did not well I

1162
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:13,930
suppose that is sort of LARPing there

1163
00:53:11,259 --> 00:53:16,719
but that is not really giving me a very

1164
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:19,028
satisfying results let me see about

1165
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:26,528
increasing that apron just so I can see

1166
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:33,608
I want to see about this here I want to

1167
00:53:26,528 --> 00:53:36,278
see that happen a little slower okay I

1168
00:53:33,608 --> 00:53:40,978
wish these familiars would would go away

1169
00:53:36,278 --> 00:53:40,978
they're real annoying okay

1170
00:53:54,010 --> 00:54:17,590
so yeah that is not great not a fan of

1171
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:20,679
that I'm not sure exactly what to make

1172
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:22,750
of it because I don't know any other

1173
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:27,819
real way we would be able to deal with

1174
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:30,730
that we could obviously turn off the

1175
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:32,289
scaling entirely and just leave it so

1176
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:34,150
that it doesn't do that so it doesn't

1177
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:36,699
ever do the sort of sizing stuff the

1178
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:38,920
sizing stuff looks pretty cool but I

1179
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:40,539
don't know that that looks unconvincing

1180
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:47,400
maybe there's something fancier we can

1181
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:47,400
do there maybe there isn't but yeah I

1182
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:53,469
mean it might be that the widest

1183
00:54:51,699 --> 00:54:54,730
placement is really the only thing that

1184
00:54:53,469 --> 00:54:57,459
we're going to be able to do i'm not

1185
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:58,900
sure if we wanted to do that you know we

1186
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,460
could take all of this stuff obviously

1187
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:06,400
that's happening here and just say okay

1188
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:12,579
the floor z we never actually used right

1189
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:15,190
and that would look like this and then

1190
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:20,739
we just sort of have this we're back to

1191
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:23,889
the same situation of you know that all

1192
00:55:20,739 --> 00:55:25,479
works it's just a lot more boring it

1193
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:28,210
doesn't have that nice feel that the

1194
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,710
perspective version does you know it's

1195
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:31,980
still like fades out and everything but

1196
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:37,059
it's just it just doesn't have that same

1197
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:39,570
kind of feel to it so I don't know what

1198
00:55:37,059 --> 00:55:39,570
to do about that

1199
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:51,550
I don't know I mean we're going to have

1200
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,199
to keep that apron pretty narrow if we

1201
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:58,769
don't want a bunch of objects sliding

1202
00:55:53,199 --> 00:56:07,089
around all the time on it you know and

1203
00:55:58,769 --> 00:56:13,360
oops but yeah I just I just don't know

1204
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:17,530
how we would how we would keep that from

1205
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:19,510
getting out of hand let me think is

1206
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:27,850
there any other thing I could do besides

1207
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:29,890
the looping yeah I don't know because it

1208
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:39,299
is a fundamentally kind of nasty problem

1209
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:39,299
I mean you got this thing that's well

1210
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:49,480
I guess maybe you could say that if you

1211
00:56:46,748 --> 00:56:53,318
were to keep their if you were to keep

1212
00:56:49,480 --> 00:57:01,269
some range in which the scaling didn't

1213
00:56:53,318 --> 00:57:05,528
occur maybe that would help I don't know

1214
00:57:01,268 --> 00:57:07,929
I make sure I'm doing this right first

1215
00:57:05,528 --> 00:57:12,900
of all so assuming that you're close to

1216
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:12,899
the top of the range between the floors

1217
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:21,849
yeah you're just yeah just looking at

1218
00:57:18,248 --> 00:57:25,618
the apron then you learn the two floors

1219
00:57:21,849 --> 00:57:28,720
ease in terms of what your transform is

1220
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:30,548
that's probably pretty good i mean i

1221
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:36,328
don't know that there's much else i

1222
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:42,730
would do to that ah yeah so I don't know

1223
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:45,818
about that I don't know and here's the

1224
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:53,469
version that that looks I think it looks

1225
00:57:45,818 --> 00:57:54,909
like what we want oops because I was

1226
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:56,949
feeling pretty good about this it's just

1227
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:59,219
it's got that popping artifact right

1228
00:57:56,949 --> 00:58:01,689
because otherwise it's what I wanted

1229
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:05,528
right that looks exactly like what I

1230
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:07,150
wanted the problem is like I just don't

1231
00:58:05,528 --> 00:58:15,400
know how to deal with the popping part

1232
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:17,200
in terms of the transform you know and

1233
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,119
maybe there'd be a solution just for the

1234
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:22,509
hero because the hero is always kind of

1235
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:24,369
the where the camera is but you know I'm

1236
00:58:22,509 --> 00:58:26,498
thinking about other entities as well

1237
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:29,200
and they they would kind of have this

1238
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:31,358
these problems I think where you know as

1239
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,858
you kind of saw them go up and down I'm

1240
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:35,108
going to get rid of that jitter on the

1241
00:58:32,858 --> 00:58:36,608
floor as well for the moment while we're

1242
00:58:35,108 --> 00:58:38,949
looking at things is kind of distracting

1243
00:58:36,608 --> 00:58:41,548
and so I'm going to go ahead and just

1244
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:44,739
take that out of the equation as well

1245
00:58:41,548 --> 00:58:46,358
but yeah so I don't know I guess we'll

1246
00:58:44,739 --> 00:58:48,429
just we'll leave this till tomorrow

1247
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:50,139
we'll talk about it some more but I'm

1248
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:52,449
worried about that I don't know of an

1249
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:55,058
immediate solution because yeah that

1250
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:55,989
looks like what I want every in all

1251
00:58:55,059 --> 00:58:58,060
other respects

1252
00:58:55,989 --> 00:58:59,709
but I just don't know how to solve that

1253
00:58:58,059 --> 00:59:01,029
popping problem of moving between

1254
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:04,030
because now you essentially got two

1255
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:09,880
spaces in terms of the transform I don't

1256
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:12,730
know how to really get really know how

1257
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:16,269
to get away from that you know I don't

1258
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:22,329
know what I could do to make that not

1259
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:25,659
cause us problems so yeah that's that's

1260
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:27,849
not that's not great maybe we'll think

1261
00:59:25,659 --> 00:59:29,679
of something though you know maybe we'll

1262
00:59:27,849 --> 00:59:37,329
think of something you want to give up

1263
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:40,089
right away I'm going to go ahead and go

1264
00:59:37,329 --> 00:59:42,480
to the queue and the a since it is Q&amp;A

1265
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,480
time

1266
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,780
you

1267
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:53,889
it's like gonna be an easy night no

1268
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:57,429
questions asked me no more questions

1269
01:00:53,889 --> 01:00:58,869
I'll tell you no more lies not know the

1270
01:00:57,429 --> 01:01:07,929
rest of that song but I know it's like a

1271
01:00:58,869 --> 01:01:13,269
nursery rhyme sort of thing cyberpunk

1272
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:15,069
hobo are there any particular reasons

1273
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:22,559
not to refer continuous scaling and z

1274
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:22,559
besides easy sorting uh yeah I'm like I

1275
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:30,669
just don't feel like the art looks good

1276
01:01:28,329 --> 01:01:34,360
with that kind of scaling because so

1277
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:36,220
it's it's not obvious to see because we

1278
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,920
haven't tried to drop in the real art

1279
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:43,149
yet but essentially you got this problem

1280
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:49,990
of you know here is what a room looks

1281
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:52,210
like let's say right so that's the top

1282
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:55,719
wall and then here is the ground or

1283
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:57,970
whatever something like that right and

1284
01:01:55,719 --> 01:02:00,809
the problem with it is if you do that

1285
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:03,549
scaling then you now you need to have

1286
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:05,949
some way of doing artwork for like these

1287
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:08,200
sides and stuff like that and suddenly

1288
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:10,419
you pretty much have to just do 3d at

1289
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:12,789
that point right whereas if you're

1290
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:14,889
orthographic you know no matter where

1291
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:18,250
something is it still just looks like

1292
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:20,230
this so you can just have one sprite for

1293
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:22,510
that and once right for the top and be

1294
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:24,849
done right because it doesn't matter

1295
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:27,430
where on the screen it is it always is

1296
01:02:24,849 --> 01:02:30,279
the same artwork right and so basically

1297
01:02:27,429 --> 01:02:32,319
to avoid going to full 3d modeling for

1298
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,810
the scenes you pretty much don't ever

1299
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:39,760
want there to be any prospective

1300
01:02:33,809 --> 01:02:43,210
transform on the actual stuff on the

1301
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:47,020
actual scenery now you could prospective

1302
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:49,690
transform the people somehow but they

1303
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:51,759
have to line up with the scenery and so

1304
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:53,559
you can't really transform them

1305
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,110
completely willy-nilly right you still

1306
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:58,239
have to have some conceptualization of

1307
01:02:56,110 --> 01:03:03,550
what's going to happen

1308
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:09,609
and so I don't really know uh how to

1309
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:12,460
make that kind of trade-off right again

1310
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:14,110
I'm not really a 2-d game programmer and

1311
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:16,869
more of a 3d game programmer so it's

1312
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:19,990
kind of not it's not my area of

1313
01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:21,579
expertise like how to do like whatever

1314
01:03:19,989 --> 01:03:24,189
the hacks are that you might want to do

1315
01:03:21,579 --> 01:03:27,639
to make this sort of thing work more

1316
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:28,929
logistical II it's kind of a you know

1317
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:30,368
I'm sure it's a black art right like

1318
01:03:28,929 --> 01:03:31,509
it's like hey if you've done some to 2d

1319
01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:33,369
games you probably have a lot of tricks

1320
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:35,560
up your sleeve for like well this is how

1321
01:03:33,369 --> 01:03:43,420
I do covering this part of it or

1322
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:45,670
whatever uh so you know that's that's

1323
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:47,260
really all that is so I don't really

1324
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:49,690
have anything against the perspective

1325
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:52,230
scaling it's more just that like artwork

1326
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:58,240
wise in 2d it doesn't really super work

1327
01:03:52,230 --> 01:04:00,820
and you know you can you can do other

1328
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:02,439
things you could make little blocks and

1329
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:04,150
texture them you know you could sort of

1330
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,950
make it pseudo-3d there and then you'd

1331
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:07,690
be fine or you can do a number of things

1332
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:10,239
like that but I don't really want to go

1333
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:12,070
down those those roads I want handmade

1334
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:14,079
hero to just be using straight fit map

1335
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:15,730
part that's kind of you know one of the

1336
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,309
limitations that I was sort of saying it

1337
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:20,530
should have and so at that point I don't

1338
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:27,130
know that there's really that much you

1339
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:30,850
can do so yeah so it's yeah it's an

1340
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:33,150
issue I'm not sure what to do about that

1341
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:33,150
issue

1342
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:47,630
so it's the kid asked I may have missed

1343
01:04:45,858 --> 01:04:49,608
it but what's the reasoning for type

1344
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:51,588
definite be through 2x as a be through

1345
01:04:49,608 --> 01:04:53,389
two and not just use be through to its

1346
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:56,029
the same reason I tend to have like s 32

1347
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:59,239
x and u 3 2 X it's like if I don't care

1348
01:04:56,030 --> 01:05:00,859
what size the thing is i'll use the X so

1349
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:02,809
that like you know if for some reason

1350
01:05:00,858 --> 01:05:04,759
there was a platform where it's more

1351
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:07,730
efficient to use 64 bits to store the

1352
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:09,260
boolean because like operating on 32-bit

1353
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,909
registers it has a cost because it's

1354
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:13,700
like 64-bit native and doesn't like to

1355
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:15,500
downshift or something then it can that

1356
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:17,568
used to be a lot more relevant sort of a

1357
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:19,670
force of habit it's not super relevant

1358
01:05:17,568 --> 01:05:21,920
now like I don't know that the x64

1359
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:26,318
architecture cares at all whether you

1360
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:30,680
operate on a 64 or 32 16 or an eight I

1361
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:33,108
don't know I don't know about arm but

1362
01:05:30,679 --> 01:05:35,960
generally speaking they're definitely

1363
01:05:33,108 --> 01:05:37,909
have bent like I feel like there were

1364
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:40,789
definitely times in the past where there

1365
01:05:37,909 --> 01:05:43,549
have been architecture revisions where

1366
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:45,318
you end up in a situation where if you

1367
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:48,470
force the processor to downshift it gets

1368
01:05:45,318 --> 01:05:50,690
unhappy right so if you force the

1369
01:05:48,469 --> 01:05:53,809
processor to do an operation of some

1370
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:55,880
kind on a 16-bit value instead of a

1371
01:05:53,809 --> 01:06:00,529
32-bit value and it's 32 bit native it

1372
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:02,838
gets upset and it goes slower right so I

1373
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:04,160
don't actually know that we need to do

1374
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:06,380
this for a particular reason but my

1375
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,328
habit tends to be to type accident of

1376
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:11,599
things and so really most of all that

1377
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:12,980
that typedef was is to make it so that I

1378
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:17,720
don't have to think about it anymore i

1379
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:19,490
can just type the X if I want it and not

1380
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:21,348
if I don't so that's that's really all

1381
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:23,149
it is and it's the same for all the

1382
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:26,150
types that's just what the X means in

1383
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:28,160
general the X is just I'm telling you

1384
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:30,289
that I'm using 32-bit computing here but

1385
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:34,539
I don't care if you go up to 64 bit on

1386
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:36,800
me it wouldn't bother me right and

1387
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:38,599
technically in a lot of those places I

1388
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,359
could probably have called it a be 8x

1389
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:43,760
and so in a fair number of them but you

1390
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:46,190
know really I think part of the problem

1391
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:49,450
is just C is not particularly great at

1392
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:51,980
expressing things in size invariant ways

1393
01:06:49,449 --> 01:06:54,828
like a lot of equations you want to just

1394
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:57,170
specify and say you know look however

1395
01:06:54,829 --> 01:06:58,760
many bits you needed this to be four

1396
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:00,200
this to work out is how many bits the

1397
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,940
things should be or what you know it

1398
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:03,939
doesn't have a lot of that unfortunately

1399
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:15,019
let's see the size 'ok thought have the

1400
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:17,660
floor above transform with the widest

1401
01:07:15,019 --> 01:07:21,230
placement respective to the current

1402
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:24,639
floor until you jump over to it at which

1403
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:36,019
point the view cuts to be relative to

1404
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:38,179
the new current floor have the floor

1405
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:40,039
above transform with the widest

1406
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:44,929
placement respective to the current

1407
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:49,630
floor until you jump over to it at which

1408
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:49,629
point the view cuts to the relative I

1409
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:55,880
don't think I understand what you're

1410
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:58,640
saying I don't I don't think I followed

1411
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:01,039
that one demon Sookie I just watched

1412
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:03,739
your papers talk and I didn't get the

1413
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:06,798
minkowski sum exactly I don't get where

1414
01:08:03,739 --> 01:08:16,929
you deduce the points to subtract from

1415
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:22,609
each other uh that may require a more

1416
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:25,699
elaborate answer do you want it may be

1417
01:08:22,609 --> 01:08:28,460
asked that first thing on tomorrow's pre

1418
01:08:25,698 --> 01:08:29,659
stream and I could walk you through it

1419
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:32,298
I'm not sure exactly what you're talking

1420
01:08:29,659 --> 01:08:34,130
about but I have a guess but either way

1421
01:08:32,298 --> 01:08:35,838
I could walk through the portion of it

1422
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:38,298
that would probably explain that in a

1423
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:39,920
little more detail the the papers we

1424
01:08:38,298 --> 01:08:43,219
love talk obviously was not supposed to

1425
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,048
be a complete explanation of gjk because

1426
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:48,948
it was packed into like something like

1427
01:08:45,048 --> 01:08:54,469
15 minutes or something like that so you

1428
01:08:48,948 --> 01:08:55,939
know yeah it's a little bit fast but do

1429
01:08:54,469 --> 01:08:59,480
you explain on screen before so I can go

1430
01:08:55,939 --> 01:09:02,448
to air kiss uh you can if you're looking

1431
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:08,119
for like my old the original one where I

1432
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:10,159
talked about this you can in fact it's

1433
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:10,979
on the first page of Google if you just

1434
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:15,329
go to g JK

1435
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:18,949
a this right here this video from long

1436
01:09:15,329 --> 01:09:21,778
long long time ago you can actually

1437
01:09:18,949 --> 01:09:23,818
watch and it kind of should walk you

1438
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:26,460
through it maybe a little bit better I

1439
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:28,440
don't know I but if you want to watch

1440
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:42,810
that one it might answer your question

1441
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:45,298
but but it might not saina Crom for the

1442
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:47,370
stairs have you considered stairs on a

1443
01:09:45,298 --> 01:09:48,659
particular floor go down instead of up

1444
01:09:47,369 --> 01:09:58,229
then you wouldn't have to worry about

1445
01:09:48,659 --> 01:10:00,720
alpha uh I'm not sure that I understand

1446
01:09:58,229 --> 01:10:04,709
what the difference would be there like

1447
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:12,720
up stairs or stairs they don't go down

1448
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:14,220
or up there just stares right and you

1449
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,659
Trevor it's whichever way the player

1450
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,860
traverses them that determines whether

1451
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:19,430
they're going upstairs or downstairs

1452
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:19,429
right

1453
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,460
yeah an amusing antidote from the papers

1454
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:48,609
we love conferences they were like it's

1455
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:50,230
there they said it's going to be oh well

1456
01:10:48,609 --> 01:10:52,299
I'll tell out and out later then thus

1457
01:10:50,229 --> 01:10:54,519
Isaac question so instead of the above

1458
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:56,409
floor perspective transforming into

1459
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,480
place you move the stairs it stays still

1460
01:10:56,409 --> 01:11:00,960
and jump cuts the power perspective once

1461
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:04,238
you hit hop to a tile on the floor well

1462
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,039
yeah but the problem is in that case

1463
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:09,009
then I just I would just turn off the

1464
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:11,019
respective all together right the whole

1465
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:12,369
point of this is to have that

1466
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:16,449
perspective transform because it looks

1467
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:18,159
cool right so that's what I'm trying to

1468
01:11:16,448 --> 01:11:22,869
get if I wasn't trying to get that i

1469
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:24,550
could just turn it off entirely right so

1470
01:11:22,869 --> 01:11:26,019
I'm trying to figure out a way to kind

1471
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:27,880
of have my cake and eat it too which

1472
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,750
might not be possible but I'm just

1473
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,539
trying to figure out a way that I can

1474
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:36,789
get that nice look of the perspective

1475
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:40,810
floor coming into place but whoo-hoo but

1476
01:11:36,789 --> 01:11:42,729
without I having a discontinuity or

1477
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:44,680
weird motion that looks really strange

1478
01:11:42,729 --> 01:11:46,238
and I don't know that that might just be

1479
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:51,780
a complete fools are in it might be as

1480
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:51,779
that's not possible at all you know

1481
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:06,449
anyway so the anecdote from the comp the

1482
01:12:04,289 --> 01:12:10,350
conference was like they were like oh

1483
01:12:06,449 --> 01:12:13,710
you know we're going to have someone

1484
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:17,930
doing live captioning for it so that's

1485
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:20,789
so you know there you go and I'm like uh

1486
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:22,110
like that's not going to work for my

1487
01:12:20,789 --> 01:12:23,579
talk I'm like there's no way they're

1488
01:12:22,109 --> 01:12:24,779
gonna be able to take captions at the

1489
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:26,729
rate i talk and they're like no no no

1490
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:31,500
they're really good and I'm like okay

1491
01:12:26,729 --> 01:12:33,719
and then after the talk it was like nope

1492
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:34,949
they totally can keep up and the person

1493
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:39,119
who was doing the captain came up to me

1494
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:40,829
and was like was saying like well you

1495
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:43,170
know I was keeping up with you up to

1496
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:45,569
about 300 30 words per minute and then I

1497
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:48,180
had to like just kind of skip most of it

1498
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:50,219
that's like yeah I tried to tell them

1499
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:52,289
that but they didn't listen to me sorry

1500
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:54,390
like I because you know you can't type

1501
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:56,760
that fast no one can type that fast I

1502
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:58,260
certainly can't and you know

1503
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,400
stenographers are better than me and

1504
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:01,829
they're using shorthand but still

1505
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:03,359
they're not that much fast faster 330

1506
01:13:01,829 --> 01:13:05,989
words for a minute I mean my god no one

1507
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:05,989
can type that fast

1508
01:13:11,059 --> 01:13:15,000
William Bundy are you doing a whole

1509
01:13:13,078 --> 01:13:17,759
layer transfer at once or per object we

1510
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,520
actually have per object transform so

1511
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,170
you know we can do whatever we want I

1512
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,429
just can't think of what we would do

1513
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:25,649
that would work real well so I don't

1514
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:27,539
know santokh Ron yes but currently

1515
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:29,549
stairs are owned by the floor below them

1516
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:32,130
that's true if they were owned by the

1517
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:36,630
floor above them then you wouldn't see

1518
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:38,550
the stairs two floors above since they

1519
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:39,900
would be two floors above thus not

1520
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:41,699
blocking your weight and not ending an

1521
01:13:39,899 --> 01:13:42,839
alpha oh I see what you're saying you're

1522
01:13:41,698 --> 01:13:44,279
talking about from the thing i said

1523
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,650
before where I don't want to have them

1524
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:48,300
kind of on top of you that's true but

1525
01:13:46,649 --> 01:13:50,269
then you also wouldn't really be able to

1526
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:53,270
see to get on them in the first place

1527
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:53,270
right

1528
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:11,000
did buckminster fuller speak

1529
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:14,569
particularly fast pseudonym I have never

1530
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,609
heard him speak I suppose maybe there is

1531
01:14:14,569 --> 01:14:18,319
like a video of him did anyone record

1532
01:14:16,609 --> 01:14:22,099
that it would have been a long time ago

1533
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:23,779
but probably someone did maybe or order

1534
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:34,100
an audio recording I suppose this all we

1535
01:14:23,779 --> 01:14:36,340
would need not a video all right I'm

1536
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:38,539
going to go ahead and close it down

1537
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:39,860
thank you everyone for joining me for

1538
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:41,420
lips at a handmade here at so I'm

1539
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:42,319
peddler coating with you as always if

1540
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,609
you would like to follow along the

1541
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:46,189
series at home you could always pro to

1542
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:47,599
the game on handmade here org it comes

1543
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:50,059
with the source code so you could play

1544
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,470
around with it on your own machine we

1545
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:53,150
also have a forum site if you want to

1546
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:55,310
ask questions a patreon page want

1547
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:56,629
support the video series a schedule bot

1548
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:58,580
which tells you when we're going to be

1549
01:14:56,630 --> 01:15:01,640
live and an episode guide for catching

1550
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:04,550
up on old parts of the series I will be

1551
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:06,470
out here tomorrow night 8pm again same

1552
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:07,820
time same place hope to see you there

1553
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,840
when we will consider this problem

1554
01:15:07,819 --> 01:15:10,130
little bit more insight if there's

1555
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,420
anything we can do to save our nice

1556
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:12,739
little perspective transform which i

1557
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,090
think is kind of cool-looking and so I

1558
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:18,109
was kind of hoping that we could maybe

1559
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:20,840
we can't but will at least try okay so

1560
01:15:18,109 --> 01:15:22,339
that's about it for now I will see you

1561
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,289
guys tomorrow until then have fun

1562
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:27,220
programming and i'll see you on the

1563
01:15:24,289 --> 01:15:27,220
Internet take it easy
