1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
so one of the things that I get asked

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,270
about all the time on the stream now

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,378
especially because I've had hand paid in

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:10,230
the past and I've talked about it on the

5
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:13,079
stream is essentially like you know what

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,210
what do you do for you know physical

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,550
problems like pain problems or you know

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,010
aches and/or you know weird nerve

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,050
sensations sort of stuff if you do a lot

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,789
of programming or a really any job that

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,130
involves sitting down and typing most of

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,019
the day you know there's sort of this

13
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,028
undercurrent of everyone sort of has

14
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,919
these problems but nobody really knows

15
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:33,359
that much about them in our industry and

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,710
we don't really know necessarily what to

17
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,509
do and you know you might go on the

18
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,609
internet and do some searches or

19
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,710
something and find some kind of a you

20
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,210
know WebMD page with some ads on the

21
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,160
side and you read the symptoms and

22
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,049
you're like oh okay maybe this is what I

23
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,869
have maybe I should do this weird thing

24
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:51,058
that they're saying or something but

25
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:53,038
what we do at Molly rub get whenever we

26
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,078
have any sort of a problem with with

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,170
physical things related to work is we

28
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,239
ask dr. Emily sure so I asked her to

29
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,340
come today and talk to all of us about

30
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,728
you know essentially like what's the

31
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,469
real beginner you know the the novice

32
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:09,000
introduction from a medical professional

33
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,519
to people who don't really know anything

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,560
about this about how to like diagnose

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,959
and think about these problems so that

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,070
they can essentially get the the medical

37
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,809
help that they need right and you know

38
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,149
if you understand more what's happening

39
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,409
with your anatomy and more what's

40
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,359
happening with your you know nervous

41
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,250
system all sort of stuff you can ask the

42
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,039
right professional to help you and have

43
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,780
some idea of where you need to go or

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
what you might need to do to stop having

45
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,510
these kinds of problems so yeah without

46
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,219
further ado doctor am I sure

47
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,530
[Music]

48
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,530
[Applause]

49
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,489
good morning so so first of all I'll

50
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,280
give us a little bit of background you

51
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:53,140
know since we don't know anything about

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,228
you here I obviously know you personally

53
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,460
but what's what what got you into this

54
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:59,200
profession what got you into like

55
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,759
diagnosing sort of these sorts of

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,079
problems and helping people with them

57
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,570
because obviously you do a lot more than

58
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,739
just sort of problems that programmers

59
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:07,118
might have or something I know you do a

60
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,258
lot of work with like circus performers

61
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,569
and all these other sorts of things so

62
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:12,009
give us a little background there I grew

63
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:16,120
up kind of being a very physical person

64
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:19,179
and always was an athlete and a gymnast

65
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,469
specifically and a dancer and got into

66
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,510
circus when I was a kid and I've always

67
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:25,060
been a person who watches movement and

68
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,649
enjoys movement and I kind of knew I

69
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,159
wanted to do something with human bodies

70
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,500
and movement so eventually after

71
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,509
spending too much time or to start

72
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,639
amount of time performing and playing

73
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:37,929
around the world I went back to school

74
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,899
and I am now a doctor of physical

75
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:46,840
therapy which basically means I like

76
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:48,459
movement a physical therapist what we do

77
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,580
which I think most people don't actually

78
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,739
know is we are movement diagnosticians

79
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,959
so we look at the anatomy we look at the

80
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,819
biomechanics and we problem-solve how

81
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,969
all that works together and place

82
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,939
together to give you the symptoms or

83
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:07,120
your pain or just the weird way you walk

84
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:08,319
down the street so walking in front of

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,849
my office is always interesting because

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,259
I'm always staring at everyone going ooh

87
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:17,259
that it's weird but but yeah so that's

88
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:19,328
kind of my quick background I love

89
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:21,819
working with anybody who moves which is

90
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,989
pretty much everybody and I just find it

91
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,090
really interesting it's kind of like

92
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,739
what you guys do see you are faced with

93
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,840
a problem you need to find the answer to

94
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,549
and you are problem-solving it's the

95
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,129
same thing from my end it's all physics

96
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:34,780
and engineering levers pulleys the human

97
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:38,289
body is a really interesting simple

98
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:42,189
machine so in your you run your own

99
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:44,709
practice now and I was curious so do you

100
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:47,770
see a lot of people come in with kind of

101
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,060
pain or injuries related to doing work

102
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,620
at a computer is that a common thing

103
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,620
that you have or is it the kind of thing

104
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,450
that people just don't really know to

105
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,159
you know seek help for or going to the

106
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:59,799
wrong places for it's really interesting

107
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:04,270
because I would say most of the people I

108
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:06,189
see have pain due to the way they are

109
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,250
working whether or not they know it or

110
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:11,769
not so even if my circus people are

111
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,479
coming in usually so I treat a lot of

112
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,550
circus performers both students and

113
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,668
performers here in the Seattle community

114
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,680
and most of the circus students are not

115
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:23,079
full-time circus performers and they

116
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,030
spend their week sitting at their desk

117
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,848
and then their evenings and weekends

118
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:30,129
flying around on things and usually what

119
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:32,199
they're coming in for is certainly

120
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:33,519
contributed to by how they're sitting at

121
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,629
their desk and all the things I do like

122
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,240
this and then they all of a sudden want

123
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:39,610
to do this and they don't realize it

124
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,199
what we train our body for every day is

125
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,689
the things that we do so if you're

126
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,649
practicing this all the time this

127
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,449
becomes what you're good at

128
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:49,000
even if it's not a great shape for your

129
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,649
body and more specifically you know what

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,750
you're asking is do people come in for

131
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:56,949
this sometimes okay oh it's it's hard to

132
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,990
answer because I don't know who I'm not

133
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:00,848
seeing okay that's a good point so

134
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,408
people that come in to me yeah

135
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:03,908
absolutely every single person that

136
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:06,728
comes in with pain from work it's

137
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:09,098
totally coming in for work

138
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:10,870
that's okay so essentially what you're

139
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:13,180
saying there is that even though someone

140
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,579
may not be coming in and saying hey I'm

141
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,408
having problems I type all day and I get

142
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,300
this pain in my wrist or something

143
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:21,248
you do get situations where like someone

144
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,990
comes in and says I'm having pain for

145
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:24,759
this thing that I do on the weekend and

146
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,439
I you know I think it's that and you're

147
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,939
like yeah okay and you're you know

148
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,740
you're kind of like this and Stephanie I

149
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:31,389
can see that like probably part of the

150
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,759
problem is just your your musculature is

151
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,319
not you know sometimes I see people who

152
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,639
come in and I'm chatting with them about

153
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,770
stuff we're like oh yeah and I have this

154
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,120
thing when I'm working I see so it's

155
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:41,378
kind of like a little bit of a doorway

156
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,819
question there or whatever they call it

157
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,218
where it's like kind of like oh you know

158
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:47,050
by the way here's the actual thing and I

159
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:47,949
you know didn't mention that as part of

160
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,360
the thing right because they don't think

161
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:53,259
of it as a thing because it just happens

162
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,610
every day or I had a you know patients

163
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,870
come in and they're like oh yeah and

164
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,550
this thing but it's been happening to me

165
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,598
since I was 15 okay okay just because

166
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,919
it's been happening you since you're 15

167
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:05,009
does not mean it's not involved does not

168
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:09,308
mean it's not it's a normal occurrence

169
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:11,949
so let's let's dive into the to the sort

170
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:13,810
of science part here I have a list of

171
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:14,860
stuff that you sort of sent me that was

172
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,439
like here's the sorts of things we

173
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,430
should probably talk about and I think

174
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,990
I'm just going to start with those

175
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,610
because you kind of knit like I don't

176
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,348
even have like a basic understanding

177
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,360
really of how these sorts of things fit

178
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:26,918
together so I feel like I can't really

179
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,389
put them in a good order so tell me if

180
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,948
I'm going out of you don't feel like you

181
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,329
happens or times gonna kind of go by the

182
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,919
sorts of things you talked about so that

183
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:35,109
I you know hopefully something up right

184
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:38,378
so the first thing that you were talking

185
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,430
about is diagnosis versus symptoms

186
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:41,289
that's what you were saying and you

187
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,639
specifically mention the fact that like

188
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:46,870
doctors label symptoms not causes or

189
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,009
something like that you you said

190
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,478
something there and I wasn't really sure

191
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:51,158
what you meant so could you maybe start

192
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:53,139
with that and telling a little tussle

193
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:54,968
about like the diagnosis symptoms thing

194
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:57,848
and what you were thinking about sure so

195
00:06:54,968 --> 00:07:01,269
your traditional primary care doctor or

196
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:05,519
often orthopedist that you go into and

197
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:08,698
say hey I have low back pain

198
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,529
I am a computer and they're gonna go

199
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,840
great you have a diagnosis of low back

200
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,728
pain but what is that really your low

201
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,939
back pain is a symptom what's causing

202
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:19,139
the low back pain why is it there if I

203
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,550
look at someone's low back pain I'm like

204
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,478
well obviously it's musculoskeletal it's

205
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,889
how they're moving it's what they're

206
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:25,829
doing though

207
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:28,288
low back pain could be a lot of other

208
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:30,180
medical conditions that have a side

209
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:34,038
effect of low back pain or that symptom

210
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,750
so a lot of our medical system currently

211
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,430
doesn't have a good language of brown's

212
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,019
musculoskeletal pain and we're still

213
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,470
kind of learning and kind of developing

214
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:46,889
that language so a lot of the diagnoses

215
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:49,169
traditionally are not really helpful

216
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:50,970
they're a description of what you're

217
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:53,399
experiencing but they're really not

218
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,479
causational so again this is kind of

219
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,829
what I was talking about with physical

220
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,129
therapist says movement dies when

221
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:01,079
Diagnostics is we're kind of filling in

222
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:03,240
that void of we have it I have a

223
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,829
diagnosis system not all physical

224
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,329
therapy is growing and changing so there

225
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,519
are many different diagnostic systems

226
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:12,240
but the diagnosis system I use for

227
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:14,939
example with low back pain is you know I

228
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,069
diagnose by the cause movement cause so

229
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,168
okay you have low back pain do you have

230
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,639
it because every time you bend forward

231
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:22,288
and that's a stressor that bothers you

232
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,668
or every time you get a rotation which

233
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:25,680
could be because you're moving your arm

234
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:27,180
and that's pulling on your back so it's

235
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,978
of rotation diagnosis or reflection

236
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:34,408
diagnosis or the different movement

237
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:35,718
orientations of the back but knowing and

238
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:37,799
understanding that what you're

239
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,200
experiencing might just be a symptom of

240
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,908
something going on more globally in your

241
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,300
body it's really kind of important I

242
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:45,360
know

243
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,159
Casey's talked a lot about self

244
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,039
diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome what

245
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,208
kind hopefully get to that bitterness

246
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,309
but is that because of something

247
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,719
happening a wrist is that because it's

248
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,250
me happening your elbow at your shoulder

249
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,920
your neck there can be a lot of

250
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,269
different causes for the same diagnosis

251
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,059
yeah and I feel like that's one of those

252
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,679
sort of memes that got around was carpal

253
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,139
tunnel syndrome so now people just if

254
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,458
they're having some general problem here

255
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,929
they're like I must have carpal like

256
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,099
it's kind of this unfortunate thing

257
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,479
where they just think that and maybe

258
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,620
that has some of you that maybe it

259
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,750
doesn't or they don't even necessarily

260
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,009
know what they should be doing like do I

261
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,740
need to get surgery for this all of a

262
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:19,569
sudden or something

263
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,940
and not necessarily no but yeah I guess

264
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,730
we can put that down - we did - you had

265
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,130
the common ailments section here on the

266
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,899
diagnosis versus symptoms thing so is it

267
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:30,850
the case generally that you know if you

268
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,519
go to like a primary care physician

269
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,889
is it sort of like just well if you

270
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,600
happen to get one who knows about you

271
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:39,699
know movement mechanics or something

272
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,050
they may go oh I should probably refer

273
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,790
you to somebody who's gonna take a look

274
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:44,439
at this more carefully versus someone

275
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:45,610
who just doesn't think along those lines

276
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,500
and just goes like okay you know

277
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,480
prescribe some you know aspirin I'm like

278
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,460
like when you go to a primary care

279
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,620
physician is it generally the case that

280
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,629
they would be expected to properly refer

281
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,480
you in the case of a mechanical problem

282
00:09:55,629 --> 00:10:00,070
or is that just kind of hit or miss it's

283
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,590
it's hard to say how to say in Seattle

284
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,270
we've got great okay I'm we're here docs

285
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,190
in general and usually they're gonna

286
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:09,309
look at it and be that and and think

287
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,410
okay that is musculoskeletal problem and

288
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,969
they're really great at referring out to

289
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,159
physical therapy orthopedist whatever

290
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,540
they think is is appropriate primary

291
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,919
care Doc's are amazing because they have

292
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:19,689
such a wide breadth of knowledge and

293
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,979
their job is really to point you down

294
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,350
the correct Avenue and the correct

295
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,080
pathway so a good primary care doc yeah

296
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,670
is gonna is gonna either say yeah I

297
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,000
think this is solvable with the

298
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:32,620
contribute of treatment whether that's

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,889
take these NSAIDs go home ice whatever

300
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:38,259
or and come back later and then we'll

301
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:42,879
see or send you on to another

302
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:48,340
practitioner my feeling is why try to

303
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:50,470
mask it again with Ison comeback that

304
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,820
whatever you every generally if it's a

305
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,070
it's a more long-term problems

306
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,650
repetitive stress injury they tend to

307
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,820
come back if you fell down the stairs

308
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,829
you don't tend to fall down the stairs

309
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,560
repeatedly so that's gonna be something

310
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:08,500
that if you do fall down the stairs

311
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:11,919
repeatedly so yeah and again just

312
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,730
finally on that note there it's like so

313
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,069
if you want to get diagnosed for

314
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,389
something like this like if you want

315
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,560
maybe you don't have access to a good

316
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,449
primary care you know wherever you are

317
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,500
whatever or you you just you would like

318
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,410
to have someone take a look at your

319
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,909
movement mechanics I is physical therapy

320
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:29,649
something you can

321
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:30,850
go to directly or is this something that

322
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,799
you have to go through Amanda thought

323
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,060
about it for like you know after we're

324
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,500
sort of done talking about about all

325
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,000
this stuff today if people are like I

326
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,370
would like to talk to specialists in

327
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,720
this because obviously it in you know 90

328
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,919
minutes they're not going to now

329
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,190
suddenly be able to do this themselves

330
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,929
how you know how do they go about

331
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,280
accessing that that care or even

332
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,839
figuring out who a good practitioner in

333
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:54,549
their area might be is there something

334
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,899
they can turn to yeah so legislation

335
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:57,339
varies from state to state most states

336
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,039
have some form of direct sac direct

337
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,389
access to physical therapy so in most

338
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,730
states you can show up at your physical

339
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:07,389
therapist and make an appointment and

340
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,879
get seen I am NOT up to date on which

341
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:10,870
states are which at the moment

342
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,370
Washington is one of them Washington is

343
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,470
absolutely one of them some states are

344
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,299
like you can see a PT for 30 days as

345
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,230
long as there's progress and all that

346
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:21,729
stuff

347
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:23,830
other states that I not sure about they

348
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,639
do require doctors referral and if you

349
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,800
have a good relationship with your

350
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,179
primary care doctors you can basically

351
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,289
usually pretty easy depending on their

352
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:32,019
relationship with you and how well they

353
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:34,599
know you there was a second part to that

354
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:36,610
question well be the second part

355
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,430
question was sort of like let's say that

356
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:42,310
well and I guess this is sort of guess

357
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:43,839
the fact that if you're going to get

358
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:45,849
help for something like this obviously

359
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,170
you may have preferences or you may want

360
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,180
to know that you know you're going to

361
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:50,379
somebody especially you mentioned

362
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:51,669
there's many different systems of

363
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:56,019
diagnosis which is a question I wanted

364
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:58,990
to ask you about later you know is there

365
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:01,240
some reading you can do or a place you

366
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,129
can go online to find out more about the

367
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,750
physical therapists or other people who

368
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:06,309
would do this sort of thing in your area

369
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,840
so that you can make an informed

370
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,939
decision about who you go to because I

371
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,430
mean just like any medical care not

372
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,770
everyone is going to be the same kind of

373
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:17,739
you know treatment so I didn't know is

374
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:20,379
there like a some kind of a resource you

375
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,700
can use to find physical area or even if

376
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:23,830
it was something in just a case of like

377
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,030
I want to go to you know say I'm out of

378
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,950
state or like I like the way Emily

379
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:29,319
diagnoses problems I want to go to

380
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:32,020
someone who follows that same school of

381
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,890
this kind of you know choice that make

382
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:37,389
sense yes it absolutely does there are

383
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:38,449
resources there's the American Physical

384
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:41,000
Therapy organist

385
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,759
Association and they have state chapters

386
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,009
and there's often listings of providers

387
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,750
on their site it doesn't it tells you

388
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:48,799
who's still involved in the national

389
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,399
organization but doesn't tell you much

390
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:54,139
more about them I certainly love the

391
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,459
word-of-mouth network if you really are

392
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,199
lost and don't know where to go often

393
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,970
that's where a primary care provider can

394
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,560
be a good resource as well but like hey

395
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,090
I've heard good things about this person

396
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,419
or that person because they're in your

397
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:07,519
local community and and know a lot of

398
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:10,219
the different kind of schools of thought

399
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,069
may have their own referral basis and

400
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:17,149
kind of lists on different networks mine

401
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:20,480
does not though we do have our own

402
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:23,059
spreadsheet that we have internally so I

403
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,889
can open up if people are interested

404
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:27,019
they're welcome to email me and I can

405
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:29,659
see if I can make that available and/or

406
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:32,299
possibly personally respond depending on

407
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:33,919
what the demand is but yes the the

408
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:36,949
school of thought that I was trained in

409
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:40,490
is movement system impairments so it's

410
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:42,920
really looking at things on a movement

411
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,240
centric model so some physical

412
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,620
therapists practice more joint centric

413
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,269
model they'll look at the joint or the

414
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,490
tissue that they believe to be injured

415
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:51,199
and kind of work out from there and I'm

416
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,930
generally looking more movement and

417
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,520
working kind of inward and that is not

418
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:59,029
necessarily unique to the school of

419
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,590
thought but I am part of but it's just

420
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:05,720
kind of different mentalities to kind of

421
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:06,769
get the same problems so just I I mean I

422
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,629
sort of understand what you're saying

423
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:12,139
but I'm not totally clear so you keep

424
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:13,850
you have like sort of a subnetwork like

425
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:20,360
that you guys know about it we have a

426
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:22,519
Facebook group it's really okay so

427
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,480
basically like that's so so that there

428
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,649
is sort of sort of a professional it's

429
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,840
not an organization technically but a

430
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:31,669
professional sort of network where

431
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,399
people do know each other but that's not

432
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:36,709
necessarily exposed to the patients who

433
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,159
just is generally browsing but if people

434
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:42,400
really wanted to they could email you or

435
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:46,100
talk to you about the okay

436
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,759
so let's move on to talking about the

437
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,740
actual nitty-gritty here so someone

438
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,309
comes in with this kind of a problem

439
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,570
like something

440
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:55,789
where it's gonna probably be

441
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,778
work-related or use baby they don't come

442
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,250
in with some this work later but you

443
00:15:56,778 --> 00:16:01,460
suspect based on what you're seeing that

444
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,778
it's gonna be work-related so what sorts

445
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,970
of things do you start looking for like

446
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:06,110
how do you what is this kind of you know

447
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,580
when you just first start looking at

448
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,659
someone how they're moving I know as

449
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,180
someone who's gone through this process

450
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:13,069
like you do it very much like a software

451
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,539
engineer actually would approach well a

452
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,190
good software engineer would approach

453
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:18,559
debugging a problem where you kind of go

454
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,029
like okay I'm gonna start doing a bunch

455
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,528
of testing and getting sort of

456
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:22,700
information about what's going on can

457
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:24,620
you just give us a little bit

458
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,940
introduction to like that process and

459
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,950
what you're looking for how you're

460
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,690
putting those pieces together in sort of

461
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,640
like maybe an abstract sentence

462
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,790
so when someone walks in the door I have

463
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:35,870
a systematic exam that I do and it kind

464
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:37,399
of almost doesn't matter what they walk

465
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,990
in the doorway I'm gonna do the same

466
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,389
exam because it's gonna help me pick up

467
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,830
the bits and pieces that I may not have

468
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:44,299
thought to check in the first place the

469
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,850
things that I don't know that I don't

470
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:49,159
know okay so by having a systematic exam

471
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,720
I run through everything and I can get a

472
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,338
more global picture and kind of see how

473
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,769
the pieces fit together so even if I do

474
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,960
test one and two and I'm like yeah it's

475
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:58,519
probably coming from this and that I

476
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,230
want to confirm at about ten more times

477
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:05,629
so I really have a full exam that I do

478
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,740
so I start almost always I have the

479
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,010
person in standing I just look how

480
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,170
they're standing before that usually I'm

481
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:13,279
talking to them in the office and we're

482
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,990
taking a subjective we're kind of

483
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,519
getting an idea of what their problems

484
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,049
are and all that what they don't know is

485
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:32,389
I'm generally looking at them the entire

486
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:33,710
time looking at how theirs today so so

487
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,290
yeah so I'm kind of doing a little

488
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,090
sussing out before we even start but my

489
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,859
official start to my exam isn't standing

490
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:41,449
and I look at their postures look how

491
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:43,009
they're carrying their body and how

492
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,840
they're holding themselves in space and

493
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:46,279
that indicates to me probably how

494
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:51,549
they're doing it throughout their day to

495
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:53,450
some degree what's fascinating about

496
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:55,220
specifically the shoulders because I

497
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,630
know probably most of you if you do have

498
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,950
pain it's gonna be more in the upper

499
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,150
body unless it's low back pain because a

500
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,340
lot of people was sitting all day or

501
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,360
standing desks now have stuff going on

502
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:04,740
the lower body but

503
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,869
I'll keep it to the upper body for the

504
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,029
moment but what's fascinating to me

505
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:10,889
about the upper body and shoulders in

506
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:15,089
particular is that they're not really

507
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:16,500
attached to our body which allows to do

508
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:19,679
cool things like spin our arms in

509
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,539
circles but if you think about the

510
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,690
shoulder girdle let's see if I can pull

511
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,759
it up here yes we are trying to try our

512
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:31,880
mental thing here where we actually have

513
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:31,879
an atlas of human anatomy we can search

514
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:50,029
other diagrams too many scapula there's

515
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:53,340
so many scapula's let's see if I can do

516
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:57,210
something better when I was looking

517
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:59,369
through this atlas I was kind of shocked

518
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,130
at the number of details in the diagrams

519
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:11,250
I don't really like to think about my

520
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:13,470
body as having all of these things okay

521
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:17,759
let's let's play with this cuz it's here

522
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:25,500
okay okay so you can draw right I can

523
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:28,500
totally relate so this is the area I'm

524
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:32,339
kind of talking about here that is your

525
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,220
scapula this guy that's triangle which

526
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:39,599
is your wing sticking out on your back

527
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:41,250
this here your color in between those

528
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,049
two works it's it's your rib cage so you

529
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,589
can't like just poke and get your

530
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:48,059
scapular you have to recover but what's

531
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:51,089
interesting is that you're only attached

532
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:53,069
by a joint right here and what that is

533
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,689
is that your sternum right there and if

534
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:56,429
you look at all of these bones and how

535
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,140
heavy that arm is with all that muscle

536
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,140
that's the only little joint holding it

537
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,509
up that's probably not doing very much

538
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:06,660
so you've got this giant structure kind

539
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:09,000
of pulling off your body and what's

540
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,940
holding it on is all the muscles which

541
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,490
is so very cool to me because it gives

542
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,930
me so much information so you've got

543
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,750
this arm just hanging off the body and

544
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,830
just by looking

545
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,259
have someone's holding their arm I can

546
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:22,809
see what muscles might be stiffer or

547
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:24,789
tighter what muscles are longer shorter

548
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:26,740
how they might move when they go to move

549
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:28,750
their arm overhead and all sorts of

550
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,789
really neat stuff just by how they kind

551
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:33,130
of hold their shoulder in space it's my

552
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:34,119
first test like I'm not even having them

553
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,410
do anything yet I'm just having them

554
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:39,549
stand there but you can see so much

555
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:42,730
because of how flexible this complex is

556
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:44,319
the shoulder girdle complex so it's kind

557
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,329
of cool and there's something can I ask

558
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,109
a follow-up question there and if you

559
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:53,529
want to keep going okay

560
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:56,379
can you what you're welcome to do can

561
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:58,000
you unpack a little bit because one of

562
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,590
the things you just mentioned there was

563
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,319
sort of something that I didn't used to

564
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:05,079
think about until having problems with

565
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:08,289
this sort of thing which is that I don't

566
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:11,529
think everyone realizes necessarily that

567
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:14,049
where their joints are by default has

568
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:17,410
something to do with how their muscles

569
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:20,289
have been used like I never it's not

570
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,490
necessarily that unusual when you say it

571
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:23,619
but it's just not something that I think

572
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,509
ever crossed my mind so could you maybe

573
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:28,479
like give a little bit of background on

574
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:30,789
how that works like how muscles change

575
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,680
how they situate things based on their

576
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,759
use or you know I don't even really not

577
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,410
ask the question cuz I'm not really sure

578
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,599
I understand exactly how it works but

579
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:41,650
you know what I mean I do it's a very

580
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:43,569
it's a pretty complex question to fully

581
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,700
appreciate what's going on you have to

582
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,809
appreciate how much of its going on like

583
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,789
you were saying you look at the fatless

584
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:52,269
and you're like there's so much stuff

585
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:53,680
that and so as you come to understand

586
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:56,740
what all that stuff is and what all that

587
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,840
stuff does you can start to kind of see

588
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,960
through the skin okay you can start

589
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:03,939
seeing like oh this shoulder is tipped

590
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,279
forward a bit so if the shoulders tip

591
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,870
forward what does that mean to me what's

592
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:09,160
going on the inside well the structures

593
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,659
in the front are gonna be stiffer than

594
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,580
the structures in the back what does

595
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,259
that mean stiffer than yes in the back

596
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:15,849
so stiffer means that you're probably

597
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:18,519
using the muscle more so it's probably

598
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:19,959
stronger and therefore it's kind of

599
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:22,990
winning this tug-of-war so if you think

600
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,140
of muscles as Springs okay they contract

601
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:28,059
and expand so you can kind of get that

602
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,190
analogy if you think of muscles as

603
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:31,379
Springs I mostly

604
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,519
use in a shortened position all the time

605
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,010
so if you're always using your bicep and

606
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,740
it's always here it's going to be

607
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:39,299
stiffer relative to your tricep and

608
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,500
you're probably gonna stand with your

609
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:47,480
arm in a little bit more than two

610
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:52,140
position so that's okay this is great so

611
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,809
when I'm moving you know around is is

612
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,090
that that's increased tension on the

613
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:58,409
spring at its default position like this

614
00:22:57,089 --> 00:23:01,349
because we're basically saying like okay

615
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,509
my rest state this thing is now shorter

616
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:06,449
which means that my musculature moves

617
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:07,920
compensated the other muscles are longer

618
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,960
than I guess essentially in their rest

619
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,670
state is this a property of the muscles

620
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,500
size meaning does that mean this muscle

621
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:19,800
got shorter this way or does it a

622
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,480
property of like the brain telling this

623
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,069
to be this contracted at rest

624
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,299
like like who do you know what I'm

625
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,339
saying like what is actually what

626
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:28,649
causing that shortness and the longness

627
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:30,480
that that puts it into a new position at

628
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,570
rest so our bodies are really really

629
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,220
good at being efficient okay so if we

630
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:36,869
are constantly doing one thing or one

631
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,549
pattern over and over and over again our

632
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:39,750
body likes to take shortcuts okay so

633
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:41,279
they're like well you always are bending

634
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,049
that arm so let's just keep that arm a

635
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,420
little bit

636
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:50,309
what kind of just start there and that's

637
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:52,590
neurological meaning yes yes to all of

638
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:53,639
it um it is neurological because your

639
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:57,149
brain is telling your body to do these

640
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,500
things but then long-term and even

641
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,910
relatively short-term like if you're

642
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,380
sitting at a chair for like four hours a

643
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,300
day your body will start to make changes

644
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,400
okay your body will start to lay down

645
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:07,980
different tissue structure in your

646
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,330
muscles to help support they don't have

647
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,579
to constantly send that signal to fire

648
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:13,679
fire fire fire fire thankfully as we

649
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:15,000
stand back up again our body will change

650
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,980
that issue back to a good contractile

651
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,490
muscle tissue it's our bodies are highly

652
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:23,370
adaptable and super super efficient so

653
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:27,240
yes it is neurological saying yes fire

654
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:30,599
that muscle it is also physiological in

655
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,299
that our muscles when they contract we

656
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:34,349
kind of have these two things sliding

657
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,569
over each other and that's how they

658
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:38,369
shorten and they've got these little

659
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:40,629
oars and they kind of pull it very very

660
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:42,879
cool that it happened so fast

661
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,610
but instead of kind of hanging out here

662
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,290
they'll start hanging out here because

663
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:49,119
again it's more efficient because I know

664
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:51,940
you're gonna bend it again to go there

665
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,889
and so if you're not ever using that

666
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,009
range of the muscle it's not going to be

667
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:58,630
as available but as I said with standing

668
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:00,970
up after sitting all day at work it's

669
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,400
highly changeable so if you start in

670
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,140
this particular example using your

671
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,460
tricep and fully extending your arm and

672
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,940
not working in that shortened position

673
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:14,650
all the time it changes so essentially

674
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:16,539
the I guess is break down into very

675
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,580
short term or short term and long term

676
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:21,129
effects in that sense meaning pretty

677
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:23,710
quickly my muscles will actually pick up

678
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,360
new neurological starting points

679
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,940
basically like over you know not very

680
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,469
not too long they'll maybe do this thing

681
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,049
where as it sounds like you're sort of

682
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:34,450
saying once I get them into that sort of

683
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:37,089
rest position they may actually start to

684
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,950
change their shape eventually or is that

685
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:40,149
never happens well we know that will

686
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:45,730
eventually happen but usually you're

687
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:48,880
casted like you're mostly just the

688
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,380
actual mental where am i keeping yeah

689
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,120
it's mental it's also the strength of

690
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,210
the muscle so because you get stronger

691
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,909
so you're getting that passive spring

692
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,309
get stiffer and thicker ok and the other

693
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,350
spring is kind of this flimsy loose

694
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,879
spring and so at rest you've got a

695
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:05,919
tighter spring pulling this way then

696
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,810
you've got lean that way so a stronger

697
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,400
muscle in the sense of like literally

698
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:11,349
like a body builder stronger muscle like

699
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,290
I'm building muscle when the muscle

700
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:18,639
builds up it becomes tensor by default

701
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:21,039
rest so if you are always doing biceps

702
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,180
biceps biceps and which essentially

703
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,680
extend like this all day long you were

704
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,539
doing but if you're always doing bicep

705
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,670
curls for example and you're never doing

706
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:29,829
anything for your tricep you will just

707
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,320
have a stiffer bicep spring then your

708
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:34,480
tricep spring so it doesn't when a

709
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,679
muscle necessarily even when you're

710
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,299
talking about building muscle that has

711
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,039
nothing to do with like the you know

712
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:40,990
physical therapy aspects or the pain a

713
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,809
so 74 just building muscle normally at

714
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,940
that point it's not just that the

715
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:48,129
muscles capacity to pull when it wants

716
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,350
to pull is more it's sort of in some

717
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:53,740
sense always pulling so if it gets

718
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:54,039
stronger its base level of pull is just

719
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,710
gonna

720
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,059
stronger that's just how it doesn't yes

721
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,590
but ideally everything's getting

722
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:02,259
stronger together so you're trying

723
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:04,629
definitely I mean going in and doing

724
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:07,869
like one exercise is probably not the

725
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:11,050
best but global exercise is really a

726
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:12,879
lovely thing okay yeah keeping that

727
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:15,519
balance because our our body's like

728
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,840
balance they they are built on the

729
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,849
system of balance you think chemically

730
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:23,230
we our bodies want to be in homeostasis

731
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:26,799
we we don't want if you eat I don't know

732
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,829
a ton of acidic foods for example your

733
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,450
body will not become more acidic because

734
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:32,589
our bodies are always want balances and

735
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,509
the same things for to for our muscles

736
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:35,829
our muscles want to keep the same length

737
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:37,359
on this side it's the attention on this

738
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:39,279
side as this side so they get nice even

739
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:42,369
pull and that's how everything kind of

740
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,839
stays happy and healthy so let's go back

741
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,339
to the shoulder example that yes I think

742
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,959
that sorry I just want to unpack this I

743
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:49,779
think I sort of start out with me

744
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,640
knowing roughly what's going on yeah so

745
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:54,099
okay so back to the shoulder example

746
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,780
somebody has their shoulder and you can

747
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:58,980
kind of see that's you know in an

748
00:27:55,779 --> 00:28:01,059
unusual position so that you know

749
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,220
positional information is sort of now

750
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:06,609
telling you okay now I have some

751
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:09,130
information about how the default rest

752
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:10,839
you know tension on each of these muscle

753
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,730
groups is and I can see that it's a

754
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:15,639
little wrong meaning one of them is too

755
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,670
tense at rest and that could be causing

756
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,259
problems why so why do they start to

757
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:23,320
let's get into the sort what our

758
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:25,240
problems at this point is now I'm gonna

759
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:26,919
rephrase but you said a little bit it's

760
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,859
not that passive resting tension that

761
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,779
causes problems it's the things that

762
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:37,689
you're doing that's causing that passive

763
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:40,720
rustic tension okay so I'm gonna kind of

764
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:43,779
go around Google and we're gonna yeah so

765
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,660
I found that I saw this neat little

766
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:48,970
thing so this is the shoulder from the

767
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,940
back so you've got your arm bone here

768
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,829
and oh I see a raisin that's not gonna

769
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:57,160
work the arm bone here and the shoulder

770
00:28:53,829 --> 00:29:00,460
blade here and to bring an arm up

771
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,140
overhead for example the first 30

772
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,519
degrees of your arm motion is just the

773
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,259
humerus spinning in the socket so just

774
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,250
that arm bone moving out to the side

775
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:12,230
about thirty degrees

776
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:16,039
and then as that goes up overhead you

777
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,930
get a two-to-one ratio of two degrees of

778
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:20,950
the humerus moving for every one degree

779
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:23,720
of the shoulder blade moving as well and

780
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:26,210
that all has to work together and if it

781
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,700
doesn't work together that's when you

782
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:31,549
can get pain or problems at the shoulder

783
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,580
joint at the neck the even down the arm

784
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:36,289
depending on kind of where you're

785
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:38,629
predisposed to kind of get those issues

786
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:40,430
but as that arm goes overhead so if you

787
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,660
guys are feeling bold and you want to

788
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,310
not hit the person next to you've take

789
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,779
care of up in front of you and bring it

790
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:47,029
up overhead you should feel your

791
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:54,139
shoulder blade coming almost underneath

792
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:55,910
your armpit this is awesome but you

793
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,350
should feel your arm kind of spin and

794
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:00,019
then your filler blades spin around your

795
00:29:57,349 --> 00:30:01,279
back and come up so someone who walks in

796
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:03,109
and the shoulder is already kind of

797
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,430
tipped forward and it can be just tipped

798
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:06,139
forward or can you rotate around the

799
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,289
outside or it can be a lots of different

800
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:11,360
things depending on how they're moving

801
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:12,980
that spin roll a glide of all those

802
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:17,779
joints moving together is not gonna

803
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:20,000
happen as well so they're gonna show

804
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:22,579
that in pretty much all their movements

805
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,900
or a lot of their movements probably

806
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:26,319
especially when they're in a position

807
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,940
that they have pain in so that's kind of

808
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,529
what I'm seeing when I'm seeing you know

809
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,500
something like this it's like okay well

810
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:35,359
that's gonna tell me that they're doing

811
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,220
something else that's strange or they're

812
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,990
just sitting all day like this and

813
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,180
they're never gonna they're never coming

814
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,430
back up so that I'm gonna see them find

815
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,769
that their back muscles aren't as strong

816
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:48,220
because what makes that shoulder blade

817
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:53,650
go around is three different muscles

818
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:56,829
you've got your upper trapezius up there

819
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:59,120
your lower trapezius going down that way

820
00:30:56,829 --> 00:31:01,220
and your serratus anterior which is my

821
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,479
favorite muscle right now going that way

822
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:06,110
I'm sorry right now

823
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,980
it changes okay you have like a muscle

824
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:11,569
of the Month Club or something it's six

825
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,839
months or so it kind of goes with the

826
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:16,519
wind that would be a nice webpage the

827
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,869
muscle of the muscle where you could go

828
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,869
and read about this muscle

829
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:25,319
sorry continue no that's cool so you've

830
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,039
kind of got three directions of pull

831
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:30,929
you've got kind of an an up and because

832
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,210
it attaches on this corner it's gonna

833
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,970
pull it around a little bit and you've

834
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,319
got a down and again because attaches on

835
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:41,970
this corner it's going to pull it down

836
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:45,569
and around a bit and you've got forward

837
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:47,670
and again up so that pulls that shoulder

838
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:49,139
blade into that upward rotation so now

839
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,150
if you've got this forward shoulder

840
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,230
thing cuz you're sitting there taping

841
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,559
all day

842
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:58,319
a lot of times the back musculature

843
00:31:54,558 --> 00:32:00,089
isn't it quite doing its job so the

844
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,279
muscles back here like the trapezius and

845
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:05,789
sometimes even the serratus here isn't

846
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:09,359
doing its job because serratus pulls the

847
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:10,529
shoulder blade forward and up but the

848
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,139
thing that pulls the shoulder forward

849
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:16,940
and down is your PEC muscle in the front

850
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,140
we all pretty much know which is

851
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,429
fighting it so sometimes that that turns

852
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,990
off he's like well shoulder blades

853
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:22,620
already getting pulled forward I'm going

854
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,539
on vacation

855
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:26,939
because again bodies are efficient

856
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:28,710
because so it just already knows it's

857
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,750
there so the brain is not trying to move

858
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,039
its dirty forward I've already found a

859
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,910
way to do that so now I'm just gonna do

860
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:37,920
this weird other thing it's not quite

861
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,870
that bad but when you start when you

862
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,110
look at it all day long you start to to

863
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:44,759
seeing these things pretty clearly so

864
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:46,289
it's not necessarily the resting

865
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:50,819
position that's doing it it's maybe the

866
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:52,558
active position of typing all day or the

867
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,019
active motion of doing this all day

868
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,250
which I don't know why you would do but

869
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,480
maybe if your if your career is

870
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,940
different you're doing more but reaching

871
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,259
your ask or your mousing but you're like

872
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,759
mousing like this for some position

873
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:06,089
which actually isn't probably that

874
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:08,549
unusual probably not too high yeah it's

875
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:10,289
it's pretty common so there's lots of

876
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:11,399
different ways to kind of create weird

877
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,928
postures that will do weird things to

878
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,370
you I wanted to ask I'm sorry I'm

879
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:16,559
putting up this yeah no it's fine cuz

880
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:17,519
bucks I'm really cool it does kind of

881
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:18,899
Akko up there

882
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,160
I like the muscle drawing to it the

883
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,830
strands I was like oh that's pretty cool

884
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,470
so the you were talking about sort of

885
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:29,159
the movement ratios there so essentially

886
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,870
the your brain has to sort of contract

887
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,400
these at resolved rates like it's like

888
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:32,998
this one has to contract twice as fast

889
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,229
as this one

890
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:36,629
to move this in position and then I've

891
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:38,159
got so this sort of the function that

892
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:40,918
we're looking at here is kind of this

893
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,719
like piecewise thing it's it's only one

894
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,369
of them is going then it's a two-to-one

895
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:46,499
ratio of two of them and then another

896
00:33:44,368 --> 00:33:47,968
one might kick in this is right well

897
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:49,739
yeah I mean the two-to-one ratio is to

898
00:33:47,969 --> 00:33:53,249
the end of the range to the end up with

899
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:55,288
180 degrees total 120 degrees of our

900
00:33:53,249 --> 00:34:04,499
motion 60 degrees of scapula motion and

901
00:33:55,288 --> 00:34:05,818
so is that is that process part of I

902
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:07,288
don't want to call it an impairment

903
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:08,548
because that's probably the wrong term

904
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:10,168
that is the term I would probably use

905
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:12,989
I'd use a movement and movement

906
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:15,179
impairment okay so if you are having a

907
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:19,078
movement impairment are we talking

908
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:21,358
primarily about the that sort of muscle

909
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:22,889
rest situation that you sort of were

910
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,328
describing that I'm getting a better

911
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:28,889
handle on now but probably still not

912
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:32,129
quite yet exactly it is the is that

913
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,450
function is the brains you know series

914
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:35,909
of things that it's firing and how

915
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,648
that's firing is that also implicated

916
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,690
sometimes all the times that are so

917
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:42,898
meaning it could be that the muscles at

918
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:45,240
rest even are okay but your brains

919
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:46,888
function for moving them as wrong and so

920
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,209
now instead of two to one it's three to

921
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,769
one or instead of two to one it kicks in

922
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,690
throughout time can you commute like

923
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:54,328
yeah we may not know all this stuff but

924
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,769
what we do know yeah so sometimes

925
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:57,089
somebody walks in the door and their

926
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,798
movement and their standing postures

927
00:34:57,088 --> 00:34:59,969
really normal again we only got to the

928
00:34:58,798 --> 00:35:02,449
first part of the exam we got to

929
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:06,449
standing and then we got sidetracked so

930
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:07,649
which is great but but this is what I do

931
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:11,358
not Susan I look at how they move their

932
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:12,960
arm for an upper of our body exams so

933
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,788
sometimes people walk in with a

934
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,650
completely normal posture but they don't

935
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:18,778
have the right neuromuscular

936
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,650
coordination to make the movements

937
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:22,440
happen at the right time in the right

938
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,450
place sometimes you know everything fits

939
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,750
and you see it all together but usually

940
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:31,108
it's not the resting posture that's

941
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:34,199
causational it's a symptom it is a part

942
00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:37,920
of the entire square lay of symptoms

943
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:42,149
that you see or patterns squarely what

944
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,730
is that you you okay this is a regular I

945
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:47,490
don't know

946
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:49,679
I use it it's a a grouping of symptoms

947
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:52,519
okay sorry

948
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,519
Lucas Thomas

949
00:35:55,409 --> 00:36:01,618
so yes the rusting posture is almost

950
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:04,109
never called the cause the resting

951
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,640
posture is occurring because of how the

952
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:11,759
person is moving in their daily life

953
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:13,440
okay yeah well I guess if we sort of go

954
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,589
further into the second part of the exam

955
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,630
thing so when you are you know starting

956
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:20,519
to ask that mean because a lot of times

957
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,550
that exam is sort of like you know try

958
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:24,869
doing this or you will sort of position

959
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,700
the person right you'll like put them

960
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:28,980
into a position and you'll ask them to

961
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,539
like push or pull or something like this

962
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,039
can you talk a little bit about that

963
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:33,659
like what's that's checking for how

964
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,400
those sorts of things go or is that is

965
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:36,598
that the best thing to talk about next

966
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,710
or would you rather talk about like

967
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,869
nerves and stuff first I don't know

968
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,639
which one's gonna be better I can go

969
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:42,990
either way I'm happy to continue going

970
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:49,650
but let's talk about say for example

971
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:51,118
because sort of yeah so once I'm done

972
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:53,099
looking some at somebody standing still

973
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,900
I'm gonna watch how they move so I have

974
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:56,369
them do basic movements like bring your

975
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,400
arms up bring your arms down bring your

976
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:01,170
arms out rotate your arms and if any of

977
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,750
those causes pain I want to see if I can

978
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,220
then eliminate their pain by grabbing a

979
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,719
hold say of the shoulder blade moving it

980
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:07,828
where I want it to go and see if that

981
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,058
eliminates your symptoms because that

982
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:10,798
gives me a ton of information oh you

983
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:12,720
have pain when you do it well when I do

984
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:16,500
it for you and theoretically a better

985
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,909
pattern is it is it less painful is it

986
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,059
does it change how your symptoms are

987
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:22,500
occurring I will then have them do

988
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:24,809
things in different positions I will

989
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,429
test the strength of muscles and when I

990
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,869
test the strength of muscles I'm looking

991
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:31,769
for a couple different things I'm

992
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:34,680
looking for okay sure is a muscle strong

993
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:36,480
is it strong enough to do its job but

994
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:38,279
that's not the primary thing I'm looking

995
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,599
for what I'm actually looking for is are

996
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,700
you actually using the muscle I'm

997
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,410
telling you to use if I put you in a

998
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:44,818
position that is optimal to make that

999
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:47,368
muscle fire and you're using everything

1000
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:49,380
else it's telling me a lot about how

1001
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:51,480
you're moving throughout your day so I'm

1002
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,940
like okay use this muscle exactly and

1003
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,079
then you're

1004
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,840
you know and I'm like pull your shoulder

1005
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,130
black back and you go mm-hmm oh that's

1006
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,930
not right

1007
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,090
so I'm looking for how you choose to

1008
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:03,699
hold the position with the muscle and

1009
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:05,920
then if your position is good you're

1010
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:07,779
firing the muscle properly if I resist

1011
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,460
that do you still continue to use that

1012
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,380
muscle to do it and how strong is it or

1013
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:14,470
do you then cheat and use something else

1014
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,369
secondarily and I kind of do that in all

1015
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:16,659
the different positions of the body

1016
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:19,359
through lots of different movements of

1017
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:21,429
the body and I'm really just looking for

1018
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,039
what your patterns are and how you

1019
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:25,659
choose to cheat the world around you a

1020
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:27,550
little bit which may or may not be

1021
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:32,199
leading to your symptoms are your pain

1022
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:34,090
is so one of the things that kind of I

1023
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:35,439
noticed in relationship to that sort of

1024
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,900
thing like the positioning and and

1025
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,760
having someone use a muscle in

1026
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,670
particular is that it seems like

1027
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,780
sometimes at least for me and I don't

1028
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,050
know if this is generally true for

1029
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,210
people and more broadly there are

1030
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:51,640
muscles that you can't really even

1031
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,860
target with your brain until you've

1032
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:55,389
practiced like I don't know how to say

1033
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,769
it any other way but it's like you know

1034
00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:58,359
sometimes it's like okay you know you

1035
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:59,679
know pull your shoulder blade back in

1036
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,780
this way or something and I'm like I

1037
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:04,000
don't know how to do that right it's

1038
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,590
like maybe that muscle is normally

1039
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,599
firing as part of some other thing that

1040
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,519
I think to do but it's like I can't

1041
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,679
think to contract just that muscle and

1042
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,409
then I have noticed that like over time

1043
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,239
then your brain does sort of learn to be

1044
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:18,670
able to maybe target that muscle more

1045
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,169
specifically is that am I totally

1046
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:23,610
misinterpreting that or is this a is

1047
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:26,500
that a really like it's a real thing

1048
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:29,410
your brain and your neurological system

1049
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,659
are again very very changeable very

1050
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:33,250
adaptable and some people have kind of

1051
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:35,049
an aide idea of where their body is some

1052
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,000
people don't some people can learn it

1053
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:41,470
some people it takes longer but they can

1054
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,269
learn it eventually so during my exam

1055
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:45,429
for example I'll often place someone

1056
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:46,869
where I want them and then say hold this

1057
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:49,089
because I want to know what they're

1058
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:50,949
gonna hold it with but there's ways of

1059
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:54,010
tricking the brain into kind of finding

1060
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:56,529
that muscle you can tap on the muscle or

1061
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,330
or and that kind of helps stimulate the

1062
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,010
nerves a little bit

1063
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:01,869
you can use different visualizations you

1064
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:04,210
can try to equate it to a movement 30

1065
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:05,170
familiar with like oh it feels like when

1066
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,630
you do

1067
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:10,400
exercise yeah so there are ways of doing

1068
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,680
it but the brain can learn to fire

1069
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,090
anything or fire anything in a new

1070
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:15,409
pattern it just for some people it comes

1071
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,870
a little bit more easily for some people

1072
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:19,279
it's a little harder and you can try a

1073
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:24,559
million different ways of telling them

1074
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,120
showing them hands on moving them so

1075
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:29,539
many different ways of cueing or we call

1076
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:31,759
it cueing movement and patterns and

1077
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:35,170
muscles to actually fire so I think

1078
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,250
that's pretty good for the basics of

1079
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,409
well there's well I guess there's one

1080
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,340
thing we have listed on here that we

1081
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:41,989
should probably talk about exams to

1082
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,730
start talking moving on to sort of like

1083
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:45,859
the actual pain part like what's causing

1084
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,630
matter how that's working but one thing

1085
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,340
that you had mentioned that I actually

1086
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,480
don't think I know anything about cuz I

1087
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,100
think you've ever mentioned it to me

1088
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,440
just in the course of like actually

1089
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:57,289
doing physical therapy spinal alignment

1090
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,789
and plumb line you mentioned which I'm

1091
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:00,590
assuming is about the thing that I was

1092
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,900
I'm doing wrong right now or whatever

1093
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,780
sitting but like what what is what did

1094
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,490
you want it to say about that yeah so if

1095
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,470
you think about your body most of us

1096
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:10,849
think about kind of being anchored to

1097
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:12,230
the ground either through our feet or

1098
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:15,739
right now through our butts on our

1099
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:17,539
chairs but most of our movement and all

1100
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,489
of our musculature is anchored from the

1101
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:21,349
kind of the center out because

1102
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:23,509
everything has every muscle has at least

1103
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:27,769
two ends so again we'll use the bicep as

1104
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:29,390
an example because it's easy it attaches

1105
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:31,909
at your elbow and it attaches up at your

1106
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:34,039
shoulder so if you're not able to

1107
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:35,389
stabilize the shoulder end well you'll

1108
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:39,710
never be able to fire at the elbow well

1109
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:42,889
so this is proper biceps firing ish and

1110
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,269
then improper firing you'd have a wiggly

1111
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:46,219
shoulder because it's yanking and the

1112
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:48,670
muscle shortening and does not have an

1113
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:51,139
anchor so if you don't have a properly

1114
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:54,460
aligned spine you're not going to be

1115
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:57,109
able to fire everything else as well

1116
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,550
the spine does not always have to be in

1117
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,200
its perfect neutral alignment all the

1118
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,120
time our bodies again are highly

1119
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:04,009
adaptable we are able to move it in all

1120
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:08,679
sorts of different ways and directions

1121
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:11,559
but having a neutral spine or neutral

1122
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:13,149
can really help you kind of get the

1123
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:16,750
handle on what else is going on the body

1124
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:19,240
so the spine is an s-curve let's see if

1125
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,679
I can find a picture of the spine I had

1126
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:25,088
trouble finding it before but you'll see

1127
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:26,980
we can get to pop up no that was the

1128
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:28,929
problem the problem is that bones have

1129
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,420
spine ain't like little out cropping of

1130
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:33,848
bone is also a spine so I get like a lot

1131
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:44,530
of spine no they will not but we can try

1132
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:45,940
cervical spine for example thinking it

1133
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,890
is thinking they did not fight there

1134
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,809
they do not have the surface we didn't

1135
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:54,789
find any result yeah that was very lucky

1136
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:57,460
he wanted to include us in like it to be

1137
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:59,259
it to be responsible for it all of us to

1138
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,838
your sponsor I think if I could spell

1139
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,790
company

1140
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:04,929
let's try thoracic so your spine is

1141
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,759
broken up into three different parts

1142
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:09,009
you've got your cervical which is your

1143
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,140
neck your thoracic which is your torso

1144
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,119
which all your ribs attached to it might

1145
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:16,719
be in the second if you really need it

1146
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,760
there's two there were two volumes okay

1147
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,558
how bad how bad do you want to have a

1148
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,210
spine diagram I'll talk about it and

1149
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:23,470
then if we get enough hooting and

1150
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,809
hollering or something I can look at it

1151
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:28,298
okay and cervical spine is the nak

1152
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:31,510
thoracic spine attaches the ribcage

1153
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:33,280
lumbar spine low back and a spine should

1154
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:38,549
look like let's see if I can just find a

1155
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:41,700
pretty blank page every somebody oh

1156
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:41,699
they're good

1157
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:45,990
we'll use a space cuz it's relatively

1158
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,989
clear

1159
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:58,929
so cervical spine let's do this thoracic

1160
00:43:50,590 --> 00:44:01,150
spine lumbar spine sort of cervical

1161
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:04,779
spine thoracic spine in the lumbar spine

1162
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:11,769
ish it's Kirby there's a the skull is

1163
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:14,950
here so your spine acts a little bit

1164
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:16,150
like a spring and it absorbs and our G

1165
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:18,460
comes we walk and move throughout our

1166
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:20,889
day but this alignment is kind of

1167
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:25,449
important because and this is true in

1168
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:27,519
sitting or in standing and the plumb

1169
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:29,109
line I was discussing drops basically

1170
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,400
from the ear down the body and it's felt

1171
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,230
like how much of your body's and further

1172
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,430
behind and it should be about half and

1173
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,650
what things are you cheating or

1174
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:37,629
compensating with there's some really

1175
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,760
neat different examples of poor posture

1176
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:41,890
if you just look up spinal alignment and

1177
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,570
you google it it'll show you like a ways

1178
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:45,250
of posture like if you're leaning back

1179
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:50,410
or leaning forward or all sorts of

1180
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:52,539
things but let's use sitting because but

1181
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:54,389
if you're sitting and let's say it's the

1182
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:56,440
end of a long day and you're like this

1183
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:58,509
not only have you changed your spinal

1184
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,429
posture my shoulders have rounded and

1185
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:03,310
come forward and now my head's gone

1186
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:04,809
forward now my neck musculature here is

1187
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:07,059
gonna be tighter my neck musculature

1188
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:08,440
here is gonna be tighter this is gonna

1189
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:10,449
influence how my nerves are coming out

1190
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,210
of my neck see segue into news back

1191
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:15,429
great and down your arms and into your

1192
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,230
hands or maybe the end of the day you're

1193
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:21,940
more like this soon you're shaping like

1194
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:23,590
that I've seen this one a lot again your

1195
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,809
lumbar spine may or may not be that bad

1196
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:27,400
it may also be curved but your spine is

1197
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:28,869
kind of taking on this C shape your

1198
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,099
shoulder blades are moving up and around

1199
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:30,880
your back your shoulders are gonna

1200
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:33,549
forward

1201
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,740
your arms are internally rotated so

1202
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:37,360
really how you're sitting makes a big

1203
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:38,469
difference on all the structures

1204
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,530
throughout your body so that was kind of

1205
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:42,939
a long way of getting to the point of

1206
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:45,220
like hey know what you're doing and

1207
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:46,990
change positions frequently so look

1208
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:49,179
let's talk about one thing that you said

1209
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:50,679
there that I I totally forgot about what

1210
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:53,409
not the shoulder actually the

1211
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:54,940
stabilization part of it is kind of

1212
00:45:53,409 --> 00:45:58,029
interesting like I had not thought about

1213
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:00,420
this previously until you had explained

1214
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:03,400
it to me actually which is that I

1215
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,050
typically think of friend for some

1216
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,210
reason because having done character

1217
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,589
animation for a living for five years

1218
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,108
you think that I would have thought

1219
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:13,779
about this before ever but I didn't or

1220
00:46:11,108 --> 00:46:17,409
maybe it's because of that I tended to

1221
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:19,390
think of muscles in in isolation meaning

1222
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:21,639
even if I was thinking like oh this

1223
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:23,348
group of muscles is doing something I

1224
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:26,500
neglected to think about the fact that

1225
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:28,480
whatever they're doing muscles upstream

1226
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,429
from them are going to have to counter

1227
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,318
because if they would didn't do that it

1228
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:33,969
would pull the rest of you in to

1229
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,759
wherever that muscle was going or away

1230
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:38,919
from it or something so can you just

1231
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,240
just cement that you mentioned the

1232
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,690
stabilization powers like actually like

1233
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,639
wait a minute

1234
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:44,230
many people may not actually have

1235
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,358
internalized this because especially for

1236
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,460
people for being computer graphics we

1237
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:49,900
don't have this like Reedus you know we

1238
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,980
just move the thing and it moves we

1239
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,690
don't have to think about the ripple

1240
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,548
effects yeah so can you just talk a

1241
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:57,280
little bit about that just I mean sure

1242
00:46:54,548 --> 00:46:58,750
for fun everybody a Reacher I'm out in

1243
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,369
front of you and make a tight tight

1244
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,389
tight tight vest and see if you can feel

1245
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:03,160
what's going on at your shoulder blade

1246
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:04,838
behind you and then open your hand we

1247
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:05,858
could take this together you should feel

1248
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:07,779
the muscles around your shoulder blade

1249
00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:09,369
contracting in the back which is just so

1250
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:14,170
cool but our bodies just do that

1251
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:15,400
naturally but every muscle when it fires

1252
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,869
live if you look at a picture of a

1253
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,420
muscle you see like the stripes kind of

1254
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:20,980
like I was drawing on that on the

1255
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,170
overhead there when you see those

1256
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:24,670
stripes those are the angles of like the

1257
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,289
lines on which the muscle contracts

1258
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:26,769
which means it's contracting on both

1259
00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:28,838
sides

1260
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:30,608
so it's not just contracting and pulling

1261
00:47:28,838 --> 00:47:32,139
the arm up it's pulling on both sides

1262
00:47:30,608 --> 00:47:34,000
which means every time you have a muscle

1263
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:37,239
firing here you have a muscle pulling on

1264
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,650
the other side back the other direction

1265
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:40,239
specifically for the shoulder blade and

1266
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:43,510
why the serratus anterior is currently

1267
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:44,469
my favorite muscle is I love to think

1268
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:47,049
about how the shoulder blade is

1269
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:49,118
stabilized because it is just so neat

1270
00:47:47,048 --> 00:47:51,489
like I was saying before the arm is a

1271
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,869
really heavy structure you've got all

1272
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:54,909
those bones and those muscles just

1273
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:59,769
dangling off that shoulder blade pulling

1274
00:47:54,909 --> 00:48:02,558
the arm down and away from the body so

1275
00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:03,199
if that's all pulling this way you need

1276
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,700
to have

1277
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:08,599
muscles pulling this way but to counter

1278
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:11,389
that you need to have muscle pulling

1279
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:13,130
this way and most importantly because

1280
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:17,539
that arm is pulling downward because

1281
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:22,309
it's only attached at the top of the

1282
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:25,369
shoulder blade here you're like we lost

1283
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:26,420
it okay since the arm is only attached

1284
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,319
to the top of the shoulder blade here

1285
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,930
you've got this whole rest of the

1286
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,430
triangle it's gonna pull the arm just

1287
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:34,129
from the weight of it in that downward

1288
00:48:31,429 --> 00:48:42,769
rotation see now I'm just making a mess

1289
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:44,059
let's see so this arm bone here is only

1290
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:46,309
attached at the top corner of the

1291
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:48,049
triangle which means just at rest

1292
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:50,139
just hanging if no other forces were

1293
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:53,690
present you'd have this downward pull of

1294
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:59,239
the scapula into downward rotation so

1295
00:48:53,690 --> 00:49:02,289
you need your middle trapezius to be

1296
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:06,859
pulling in against that outward force

1297
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:08,480
your lower trapezius is gonna pull into

1298
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,670
a little bit of the upward rotation like

1299
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,219
we talked about before and your serratus

1300
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,360
anterior which is gonna pull in outward

1301
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:15,859
and into a little bit of that upward

1302
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,019
rotation so you've got this counter of

1303
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:20,180
pulling going on you've got input in

1304
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:22,009
pull and out pull and they're both

1305
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:24,319
helping it upwardly rotate against that

1306
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,720
arm and that's just at rest so every

1307
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,580
time you then go to move that arm

1308
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:29,750
everybody's kind of got to recalibrate

1309
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:32,900
exactly how much energy they're putting

1310
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:36,230
where that same thing is happening okay

1311
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,610
now I'm going to flex the elbow and I'm

1312
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:41,150
gonna bring that up okay I've got the

1313
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:43,280
biceps pulling here so I need to

1314
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:45,260
stabilize more with this pull here as

1315
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,690
this pulls the arm up there and now I'm

1316
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:50,240
just creating a giant mess on my butt

1317
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,829
well actually that's really fascinating

1318
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,049
because it's essentially like well we

1319
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:55,759
have this you know rigid body dynamics

1320
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:58,070
problem basically where we've got to got

1321
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,150
this thing there we've got points that

1322
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,820
we're pulling on which will induce

1323
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:03,740
torque as well as linear motion and it

1324
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:07,820
all has to balance out properly

1325
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:09,409
you only can exert certain directions on

1326
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,900
it right because you I'm simplifying

1327
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:13,009
things there's also Tilton yeah and

1328
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,820
there's lots of different muscles that

1329
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:18,920
that correspond to that but yes you are

1330
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:22,160
but you have yeah you have quite a lot

1331
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:24,170
of options so it sounds like to I mean

1332
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,089
just just from the physics of it that

1333
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:28,579
means that essentially when I'm sitting

1334
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,950
or standing or anything else the contact

1335
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:32,690
points with the rest of the world are

1336
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:34,579
essentially where all the energy has to

1337
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:38,030
flow back to in some sense meaning

1338
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:40,519
whatever I do all the muscles up to the

1339
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:42,710
point where I'm grounded have to be

1340
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:44,509
involved otherwise I would you know the

1341
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:47,869
inertia I guess takes something out of

1342
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:49,850
it well challenge you to now think about

1343
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:51,469
an aerialist in space a circus performer

1344
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:53,420
ok yes they do not need a grounded

1345
00:50:51,469 --> 00:50:55,189
contact with the outside world they just

1346
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:56,930
need their core and their spine and all

1347
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:58,820
their stabilizer muscles to be doing

1348
00:50:56,929 --> 00:51:01,250
their job so it's not necessarily about

1349
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,809
the contact points I'm not sure and

1350
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,820
you're standing it's about how it

1351
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:07,369
interacts with your stability internally

1352
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,110
but so is does that mean that the body

1353
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:10,609
is just heavy enough on its own that we

1354
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,960
don't really have to care about that

1355
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:14,240
external kind because even an aerialist

1356
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,400
they will change or their whole body's

1357
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,859
orientation as a result of those motions

1358
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:23,840
there right meaning do you know what I

1359
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:29,390
mean like so it all ends up physics so

1360
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:31,550
class yes so does that mean just trying

1361
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:34,659
to get to the whether those are

1362
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:37,039
important or not if you are standing

1363
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:39,429
does the series of muscles that are

1364
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:42,110
involved in say moving your shoulder

1365
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:43,429
when you consider all the contractions

1366
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:45,650
eat no matter how tiny that would happen

1367
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:47,659
are they different because they can stop

1368
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:49,340
at your tailbone then if I'm then if I

1369
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:51,109
was what I'm sitting sorry then when I'm

1370
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,370
standing when they cannot stop at my

1371
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,780
tailbone because they have to go all the

1372
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:55,699
way down to my leg before they hit solid

1373
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,650
these support till don't stop your

1374
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:59,000
tailbone even sitting okay so your legs

1375
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:01,639
are still counter but your legs are

1376
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,809
still involved in some in some way so

1377
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:05,269
like oh nice thing just now with my legs

1378
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:06,860
crossed I'm exerting a force probably

1379
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:09,170
inward a little bit there's a little bit

1380
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,490
of outward force as they're crossed and

1381
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:12,110
I'm getting stability from all of that

1382
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:13,849
in addition to what's going on at my

1383
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:15,500
core so it doesn't stop kind of at your

1384
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:16,699
sits bones it really does turns out all

1385
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,199
the way down it does change a bit when

1386
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:19,699
you're standing because it changes your

1387
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:22,699
leg position changes where you're

1388
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:25,419
exerting forces but any little motion

1389
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:26,519
you're doing is somehow affecting

1390
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,159
everything

1391
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:30,900
[Laughter]

1392
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:33,629
ideally your core is kind of a

1393
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:35,608
transition point you'll still get some

1394
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:37,380
effect up and down but your core is kind

1395
00:52:35,608 --> 00:52:39,239
of your should be one of your most

1396
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:41,910
stable structures I see so that's like

1397
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,618
the place where a lot of the energy kind

1398
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:46,049
of dissipates by that point we've gotten

1399
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:47,700
to people don't have to do too much

1400
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,690
contraction or weight which is why when

1401
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:50,429
you're sitting you're not really feeling

1402
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:54,900
your legs do you much then okay they're

1403
00:52:50,429 --> 00:52:56,940
active but they're not yeah okay that is

1404
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,869
a lot to digest but we've got a whole

1405
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:02,849
bunch of stuff to go through here so

1406
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:06,210
let's start talking about the actual

1407
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:08,190
like I mean those are sort of the cause

1408
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:10,349
of the problem perhaps you might say in

1409
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:12,300
terms of like what you're doing this

1410
00:53:10,349 --> 00:53:14,099
this making problem happen but the

1411
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,869
problem you're actually feeling ends up

1412
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:17,760
being something nerve related or blood

1413
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:19,050
flow related or something like this can

1414
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,940
you start to give us an introduction

1415
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:23,730
into like that's like I'm having pain

1416
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:25,858
what is pain mean like there's different

1417
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:27,719
ways in which that might manifest itself

1418
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:30,299
or discomfort right can you start to

1419
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:32,098
start giving us the intro of like what

1420
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,880
what's that part of it about and where

1421
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:37,440
is that coming from

1422
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,940
okay well the whole conversation about

1423
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,440
what is pain but that could be a whole

1424
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:45,690
nother hour to go but it is really a

1425
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:49,800
creation of the brain to sensation that

1426
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:54,869
it doesn't quite understand but so pain

1427
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:56,880
is kind of a vague overarching catch-all

1428
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:57,660
for most of the public but I really kind

1429
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,570
of break it down to a couple of

1430
00:53:57,659 --> 00:54:02,159
different types of pain numbness burning

1431
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,410
tingling those are gonna be your nerve

1432
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:08,489
symptoms and usually are coming from our

1433
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:10,589
neurological source whether what's a

1434
00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:12,049
nervous being compressed a nervous being

1435
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:14,789
[Music]

1436
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:18,720
pulled that's usually gonna be a nerve

1437
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:21,838
inner sanctum dull achiness is often

1438
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,980
muscular mustard pain when it's a more

1439
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:25,769
of a spasm can be a little bit more

1440
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:27,869
sharp a little bit more cute but you've

1441
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:30,119
got different kind of categories and

1442
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:34,170
qualifications of pain that you're

1443
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:36,950
feeling and that can really manifest

1444
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,950
anywhere in the body

1445
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:44,309
the you know as we're talking the causes

1446
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:46,739
of all that even if you have say your

1447
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:48,539
pain or nervous symptoms in your hand it

1448
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:50,339
could be because of what you're doing

1449
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,340
your shoulder and kind of how that's

1450
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:58,980
translating down or translating back up

1451
00:54:52,340 --> 00:55:00,329
and it's sort of focus it in for you

1452
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,840
because I've got a bunch of oh yeah

1453
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:05,340
great so um all right so you sort of

1454
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,100
listed I think five things they're

1455
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:10,769
basically three three right you said

1456
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:18,299
numbness burning tingling yep right and

1457
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:20,909
then you said aching yeah so all of

1458
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:22,920
those I guess are I mean the brain

1459
00:55:20,909 --> 00:55:25,259
doesn't get information back from

1460
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,059
muscles directly right it only gets

1461
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,770
information back from the nerves I

1462
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:31,590
assume meaning all of these are

1463
00:55:28,769 --> 00:55:34,320
traveling on the nerves all of these are

1464
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,970
traveling on the nerves okay so can you

1465
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,710
and some of these may be I mean

1466
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:39,480
obviously some of these are more

1467
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:41,220
neurologist questions so please if I'm

1468
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,929
going outside of the discipline I I

1469
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:44,009
apologize you can just tell me sorry I

1470
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:47,489
probably should know it somewhere back

1471
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:48,750
in my right it's like someone asking me

1472
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:50,669
about some programming language I

1473
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:54,179
haven't you know seen in many many years

1474
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:57,059
but can you give us any sort of a

1475
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:59,489
understanding of like those things do

1476
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:01,380
they indicate a particular thing that's

1477
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:03,869
happening with the nerve that we

1478
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,490
understand meaning that medical science

1479
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:07,829
kind of feels like oh right when you're

1480
00:56:05,489 --> 00:56:09,779
seeing tingling that means the nerve has

1481
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:11,909
had X happen to it somewhere along the

1482
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:14,160
line if you're experiencing adult ache

1483
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:16,049
that means the nerve is picking up this

1484
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:18,539
like what is happening there do we know

1485
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:19,769
the tingling tingling or numbness is

1486
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:20,940
usually neurological compression it

1487
00:56:19,769 --> 00:56:23,460
means the signal is not getting through

1488
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:26,550
clearly okay so it's signal meaning

1489
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,030
electricity yeah why you're essentially

1490
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,950
no wire

1491
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:30,660
yes the the information that is being

1492
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:32,429
transmitted along the neuron because

1493
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:34,769
that's where our information highway of

1494
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:35,159
our body is is not getting through

1495
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:37,559
clearly

1496
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,239
so numbness is nothing's getting through

1497
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:41,610
you can't you can't feel anything cuz

1498
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:43,469
there's there's nobody's traveling so

1499
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:46,170
that's a complete break for some reason

1500
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:48,739
either it was cut or compressed or

1501
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,340
something yeah it could it could be

1502
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,869
anything it could be

1503
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,220
was just laying on it that's why you

1504
00:56:51,869 --> 00:56:55,380
know if you're laying on your army or

1505
00:56:53,219 --> 00:56:57,329
your something falls asleep you go from

1506
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,829
that numbness that tingling to that

1507
00:56:57,329 --> 00:57:00,869
burning and then it goes back to normal

1508
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:03,539
so like you could have it even on that

1509
00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:06,480
minor scale and that kind of is what

1510
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:09,029
that nerve pain is oh so those are all

1511
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,550
actually essentially the same thing just

1512
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:13,230
a different amount so it's like how much

1513
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,660
electricity was able to travel through

1514
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:19,230
or not how much electricity but how you

1515
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:21,480
know yeah is is where you are on that

1516
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:24,150
line is that correct

1517
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,230
kind of yeah and everyone what kind of

1518
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:28,740
experience a little differently but

1519
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:30,480
that's kind of the general and then what

1520
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:32,789
about the other ones that you said okay

1521
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,190
this is the nerve is functioning fine

1522
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:36,840
meaning all the informations flowing you

1523
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:38,760
know back to the source and the amount

1524
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,550
that it's supposed to but I'm still

1525
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:44,070
getting pain how is it picking up like

1526
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:46,500
what is the dull aching or the muscle

1527
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:48,630
spasm pain is that something the nerve

1528
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:51,750
is sensing or like how does that or is

1529
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:55,349
that really no it's a good question and

1530
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:56,610
it's a very big question oh it is one

1531
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:59,179
that is currently being studied more and

1532
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:05,640
more but we do know a lot about pain

1533
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:07,169
pain and that dull achy feeling is how

1534
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:08,759
our brain is translating that it's

1535
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:12,869
trying to figure out what's going on

1536
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:14,730
okay there so it's not the muscle that

1537
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:17,190
really feels that way it's your brain

1538
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:19,050
trying to make sense of what's going on

1539
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:21,269
there so it's a constant contraction say

1540
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:22,950
at the muscle because the spasm and your

1541
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:24,929
brain is trying to figure out how to

1542
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:27,659
interpret that signal and so the signals

1543
00:58:24,929 --> 00:58:31,199
that it's getting this is me completely

1544
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:32,879
making something up so when you say

1545
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:35,250
tries to figure out what's going on is

1546
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,559
that in a sense saying well okay I've

1547
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:39,900
got these nerves that are going out to

1548
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:43,590
various parts of my body my brain is

1549
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:45,840
used to the signals coming back this way

1550
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:47,490
all of a sudden I see that they're

1551
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:51,930
coming back differently from this and

1552
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:54,750
I'm worried so now I am just the your

1553
00:58:51,929 --> 00:59:00,269
brains way of saying I don't see the

1554
00:58:54,750 --> 00:59:01,739
right signals coming back is yes the we

1555
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:03,509
only have certain types of

1556
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:06,929
we're suckers for sensation in the body

1557
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:08,760
so we don't have like I feel water

1558
00:59:06,929 --> 00:59:12,389
bottle you know you feel you feel cold

1559
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:14,010
you feel hot sorry you feel hot hot but

1560
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:15,539
not cold oh really

1561
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,610
so the absence of feeling hot do you

1562
00:59:15,539 --> 00:59:21,239
feel is cold so like things like that

1563
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:23,670
are it's it's pretty binary like you

1564
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:25,259
don't we don't have as much sensation we

1565
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:27,840
interpret sensation more broadly than we

1566
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:30,090
actually sense it okay so the brain is

1567
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:32,789
filling in a number of gaps here and I

1568
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:34,980
suppose that is probably why these sorts

1569
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:37,320
of things are difficult in the diagnosis

1570
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:40,230
phase because it's like well you know

1571
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,940
it's such a blunt you know instituted

1572
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:43,019
that the the the information the patient

1573
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:45,000
can give you about what they're feeling

1574
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:47,009
is really kind of fuzzy because their

1575
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,650
brain is just sort of looking at some

1576
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:51,480
not particularly great signals and just

1577
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:53,309
producing an output and it's like well

1578
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,380
we can try it you know you can try to

1579
00:59:53,309 --> 00:59:57,090
figure out what that means by how we've

1580
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,680
seen it happen in the past but it's it's

1581
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:00,600
just not really as precise as we would

1582
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:02,579
like to know and some people are just

1583
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:04,049
better verbalizing than what they're

1584
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:06,750
feeling because you know it's also an

1585
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:08,880
interpretation problem of okay I can

1586
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:13,769
feel it I know what I'm feeling what but

1587
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:17,010
how do I say it that words and then you

1588
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:18,869
know honestly I don't find people's

1589
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,310
ability or inability to describe their

1590
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:23,519
symptoms that limiting diagnostically

1591
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:25,949
okay because I'm looking again for all

1592
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,730
these other indicators so if you're

1593
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:29,789
saying I

1594
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:31,380
I have weirdness when I do this thing

1595
01:00:29,789 --> 01:00:33,389
that's usually enough okay so you just

1596
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,039
maybe any indication that the brain did

1597
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:37,109
something is probably like okay like

1598
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,159
well that's the clue I need and now it's

1599
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:40,079
weird oh nothing you've come into my

1600
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:41,849
office yeah that's good enough that's

1601
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,380
good enough okay I don't really need

1602
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:45,119
somebody generally she described that

1603
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,130
much further other than you know I think

1604
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,960
it's more this or that but it's usually

1605
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:50,970
how they're moving that I am looking at

1606
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,679
more than what they're saying I don't

1607
01:00:50,969 --> 01:00:54,389
have this written down but I meant to

1608
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:56,179
write it down and since I'm thinking of

1609
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:59,699
it now I'm just gonna say it

1610
01:00:56,179 --> 01:01:02,519
so can you also briefly just mention or

1611
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:04,349
discuss referred pain to the extent that

1612
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:05,519
we would need to know it for the you

1613
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:08,210
know stuff we're gonna talk about here

1614
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:10,860
like the idea that the pain maybe is

1615
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:13,940
misplaced in terms of what the where the

1616
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:16,610
patient thinks it's coming from yeah so

1617
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:19,360
there's different types of referred pain

1618
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:21,079
and this is a great place to to say

1619
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,660
something that I'll get to in a second

1620
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:25,309
because doesn't matter yet different

1621
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:27,319
types preferred pain so usually refer

1622
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:30,289
pain is symptoms you're feeling that are

1623
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:33,230
not from the place that you are having

1624
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:35,000
an issue so I'm a simple musculoskeletal

1625
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:37,250
level something that I deal with almost

1626
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,980
on a daily basis is if you have pain in

1627
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:42,590
a straight line here at your shoulder

1628
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:44,210
it's your rotator cuff which is which is

1629
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:45,410
the deep muscles of the shoulder that

1630
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,659
actually controlled the spin and glide

1631
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:49,730
of the actual humerus they don't run in

1632
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:52,129
a vertical line on your shoulder but

1633
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:55,429
that's where you feel it on a more

1634
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:57,950
global medical scale you can have pain

1635
01:01:55,429 --> 01:02:00,019
referred from your organs and to

1636
01:01:57,949 --> 01:02:04,250
somewhere external on your body in the

1637
01:02:00,019 --> 01:02:05,210
Maya tomes meaning on the skin and that

1638
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,920
may or may not be actually

1639
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:09,860
musculoskeletal you can have pain from

1640
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,820
the inside of your body expressing on

1641
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,220
the outside and that's kind of what I

1642
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,750
want to talk about which was

1643
01:02:12,219 --> 01:02:16,639
musculoskeletal pain including

1644
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:18,679
neurological pain tends to change with

1645
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,420
the position it tends to change with

1646
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:22,909
time of day your activity or what you're

1647
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:25,070
doing pain that does not go away no

1648
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:26,690
matter what you do you're gonna want to

1649
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:28,850
get checked out by your primary care

1650
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:31,130
doctor first because there might be

1651
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:32,630
something else going on so even if it

1652
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:33,980
appears to be in a location that would

1653
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:36,230
suggest that it couldn't be something

1654
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:38,059
like an internal organ that may not be

1655
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:39,619
true at all may be true may be that it's

1656
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:41,299
actually you know something that has

1657
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:42,859
nothing to do with your your body

1658
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:45,470
mechanics yeah for example like a

1659
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:47,390
gallbladder will refer pain to like the

1660
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:49,519
back and people will come in with back

1661
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:51,500
pain and oh it hurts it hurts all the

1662
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:53,239
time whenever I do I can't get it to go

1663
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:56,030
away and I'm like no that's probably not

1664
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:57,679
your back look I mean you could have is

1665
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:00,110
your back is fine the bad news is you

1666
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:01,129
need to go I mean you might have back

1667
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,289
pain all the time but it should at least

1668
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:04,460
change intensity it should there should

1669
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:07,159
be things you can do to mitigate the

1670
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:08,630
symptoms so it's just another it's just

1671
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,069
an indicator to me that there there

1672
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:11,329
might not be a musculoskeletal thing

1673
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:13,010
going on there might still be but it's

1674
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,719
worth checking out usually there's other

1675
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:16,730
red flag indicators or things like that

1676
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:18,469
that make my little ears perk up but

1677
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:23,360
it's just another thing to think about

1678
01:03:18,469 --> 01:03:24,619
so I guess let's since we've kind of

1679
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,410
grabbed them I think most of things well

1680
01:03:24,619 --> 01:03:28,868
actually no we did not talk about

1681
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:30,608
vascular things at all and I part of

1682
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:32,079
that as I think because I don't actually

1683
01:03:30,608 --> 01:03:33,670
know anything about these I don't think

1684
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:37,210
I've ever heard you mentioned them to me

1685
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:39,608
either so could you just tell us to what

1686
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:41,048
degree that's important for these sorts

1687
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:42,848
of ailments and and what we should be

1688
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:47,650
aware about or what we should be aware

1689
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:50,140
of in terms of those pathways yes I'm

1690
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:54,220
going to just take this where I want to

1691
01:03:50,139 --> 01:03:57,568
go so let me see if I can find a picture

1692
01:03:54,219 --> 01:03:57,568
that I might want

1693
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:13,400
Jesus has that on there no hold on we

1694
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:15,769
could bring up the second PDF which

1695
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,970
maybe has some of the spine stuff on it

1696
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:18,380
I don't know if they were separated in

1697
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:20,359
the book I grabbed the one that's upper

1698
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,800
limbs and stuff and the other ones you

1699
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,120
want me to bring it up well let's let's

1700
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,260
see if I can try something else here

1701
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:29,710
because I think I saw something good

1702
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:29,710
with it before with the scalene so let's

1703
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:38,210
see you look at all that beautiful

1704
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:41,110
vascular bundles that's not bad but not

1705
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:41,110
if you don't know you're looking at

1706
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:49,420
that's kind of cool

1707
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:51,829
okay so this is somebody from the side

1708
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,119
the shoulder has been removed so the

1709
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:57,590
stripe things that you're looking at

1710
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:59,089
here are the ribs it look like ribs what

1711
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:01,460
else has been removed so if you see this

1712
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:04,100
little white disc here that's where your

1713
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:09,860
collarbone attaches okay so your

1714
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:12,049
collarbone would sit right here blue in

1715
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:16,430
this case means vein red means artery

1716
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:19,460
yellow here in this block are your nurse

1717
01:05:16,429 --> 01:05:22,879
coming up your neck so here you've got

1718
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:24,860
your collarbone here you've got your

1719
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,360
veins they're gonna come down around go

1720
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:28,190
down your arm that way you're honoring

1721
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,630
so you go down around down your arm that

1722
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,389
way technically your arteries going down

1723
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:33,980
around your veins coming back up but and

1724
01:05:31,389 --> 01:05:36,139
your nerves are gonna come out and go

1725
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:38,929
down that way too so everybody is now

1726
01:05:36,139 --> 01:05:40,309
passing under this collarbone so your

1727
01:05:38,929 --> 01:05:43,909
nerves are passing under your arteries

1728
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:45,799
are passing under so sometimes what

1729
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:48,440
people are feeling as nerve pain or

1730
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,480
muscle pain is the fact that they're

1731
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:53,090
knocking the blood flow to the muscle or

1732
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,800
to the nerve that you need for things to

1733
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:56,510
process properly or to function properly

1734
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,580
because you need those nutrients flowing

1735
01:05:56,510 --> 01:06:01,270
you need oxygen going to the to the

1736
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:06,949
muscles to produce contractions so

1737
01:06:01,269 --> 01:06:10,730
everything comes out so you've got what

1738
01:06:06,949 --> 01:06:12,649
I pulled up was the the scalenes so

1739
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:15,119
you've got these muscles that come

1740
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:17,608
across the nerve see the herbs come

1741
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,048
out there coming across the artery let's

1742
01:06:17,608 --> 01:06:24,778
see if I can get a better picture of it

1743
01:06:19,048 --> 01:06:26,699
even ooh yeah see that's cool again the

1744
01:06:24,778 --> 01:06:28,858
yellow is the nerve the red the artery

1745
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:31,139
coming out and you can see the scalene

1746
01:06:28,858 --> 01:06:35,400
or the muscle of the neck they're coming

1747
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:37,460
up crossing over all of it and then

1748
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,869
you've got the collarbone that would be

1749
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:43,409
all that's been removed but that would

1750
01:06:39,869 --> 01:06:47,028
be coming out here across it as well so

1751
01:06:43,409 --> 01:06:49,920
this just kind of shows you how

1752
01:06:47,028 --> 01:06:52,829
intricate and how integral your posture

1753
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:55,680
and movement are because if your heads

1754
01:06:52,829 --> 01:06:57,329
doing this even out tightened your

1755
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,608
scalene muscle which is the guy I just

1756
01:06:57,329 --> 01:07:00,720
drew in he's no tighter trying to hold

1757
01:06:59,608 --> 01:07:01,710
your head up and try to figure it all

1758
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:02,969
out

1759
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:06,088
which can put pressure on your nerves

1760
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:07,558
and arteries if you are shoulders are

1761
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:08,880
kind of pressed and hanging out because

1762
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:10,200
you're down here and your arms are kind

1763
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,210
of hanging and you're using your laptop

1764
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:13,710
on your lap kind of thing now your

1765
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:16,909
collarbone has been depressed and it's

1766
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:19,829
pushing down on your nerves and arteries

1767
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:22,230
and that can lead to having symptoms

1768
01:07:19,829 --> 01:07:23,960
weigh down your hand that you didn't

1769
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:26,420
realize was because you feel like that

1770
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,940
or something like that so that's kind of

1771
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:32,519
what I think is really important about

1772
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:34,889
your blood flow is that it can really

1773
01:07:32,518 --> 01:07:36,899
cause all sorts of symptoms because if

1774
01:07:34,889 --> 01:07:39,778
you're not getting the nutrients you

1775
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:41,670
need out to the peripheral periphery of

1776
01:07:39,778 --> 01:07:44,579
the body you're not gonna be able to

1777
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:46,440
function properly and is that sort of a

1778
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:48,630
property just of the fact that the

1779
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,970
further something is a way like the

1780
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:53,789
essentially the whatever the body is

1781
01:07:50,969 --> 01:07:56,098
trying to carry out to its systems de

1782
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:58,049
plena sh'zazz it goes out so if I start

1783
01:07:56,099 --> 01:07:59,579
to reduce the flow it means the furthest

1784
01:07:58,048 --> 01:08:02,068
out things are the ones that get the

1785
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:03,989
least of it or is that an incorrect

1786
01:08:02,068 --> 01:08:05,068
characterization yeah you know that but

1787
01:08:03,989 --> 01:08:07,380
I haven't thought about it that way but

1788
01:08:05,068 --> 01:08:09,239
that's probably pretty good there's also

1789
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:09,769
the chance that multiple things can go

1790
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:12,599
wrong

1791
01:08:09,768 --> 01:08:14,159
so if okay your head is doing something

1792
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:15,720
weird which puts more tension on your

1793
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:16,679
neck muscles and then your shoulders

1794
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:18,838
doing something weird which more

1795
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:21,060
attention on the structures themselves

1796
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:22,920
and then you're not stabilizing properly

1797
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:24,509
so you've got something going on with

1798
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,750
the elbow because you're overworking

1799
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:27,430
your forearm musculature

1800
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:29,170
now that's working too hard cuts trying

1801
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:31,060
to stabilize your elbow and move your

1802
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:33,010
hand and then you come down and you've

1803
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:35,560
got the narrowing at the wrist and like

1804
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:38,380
we get to your fingers so there's lots

1805
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,600
of different places where things can be

1806
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:43,150
less perfect is that I've heard you use

1807
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:46,539
the word double crush before yes that is

1808
01:08:43,149 --> 01:08:48,069
that is the idea behind double crush but

1809
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,000
you know double crush just means like oh

1810
01:08:48,069 --> 01:08:50,319
there something going on up here and

1811
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,199
something God doing down here but really

1812
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:55,149
it could be it ain't see bit here and a

1813
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:56,260
bit there a teeny tiny bit there and a

1814
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:58,420
little there and you end up becoming

1815
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:00,460
table crush now quadruple a quadruple

1816
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,510
splash or whatever crush I think is just

1817
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:04,810
so dramatic

1818
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:08,890
yeah it does sound a bit dramatic okay

1819
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:10,600
so I think that's all of the I think

1820
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:12,850
that's all of the stuff for just like

1821
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,800
basics of you know the functioning so we

1822
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:16,750
can get into some of these because we've

1823
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:19,500
got about 20 minutes left so I just

1824
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:22,359
wanted to kind of go through like the

1825
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,590
know I wanted to go through some of

1826
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:24,819
these ones that you that you had down

1827
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:26,050
here and maybe we can pick which ones

1828
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:27,699
are probably most important or maybe you

1829
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:29,940
can just kind of touch on each one

1830
01:09:27,699 --> 01:09:32,439
briefly so people know about them you

1831
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:34,779
sent me a list of common ailments that

1832
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:38,259
people who you know sit like this all

1833
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:40,809
day might get and first one was medial

1834
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:44,890
or lateral epicondylitis am i

1835
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:50,710
pronouncing basically it's pain at the

1836
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:52,900
inside or the outside of the elbow we

1837
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:54,520
used to call it epicondylitis or tennis

1838
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:56,379
elbow or golfer's elbow or probably

1839
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,700
terms you're more familiar with we're

1840
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,449
just moving to the OSIS because it's

1841
01:09:57,699 --> 01:10:01,029
more accurate

1842
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:02,949
I just meaning inflammation of what's

1843
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:06,340
going on there osa smeeting mini tearing

1844
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:09,970
well tearing but mini tearing it's not

1845
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:11,860
things flying apart basically it means

1846
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:13,420
you're overusing the things in your

1847
01:10:11,859 --> 01:10:14,679
forearm to either over using your finger

1848
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,329
flexors do you make that tight fist

1849
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:19,060
again you'll feel everything tightened

1850
01:10:16,329 --> 01:10:20,800
up by the inside of the elbow and if you

1851
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:22,300
pull your fingers back you'll feel

1852
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:26,739
everything tighten up by the outside of

1853
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:29,710
your elbow and so if you're using that a

1854
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:31,989
lot and not stabilizing properly of the

1855
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:34,899
chain I call that up the chain back

1856
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:36,869
towards the center you are now asking

1857
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:39,069
those muscles to do a ton of work

1858
01:10:36,869 --> 01:10:40,659
and they would probably be better served

1859
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:42,939
with better support up here so they

1860
01:10:40,659 --> 01:10:47,500
don't have to work as hard down at the

1861
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:51,189
finger level so it's I find it is common

1862
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:54,310
with trackpad oh really

1863
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:56,379
sometimes it kind of laughs yeah so

1864
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:58,240
you're doing like a swiping motion a lot

1865
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:59,230
so using a lot of finger flexion and

1866
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:01,179
you're probably resting your I'm

1867
01:10:59,229 --> 01:11:05,099
somewhere doing something weird I'm not

1868
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:08,590
supporting you no again this one right

1869
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:10,870
so carpal tunnel syndrome couple times

1870
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:12,430
an action and then you said you had a

1871
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:14,500
parenthetical that was high-end other

1872
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:16,869
nerve issues I'm not sure what that

1873
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,520
means but good well I know because I

1874
01:11:16,869 --> 01:11:21,519
I've heard most of this from Casey so

1875
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:22,750
when people walk in my door they may or

1876
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,100
may not they just sent me like oh I

1877
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:27,069
think I have some carpal tunnel or they

1878
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:30,370
might do something like that but usually

1879
01:11:27,069 --> 01:11:31,809
it's either self diagnosed or not

1880
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:33,069
diagnosed or and you've said like oh

1881
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:34,810
everyone thinks they have carpal tunnel

1882
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:36,849
do ya it's kind of like well I wanted to

1883
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:40,740
kind of say this is what carpal tunnel

1884
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:43,570
is was my first thing so carpal tunnel

1885
01:11:40,739 --> 01:11:46,109
hallmark characteristics are numbness

1886
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:48,670
tingling burning some nerve symptoms

1887
01:11:46,109 --> 01:11:51,399
generally and on the palm side of the

1888
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:53,230
hand most often in these two fingers so

1889
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:55,929
the pointer in the middle finger maybe a

1890
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:57,579
little bit into the thumb if you're not

1891
01:11:55,930 --> 01:12:01,539
if you're having pain it's probably not

1892
01:11:57,579 --> 01:12:03,189
carpal tunnel if it's unless it's also

1893
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:07,390
accompanied with that burning and

1894
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:10,629
tingling and carpal tunnel again because

1895
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:13,750
it's defined as basically its median

1896
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:14,619
nerve so it's the median nerve bundle

1897
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,689
that comes all the way down from the

1898
01:12:14,619 --> 01:12:19,659
neck down the arm through the carpal

1899
01:12:16,689 --> 01:12:21,549
tunnel in the wrist and into the hand so

1900
01:12:19,659 --> 01:12:24,819
since it's that having a whole long

1901
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:27,119
pathway it may or may not be the actual

1902
01:12:24,819 --> 01:12:30,189
carpal tunnel that's the problem

1903
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:33,250
it could be something at the neck or

1904
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:35,799
something kind of down the chain it can

1905
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:38,140
be caused by leaning at your wrist it

1906
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:40,060
can be caused by spending too much time

1907
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:42,430
with the wrist flexed flexed or extended

1908
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:43,870
I believe flexing the wrist increases

1909
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:46,659
the pressure in the carpal tunnel eight

1910
01:12:43,869 --> 01:12:49,119
fold and extending the rest increases at

1911
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:50,059
ten fold so having a relatively neutral

1912
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:51,948
wrist when you're working

1913
01:12:50,059 --> 01:12:53,269
is actually important so that whole

1914
01:12:51,948 --> 01:12:55,038
ergonomic setup thing is kind of cool

1915
01:12:53,269 --> 01:12:56,269
that's why those wrist braces tend to

1916
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:57,228
help because they're just cheating and

1917
01:12:56,269 --> 01:12:59,469
helping you get there I was actually

1918
01:12:57,229 --> 01:13:01,579
talking to a patient the other day

1919
01:12:59,469 --> 01:13:03,378
totally unrelated injury but it just

1920
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:05,929
kind of came up in conversation that he

1921
01:13:03,378 --> 01:13:07,939
had used to have carpal tunnel he's like

1922
01:13:05,929 --> 01:13:09,319
it's funny I put on the wrist brace and

1923
01:13:07,939 --> 01:13:13,039
it made me use my shoulder more I'm like

1924
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:14,389
aha so you can put a wrist brace on and

1925
01:13:13,038 --> 01:13:16,148
then we take it off you might go back to

1926
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:18,288
your old habit so you might have learned

1927
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:19,550
but and you know for him he put the

1928
01:13:18,288 --> 01:13:21,068
wrist brace on and he realized all of a

1929
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:23,510
sudden he was doing he was doing

1930
01:13:21,069 --> 01:13:26,829
electronic so he was more in like this

1931
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:29,269
doing doing stuff and he realized that

1932
01:13:26,828 --> 01:13:30,438
he changed how he's using his shoulder

1933
01:13:29,269 --> 01:13:32,289
he's like oh yes I used my shoulder much

1934
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:34,459
more instead of doing this all day long

1935
01:13:32,288 --> 01:13:35,779
so just kind of being aware of your

1936
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:39,349
movement can be one of the biggest

1937
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:42,198
changes you can make and that's really

1938
01:13:39,349 --> 01:13:45,260
where I come in my goal if I can give

1939
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:46,308
someone like no exercises and just tell

1940
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:48,019
them the things to change in their daily

1941
01:13:46,309 --> 01:13:49,729
life they're much more likely to do that

1942
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:52,128
then do all the exercises I tell them to

1943
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:57,099
do when they go home so I am much

1944
01:13:52,128 --> 01:14:00,139
happier to say okay so stop doing this

1945
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:01,550
whole the whole unit and the reason I

1946
01:14:00,139 --> 01:14:03,498
put other nerves stuff in there is

1947
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:05,748
because if it's not this but it's still

1948
01:14:03,498 --> 01:14:07,279
that I miss tingling burning it could be

1949
01:14:05,748 --> 01:14:08,738
one of your other nerves all our nervous

1950
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:11,088
more on the pinky side of the hand

1951
01:14:08,738 --> 01:14:12,618
radial nerve is more on the and the

1952
01:14:11,088 --> 01:14:14,958
thumb side of the hand and the back side

1953
01:14:12,618 --> 01:14:19,639
could you I think this has a diagram of

1954
01:14:14,958 --> 01:14:21,529
the mouse and because I saw it when I

1955
01:14:19,639 --> 01:14:23,899
was slipping through down there and I

1956
01:14:21,529 --> 01:14:25,938
meant to mention that before because

1957
01:14:23,899 --> 01:14:30,159
this is this is one of my favorite

1958
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:30,159
diagrams anyway that I had no idea about

1959
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:37,870
worst search it's you know it's it's

1960
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:44,259
user you know I I'm not searching for

1961
01:14:37,869 --> 01:14:46,119
the right thing pretty sure is in here

1962
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:48,760
somewhere there is second one of the

1963
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:49,930
ones with this is this is cool we were

1964
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:55,750
just talking about the carpal tunnel

1965
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:58,150
this is the carpal tunnel no so you've

1966
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:59,738
got this retinaculum there so if they do

1967
01:14:58,149 --> 01:15:02,859
carpal pulses your surgery that's what

1968
01:14:59,738 --> 01:15:05,799
they're gonna snip but you've got all

1969
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:08,920
the flexor tendons so all of these guys

1970
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:12,130
here is this hand this is hand palm up

1971
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:15,069
this is hands this is your hand looking

1972
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:17,279
like this way okay so palm up from the

1973
01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:21,369
from your side of the hand from the

1974
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:22,689
owners side so if you look at that it's

1975
01:15:21,369 --> 01:15:24,029
actually sorry it's looking down into

1976
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:26,439
the rest of it

1977
01:15:24,029 --> 01:15:30,420
okay so we've cut off the fingers

1978
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:34,899
[Laughter]

1979
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:38,440
anatomy so you've got all of these

1980
01:15:34,899 --> 01:15:41,589
things in here are all your flexor

1981
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:43,629
tendons so they're the the muscles

1982
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:44,800
themselves are actually way up here in

1983
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:47,590
the forum that's why you get your

1984
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,789
epicondylitis up here the muscles

1985
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:50,590
bellies themselves are here then they

1986
01:15:48,789 --> 01:15:52,420
send down the tendon to actually attach

1987
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:54,819
into the hand and cause things I think

1988
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:57,659
are flexion so they're all passing

1989
01:15:54,819 --> 01:16:00,219
through there and then you've got your

1990
01:15:57,659 --> 01:16:04,019
nerves and arteries trying to pass

1991
01:16:00,219 --> 01:16:08,230
through there too so just kind of cool

1992
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:14,890
my way I think it should be it might be

1993
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:17,229
further down in the next I so the here

1994
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:19,630
we go so your median nerve is your

1995
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:23,349
traditional carpal tunnel nerve thing

1996
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:24,819
and that's here in the red and that's

1997
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:29,289
traditional tone because that's the one

1998
01:16:24,819 --> 01:16:31,750
that can't literally cannot be

1999
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:33,279
compressed at that time great okay and

2000
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:36,039
then here's where you get your older

2001
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:37,090
nerve and green and your radial nerve in

2002
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:39,789
blue and then you can see on the back

2003
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:42,279
side of the hand it's all blue radial

2004
01:16:39,789 --> 01:16:43,630
nerve and all our nerve

2005
01:16:42,279 --> 01:16:47,319
median nerve on the tips of the fingers

2006
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:48,640
but rarely if that gets bad enough in

2007
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:50,019
the medial nerve distribution you'll get

2008
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,940
some aching in the forearm that's

2009
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:54,370
usually just because the nerve which

2010
01:16:51,939 --> 01:16:55,750
sends its signal down to the muscles to

2011
01:16:54,369 --> 01:16:58,149
contract to the nerves do all the

2012
01:16:55,750 --> 01:17:00,279
information transfer um transmission

2013
01:16:58,149 --> 01:17:00,789
isn't working properly they can get a

2014
01:17:00,279 --> 01:17:04,269
key

2015
01:17:00,789 --> 01:17:07,000
because but so yeah so that's where

2016
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:10,060
you'll feel the different nerves the

2017
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,199
most common ones anyway in in the hand

2018
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:14,440
so if you someone says a no misen

2019
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:15,849
tingling I'm always like where and if

2020
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:18,519
they're telling me the whole hand I'm

2021
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:21,070
like well chances are starting way up

2022
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:29,500
here because that's the only place you

2023
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:33,039
could crush them all at the same you

2024
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:35,350
know in the same in one fell swoop yeah

2025
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:37,750
otherwise you're gonna get to do it here

2026
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:40,390
the kind of branch out once they kind of

2027
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:41,500
come through that thoracic outlet if you

2028
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:44,320
guys have heard of thoracic outlet

2029
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:46,449
syndrome again you're describing symptom

2030
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,279
why do you have that pressure what is

2031
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:51,429
the rasa classic outlet is that pushing

2032
01:17:48,279 --> 01:17:53,679
down oh okay that that outlet is getting

2033
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:56,020
it's getting stricter constricted that

2034
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:58,000
but again I care about not that that's

2035
01:17:56,020 --> 01:18:01,000
where the constriction is why is a

2036
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,560
constricted there yeah okay so was that

2037
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,600
all for carpal tom and really other

2038
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,240
nerve issues for d yeah that's kind of

2039
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:08,910
the general unless people have very I

2040
01:18:07,239 --> 01:18:11,889
really don't know how to pronounce this

2041
01:18:08,909 --> 01:18:14,680
okay there we go yes the equivalent is

2042
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:15,550
another common one this is one that

2043
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:19,600
people have pain when they're hanging

2044
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:24,420
space bar it does this it's it's

2045
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,420
inflammation of the tendon right here

2046
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:38,150
see if I can just do it by this hmm it's

2047
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:41,139
not gonna come up with that I'm pretty

2048
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:43,729
sure that but the tendon they meant but

2049
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:51,310
yeah this book doesn't have almost any

2050
01:18:43,729 --> 01:18:53,629
yeah and based things I don't think I

2051
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:56,710
actually cross off the ones we've gone

2052
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:56,710
over here so I'll be able to

2053
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:08,939
what is that what Oh slicing through the

2054
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:14,489
hand here we're getting we getting down

2055
01:19:08,939 --> 01:19:16,529
to the good stuff rather gruesome it's

2056
01:19:14,488 --> 01:19:18,919
like a scene from a mafia movie or

2057
01:19:16,529 --> 01:19:18,920
something

2058
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:38,869
from a different angle someday we will

2059
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:43,559
have a fully rotatable human atlas

2060
01:19:38,869 --> 01:19:44,849
someday I've always searched with us

2061
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,100
online they have kind of like some

2062
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:58,860
really not particularly good ones

2063
01:19:47,100 --> 01:20:00,570
oh why that came when I was looking for

2064
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:05,429
a pollicis with me um I don't really

2065
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:07,349
know can we send this back in time okay

2066
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:09,960
we just had that drawing of the of the

2067
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:13,800
smiling guy sitting though here's what

2068
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:15,119
I'm looking for so these two tendons

2069
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,130
that kind of form that triangle

2070
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:21,809
information of those tendon sheaths is

2071
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:23,789
de Quervain's but again it's often the

2072
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:25,710
spacebar action but it usually is

2073
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:26,970
indicated like it indicates of people

2074
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:29,460
are moving weirdly and generally

2075
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:30,690
actually a nice example of this just so

2076
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:36,420
you can kind of get an idea of what I

2077
01:20:30,689 --> 01:20:38,629
see is a young woman who had this

2078
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:41,010
diagnosis this medical diagnosis and

2079
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:42,329
whenever she would turn her hand over

2080
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:45,420
she would turn her hand over like this

2081
01:20:42,329 --> 01:20:46,680
she lead with her thumb and she wouldn't

2082
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,819
be able to turn it over as far as the

2083
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,470
other side should kind of look like this

2084
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:50,609
when I had her turn her hands over it's

2085
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:54,090
like well you're working way too hard

2086
01:20:50,609 --> 01:20:55,710
stop that so her treatment was keep your

2087
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:58,670
thumb in neutral and rotate your hand

2088
01:20:55,710 --> 01:21:02,100
back and forth that was it that was it

2089
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:03,510
and she eventually learned that like and

2090
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,829
she was able to then rotate her arm

2091
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:07,530
further didn't have to work as hard to

2092
01:21:04,829 --> 01:21:09,779
turn her hand over and that worked for

2093
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:11,219
her in her circumstance but it's just

2094
01:21:09,779 --> 01:21:13,380
very interesting you can see where

2095
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:14,820
people are kind of trying to find a way

2096
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:16,230
she's like I like just can't get there

2097
01:21:14,819 --> 01:21:17,729
so she would use her thumb to kind of

2098
01:21:16,229 --> 01:21:19,829
make up the difference and it's like

2099
01:21:17,729 --> 01:21:22,939
okay let's make it so you can get there

2100
01:21:19,829 --> 01:21:24,869
so you don't have to use your thumb so

2101
01:21:22,939 --> 01:21:26,789
shoulder impingement shoulder

2102
01:21:24,869 --> 01:21:28,829
impingement children just like the speed

2103
01:21:26,789 --> 01:21:33,239
round I know I'm just discreet shouting

2104
01:21:28,829 --> 01:21:35,010
out a children's event again where

2105
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:37,109
that's their medical diagnosis it's not

2106
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:38,010
a physical therapy diagnosis physical

2107
01:21:37,109 --> 01:21:39,889
therapy diagnosis

2108
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:42,030
what's causing the shoulder impingement

2109
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:43,800
shoulder impingement is the catch-all

2110
01:21:42,029 --> 01:21:45,329
for like when I move my arm like this it

2111
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,190
pinches up my shoulder I have that pain

2112
01:21:45,329 --> 01:21:51,649
in the vertical line it usually means

2113
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:54,479
the rotator cuff is being squished so

2114
01:21:51,649 --> 01:21:55,829
the rotator cuff again from what you

2115
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:57,899
described before is it's gonna look at

2116
01:21:55,829 --> 01:22:09,439
it muscles okay like that are on the

2117
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:09,439
interior so ones you can't really see

2118
01:22:09,739 --> 01:22:13,949
that's a shoulder from the outside

2119
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:17,489
that's your deltoid not your rotator

2120
01:22:13,949 --> 01:22:19,079
cuff your rotator cuff are these muscles

2121
01:22:17,489 --> 01:22:21,689
that are really right attached to the

2122
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:23,880
scapula which is this again this

2123
01:22:21,689 --> 01:22:25,589
triangle here and then your humerus

2124
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:28,199
coming down that way and they kind of

2125
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:31,369
hugged that humerus into that into that

2126
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:31,369
joint let's see if I can

2127
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,539
yeah these are just hard to understand

2128
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:49,029
if you don't already know what you're

2129
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:50,529
looking at is part of the problem where

2130
01:22:49,029 --> 01:22:54,250
is what I'm looking for them this is

2131
01:22:50,529 --> 01:22:56,920
pretty good so this is looking top-down

2132
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:58,239
as if we were looking through the top of

2133
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:03,300
the head kind of at the shoulder

2134
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:06,039
so again in the front here collarbone

2135
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:08,440
back here top of the shoulder blade and

2136
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:10,000
in that top of the shoulder blade is the

2137
01:23:08,439 --> 01:23:12,159
superspinatus muscle so that's where

2138
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,520
these stripes are that pink bit is the

2139
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:17,439
muscle this bulge here is the head of

2140
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:20,140
the humerus it's a head of the arm done

2141
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,279
the supraspinatus comes under so if you

2142
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:24,490
feel top of your shoulder your field

2143
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:26,769
bone right there the supraspinatus goes

2144
01:23:24,489 --> 01:23:28,300
under that bone so you've got your

2145
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:30,700
collarbone comes across

2146
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:32,409
you've got your acromion process that's

2147
01:23:30,699 --> 01:23:34,809
the thing that sticks out and if you

2148
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:36,579
come then back on the backside of that

2149
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:37,990
you'll feel soft squishy muscle tissue

2150
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:40,420
maybe there's a knot or two there but

2151
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:42,369
self-security muscles if you that is

2152
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:45,430
your supers under that is your

2153
01:23:42,369 --> 01:23:47,140
supraspinatus which comes out underneath

2154
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:49,659
that acromion process so if your scapula

2155
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:50,860
is not doing that nice motion where it

2156
01:23:49,659 --> 01:23:52,510
swings up like we were talking about

2157
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:54,250
earlier you're super super nice gets

2158
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:56,170
squished underneath that acromion

2159
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:57,670
process and that's classically known as

2160
01:23:56,170 --> 01:24:00,430
shoulder impingement but again

2161
01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:03,340
that's great but why is that happening

2162
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:04,300
so it's great so maybe it's falling so

2163
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:05,350
much that you're getting a pinched

2164
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:07,810
minute matter what you do but chances

2165
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:10,539
are that's capulet's not moving properly

2166
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:13,330
so that's real good then you just have

2167
01:24:10,539 --> 01:24:14,800
neck pain and shoulder pain yeah just

2168
01:24:13,329 --> 01:24:16,930
generalized neck pain shoulder pain

2169
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,820
because again those are the diagnosis

2170
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:20,920
that you got but you're good right so

2171
01:24:18,819 --> 01:24:22,059
neck pain could be from doing this could

2172
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,140
be from doing this could be because when

2173
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:24,610
you turn your head right you do a weird

2174
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:24,970
thing to point your elbow do a weird

2175
01:24:24,609 --> 01:24:27,579
thing

2176
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:30,909
shoulder pain again things not moving

2177
01:24:27,579 --> 01:24:32,859
properly in there basically it usually

2178
01:24:30,909 --> 01:24:36,819
comes down to how you're holding

2179
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:39,009
yourself and how you're moving you there

2180
01:24:36,819 --> 01:24:42,119
are some really cool great studies out

2181
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:45,070
there right now about MRI results and

2182
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:47,670
say neck pain or low back pain and it's

2183
01:24:45,069 --> 01:24:50,889
basically like yeah your MRI looks nasty

2184
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:53,590
but you're part of us yeah group that we

2185
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:55,300
tested that's completely pain-free so in

2186
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:55,940
normal populations is something like

2187
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:58,130
depending on the

2188
01:24:55,939 --> 01:25:01,609
age group and I'm going to screw it up

2189
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:04,310
so please look it up it's something like

2190
01:25:01,609 --> 01:25:05,929
in your in your 30s it was like 70

2191
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:08,390
something percent had it a weird anomaly

2192
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:09,920
on their MRI that if you went in and I

2193
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:11,780
said I had neck pain and you get imaging

2194
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,039
done and they're like oh yeah you got

2195
01:25:11,779 --> 01:25:16,009
this thing it's definitely that it's

2196
01:25:13,039 --> 01:25:18,170
like well but normal population has that

2197
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:20,900
too so again though you may have

2198
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:22,730
anomalies on imaging they don't

2199
01:25:20,899 --> 01:25:24,948
necessarily correlate to your pain or

2200
01:25:22,729 --> 01:25:26,539
symptoms portents correlate to Campagna

2201
01:25:24,948 --> 01:25:28,549
symptoms is what you're doing in the

2202
01:25:26,539 --> 01:25:31,729
rest of your body that may have caused

2203
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:33,260
that anomaly as well oh interesting so

2204
01:25:31,729 --> 01:25:34,429
it could be that the cause of the pain

2205
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:37,400
and the cause of the anomaly are

2206
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:39,980
actually are the same nothing to do with

2207
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:42,259
the anomaly at all yes I see or you know

2208
01:25:39,979 --> 01:25:45,099
so just because you have a bulging disc

2209
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:48,829
it does not mean that is you have pain

2210
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:51,590
so though we all especially anybody

2211
01:25:48,829 --> 01:25:55,039
who's science-based brain loved to have

2212
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:56,480
answers and images and all that it we

2213
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:58,250
need to kind of come to terms the fact

2214
01:25:56,479 --> 01:26:00,799
that's just not how our bodies work so

2215
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:02,539
we want to learn what it is that's

2216
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:05,420
actually causing our symptoms and kind

2217
01:26:02,539 --> 01:26:07,340
of understanding scope so we kind of

2218
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:09,590
need to just get em our ID all the time

2219
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:12,050
so that we can see when these things

2220
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:13,850
actually develop and then go well

2221
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:15,350
alright you know occasionally just

2222
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:21,079
single-handedly blew up our healthcare

2223
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:22,699
sorry we're trying to say is that

2224
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:24,439
conservative care consumes its

2225
01:26:22,698 --> 01:26:26,179
management which saves both the

2226
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:28,609
insurance companies money and you money

2227
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:29,030
are actually the better way to go fair

2228
01:26:28,609 --> 01:26:31,639
enough

2229
01:26:29,029 --> 01:26:35,029
so we've only got a few minutes left

2230
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:37,340
here so let's just end on so obviously

2231
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:39,590
this is sort of all of the the sort of

2232
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,969
stuff that's with diagnosis figure out

2233
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:42,829
where the pain could be what it might be

2234
01:26:40,969 --> 01:26:46,039
coming from that sort of thing so at the

2235
01:26:42,829 --> 01:26:49,069
end of doing all of that work you then

2236
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:50,390
obviously give people sort of activities

2237
01:26:49,069 --> 01:26:51,679
to do right that's kind of the goal like

2238
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:53,360
you were saying it might be as simple as

2239
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,560
just like hey try to learn how to turn

2240
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:55,579
your hand over more or something like

2241
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:59,239
this or it may be like a set of

2242
01:26:55,579 --> 01:27:03,140
exercises so it cetera so I just wanted

2243
01:26:59,238 --> 01:27:05,119
to ask sort of the question are there

2244
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:07,010
preventative exercises that you

2245
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:08,359
recommend or preventative

2246
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:10,420
that you recommend because obviously if

2247
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:12,439
someone has one of these problems

2248
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:15,109
they're gonna have to go to somebody

2249
01:27:12,439 --> 01:27:16,429
like you to sort of get the actual

2250
01:27:15,109 --> 01:27:17,960
movement stuff worked out and go okay

2251
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:20,119
here's the exercises you need to do to

2252
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:23,630
correct that specific impairment but

2253
01:27:20,119 --> 01:27:25,460
prior to having a problem are there

2254
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:28,420
things you can do that just keep your

2255
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:31,010
body in shape better than you know

2256
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:33,529
decrease the likelihood of things

2257
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:35,449
getting into these bad positions knowing

2258
01:27:33,529 --> 01:27:37,550
that the person probably is like this

2259
01:27:35,449 --> 01:27:39,380
most of the time how do you counteract

2260
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:40,970
that you know what what do you recommend

2261
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:42,260
for that and are there exercises you

2262
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:45,440
recommend people do daily or anything

2263
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:47,869
like this yeah so like I said before I

2264
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:49,009
don't tend to love giving exercises so

2265
01:27:47,869 --> 01:27:51,619
I'm going to start with the two simplest

2266
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:52,489
things you can do number one as part of

2267
01:27:51,619 --> 01:27:54,800
your daily life

2268
01:27:52,489 --> 01:27:57,079
try to change positions frequently don't

2269
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,960
get really settled and comfy in one

2270
01:27:57,079 --> 01:28:01,670
position stand up sit down lean back

2271
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:03,199
lean forward you don't need to be like

2272
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:04,159
this all the time I'm not one of those

2273
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:06,529
people it's going to tell you to do this

2274
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:08,930
because it's not realistic you're at

2275
01:28:06,529 --> 01:28:10,460
your computers a lot but changing

2276
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:11,780
positions is really good for your body

2277
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:13,850
it's really healthy for your body you

2278
01:28:11,779 --> 01:28:16,729
don't get stuck in that one shape so

2279
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:19,730
that's number one number two is do

2280
01:28:16,729 --> 01:28:21,799
anything any activity any activity

2281
01:28:19,729 --> 01:28:24,889
that's not sitting down go for a walk go

2282
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,360
for a run I don't really care what you

2283
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:27,590
do but do something cardiovascular

2284
01:28:26,359 --> 01:28:28,909
getting your blood flowing everywhere

2285
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:30,739
and getting your body working globally

2286
01:28:28,909 --> 01:28:32,720
and coordinating movement all together

2287
01:28:30,739 --> 01:28:34,729
is the best thing you can do for your

2288
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:37,310
health musculoskeletal and global health

2289
01:28:34,729 --> 01:28:39,619
so those are my two like everyone should

2290
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:42,560
be doing those things and they're

2291
01:28:39,619 --> 01:28:45,979
relatively easy to do as far as specific

2292
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,360
exercises go I know everyone likes the

2293
01:28:45,979 --> 01:28:48,589
specifics to makes them be able to say

2294
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:53,029
they can point to that one thing it's

2295
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:55,369
like it's that thing haha my I will

2296
01:28:53,029 --> 01:28:58,250
again go with just one I'll pick just

2297
01:28:55,369 --> 01:29:00,739
one okay um because I think it's easier

2298
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:02,090
I don't love to give people giant lists

2299
01:29:00,739 --> 01:29:04,899
of things to do because people don't do

2300
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:09,470
giant lists they do one thing

2301
01:29:04,899 --> 01:29:11,689
some people are exceptional I find my

2302
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:16,610
tech workers sometimes like my circus

2303
01:29:11,689 --> 01:29:18,388
people love to go to extremes so

2304
01:29:16,609 --> 01:29:21,518
sometimes I have to bring them back in

2305
01:29:18,389 --> 01:29:22,510
but basically computer work all day

2306
01:29:21,519 --> 01:29:25,239
you're here

2307
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:27,369
so that's relatively rounded in the

2308
01:29:25,238 --> 01:29:29,408
torso relatively shoulders forward

2309
01:29:27,368 --> 01:29:31,389
relatively internally rotated the arms

2310
01:29:29,408 --> 01:29:33,549
the wrists could be doing all sorts of

2311
01:29:31,389 --> 01:29:35,889
weird things cuz I like to take people

2312
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:38,110
completely out of that and my absolute

2313
01:29:35,889 --> 01:29:39,969
favorite favorite actress that exercise

2314
01:29:38,109 --> 01:29:43,779
I call the reverse wall wall slide or a

2315
01:29:39,969 --> 01:29:46,149
wall angel as possibly you can find it

2316
01:29:43,779 --> 01:29:50,050
involves sticking your back flat up

2317
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:52,238
against a wall which may mean your feet

2318
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:55,139
have to be a little further away your

2319
01:29:52,238 --> 01:29:57,698
arms out to the side about 90 degrees

2320
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:58,929
hands on the wall but your elbows not on

2321
01:29:57,698 --> 01:30:00,518
the wall because most of you are stiff

2322
01:29:58,929 --> 01:30:02,109
from doing this so you to get those

2323
01:30:00,519 --> 01:30:03,940
elbows back on the wall your children's

2324
01:30:02,109 --> 01:30:05,859
gonna pop out this is why I don't like

2325
01:30:03,939 --> 01:30:08,078
giving exercises because I'm so specific

2326
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:10,408
about how I make people do it's really

2327
01:30:08,078 --> 01:30:13,139
difficult so back flat against the wall

2328
01:30:10,408 --> 01:30:16,629
hands on the wall elbows forward

2329
01:30:13,139 --> 01:30:18,309
shoulders relaxed lacks neck relaxed if

2330
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:20,229
you can achieve this position which is

2331
01:30:18,309 --> 01:30:22,690
not going to be easy for everyone then

2332
01:30:20,229 --> 01:30:25,059
you can slide your hands up the wall and

2333
01:30:22,689 --> 01:30:30,339
overhead and the idea behind that is

2334
01:30:25,059 --> 01:30:31,479
that you are opening the chest putting

2335
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:32,679
the arms out to the side just can bring

2336
01:30:31,479 --> 01:30:34,389
your shoulder blades together which is

2337
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:35,498
the opposite of here so you'll be firing

2338
01:30:34,389 --> 01:30:37,630
the muscles between the shoulder blades

2339
01:30:35,498 --> 01:30:39,609
you're working your arms into external

2340
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:41,920
rotation again fighting this internal

2341
01:30:39,609 --> 01:30:44,799
rotation position it's also an active

2342
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,819
stretch for the pectoral muscles just to

2343
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,320
get you back there which is why the

2344
01:30:45,819 --> 01:30:50,049
elbows will probably have to come

2345
01:30:47,319 --> 01:30:51,908
forward and then as you go up overhead

2346
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:53,469
you're gonna trigger in your middle and

2347
01:30:51,908 --> 01:30:57,698
lower trapezius in your back so back

2348
01:30:53,469 --> 01:30:59,229
here you're going to be stretching your

2349
01:30:57,698 --> 01:31:01,210
PEC muscles again as you go up overhead

2350
01:30:59,229 --> 01:31:04,030
your lats are gonna have to let go your

2351
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:05,948
external rotators are firing it's a lot

2352
01:31:04,029 --> 01:31:07,569
of information but the global idea is

2353
01:31:05,948 --> 01:31:10,029
you're doing the opposite of this so

2354
01:31:07,569 --> 01:31:12,788
that's probably my number one favorite

2355
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:15,908
end of the day or lunch time do five or

2356
01:31:12,788 --> 01:31:17,590
ten of them exercises and they'll keep

2357
01:31:15,908 --> 01:31:19,359
you kind of moving on healthy awesome

2358
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:22,420
well we are out of time thank you so

2359
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:24,460
much and also you're going to be at the

2360
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:26,170
reception or throughout the visit okay

2361
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:28,430
so there's a there's a pure motion

2362
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:31,069
banner which is your you

2363
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:32,690
company and there's a peer motion banner
