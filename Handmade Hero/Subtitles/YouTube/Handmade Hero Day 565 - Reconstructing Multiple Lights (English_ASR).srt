1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,448
alright hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:06,298
handmade here oh sure we could a

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:09,388
complete game live on stream we may I'll

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,339
be honest yesterday's episode was pretty

5
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,529
interesting to me because I had never

6
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,580
really thought it not only had never

7
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:16,288
really thought about it but I've

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,929
actually never even seen anyone talk

9
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,420
about it or do it I mean I can't imagine

10
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:25,079
where the first it doesn't make much

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,849
sense for us to be the first but the

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,919
stuff we discovered on yesterday's dream

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,929
about using signed distance fields to

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,910
interpolate lighting properly lighting

15
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:35,100
fall off properly or I shouldn't say

16
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:36,179
properly but attractively I've literally

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,079
never seen that before so that was

18
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,710
complete news to me when I sort of

19
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,820
investigated that and it turned out to

20
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,878
work that was shocking and so I'm kind

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,308
of interested in this and I want to kind

22
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,479
of follow that to its logical conclusion

23
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:53,939
so today we are definitely gonna

24
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:58,799
continue experiment to that and see what

25
00:00:53,939 --> 00:01:00,599
we can do with how many voxels we know

26
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,408
we can you know we know we can sample a

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,879
large number of voxels at runtime and it

28
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,290
doesn't seem to have a particularly

29
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,839
large cost like it seems like the grass

30
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,600
card is pretty good at sampling voxels

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,130
and given that we can sample what

32
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,109
appears to be a fairly large number of

33
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:19,560
voxels and we know we can interpolate

34
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:21,239
signed distance fields quite well it

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,340
kind of starts to beg the question of

36
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,399
well wait a minute like what kind of

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,560
interesting and novel at least to me

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,359
well like I said I can't promise that we

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,560
did this first because there's a lot of

40
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,118
graphics creatures out there as probably

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,469
someone has already discovered it but it

42
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,040
was fun to discover it independently

43
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,599
let's put it that way since we know we

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,020
can interpolate sign distance feels

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,609
quite well and we know that we can

46
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:47,819
interpolate normals it appears like

47
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:50,519
pretty well as in addition it sort of

48
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:54,089
starts to beg the question of like what

49
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:56,938
is the most attractive light

50
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,359
reconstruction scheme and how can we

51
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:02,129
sort of like lean on that in our output

52
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,420
phase to like make really good looking

53
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:06,929
lighting from pretty low resolution

54
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,340
sampling right so I'm relatively excited

55
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,868
about that I've literally never seen

56
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,670
anyone talk about anything like this

57
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,710
before so I'm pretty interested in that

58
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:16,619
and I like when I

59
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,200
got something new so like I said I'm not

60
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,150
sure we invented it because it probably

61
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,649
exists somewhere that's the nature of

62
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,539
graphics research is there's so many

63
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,250
people who do it and there's been so

64
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:27,870
much attention paid to it that it's very

65
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,379
unlikely that when you discover some

66
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,849
think you actually discovered something

67
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:37,019
so there is that but that said I

68
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:39,030
certainly am interested in the fact that

69
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,219
we did independently discover it and I'm

70
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,620
pretty psyched to sort of like see where

71
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,849
that leads so as you can see we are

72
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,620
currently here's our little

73
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,239
interpolation test and the really

74
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,310
interesting thing about this test and

75
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,770
again I'd like to just underscore just

76
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,050
how interesting it was to me is if you

77
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,870
look at what's going on here this is

78
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:03,270
actually voxel reconstructed lighting

79
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,009
from a spherical light right and the

80
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,159
thing that's really remarkable about

81
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:11,069
this is even though there is literally

82
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,919
no direct lighting computation occurring

83
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:16,379
now there is none we are not directly

84
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,750
computing lighting at all the pixel

85
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,400
shader does not know where the light

86
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,280
source was it is literally

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,110
reconstructing it simply from a voxel

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,349
intensity right it looks as if you've

89
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,690
performed direct lighting right because

90
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,120
what we did with the signed distance

91
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:39,240
field light interpolation actually is

92
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,090
able to reconstruct a real sphere from

93
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,420
samples that are just on the voxel right

94
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,099
and that is pretty remarkable to me

95
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:49,829
because I've never seen that demoed

96
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,840
before but it's really kind of cool and

97
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:56,700
just to underscore how interesting that

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,680
is if we are to look back at the actual

99
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:02,399
like what it looks like when you don't

100
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,920
do that so if you do not reconstruct

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,659
with a sign distance field right if you

102
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,429
actually reconstruct with just light

103
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,229
intensity which is what most people do

104
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,629
as far as I know the only kind of ever

105
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:14,819
seen was this kind if you reconstruct

106
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:17,250
with light intensity let me show you the

107
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:20,849
difference right so this is what we were

108
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:24,620
looking at before and this is good that

109
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,620
wrong route I have to do it this way

110
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,439
yeah so you know this is the the way

111
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,720
we're doing before and as you can see

112
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,329
it's like perfectly spherical right when

113
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,410
you actually switch to doing the kind of

114
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:39,240
light interpolation people normally do

115
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,110
in a voxel look at how ugly that is do

116
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,480
you see all the like rectilinear

117
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,090
artifacts from that you know from that

118
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,129
voxel sample right it's pretty bad

119
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:53,329
you can really see them very clearly and

120
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:55,850
all we did there was switch from

121
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:57,959
interpolating light intensity to

122
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,939
interpolating a signed distance field

123
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,839
that represented like light intensity

124
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:05,009
and again the difference there is

125
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,769
strictly in whether or not you allow the

126
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,930
values to go negative and one of the

127
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:12,209
things that you know is really kind of

128
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:16,280
non-intuitive is that when you are using

129
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:19,289
a reconstruction filter on something

130
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,509
truncating values creates artifacts

131
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,189
that's what happens so even though you

132
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,199
would normally say well why does it

133
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:27,259
matter if I truncate a value if I know

134
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,180
that the light intensity is zero or

135
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:32,039
negative 1 or negative 10 or whatever

136
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,120
why would it matter if I truncated all

137
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,580
those to zero because they still

138
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,590
represent no light contribution and the

139
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,750
answer is because it changes the shape

140
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:42,149
of your interpolation so you must

141
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,009
interpolate first and then clamp if you

142
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:46,379
don't want to introduce artifacts right

143
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:49,139
and so that discovery was really kind of

144
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,310
novel to me because I'd never heard it

145
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,569
mentioned in the in the context of

146
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,269
lighting and I'm really interested in

147
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:56,459
that and I think that was cool so now

148
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:59,129
what I'd like to do is just take a look

149
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:02,159
at what can we now like let's suppose

150
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:04,379
that we embrace that and say if we're

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,910
gonna take you know take all of our

152
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,379
lighting information which you know at

153
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,810
the moment like I said we this is just a

154
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:13,459
test spear that we're jamming in here

155
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:15,899
and so what we're looking to to do is

156
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:18,000
finalize this sampling layer as

157
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:20,689
something we can dump our actual light

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,250
contribution information down into right

159
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:27,990
and so what I'm really interested to

160
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:31,978
know is if we are going to output our

161
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,960
lighting in this way what can we do like

162
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:36,449
what is the best way to set it up and

163
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,060
how can we really leverage the fact that

164
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:43,449
this is for

165
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:44,918
doing really nice reconstruction to sort

166
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,689
of really create something that allows

167
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:49,089
us to get a lot of lighting expressivity

168
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:50,889
in here right because again I don't if

169
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:52,388
this is all I wanted was like a little

170
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:55,120
like flashlight effect on the player

171
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,590
then we're kind of done but if I was

172
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,990
doing that I wouldn't need the voxel

173
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,339
right but what I want to do now is flood

174
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,139
this thing with tons of lighting

175
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:04,119
information like I want all of the

176
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,100
bounce light from the ray tracing and I

177
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,519
want all of the like lots of different

178
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:14,229
light sources and all their that's what

179
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:16,449
I actually want to do right and I kind

180
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:18,569
of want to make sure that we have like

181
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:22,539
the best possible set up for that right

182
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:24,819
and and so yeah that's all so what I'd

183
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,500
like to do now is just say let's let's

184
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:29,529
push this a little further and

185
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,300
furthermore let's see how much detail we

186
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,369
actually need in the voxel because it

187
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,199
may be that our voxel now is still too

188
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,399
detailed and we probably could get away

189
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,529
with less is it all I'm thinking right

190
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,779
so for example like if we take a look at

191
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:45,339
the actual striping of the voxel so if

192
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:47,699
you remember quickly we've got like a

193
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:51,639
thing here where I think at least I can

194
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:54,849
switch to look at the voxel striping and

195
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,610
just give me some input into I guess not

196
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:03,340
this is zero didn't may have a way to

197
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:09,270
get voxel striping in here oh oh wait no

198
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:09,269
no I that was that was the wrong thing

199
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:20,259
yeah oh boy

200
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:20,949
so I guess I don't know maybe this will

201
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:28,079
do it

202
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:28,079
not sure let's take a look No

203
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:40,158
so we're packing north and south light

204
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,528
directions in here light west is the

205
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,639
only thing that actually has any light

206
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:50,720
information carried in it at the moment

207
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:56,028
so shouldn't that have worked shouldn't

208
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,790
that have striped meaning this this

209
00:08:56,028 --> 00:09:02,600
right here where we striped the West

210
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:05,870
with a full red oh because it already is

211
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,129
nevermind all right yeah obviously that

212
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,318
won't do anything never mind

213
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:14,059
I take it I take it all back that's not

214
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:22,958
gonna do anything um like let's just say

215
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:22,958
we then don't do something well okay

216
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:31,659
maybe we just do this then does that

217
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,659
help

218
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:43,309
that didn't help either all right you

219
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:44,779
know what we're just not gonna bother

220
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:46,159
with that right now I want to take a

221
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,629
look at the voxel resolution one more

222
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,939
time so I'm not sure what resolution we

223
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,590
need you know what I'm gonna so what I

224
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,530
want to do here is I would like to make

225
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,930
this actually work with so that I can

226
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:59,659
turn on box the striping here in some

227
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:01,549
way and we kind of got too many cases

228
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:06,079
here so maybe what I'll do is I'll just

229
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:09,229
like sort of duplicate this one entirely

230
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,840
right and so I'm gonna I'm gonna pull

231
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,879
this out the part where we assign it I'm

232
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,370
gonna pull that out and I'm gonna pull

233
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:20,480
it out down here I'm gonna get rid of

234
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:23,240
this right and what I want to do here is

235
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,370
I'm gonna make the definition of these

236
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,419
things the light west all that stuff I'm

237
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,730
gonna make that just be in here period

238
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:33,409
so we can make this loop a little bit

239
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,450
more sensible right because I'm kind of

240
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:36,829
just piling all this test fest up in

241
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,950
here and that's not necessarily the

242
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,889
smartest thing to do so let's just try

243
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,940
and clean this up a little bit just

244
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:46,490
because I would like to take a look at

245
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,990
the resolution and just understand the

246
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,730
effects of the resolution on the

247
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,750
reconstruction that's what I'm trying to

248
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,440
do here just kind of get that a little

249
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,809
bit more out of control

250
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,790
all right and so what I'm gonna do here

251
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:00,789
is just have these parceled out so what

252
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:05,539
I'd like to do is have a pound if here

253
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:09,110
which is like pound if like test lights

254
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:14,719
here or something like this right and

255
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:17,419
here is that code then we're gonna put

256
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,860
an end if in there so now we have the

257
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:20,899
test light sphere then we're gonna do

258
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:27,009
another one of these which is like you

259
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:31,389
know pound if test light flicker board

260
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:31,389
and that'll be this crap

261
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:41,409
and then we'll finally have one that's

262
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:48,969
like if tests light probes and that'll

263
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:51,370
be this is garbage right here right and

264
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,710
so now I can just like turn these on and

265
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:56,230
off with like a you know a pound of fine

266
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,730
basically and it'll be a little bit

267
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,940
clearer what the heck is going on

268
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:05,170
so if up here I do a pound to fine

269
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,880
test light checkerboard now I should be

270
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:10,779
able to just have picking this test

271
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,820
light checkerboard code turn on and what

272
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,220
it should do if I can pilot now is I

273
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,980
should get like nothing on screen right

274
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:22,180
because I don't have any lighting

275
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:27,629
getting fed in there if I now initialize

276
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:30,729
these so light west is going to equal

277
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:32,620
some amount of light and light south

278
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,139
light north that's where we were packing

279
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,490
the normal information in so since we

280
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,289
don't really know what the normal

281
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,110
information should be necessarily I'm

282
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:45,849
just gonna pack it in as like all ones

283
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:48,850
or something or something like that so

284
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:53,170
we'll just say like light south is gonna

285
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:55,300
be like something like that which is not

286
00:12:53,169 --> 00:13:01,599
really correct but I just need to stuff

287
00:12:55,299 --> 00:13:06,519
something in there light Seth no sorry

288
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,409
it's like north so I just need to stuff

289
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:13,389
something in there so it'll be you know

290
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:15,399
relatively correct at all why am I not

291
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:18,299
seeing anything so light West those

292
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,299
should come in here right

293
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:23,389
I think that should be correct right

294
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,669
did I change the way the oh I did I

295
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:34,259
changed the encoding so that actually

296
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:37,378
wouldn't be very much light anymore cuz

297
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:40,048
it's biased now that's the problem okay

298
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:41,519
remember we biased our lights to do

299
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:44,458
specifically that sampling so I need

300
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,499
this to be brighter it needs to be at

301
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:49,258
least like a or up probably to be a

302
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:51,209
bright light yeah there we go alright so

303
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,739
that was definitely our problem alright

304
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,659
so you can see the sort of checkerboard

305
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:58,548
pattern here now obviously we don't

306
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:02,129
actually get a checkerboard pattern here

307
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:04,139
because we have interpolation turned on

308
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:05,970
you know what I mean

309
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,369
but if you look at like how dense the

310
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,139
checkerboard actually is in practice and

311
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:12,089
we could go turn interpolation off in

312
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,249
fact you know that's maybe somewhere do

313
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:16,319
you want to or taking a look at it but

314
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:18,569
if we look at how the interpolation is

315
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:20,639
working here you can see that it's still

316
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:25,519
a pretty dense voxel it could capture

317
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:29,730
some fairly even at the most zoomed out

318
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:32,220
that we would be it's still pretty you

319
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,350
know it's a it's a pretty dense sampling

320
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,149
and you can see like it would still be a

321
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,459
little wider like it's not we're not

322
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:39,808
like properly sizing the lighting region

323
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,698
at the lighting of observation at the

324
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:43,948
moment so you know it would be a little

325
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,328
wider than this but it is kind of an

326
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:48,318
open question to me is like did we

327
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:51,599
actually need it to be this dense right

328
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:54,269
and so what I want to see is just like

329
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,360
let's suppose I'm just curious and we're

330
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:59,519
not don't really need to go down a level

331
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,379
here so I'm not sure I will keep this

332
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,068
even if it works but I just want to know

333
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:08,159
so if we were to change the voxel

334
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:11,818
resolution here right so here's our

335
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:15,688
voxel if we changed it down to an even

336
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:18,838
less resolute voxel there right so

337
00:15:15,688 --> 00:15:20,789
here's our are much less resolute voxel

338
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,939
so you can see that the bands are sort

339
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:25,649
of much bigger and blockier now right so

340
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:27,448
if we switch to something that's much

341
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:30,058
more a low resolution like that my

342
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:31,500
question is what happens if now we try

343
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,789
to reconstruct

344
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,129
the spherical light again I'm just

345
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:37,679
curious like how bad is it

346
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:39,570
as you look like how good is this

347
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:46,189
reconstruction filter like as we start

348
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:50,370
to step down the resolution of the

349
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:55,890
reconstruction what do we get right and

350
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:58,110
I don't know all right so I mean you

351
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:00,689
again really interesting I mean look at

352
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,519
how good that reconstruction is I mean

353
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,650
you would never know like look at how

354
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,210
detailed it is right and again that's

355
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:07,949
just because signed distance fields can

356
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,930
be reconstructed properly with bilinear

357
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,660
filtering and trilinear filtering right

358
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:15,689
and so you look it's like you would

359
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:18,839
never guess that the sampling that that

360
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:26,130
the actual image that you had to took

361
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:31,680
reconstruct that from was you know was

362
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:35,250
the this resolution right was was was

363
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,809
this right at that banding level I mean

364
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:41,279
another way to look at it would be like

365
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:45,209
you look at this and you see like this

366
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:48,659
the you know the the the sphere there

367
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:54,060
right and then you go to the OpenGL

368
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:56,569
layer and you turn off like geo linear

369
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,569
or something

370
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:11,149
right and now if we actually recompile

371
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,920
this and rerun the with it with the

372
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,500
render that doesn't have the bilinear

373
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,720
filtering turned on right our trailer

374
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,939
you're filtering then what you can see

375
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:24,230
is that's the actual resolution of the

376
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:28,400
light like that's what we're storing you

377
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:31,069
know I'm saying very very sparse there

378
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,660
right and it's it's just really

379
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:35,329
remarkable to me that we can reconstruct

380
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:38,330
lighting that smooth from something this

381
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:40,039
course and again that was just the

382
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:42,769
signed distance field was such a cool

383
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:49,480
thing to use there I just I'm really

384
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:55,460
stoked about that trick right so anyway

385
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:58,930
let's go ahead and now try to poke at

386
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,930
this thing and see what we can do so

387
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:10,040
what I determined last time and and I

388
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,020
don't know like I said I don't know

389
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,349
maybe we'll just maybe we'll just use it

390
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:16,670
at that low resolution I'm not sure I

391
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:20,119
don't know if that resolution gives us

392
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,730
enough verticality that is one thing I'm

393
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:27,289
a little concerned I don't know to what

394
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,940
extent we're getting sort of a I don't

395
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,589
know to what extent if we were at this

396
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,410
low resolution if we would get enough

397
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:35,480
gradation there I think we do you know I

398
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:39,040
mean it's crazy but I think we could get

399
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,509
away with a voxel that small right I

400
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:48,099
don't know I want to say we probably

401
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:50,420
could just looking at that right and

402
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:53,029
that would be so cool right I mean

403
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:57,200
that's such a small amount of

404
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:59,119
information it's really pretty neat

405
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,690
right

406
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,609
so anyway

407
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:08,539
if we come through here and we base to

408
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:10,429
say like okay you know we are gonna you

409
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:12,710
know use the reconstruction filter it

410
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,509
seems to work pretty well we want to

411
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,279
kind of do signed distance field

412
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:20,059
interpolation as much as possible

413
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,559
because to the extent that we can we

414
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:24,169
want to make sure that we interpolate

415
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:34,339
the boundaries of these things you know

416
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:36,050
well and so if we take a look at what we

417
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,750
want to encode now I think it's pretty

418
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:40,309
different than what we were encoding

419
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:43,910
because you know we switched that we

420
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:46,279
looked at the box model the you know the

421
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,860
the four corner box the 6/6 Direction

422
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,720
box model I think that's garbage I don't

423
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:53,059
think we want that we saw that it had

424
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,579
artifacts we used it so I think we kind

425
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:59,029
of want to change the way we're looking

426
00:19:55,579 --> 00:20:01,099
at this problem and I think what we want

427
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:03,170
to do is look at it as there's some

428
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:05,719
number of signed distance fields for

429
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,490
lighting and we're going to output like

430
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,230
three signed distance fields or

431
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,829
something for lighting right something

432
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:15,170
like that so if you imagine how we might

433
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:21,009
encode these like imagine we did

434
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:24,380
something like a light field normal zero

435
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:27,410
light field color zero or something like

436
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:30,710
this and then we just have like a couple

437
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,840
of these so we're basically saying like

438
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,519
we are going to put down some light

439
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:38,329
fields the light fields will have a

440
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:40,789
normal and a color and it's up to the

441
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:44,569
lighting system at the head end to

442
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:47,509
generate something whatever that

443
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:50,689
something is generate something that

444
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:52,970
fits into these light fields well and it

445
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:56,330
can be reconstructed as part of the

446
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:59,029
lighting model that will be as

447
00:20:56,329 --> 00:21:01,480
continuous as possible right and we know

448
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:05,839
that this is not it's not trivial to do

449
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,370
because the light fields it's not just

450
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,970
three lights in the world right we have

451
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:13,939
an arbitrary in irradiance sphere at

452
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,850
each light probe arbitrary lights coming

453
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,500
in bouncing off the

454
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,759
walls coming from direct light sources

455
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,420
somewhere come you know who knows what

456
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,200
it is

457
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:26,420
so the actual light that we have coming

458
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:29,360
in there's just like a ton of

459
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:32,610
information that we need there right and

460
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,919
so we need to encode these light fields

461
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:36,629
somehow and I'm gonna pick this way

462
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,070
temporarily it may be that we want

463
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,660
something more like spherical harmonics

464
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:40,950
or something about I'd since I don't

465
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:48,650
spend a lot of time thinking about

466
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:51,960
problems like those I I'm not sure

467
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:54,780
because basically like the way to look

468
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,460
at it is interpolating normals in a

469
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,819
light field versus interpolating

470
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,240
parameters of something like a like a

471
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:06,359
circle harmonic a spherical harmonic is

472
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,079
basically like decomposing a light

473
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:12,569
sphere in incoming light sphere into the

474
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,659
sum of functions that are like sinusoids

475
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:18,240
like or you could think of them as like

476
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,340
positive and negative lobes right and so

477
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,259
there's two ways we could look at this

478
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,299
problem one is we're gonna interpolate

479
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:27,089
light fields and we're sort of fixing

480
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:35,609
the directions where we are talking

481
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:37,879
about those and you know let me here

482
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:37,879
they are

483
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,819
so if you think about spherical

484
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:48,418
harmonics right what you're really

485
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:53,308
talking about is coefficients that tell

486
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:55,950
you which of these you are adding to

487
00:22:53,308 --> 00:23:00,000
your light incoming light right

488
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:02,759
so what the first coefficient of your

489
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,240
spherical lighting is that just the

490
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:08,609
incoming light from everywhere so

491
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,528
there's a ubiquitous like ambient light

492
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:14,548
right it's just a base

493
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:17,159
it's a baseline value right the next set

494
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:20,908
of coefficients are one each for these

495
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:23,580
three different sort of directional

496
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:24,539
positive and negative lobes it doesn't

497
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:26,879
matter which one of these you think is

498
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:28,319
positive or negative really but

499
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,590
basically like positive being green and

500
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,450
negative being red right in this case so

501
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:36,388
whatever the coefficient is it adds

502
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:39,389
light here and subtracts light here

503
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:41,939
right then you have one more coefficient

504
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:43,918
adds light here subtract slight here one

505
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,528
more coefficient adds like here subtract

506
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,500
slight here so a four parameters

507
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:52,200
spherical harmonic deconstruction would

508
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,538
give you this much control over your

509
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,399
light right and you just have to

510
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:57,778
decompose whatever the amount of

511
00:23:56,398 --> 00:23:59,609
lighting is that you thought you wanted

512
00:23:57,778 --> 00:24:02,700
right you just need to decompose it into

513
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:03,928
that similarly if you wanted to go one

514
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,080
more step down the ladder

515
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:10,019
you could afford by adding four more

516
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,089
parameters unfortunately you kinda need

517
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:14,038
a fifth one here to capture that last

518
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:17,009
one if you want the one more rung down

519
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:20,819
right I don't know what people typically

520
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:24,119
do to try and jam eyes Eero one two in

521
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:26,700
to look if you want that extra level of

522
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:28,138
detail I'm not sure what they do but you

523
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,519
know we could also go hog-wild so if you

524
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:32,638
count how many there are here right

525
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:38,159
there's four here there's five here and

526
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:40,319
then there's seven here right and so 7

527
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,320
plus 5 right if you were to look at

528
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:49,819
these two levels together right like 7 7

529
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:56,059
plus 5 is 12 12 is 3 more of

530
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:58,599
three more like Technic texels right so

531
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:01,970
if you were to imagine storing these in

532
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:04,699
the voxel if you just go like well all

533
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,950
right we've got four elements here and

534
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,080
twelve elements here that's a total of

535
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,720
sixteen elements we could just do that

536
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:14,629
in our voxels right so we could do a

537
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,190
spherical harmonics version that was

538
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,470
basically just these lobes and

539
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:23,029
interpolate that right and that would

540
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:24,620
just work I think right and that's one

541
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:27,680
way to read that's the way we would

542
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:30,679
reconstruct our lighting it seems pretty

543
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,779
compelling right because we know we can

544
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,779
look up that many things in our voxel we

545
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:39,109
know that 16 lookups in the voxel is

546
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:42,649
only four voxel reeds right because each

547
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:46,059
one comes back as four elements and so

548
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:48,350
we could pretty easily say well you know

549
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:50,059
there's our spherical harmonics right

550
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:54,980
there and we just look it up and we do

551
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:57,019
the computation right so it has some

552
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,990
compelling features to it it seems

553
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:02,359
pretty reasonable but the problem that

554
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,440
you get into it pretty quickly if we

555
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:06,769
were to go that route which is

556
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,170
interesting probably would have right

557
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:11,869
off the bat no colored lights right

558
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:15,259
because these coefficients just tell you

559
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:17,269
the light the amount of light so if we

560
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:18,890
actually wanted colored lighting we

561
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:21,529
would need to multiply whatever value it

562
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,840
was by three right so our spherical

563
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:27,619
harmonics would be something like this

564
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:31,369
if we wanted to go all the way down to

565
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:34,939
to this rung here that's what we would

566
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:36,619
be looking at right it's arguable that

567
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,870
we don't really need to go that far down

568
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:42,079
right maybe that's too far down so maybe

569
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:45,250
we would only do nine here right 1 2 3 4

570
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:47,990
5 6 7 8 9 those nine parameters right

571
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:51,700
maybe we would just do nine and if we do

572
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,700
9 times 3 right

573
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:58,350
that's how many coefficients we would

574
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,830
need and we know we can look up four in

575
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,829
a go

576
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:06,659
so that would only be seven right so if

577
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,130
we just cut it down a little bit this

578
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,980
would be what we would be looking at

579
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:15,290
right one two three four five six seven

580
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:23,150
and we know we could do that no problem

581
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:23,149
so surreal harmonics down to l2 right

582
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:33,480
not a bad idea if I'm honest right it

583
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:38,159
seems kind of maybe sort of a little bit

584
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,130
not so much possibly uh who knows like

585
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,019
that could be interesting

586
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,120
and the reason that could be interesting

587
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:49,680
is because it gives us sort of a formal

588
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:54,659
way of figuring out how we're gonna talk

589
00:27:49,680 --> 00:28:01,980
about the lighting right and you know

590
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:04,620
the I I guess like the alternative of

591
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:07,620
having a direction and a coefficient I

592
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:08,639
don't really know of any there's there's

593
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,799
not really a lot of ways we could

594
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,230
produce if we just wanted three light

595
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,480
fields so if we just did something that

596
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,370
looks like this then we're kind of off

597
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,740
again with with no particular

598
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:22,500
theoretical guidance as to how we

599
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:27,120
produce those fields it's kind of just a

600
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:31,829
random thing you know what I mean and so

601
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:33,750
while stuffing those directly with test

602
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:36,839
lights may be easy because we can

603
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:38,970
trivially produce three test fields by

604
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:40,829
just generating them directly that

605
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,660
doesn't help us when we go to take the

606
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:44,519
result of our ray tracing system and

607
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,650
dump it into these light fields the

608
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:52,170
question is well how you know like how

609
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:53,430
do you decompose something and what we

610
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,019
would need to do is like some kind of

611
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,130
like principal component analysis or

612
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:01,549
something right I mean we'd have to do

613
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:01,550
like well store some kind of a

614
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:09,740
you know stores store some kind of a

615
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:12,710
system that I don't even know so I'm not

616
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:21,049
sure so it kind of seems like you know I

617
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:23,420
believe that you can because these are

618
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:26,119
linear decompositions in a sense right

619
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:31,730
I'm pretty sure you can just add them

620
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:34,119
together right just make sure that's

621
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,120
true

622
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:52,840
as usual the wikipedia page is less than

623
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,840
easy to parse

624
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,200
but my assumption is we can just add the

625
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:21,189
coefficients or roughly there abouts

626
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:23,470
right since I never work with these I

627
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:31,539
can't say that definitively

628
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:37,019
unfortunately yes I know I don't care

629
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:37,019
about that well that's a cute little

630
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,830
so I guess I'm not sure

631
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:23,819
I mean here's what I'll say I would be

632
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,350
shocked if you can't do that because it

633
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:26,639
should be a decomposition that should be

634
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:28,558
able to be added together I mean that's

635
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,000
the whole point of the coefficients just

636
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,250
in the first place as they add together

637
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,440
so I can't see how you couldn't add them

638
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,819
but I just wanted someone to actually

639
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,259
say that who studies these for a living

640
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:39,259
just so I know that I'm not crazy

641
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,670
yeah

642
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:21,289
this is kind of a nice way to visualize

643
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,690
it don't you think so hear what they've

644
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:25,549
said it's basically like okay here are

645
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:29,960
the coefficients visualized by what they

646
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:31,609
do to a cube map essentially and that

647
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,140
makes it pretty easy to visualize much

648
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:37,189
much easier than this way I think right

649
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,080
because you can sort of see directly

650
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,370
what's happening on a cube map maybe

651
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:42,139
it's a little bit easier than trying to

652
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:46,629
picture what negative light means

653
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,630
they're right but yeah

654
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,419
did you do too

655
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,690
how is it possible that it's not just

656
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:34,759
stated in one of these things right up

657
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,679
front that you can add them together am

658
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:37,819
i like wrong somehow that you couldn't

659
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:39,589
have them together cuz that would be

660
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:41,269
weird looking at the math here I mean I

661
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:44,178
can't imagine why you couldn't but I

662
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:46,069
wanted someone to say that is that wrong

663
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:48,278
is it wrong Karina want someone to say

664
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:48,278
that

665
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,480
so yeah

666
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:58,048
hmm so I guess the problem here is I

667
00:34:56,338 --> 00:35:00,630
would want to read about up on these a

668
00:34:58,048 --> 00:35:02,068
little bit more because the fact that

669
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:05,338
that's just not said right off the bat

670
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:07,019
was a little weird to me and I'd like to

671
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:09,558
be more comfort than before I would pick

672
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:11,730
that as something that we would like try

673
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:15,109
directly I can't

674
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:19,079
I mean if it's if it's a decomposition

675
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:20,338
into a series of basis functions you

676
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,859
should just be able to add them together

677
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:24,690
right because the entire point of a

678
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:26,308
decomposition like that is that you are

679
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,150
summing them together in the first place

680
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:31,798
and so you should be able to sum you

681
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,019
know two separate decompositions

682
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:35,608
together it's important that that be

683
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:37,079
true because if that weren't true

684
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:39,808
it would make them very hard for us to

685
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,150
work with in the case that we actually

686
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:46,319
need to know which is to say we need to

687
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:48,510
update a state of these things you know

688
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:52,079
kind of as for each light probe and

689
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:55,589
whatever right um so yeah it's a little

690
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:59,490
bit weird there I and I'm not sure what

691
00:35:55,588 --> 00:36:05,969
to make of that exactly the other thing

692
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:08,399
I would say is one problem we might have

693
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:13,230
if we try to do something like spherical

694
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,690
harmonics is I wonder if we would run

695
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:18,119
into the problem of not being able to do

696
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:23,519
negative interpolation like we're doing

697
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:25,440
I think we'd probably well no I probably

698
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,650
wouldn't so the prop the problem with

699
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,889
with 300 marks as well is that since

700
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:34,048
they have a positive and a negative lobe

701
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:36,088
it means that the trick of interpolating

702
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:37,829
past the zero value that we're using to

703
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:43,469
make the interpolation look good

704
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:46,920
currently might not work right because a

705
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:48,838
circle harmonics system is not one that

706
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,940
you can arbitrarily shift around like

707
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:54,210
that because it has an actual zero

708
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,970
around which it is defined and I guess

709
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:59,780
I'm just not sure like that I can

710
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:59,779
necessarily convince myself

711
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,460
that the trick of making sure you can

712
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:10,279
interpolate past the zero values would

713
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:12,409
actually work I think it might not so it

714
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,540
may be that we actually couldn't use

715
00:37:12,409 --> 00:37:17,420
those even if it if they can be added

716
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:20,469
properly so I I guess maybe I'm not sure

717
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,470
that would really be good

718
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:39,380
I guess as much as I'm not sure how

719
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,539
exactly we will accomplish it I guess

720
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,820
I'm gonna start down this path with the

721
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:45,590
experimentation I'm a little nervous

722
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,000
about the spherical harmonic side of

723
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,070
things because I just don't necessarily

724
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,400
see the interpolation working properly

725
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:54,289
there on the sparse level it seems like

726
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,840
that might just introduce artifacts

727
00:37:54,289 --> 00:38:02,000
again and maybe I'm wrong about that but

728
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:07,970
that seems like what would happen but

729
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,469
it's hard to say right let's start down

730
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:12,019
this road and we'll see how I feel about

731
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:15,379
it as we go so let's suppose we change

732
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:17,329
the sampler to be six samplers normal

733
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:21,099
plus color and we're just gonna leave it

734
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:21,098
like that for the moment right

735
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:34,130
light-filled yeah it should be like

736
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:36,950
field sampler there right what does will

737
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:44,990
keep it a slight sampler so it's pretty

738
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:46,789
confusing it's true but you know we'll

739
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:49,399
figure it out right well muddle through

740
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:51,858
it and we'll figure out what is

741
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,280
something that works well in this

742
00:38:51,858 --> 00:39:00,199
scenario so if we change over to light

743
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:07,760
sampler and we've got like an N 0 C 0

744
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:09,588
and 1 C 1 and 2 C 2 there and then what

745
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,290
we do is we change the way this stuff's

746
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:16,519
working such that you know that that

747
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:19,190
doesn't happen anymore right and I guess

748
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:22,280
what I don't really know if there's a

749
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:24,679
good way to tell the graphics card in

750
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,130
this particular case you know maybe we

751
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:31,730
want it to use its own unpacking rules

752
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:35,329
so let me just take a quick gander to

753
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:37,900
see if there's something smart to do

754
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:37,900
here so

755
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,449
assuming we're gonna specify textures

756
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:52,440
you know here's sort of what we've got

757
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:55,679
right and if you look at how these

758
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,440
things are defined we could see is we

759
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:01,169
can just choose to use like an S norm

760
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,769
value or something right and an S norm

761
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:08,490
value is something that's gonna tell us

762
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:10,338
like something that's by normal looking

763
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,659
like when we encode the normal

764
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:14,369
we're encoding a positive negative x

765
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:18,420
positive negative Y pops and negative C

766
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:20,430
so you know using one of these RGB a

767
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,440
eight for example values it's not

768
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:23,848
probably what we want so we could easily

769
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,338
switch to something like this which

770
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:28,260
would allow us to encode something that

771
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:29,548
had signs in it so we don't have to do

772
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,900
the biasing ourselves it's just the

773
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:32,789
graphs card just does it automatically

774
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,068
which would probably be a faster path

775
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:35,880
right I don't know because I don't

776
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:37,440
necessarily know where they're just

777
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,519
insert shader instructions to fix that

778
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,690
or not or whether it's actually doing

779
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,460
the texture unit that probably depends

780
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,990
on the card but assuming it could do it

781
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,710
in the texture unit it's more efficient

782
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:48,959
less ops in the pixel shader right so

783
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:52,260
looking at this it's like well yeah

784
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,329
we've got some options honestly that

785
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:57,240
looks pretty compelling unfortunately

786
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:59,130
not signed we might still want to use it

787
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,679
right but what that is is it's saying

788
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:04,769
take the 32-bit value only encode three

789
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,929
things in it but get me more bits right

790
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:09,179
get me more bits of precision and that

791
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:11,159
seems pretty good right I mean that is

792
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:13,409
sort of what we would want for encoding

793
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,029
and normal in there and we would just

794
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:17,489
have to do the bias ourselves so that's

795
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:20,660
you know maybe that's not our favorite

796
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:24,659
thing but you know it it's something

797
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:27,420
certainly so I don't know that we've got

798
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:32,670
an option in standard GL here that would

799
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:35,579
give us that but signed you know I don't

800
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:37,400
see any formats in here that really do

801
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:40,869
that

802
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,869
[Music]

803
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:47,969
I mean there's versions where everything

804
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:49,289
16-bit but I think that's overkill you

805
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:50,969
know something like this I think would

806
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:55,349
be more what we would want but there's

807
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:57,539
no s norm version so I don't really see

808
00:41:55,349 --> 00:42:00,349
any way of getting that for free just

809
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:00,349
looking at it

810
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:17,299
I I don't I don't see it so we may just

811
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:21,200
want to use a format like the r11 FG 11

812
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:23,510
FB 10 F we may just want to do that and

813
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:28,609
say like alright we know that we've got

814
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:32,060
11 bits 11 bits 10 bits so it's pretty

815
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:37,070
easy for us to encode negative values or

816
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:39,730
not R and R 11 G 11 or both pretty clear

817
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:43,160
you've got one bit for sign effectively

818
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:44,719
this one is unfortunately unbalanced so

819
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:50,480
this one has the normal bias problem

820
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:52,549
where you've got one bit one value more

821
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,750
on one side than the other so you know

822
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,789
not the end of the world though because

823
00:42:53,750 --> 00:43:00,559
that would have been true that was true

824
00:42:55,789 --> 00:43:02,420
for our 8-bit encodings as well so it's

825
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,429
you know that's not that's not a huge

826
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,900
deal either way but point being you know

827
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:08,089
we could just use something like that

828
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:11,780
which does seem pretty compelling I

829
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:14,090
guess at the end of the day right um so

830
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,580
maybe we try to do something like that

831
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:22,630
let me go ahead and and put that pound

832
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:22,630
to find in there and let's let's get

833
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:38,458
did I do that wrong

834
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:43,170
our 11f

835
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:53,850
yeah so we really just need this and we

836
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:58,379
could ask for these textures to be

837
00:43:53,849 --> 00:44:03,690
stored in that format right gosh darnit

838
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:08,490
come on area so if we were to just say

839
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:12,570
look inside our texture creation inside

840
00:44:08,489 --> 00:44:15,059
the OpenGL layer as we go we want these

841
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:17,880
samplers here to be using buffers that

842
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:19,920
are you know encoded a little bit

843
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,730
differently that shouldn't be too hard

844
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,039
so during an it when we actually specify

845
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:28,289
those textures in the first place which

846
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,539
is like right here so when we're

847
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:32,940
actually specifying these we could say

848
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:36,420
alright we actually want two separate

849
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:39,210
ones here so the lighting data in this

850
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:42,539
case actually is it's not stored

851
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:44,429
uniformly we want to do and well you

852
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:46,259
know honestly looking at it we could

853
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:49,319
choose to store them all this way right

854
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:55,770
because we also only need an RG and a B

855
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:57,660
value actually so you know we could

856
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:57,960
choose to store the colors this way as

857
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:00,299
well

858
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,670
I'm just not thrilled about that and the

859
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,340
reason I'm not thrilled about that is

860
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:07,500
because I don't super love for lighting

861
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:11,550
the idea that we wouldn't really be able

862
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:14,280
to represent gray if you have you know

863
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:18,140
more bits for orangey I'm worried that

864
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:21,450
we wouldn't be able to quite exactly

865
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:23,429
unpack those in a way that would would

866
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:25,500
allow me to do grays properly I don't

867
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,599
know or or you would it's not that you

868
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,130
couldn't do grays properly it's that you

869
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,829
need to do extra work to make sure you

870
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:37,890
didn't accidentally produce yellowish or

871
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:39,869
bluish light because of the fact that

872
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:43,829
you have more precision in your R's and

873
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:45,269
G's than you have in your B right so I

874
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:47,670
don't really love that so I guess what I

875
00:45:45,269 --> 00:45:52,110
would say is yeah you know not not sure

876
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:55,280
I want quite exactly that but point

877
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,690
being if we go and look at the

878
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,480
the information we're actually storing

879
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:05,349
with the light data here then inside the

880
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,349
OpenGL light data array there we've got

881
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:13,279
light data handle which is this what I

882
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:15,409
think I'd like to do there is say like

883
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,530
let's lift this up into light fields

884
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:22,460
here where we say okay let's say we've

885
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:25,250
got light data handle and and lightly to

886
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:27,199
handle C and what we'll say is like we

887
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:32,269
don't know how many light Direction cats

888
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:35,089
we want so we're gonna just say like

889
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:39,199
we've got a max life Direction count

890
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:40,789
here and that way we can vary it because

891
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:44,210
in the future we may decide we only need

892
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:45,920
two or maybe we need four and since we

893
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:48,970
don't really have a good handle like

894
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,470
we're very much experimenting with this

895
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:52,909
and maybe what we won't say max maybe

896
00:46:51,469 --> 00:46:54,799
we'll just say light Direction count

897
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:56,989
because honestly it's how many you use

898
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,530
that's how many you will be using period

899
00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:03,679
right so let's say we just pick a number

900
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:05,210
for that and off we go then in here

901
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,919
where we've got the light data that

902
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,650
comes down we know that we're going to

903
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,670
have two different versions of the light

904
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:15,680
data that comes down here and so we're

905
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:20,480
going to have like a light Direction

906
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:23,509
count in two cases like this and we're

907
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:27,530
gonna have a normal and a color channel

908
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:28,580
like that and so again not really sure

909
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:31,339
how you want to do this but I'm just

910
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:33,829
kind of like giving us the pipeline to

911
00:47:31,338 --> 00:47:36,320
have two different formats here so that

912
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:37,699
way we can try storing the normals with

913
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,960
something that's maybe a little bit

914
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:41,029
different than what we're using the

915
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,338
store the color values because the color

916
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:45,589
values are sort of getting packed in a

917
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:48,920
way that that makes us want to have like

918
00:47:45,588 --> 00:47:50,210
HDR so RGB exponent kind of a packing

919
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:55,849
that's the way we're sort of looking at

920
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:59,210
it right now but the the normals on the

921
00:47:55,849 --> 00:48:01,460
other hand are not that right the

922
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:03,730
normals are going to want to just be how

923
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:09,179
what's the best way we can reconstruct

924
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:12,659
three arbitrary values from negative

925
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:15,509
and off we go and just to underscore how

926
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:18,568
much different that might be you know

927
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:21,869
it's a normal right we know it's

928
00:48:18,568 --> 00:48:24,029
normalized so in addition what we might

929
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:28,260
want to do is switch to literally just

930
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:32,339
like you know something that's more like

931
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:37,559
a 16-bit value where we've got like 7 7

932
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:41,880
or 7 8 1 right because we know that we

933
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:44,640
can encode the normal as just 2 values

934
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,890
right the X and the y and we can

935
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,420
reconstruct the Z by just taking the

936
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:51,150
square root of the squares of those

937
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:54,059
values right so because we know that

938
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:56,039
it's normalized to begin with we only

939
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:58,680
need one additional piece of information

940
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:01,950
to determine whether the normal is

941
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:04,949
pointing up or down basically and that's

942
00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:10,259
the sign bit whatever the sign bit is on

943
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:11,759
the z value right so we may just encode

944
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,260
them this way and leave it that we may

945
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,359
want to go one step further and say we

946
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,250
can make this even more get even more

947
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:18,598
precision or take even less space

948
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,548
depending which one we want to go down

949
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:23,400
to 16 bits or stay at 32 but get more

950
00:49:20,548 --> 00:49:26,068
precision in our normals by just

951
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,410
encoding them differently right so again

952
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:29,788
we I think we really want the

953
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:31,259
flexibility to encode our colors

954
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:33,150
differently from our normals because

955
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,579
there's a lot of ways that we could

956
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,200
consider encoding either of them and so

957
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:39,420
we probably want two different texture

958
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:41,278
formats would be my guess I doubt we're

959
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,159
gonna want the same texture format for

960
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:48,269
both of those lookups right that's just

961
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:51,750
my guess so anyway let's go ahead and

962
00:49:48,269 --> 00:49:53,849
follow through the compile errors here

963
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,519
to guide us to all the things that we

964
00:49:53,849 --> 00:49:58,769
need to replace in order to do that so

965
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:02,579
in this case here you can see all I'm

966
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:08,869
really doing is saying hey let's take

967
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:13,470
these handles right and actually

968
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:15,298
construct them like so based on how many

969
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:17,818
there are in each one so we're doing

970
00:50:15,298 --> 00:50:20,400
both of those then what we'd like to do

971
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:22,469
is loop over them separately so in these

972
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,740
two cases like I'm actually I'd like to

973
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:27,899
make two separate ones right i I just

974
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:32,939
don't think I necessarily need to be

975
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:34,650
that sort of verbose because you know

976
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:38,849
well you know maybe cuz what if we want

977
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:40,710
to do what's not unit yeah so I'm gonna

978
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:42,210
say light Direction count goes here and

979
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:45,539
I'm just gonna go ahead and say that

980
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:48,240
it's always symmetric like that all

981
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:51,869
right so when we come in here what we do

982
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:56,399
is we're going to set up these and I

983
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:58,048
need to take this this value that we

984
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,680
were using here and put it up here where

985
00:50:58,048 --> 00:51:03,869
we're doing our our GL identifiers so

986
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,368
here's here's a bunch of formats and

987
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:08,220
here's one more format that we want

988
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:10,829
there so when I actually go to do this

989
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:14,068
we're gonna generate texture handles for

990
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:16,260
the normal texture and the color texture

991
00:51:14,068 --> 00:51:19,739
we're going to do a light Direction

992
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:22,140
count of each of them and then here

993
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:24,929
we're going to like specify them so the

994
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:27,179
first thing I do is I specify the the

995
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:30,598
light data handle for the normal let's

996
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:33,659
say and then the next thing I do is do

997
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:36,750
the same thing but for the color right

998
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:38,759
now the color probably stays the way it

999
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:41,309
is right so that's probably what color

1000
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,369
does look like because it we're gonna

1001
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:46,710
encoding on exactly the same way however

1002
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:49,140
the normal doesn't the normal we're sort

1003
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:51,510
of saying look we're gonna ingest this

1004
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:56,519
somehow and then you're gonna encode it

1005
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:58,770
like this right and what I don't know

1006
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:02,639
I'll be completely honest with you is I

1007
00:51:58,769 --> 00:52:05,219
don't really know what the hey they want

1008
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:08,778
you to say they're in terms of how this

1009
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:11,909
stuff comes down the pipeline right so

1010
00:52:08,778 --> 00:52:15,778
like if I want to specify one of these

1011
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:19,889
how do I give that information to the

1012
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:24,199
actual graphics card right and I do not

1013
00:52:19,889 --> 00:52:27,269
know so it would be nice if that were

1014
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:31,078
sort of discussed somewhere what I'm

1015
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:32,219
going to guess is that if I look at the

1016
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,320
original extent

1017
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:37,409
that talks about when this was added up

1018
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:40,320
in jail somebody will tell me how to

1019
00:52:37,409 --> 00:52:45,210
actually submit these but I don't know

1020
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:54,720
so let's find out right where these are

1021
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:56,460
supposedly going to go so it looks like

1022
00:52:54,719 --> 00:53:02,219
you just couldn't specify them anyway

1023
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:04,889
you otherwise would maybe right so right

1024
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:07,919
so I don't know maybe what we would do

1025
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:10,650
here is is specify these this float and

1026
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:15,570
let it do the packing because three

1027
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:17,099
floats versus 32 bits I don't know maybe

1028
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:18,869
we want to compress those first maybe we

1029
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:20,570
don't I'm not sure but I'm gonna go

1030
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:23,130
ahead and say at least for the moment

1031
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:24,869
we're not going to do that and so what

1032
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:28,349
I'm gonna do is say look we're gonna

1033
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:32,130
specify this as RGB floats and you will

1034
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:35,190
compress it into RGB this way and so

1035
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:37,829
those arrays now will not come down as

1036
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:40,019
any kind of weird pack nonsense instead

1037
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:41,670
they're gonna be just the original

1038
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:43,380
floating point data and you can go ahead

1039
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:47,309
and do whatever you want to do with them

1040
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:49,530
right again maybe that's stupid maybe

1041
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:51,719
it's not I don't know we're making this

1042
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:53,280
up as we go along here so I don't have

1043
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,379
any preconceived notions of what has to

1044
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,019
happen there if we do look at how we're

1045
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,220
gonna submit them though then what we

1046
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:01,108
would end up saying is well these are

1047
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:03,959
gonna be F 32s right in a sense

1048
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:06,358
not really more like VIII's right so

1049
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,059
we're gonna specify a set of VIII's the

1050
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,500
light probe position stuff again is not

1051
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:11,820
stuff we actually send down so it's

1052
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,679
really we kind of want to isolate this a

1053
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:15,838
little bit say alright this is what this

1054
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:17,279
this is the actual lighting bundle this

1055
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,429
stuff is stuff used in lighting

1056
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,500
computation right but we don't need to

1057
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:24,569
send it down to the grams card yet

1058
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,309
someday maybe we do the r-tx

1059
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:27,570
implementation of this stuff and we do

1060
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:30,659
send it down the grass garden be like

1061
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:32,250
here you go but at the moment you know

1062
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:33,659
we're not we're not doing that so what

1063
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,250
we're doing instead is we're just saying

1064
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:39,118
look we're gonna submit these ourselves

1065
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:42,750
here we're gonna submit the normals as

1066
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:44,130
normals now okay so after we generate

1067
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,929
that out I don't think there's anything

1068
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:48,030
else necessarily we need to do here

1069
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:50,549
the Clara data will stay the same it's

1070
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:53,400
the normal data that will change we're

1071
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:56,550
gonna have to go to the command buffer

1072
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,889
here and say that also needs to change

1073
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:02,460
when you look at how these things are

1074
00:54:58,889 --> 00:55:05,210
getting sent down here you know all of

1075
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:09,630
this stuff is kind of a little bit wrong

1076
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:11,490
now as well so if we look at like yeah I

1077
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:15,240
don't know yeah a lot of the stuff is

1078
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:19,039
kind of incorrect so if we look at

1079
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:19,039
what's coming down here we've got the

1080
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:29,210
well actually hold on a second

1081
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:41,050
I'm not actually sure exactly how those

1082
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:46,960
were getting pushed so let me just check

1083
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:48,760
real quick okay so basically this is now

1084
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,710
just wrong you know what I mean because

1085
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,630
we remember even calling it the wrong

1086
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:54,670
thing because it's not a light index

1087
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,470
voxel anymore but you know what you're

1088
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:59,170
gonna do so this is gonna be the

1089
00:55:56,469 --> 00:56:03,929
lightbox hole and this is light voxel

1090
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:06,579
see and this is light box land right and

1091
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:10,149
what we want to do here is just say all

1092
00:56:06,579 --> 00:56:13,900
right it's not six anymore anyway it's

1093
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:19,660
three I guess in a sense and we're just

1094
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:22,119
gonna have three pointers to the to the

1095
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:23,618
different pieces of data that's going to

1096
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:26,079
come down right that's what we were sort

1097
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:29,289
of saying before and now instead of au

1098
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:31,869
32 here that's gonna be a V 3 so that's

1099
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:33,338
what we want to actually provide and

1100
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:34,660
then the light box the difference tells

1101
00:56:33,338 --> 00:56:36,639
you how big those things are so you know

1102
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:38,799
how to pack the values into them and

1103
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:41,078
alternatively we could just expect you

1104
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:44,500
to stride it but I'm not gonna do that

1105
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:47,109
I'm gonna put them in this way right so

1106
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,940
now we go ahead and recompile and again

1107
00:56:47,108 --> 00:56:51,309
just let the compiler tell us where we

1108
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,079
need to fix this stuff so the light box

1109
00:56:51,309 --> 00:56:54,909
will dim here right this is just going

1110
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:57,160
to change to being called that and then

1111
00:56:54,909 --> 00:56:59,409
what we need to specify here is actually

1112
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:01,149
when we're packing the commands in here

1113
00:56:59,409 --> 00:57:03,429
we just need to say like oh here's where

1114
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:06,010
the oops here's where the ends are

1115
00:57:03,429 --> 00:57:10,059
here's where the C's are and now we just

1116
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:12,430
have 0 1 2 right and what I'd like to do

1117
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:14,529
there is say well can't we just make

1118
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:17,889
this be a little bit more specific

1119
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:20,050
though and make it so that this will

1120
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:22,179
grow as we need it to write because we

1121
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:23,769
may want to change that pound to fine so

1122
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:26,649
I think I'm gonna instead do this way

1123
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:29,889
where we do like you know index here and

1124
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:31,480
I just say light Direction count so that

1125
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:33,159
way if we decide we want more of these

1126
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,769
in the future we just get them and we

1127
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:39,190
don't have to rework this code at all

1128
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:41,318
so what I want to do is this right and I

1129
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:44,030
just want to say you know initialize

1130
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:48,009
these out to the light data that we

1131
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:53,030
are asking you a store here and

1132
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:56,570
hopefully that just kind of works that

1133
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:59,210
is apparently not called that it's just

1134
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:05,950
called light and might see let's make it

1135
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:08,929
called light data instead all right

1136
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:10,279
again this now needs to kind of change a

1137
00:58:08,929 --> 00:58:12,679
little bit so when we're submitting

1138
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,450
these textures we need to submit both

1139
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:18,069
versions of the textures so here we're

1140
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:21,949
actually going to be saying like light

1141
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:28,070
Direction counts yeah

1142
00:58:21,949 --> 00:58:29,809
and here we're going to be data handled

1143
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:31,760
so now I don't know what's got a light

1144
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:34,250
data handle but it's just know whatever

1145
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,770
doesn't um so anyway here we're gonna be

1146
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:39,949
binding twice now we're gonna be binding

1147
00:58:36,769 --> 00:58:43,670
to the see handle and to the N handle

1148
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:45,949
right so as we go through here now we

1149
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:48,260
need to submit these differently the C

1150
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:51,259
handle will still look exactly the way

1151
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:53,060
that it did the N handle will not that

1152
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:56,720
we'll be submitting actual

1153
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:59,719
floating-point data here and that should

1154
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:03,769
just work hopefully famous last words in

1155
00:58:59,719 --> 00:59:06,289
GPU land but what can you do right we

1156
00:59:03,769 --> 00:59:08,300
have not that many more to go you can

1157
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:10,130
see here we need to actually bind these

1158
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:12,880
things and so we're gonna have to figure

1159
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:16,340
out how exactly we want them found my

1160
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,140
sort of assumption here is we bind as

1161
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:21,260
well just bind them alternatingly

1162
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:23,869
exactly as we were before so maybe we

1163
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:28,280
just do this here and we say that it

1164
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:33,739
looks like that so we have the N and the

1165
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:36,620
C's alternating so we start it - and we

1166
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:39,859
multiply this value by two and we just

1167
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:42,049
line them up in that order right and

1168
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,550
that's if we want them interleaved if we

1169
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:45,650
didn't want them interleaved then we

1170
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:48,500
would just do two loops and be done with

1171
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:49,940
it but I think that seems fine right for

1172
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:55,800
now

1173
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:59,550
such NC NC NC okay

1174
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:02,280
moving on we need up so that's like

1175
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:07,080
blocks with him now moving on we need

1176
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:10,110
some way of actually some art summer in

1177
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:13,199
here when we're doing our lighting we

1178
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:15,960
should actually I guess we have to

1179
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,039
change it in the BM Z bias program cuz I

1180
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,260
don't think we gonna get an error on it

1181
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:21,779
but we need to actually fix it somewhere

1182
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:23,430
in the the in the in the swing of things

1183
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:29,640
we're gonna have to actually put in a

1184
01:00:23,429 --> 01:00:30,839
thing somewhere that will properly query

1185
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:31,920
those in fact I'm just gonna do that

1186
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,090
while I'm thinking of it instead of

1187
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,010
finishing what's doing there because I

1188
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:36,570
just don't want to forget and not do

1189
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,820
this because we need to do it so you can

1190
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:41,130
see we got the light samplers here NC NC

1191
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:42,900
NC and so what we need to do is make

1192
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:44,099
sure that those are lined up well you

1193
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,420
know what I didn't need to do it cuz I

1194
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,409
already did it it's gonna say we need to

1195
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:49,079
make sure those are lined up properly

1196
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:49,980
and so now they are right alright so

1197
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:52,469
that seems fine

1198
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,179
nevermind in here where we've got our

1199
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:55,949
light box we'll fill out this routine

1200
01:00:54,179 --> 01:00:58,319
needs to now change and that's because

1201
01:00:55,949 --> 01:01:00,960
looking at the light voxels now this

1202
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,240
doesn't really make any sense so what we

1203
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,480
effectively have now instead of what we

1204
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:11,159
were doing before here and also by the

1205
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:13,429
way we might as well do like something

1206
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:13,429
like this

1207
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,608
just in case we want to change that

1208
01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:24,640
addressing scheme no sense cutting and

1209
01:01:21,608 --> 01:01:31,420
pasting it all over the place like that

1210
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:34,150
so when we stream this thing out and

1211
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:36,460
we've got our light voxels off we go you

1212
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:38,230
know another thing that that honestly we

1213
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:39,880
will probably want to look into and I

1214
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:43,210
don't really know to what extent we have

1215
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:46,119
the ability to do this but really these

1216
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:47,440
are all one voxel the only reason we

1217
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,329
have multiple boxes because we're trying

1218
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:54,579
to just make sure that we can just do

1219
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:57,818
standard encoding right and the problem

1220
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:59,980
is that we don't really have any way of

1221
01:01:57,818 --> 01:02:02,500
saying to the grams card that I know of

1222
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:04,599
in OpenGL 3 I don't know if there's a

1223
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:08,789
way to say look we just have one lookup

1224
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:11,079
we want you know 32 color values right

1225
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:13,089
so I don't know if there's any way to

1226
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:14,920
really do that but you know it's worth

1227
01:02:13,088 --> 01:02:17,440
noting these voxels are not really

1228
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,838
voxels they're not only six voxels

1229
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,970
they're one voxel that has six values in

1230
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:25,150
it and I just don't know any simpler way

1231
01:02:21,969 --> 01:02:30,368
to in OpenGL 3 to say hey just do this

1232
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:32,318
right um so if we're gonna supply these

1233
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:35,318
values I guess what I would say is right

1234
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:38,048
now I think we can only specify the

1235
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:40,599
first one temporarily and we'll actually

1236
01:02:38,048 --> 01:02:44,019
sort of put stuff into these a little

1237
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:47,289
bit later on and so I'm gonna say that

1238
01:02:44,019 --> 01:02:49,778
we're gonna specify here the N and the C

1239
01:02:47,289 --> 01:02:52,299
this will be like light and 0 this will

1240
01:02:49,778 --> 01:02:54,369
be light C 0 and so a lot of this stuff

1241
01:02:52,298 --> 01:02:56,259
now is not correct right so we're gonna

1242
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:58,420
have to rewrite this code a little bit

1243
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:00,640
test light checkerboard is probably

1244
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:02,858
pretty easy we're just saying that the

1245
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:05,769
light normal in this case right it's

1246
01:03:02,858 --> 01:03:07,960
gonna be a v3 and who knows what the v3

1247
01:03:05,769 --> 01:03:10,568
should be you know maybe it's that I

1248
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:14,949
don't know I don't care but the light

1249
01:03:10,568 --> 01:03:17,739
color in this case is actually fine it's

1250
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:19,719
exactly what we were doing before and so

1251
01:03:17,739 --> 01:03:21,489
what we were stuffing into light West is

1252
01:03:19,719 --> 01:03:23,048
just what we will stuff into the color

1253
01:03:21,489 --> 01:03:26,828
value now you know what I'm saying

1254
01:03:23,048 --> 01:03:28,119
so that looks like this and good you

1255
01:03:26,829 --> 01:03:30,070
know good deal

1256
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:32,650
when we come up here and we take a look

1257
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:35,309
at what this is doing then again right

1258
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:39,670
the test light smear part of things

1259
01:03:35,309 --> 01:03:43,869
which we kind of want to change a little

1260
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:56,289
bit and I'm gonna actually make this

1261
01:03:43,869 --> 01:03:57,400
have the variables we now need so when

1262
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:59,380
we come through and do the light test

1263
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,389
sphere now we don't really need to do

1264
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,550
any more of this like crazy dancing to

1265
01:04:01,389 --> 01:04:06,730
like do the light north/south pact right

1266
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:10,990
the light and zero just is the value so

1267
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:13,210
right here where we do light and like

1268
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:18,129
that all we need to do is like a sign

1269
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:20,440
that so we just do light and zero equals

1270
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:23,200
light in and that packs it light see

1271
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:28,539
zero now just needs to be whatever the

1272
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:30,149
light westpac would have been right and

1273
01:04:28,539 --> 01:04:32,980
the rest of this stuff goes away goodbye

1274
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:34,780
right and so that's the entire repacking

1275
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:36,940
of the sphere now and when you're

1276
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:39,100
looking here you can see like alright we

1277
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:42,220
don't really care about this stuff this

1278
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:44,170
is now not necessary either and none of

1279
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:46,569
that is necessary and none of this is

1280
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:49,630
necessary it's all nonsense so really

1281
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:51,940
all we need to do here is where we pack

1282
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:53,950
in the light alpha value here where I

1283
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:58,000
was doing that it's really just this and

1284
01:04:53,949 --> 01:04:59,799
then we're done right so I think that's

1285
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,389
all we really need to do to pack these

1286
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:07,870
values to place these values into the

1287
01:05:01,389 --> 01:05:11,230
voxel properly and then oops I need to

1288
01:05:07,869 --> 01:05:13,690
clear those now and then we just need to

1289
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:16,289
clean up our compilers and debug the

1290
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:20,380
lightbox look here where we are

1291
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:23,369
assigning it again just needs the NCS I

1292
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:27,309
don't know why I skipped those this is

1293
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:28,839
gonna need to be a cleared v3 I guess

1294
01:05:27,309 --> 01:05:30,250
well you know what I specified these at

1295
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:34,780
the top now so I can actually fill them

1296
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:36,099
all out and then we can start playing

1297
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,980
with them up in the loop which is what I

1298
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:40,789
wanted to do anyway

1299
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:44,000
right it's kind of caps lock value on

1300
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:47,690
there that this messing with me all

1301
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,530
right caps lock do we still need it why

1302
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:51,380
is it there

1303
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:52,609
I used to rebind it to control but I

1304
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:55,789
like those keyboards use it just does

1305
01:05:52,608 --> 01:06:01,130
that automatically for you all right and

1306
01:05:55,789 --> 01:06:02,929
so now um I guess we don't know what

1307
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:03,349
will happen but probably we need to fix

1308
01:06:02,929 --> 01:06:06,199
some things

1309
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:09,470
oh right duh we haven't rewritten our

1310
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:12,559
shader so last thing is we got a call

1311
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:15,889
this get irradiance function with the

1312
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:18,259
correct stuff right and so when we look

1313
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:21,049
at the samplers in here and we're

1314
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:23,390
pulling with these values out we need to

1315
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:25,190
start talking about these in terms of

1316
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:27,259
not our weird cube anymore I mean to say

1317
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:29,510
like let's get rid of that that's not

1318
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:31,670
relevant and so we need to start

1319
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:32,750
sampling based on like the normal and

1320
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:35,030
all that sort of stuff

1321
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:36,170
so what we want to do here is say all

1322
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:38,269
right we're gonna have three of these

1323
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:42,789
geta radiances and what we're gonna do

1324
01:06:38,269 --> 01:06:48,759
there is say we've got a light c0 c1 c2

1325
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:53,420
and then we've got a light n 0 n 1 n 2

1326
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:55,160
right and we don't care about any of

1327
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:57,500
this crap anymore because we can

1328
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:59,210
directly encode normals now the grass

1329
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:01,068
card is like doing that work for us

1330
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:02,690
right

1331
01:07:01,068 --> 01:07:04,400
furthermore this doesn't need to look

1332
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:06,289
like that this can just look like this

1333
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,500
so we can basically just get the

1334
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:12,858
irradiance that way right all right so

1335
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:15,199
that's all good and and fine and

1336
01:07:12,858 --> 01:07:16,578
whatever when we come through here and

1337
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:18,289
we're doing our sunlight when we're

1338
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:19,490
actually doing our lookups now what

1339
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:22,159
these will look like is we've got a

1340
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:25,189
Caesar or lookup and n0 lookup right

1341
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:27,949
the n0 lookups the N lookups will all

1342
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:31,159
just be looking at the XYZ components

1343
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:33,259
because we no longer will have anything

1344
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:35,659
in the Alpha Channel it'll just be blank

1345
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:38,060
so we don't want to look at that because

1346
01:07:35,659 --> 01:07:40,098
it's encoding it like the encoding we

1347
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:42,409
chose was RGB so the Alpha Channel will

1348
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:44,088
not have something in it it's it's a non

1349
01:07:42,409 --> 01:07:46,519
channel for it we only get three

1350
01:07:44,088 --> 01:07:49,838
channels out of our texture lookup the C

1351
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:53,170
does get four just as it did

1352
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:55,449
previously so that's all fine this is

1353
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:58,150
what our total lookup looks like now and

1354
01:07:55,449 --> 01:07:59,739
then the irradiance happens as it would

1355
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:01,869
have happened before this should all be

1356
01:07:59,739 --> 01:08:03,849
basically the same the coatings are all

1357
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:05,048
the same the only difference now is

1358
01:08:03,849 --> 01:08:07,450
instead of the light Direction being

1359
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:12,219
hard-coded to a box it's actually coming

1360
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:14,199
in as its own channel right and you know

1361
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:17,739
color me a little bit surprised that

1362
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:20,528
that worked the first time out what I

1363
01:08:17,738 --> 01:08:24,568
will say is it's not correct so we still

1364
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:27,460
do have an issue here if you look at the

1365
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:33,219
way that this is responding the normals

1366
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:35,469
seem incorrect they're right and I guess

1367
01:08:33,219 --> 01:08:39,039
you know what I just realized we didn't

1368
01:08:35,469 --> 01:08:48,658
I forgot I literally said this and then

1369
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:51,880
forgot that RGB encoding doesn't supply

1370
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:55,658
normal by normal right

1371
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:57,400
that RGB encoding I literally said this

1372
01:08:55,658 --> 01:09:00,368
and then just completely forgot as I was

1373
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:02,710
making all those changes right I it

1374
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:06,789
doesn't do the positive negatives for us

1375
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:09,849
right that's the problem so it like this

1376
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:14,198
they're not signed we want them signed

1377
01:09:09,849 --> 01:09:17,048
they're not signed and so we

1378
01:09:14,198 --> 01:09:19,269
fundamentally have to figure out how

1379
01:09:17,048 --> 01:09:22,329
we're gonna reconstruct signed values

1380
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:27,069
from those values and there's a lot of

1381
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:28,420
ways that we could do that right but I

1382
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:29,889
guess what I would say is when we come

1383
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:32,170
in here to do get irradiance when we

1384
01:09:29,889 --> 01:09:34,868
have this light normal and this light

1385
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:37,179
value and you can see us like decoding

1386
01:09:34,868 --> 01:09:39,880
that stuff in here like for example you

1387
01:09:37,179 --> 01:09:40,868
can see the light color getting decoded

1388
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:43,179
this way

1389
01:09:40,868 --> 01:09:46,868
we now need the light normal to be

1390
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:50,310
encoded as well so this light n is not

1391
01:09:46,868 --> 01:09:53,588
really a light n it's like a light and

1392
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:57,190
coded right and in order to produce the

1393
01:09:53,588 --> 01:09:58,630
light n we need to actually do some real

1394
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:59,538
work unfortunately

1395
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:01,909
right

1396
01:09:59,538 --> 01:10:06,529
so in order to produce a light end from

1397
01:10:01,908 --> 01:10:08,929
a light and ink what we need to do is we

1398
01:10:06,529 --> 01:10:11,988
need to to bias we need to scale it and

1399
01:10:08,929 --> 01:10:14,389
bias it so it's zero to one right now so

1400
01:10:11,988 --> 01:10:17,779
we need to again multiply it out by two

1401
01:10:14,389 --> 01:10:22,909
then we need to subtract what is

1402
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:25,099
effectively the the midpoint now right

1403
01:10:22,908 --> 01:10:26,750
so it's going from zero to one we need

1404
01:10:25,099 --> 01:10:29,538
to like bias it out to zero to two and

1405
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:33,139
shift it down to get it to be negative

1406
01:10:29,538 --> 01:10:34,880
one to one right so we can do that and

1407
01:10:33,139 --> 01:10:36,650
now we'll get normals out that are full

1408
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,500
range but hey guess what we're not

1409
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:41,719
packing them at full range yet so we

1410
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:46,689
need to first shift them up when we

1411
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:49,969
actually plug them into the shader the

1412
01:10:46,689 --> 01:10:53,359
opengl system in the first place so when

1413
01:10:49,969 --> 01:10:56,179
we go to our lighting in code right like

1414
01:10:53,359 --> 01:11:00,889
this we need to actually do the encode

1415
01:10:56,179 --> 01:11:02,809
here right so the irradiance pack like

1416
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:05,349
we have here we now need a normal pack

1417
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:05,349
right

1418
01:11:12,619 --> 01:11:18,029
and we need this pack to just shift up

1419
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,920
and you know you don't really need to

1420
01:11:18,029 --> 01:11:23,219
call it a bite we could just put it like

1421
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:27,090
by normal can we actually already have

1422
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:29,690
something like this like by normal to

1423
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,690
something

1424
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:47,550
not really no um so we need like a buy

1425
01:11:39,369 --> 01:11:47,550
normal pack here something like that

1426
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:54,460
right and so then we can have a function

1427
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:59,520
that much like our irradiance pack there

1428
01:11:54,460 --> 01:12:04,480
where we've got something that takes in

1429
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:07,600
an N value and produces the result value

1430
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:14,649
that is the scaled and biased version of

1431
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:18,850
this thing right something like this

1432
01:12:14,649 --> 01:12:20,349
so we basically like we have we have the

1433
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:24,280
value and then shift it up so we know

1434
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:26,610
that it's between 0 &amp; 1 right and it's

1435
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:31,179
just the inverse operation of what we

1436
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:35,829
like did in the in the shader that's and

1437
01:12:31,179 --> 01:12:37,658
that's it so now hopefully our normal

1438
01:12:35,829 --> 01:12:39,250
encoding is working correctly and it

1439
01:12:37,658 --> 01:12:41,829
does look like it is now right you can

1440
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:43,988
see that as we move the light so that

1441
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:45,579
those faces are back facing to the light

1442
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:47,408
they get no light which is what we're

1443
01:12:45,579 --> 01:12:49,380
you know that's what this test seer is

1444
01:12:47,408 --> 01:12:52,299
designed to do give us exact

1445
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:55,270
reproducible things we can test it does

1446
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:57,039
seem like that to me it's working on all

1447
01:12:55,270 --> 01:13:01,239
the different kinds of faces it looks

1448
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:02,710
like so that looks pretty convincing so

1449
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:06,269
I think we're packing those down

1450
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:12,069
properly now let's do a quick test here

1451
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:15,370
if I want to spam in another value so

1452
01:13:12,069 --> 01:13:16,809
you know in here where I've got the end

1453
01:13:15,369 --> 01:13:20,260
lighting computation where we're

1454
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:24,340
spamming in test lighting values if I

1455
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:26,380
want to produce some sort of a secondary

1456
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:28,659
light source so you can see here like

1457
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:31,510
how this nonsense is working right

1458
01:13:28,658 --> 01:13:34,599
you've got the light and the light

1459
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:37,600
distance right that stuff happening for

1460
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:40,719
the first light and so if we wanted to

1461
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,730
do this for more than one light right

1462
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:46,869
like we wanted to have a couple

1463
01:13:42,729 --> 01:13:50,329
different lights that get placed in here

1464
01:13:46,869 --> 01:13:53,809
what I we need is some idea of where the

1465
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:55,489
other light actually is right and so I

1466
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:57,220
would need you know a second light

1467
01:13:55,489 --> 01:14:00,979
source I don't know where that should be

1468
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:05,630
but what you could imagine is like let's

1469
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:10,039
suppose I create a light to UVW here and

1470
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:12,409
I guess honestly like you know maybe we

1471
01:14:10,039 --> 01:14:15,439
do this with a four of the person and I

1472
01:14:12,409 --> 01:14:18,439
won't bother um so here you know we put

1473
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:21,529
the light Pete and if I wanted to have a

1474
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:23,929
second light P I could say that like b2

1475
01:14:21,529 --> 01:14:25,429
equals light P plus some fixed offset so

1476
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:27,530
let's suppose I want another light

1477
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:29,450
source that's just like always three

1478
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:31,279
meters to the other side or something

1479
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:33,170
right

1480
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:36,050
maybe that's not enough like let's talk

1481
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:37,550
about five meters I don't know so

1482
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:40,159
supposing I wanted to move the light

1483
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:43,550
source five meters away in the X

1484
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:48,159
direction we'll just try that and maybe

1485
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:51,650
we say like okay we're gonna use me

1486
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:54,470
we're gonna compute that now so I'm

1487
01:14:51,649 --> 01:14:55,909
gonna take this snippet of code which is

1488
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:57,500
just like a little like reproducible

1489
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:58,939
snippet again I'm just doing test code

1490
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,529
here ordinarily if I thought I was

1491
01:14:58,939 --> 01:15:01,729
actually gonna do this a lot I'd

1492
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:03,949
actually pull that out into a function

1493
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:05,779
probably I'm not gonna bother right now

1494
01:15:03,949 --> 01:15:07,880
just gonna leave it in here and what I'm

1495
01:15:05,779 --> 01:15:11,750
gonna do is since we now have a light to

1496
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:17,510
UV you can see that there Y is this I

1497
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:21,448
don't even know why that's not just that

1498
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:23,070
don't ask me but I'm now gonna switch to

1499
01:15:21,448 --> 01:15:24,419
using the second lady so now we have a

1500
01:15:23,069 --> 01:15:26,189
secondary light here and you can see

1501
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:28,050
that we're like computing that light

1502
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:32,848
source differently all I'm gonna do is

1503
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:35,880
I'm just gonna switch it to having that

1504
01:15:32,849 --> 01:15:37,679
second light go out on the second

1505
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,630
channel and so all I want to see here is

1506
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,190
if that will actually work at all and

1507
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:43,828
just kind of start to look massage that

1508
01:15:41,189 --> 01:15:45,899
into place right so now we should have

1509
01:15:43,828 --> 01:15:47,969
two lights and you can see that there

1510
01:15:45,899 --> 01:15:50,158
they are actually both where they should

1511
01:15:47,969 --> 01:15:52,559
be it looks like so now we've created

1512
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:54,960
kind of a blob with the other light kind

1513
01:15:52,559 --> 01:15:56,248
of separated from this light and in

1514
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,019
theory right I should be able to

1515
01:15:56,248 --> 01:16:00,779
separate them even more if I want to so

1516
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:02,219
if I came in here and I wanted to look a

1517
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:05,189
little bit more closely at that shape

1518
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:07,649
you know let's say I spread it out by 10

1519
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:10,259
now and we wait for that recompile

1520
01:16:07,649 --> 01:16:12,569
reload we should see that jump to the

1521
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:15,989
side yeah and maybe like a little bit

1522
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:17,368
more like that so I can see the

1523
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,919
interference pattern between the two

1524
01:16:17,368 --> 01:16:21,899
lights where they start and stop and

1525
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,840
that stuff right so you can see that

1526
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:26,939
looks pretty reasonable there right now

1527
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:29,069
let's get them overlap a little more I'm

1528
01:16:26,939 --> 01:16:31,828
gonna change the color values here so

1529
01:16:29,069 --> 01:16:34,319
we've got two different colors values

1530
01:16:31,828 --> 01:16:36,569
maybe I will drop the blue so we got a

1531
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:39,448
yellow light and drop the red so we have

1532
01:16:36,569 --> 01:16:41,609
a cyan light as well so we can just kind

1533
01:16:39,448 --> 01:16:43,018
of see the colored regions of these two

1534
01:16:41,609 --> 01:16:44,880
which should you know hopefully

1535
01:16:43,019 --> 01:16:48,119
interpolate properly as well so there's

1536
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,038
our two right separate color lights that

1537
01:16:48,118 --> 01:16:51,089
were reconstructing there and then what

1538
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:54,710
I'm gonna do is like smoosh those

1539
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:57,269
together so now the light separation

1540
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:59,099
let's make that more like eight so

1541
01:16:57,269 --> 01:17:01,199
they'll be an overlap region and it

1542
01:16:59,099 --> 01:17:03,269
should be like white ish in the overlap

1543
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:04,738
region because you've got two light

1544
01:17:03,269 --> 01:17:08,610
sources that are combining they're in

1545
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:11,669
theory and you know it sort of is right

1546
01:17:08,609 --> 01:17:13,109
it's more white anyway right and of

1547
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:15,239
course since these two lights are

1548
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:17,158
actually in different places what should

1549
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:19,768
happen is I rotate around twos I should

1550
01:17:17,158 --> 01:17:21,748
see some play of the light and I do

1551
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:24,479
which is good right because there is a

1552
01:17:21,748 --> 01:17:27,238
little bit of specular on these services

1553
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:29,460
now I could really crank that up to like

1554
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:30,329
if we wanted to we could we could take a

1555
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,680
look at what happens with

1556
01:17:30,329 --> 01:17:32,789
specular a little bit more but you can

1557
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,140
see like you see how they're getting

1558
01:17:32,789 --> 01:17:36,899
that specular on there a little bit

1559
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:37,710
right you see it and that's kind of a

1560
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:39,269
nice effect too

1561
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:41,039
again not something we're really going

1562
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:43,650
to lean into in this particular game but

1563
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:45,869
you know it's nice to have a little bit

1564
01:17:43,649 --> 01:17:47,819
of specular option in there for just

1565
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:49,019
getting a little bit of that it just it

1566
01:17:47,819 --> 01:17:51,539
just adds a little character to the

1567
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:52,980
lighting you know it's great if you want

1568
01:17:51,539 --> 01:17:54,449
to go full bore and have actual like

1569
01:17:52,979 --> 01:17:56,729
reflective services and stuff like that

1570
01:17:54,449 --> 01:17:58,619
yeah that's awesome too we're not really

1571
01:17:56,729 --> 01:18:00,659
looking for that here we're not looking

1572
01:17:58,619 --> 01:18:02,609
to solve that particular problem but in

1573
01:18:00,659 --> 01:18:04,979
this case we do get a little bit of a

1574
01:18:02,609 --> 01:18:06,929
character in there and adding a little

1575
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:11,699
bit of specular character to light can

1576
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:14,190
can be useful all right so I think this

1577
01:18:11,699 --> 01:18:17,369
is looking great and to me that just

1578
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:19,769
says yeah like I think this has a lot of

1579
01:18:17,369 --> 01:18:24,180
potential so now the question is how do

1580
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:27,570
we get from light probes to this in in a

1581
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:29,100
reasonable way right and I do think you

1582
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:31,469
know I mean one thing is we probably

1583
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:32,940
have too many light probes I mean just

1584
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:34,350
looking at how many there are it's like

1585
01:18:32,939 --> 01:18:37,529
do we really need that many of light

1586
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:39,060
probes and the answer is probably no but

1587
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:40,590
we're gonna stick with that many for now

1588
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:42,030
and then we'll just like start to

1589
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:46,560
decrease the number of light probes that

1590
01:18:42,029 --> 01:18:47,579
we have as necessary right and we'll

1591
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,710
start to work with that a little bit

1592
01:18:47,579 --> 01:18:52,979
different but I guess what I would say

1593
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:55,439
is you know as a light sampling scheme I

1594
01:18:52,979 --> 01:18:57,209
think this is pretty good if you get

1595
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:58,710
more than three lights and you know

1596
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:00,689
again we could also just crank that up

1597
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:03,260
to four lights and I don't think we

1598
01:19:00,689 --> 01:19:06,059
would see a lot of problems right if I

1599
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:07,619
we don't we have to actually like have a

1600
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,880
way to turn off lighting on the profiler

1601
01:19:07,619 --> 01:19:10,279
which we haven't done yet like our

1602
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,670
profiler is still being lit

1603
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:16,729
unfortunately not exactly what we want

1604
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:20,190
to be sure but you know that's that's

1605
01:19:16,729 --> 01:19:21,479
that's just you know how graphics go

1606
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:22,769
sometimes right everything is going

1607
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:24,089
through the same pipeline at the moment

1608
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:25,680
and we just don't have a flag for that

1609
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:28,020
so we're gonna have to do that at some

1610
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:29,300
point not my fault that's just how

1611
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:32,280
things go right

1612
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:35,489
but anyway looking in general at the

1613
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:39,869
speed though if I was to firebend site

1614
01:19:35,489 --> 01:19:42,029
here and just ask it to tell me how bad

1615
01:19:39,869 --> 01:19:45,539
is this situation

1616
01:19:42,029 --> 01:19:49,739
in terms of speed there right so if I

1617
01:19:45,539 --> 01:19:51,239
grab our you know our project and ask it

1618
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:53,250
to launch the frame profile you know

1619
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:57,000
like what you know and video what do you

1620
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:58,920
see right and you know looking at this

1621
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,409
graphics card it's just it's eating that

1622
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,329
for breakfast like that three voxel

1623
01:20:01,409 --> 01:20:05,250
samples it's just like laughing at and

1624
01:20:03,329 --> 01:20:08,250
telling me that doesn't care at all or

1625
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:11,340
three six you know three pairs of box of

1626
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:13,590
samples so you know it means we could

1627
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:16,800
really decompose this into a large

1628
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:18,600
number of these things I think and not

1629
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:22,010
really have to worry that much about it

1630
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:26,100
so we could probably even go to four

1631
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:30,720
light channels and not really break a

1632
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:32,310
sweat right because one hundred and

1633
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,079
sixty frames per second is way more than

1634
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:36,030
the number of frames per second then I

1635
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:38,279
felt like I needed that that's way over

1636
01:20:36,029 --> 01:20:40,619
the spec that I've demanded this game be

1637
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:42,929
at and so I'm okay with that

1638
01:20:40,619 --> 01:20:45,569
right so if we wanted to crank that up

1639
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:49,500
and just say let's have a lot of these

1640
01:20:45,569 --> 01:20:53,789
right you know maybe I I just say like

1641
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:55,350
let's have four lights total we can

1642
01:20:53,789 --> 01:20:58,890
blend between and that's just a crazy

1643
01:20:55,350 --> 01:21:01,440
because remember this is like every

1644
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:04,920
voxel can capture for incoming light

1645
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:07,649
directions which is probably like way

1646
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,510
overkill I just want to see if we can do

1647
01:21:07,649 --> 01:21:11,849
it right I just want to see if that has

1648
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:13,560
really any problems for us whatsoever so

1649
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:17,460
let's say we've got a bunch of these

1650
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:19,950
here and I just want to do like this

1651
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:21,420
right so we've got like some stuff and

1652
01:21:19,949 --> 01:21:28,079
it's happening and whatever

1653
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:29,819
and if I create three four so three

1654
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:33,090
dependent light sources off of the one

1655
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:35,659
light source there I stuff them in here

1656
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:38,250
and I give them some other you know

1657
01:21:35,659 --> 01:21:40,880
color characteristics so you know maybe

1658
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:45,770
we've we've actually got like you know a

1659
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,770
red dennah green and a blue light there

1660
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:51,449
that are separating then you know here

1661
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:51,928
I've got some other light maybe maybe

1662
01:21:51,449 --> 01:21:55,859
like

1663
01:21:51,929 --> 01:21:57,059
a dimmer sort of white light or

1664
01:21:55,859 --> 01:21:59,279
something or maybe that's just a pure

1665
01:21:57,059 --> 01:22:00,929
white light I don't know I don't care so

1666
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:02,819
we've got some lights in there red green

1667
01:22:00,929 --> 01:22:05,550
and blue and now I just want to stuff

1668
01:22:02,819 --> 01:22:06,748
those lights into the system so when we

1669
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:09,269
come through here we're just gonna do

1670
01:22:06,748 --> 01:22:12,238
like alright here's our our four light

1671
01:22:09,269 --> 01:22:13,860
directions that's how many you get so

1672
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:16,138
you know hopefully you can encode

1673
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:18,420
whatever complex light feel if you want

1674
01:22:16,139 --> 01:22:21,239
with somehow decomposing it into four

1675
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:23,130
light directions which is you know or or

1676
01:22:21,238 --> 01:22:24,808
someday we switch again to some other

1677
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:27,090
encoding spherical harmonics I don't

1678
01:22:24,809 --> 01:22:30,110
know what but you know whatever we think

1679
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:36,029
of whatever we end up thinking is right

1680
01:22:30,109 --> 01:22:41,328
we encode right so we've got the the

1681
01:22:36,029 --> 01:22:41,328
light directions here we switched the

1682
01:22:42,979 --> 01:22:51,840
oops light direction count here - four

1683
01:22:48,599 --> 01:22:53,610
we recompile and cross our fingers I

1684
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,939
don't know if there's anywhere else that

1685
01:22:53,609 --> 01:22:58,518
it matters to be honest might not and

1686
01:22:56,939 --> 01:23:00,090
then we see if we can make that happen

1687
01:22:58,519 --> 01:23:03,119
in a useful way

1688
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:06,809
all right so here's our lights if we

1689
01:23:03,118 --> 01:23:08,639
zoom out I I guess I don't see my third

1690
01:23:06,809 --> 01:23:12,029
light which makes me a little concerned

1691
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:13,439
right so I've got the three lights but I

1692
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:16,158
don't see the fourth even though the

1693
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:19,039
light Direction count is ostensibly for

1694
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:29,429
looking at our four UVW sir did I forget

1695
01:23:19,038 --> 01:23:36,840
three - I didn't zero one two three zero

1696
01:23:29,429 --> 01:23:38,880
one two three sure seems oh yeah hey man

1697
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,639
you've got to actually load it in the

1698
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:43,889
shader that's the one thing that's not

1699
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:45,929
based on eraser I haven't been using

1700
01:23:43,889 --> 01:23:48,328
arrays and the shaders you actually can

1701
01:23:45,929 --> 01:23:50,639
I'm nervous about it because I don't

1702
01:23:48,328 --> 01:23:54,899
know what kind of OpenGL 3 compatibility

1703
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:56,939
there are two arrays of samplers so it's

1704
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:58,198
really just a fear it's really it's a

1705
01:23:56,939 --> 01:23:59,400
fear based things reason about doing it

1706
01:23:58,198 --> 01:24:03,710
you you absolutely could have done that

1707
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:07,619
and so it's just kind of

1708
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:10,140
no real reason so I apologize for that

1709
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:12,809
I'm just I'm just not willing to go down

1710
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:15,360
that speed lankan path at the immediate

1711
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:17,700
moment but you know that that there's no

1712
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:19,289
reason we couldn't have made that be

1713
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:21,809
something in the shader that was just

1714
01:24:19,289 --> 01:24:23,369
parametrized as well we just are a

1715
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:33,270
little worried about it all right um

1716
01:24:23,369 --> 01:24:35,670
oops forgot one more thing uh so in

1717
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:40,100
theory now we should have bound all of

1718
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:44,220
our textures up and yeah and hopefully

1719
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:47,270
we'll get our four lights now it looks

1720
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:50,520
good right so there's our four lights

1721
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:53,550
they seem pretty good they look like

1722
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:56,600
they're in the right places not seeing

1723
01:24:53,550 --> 01:25:01,110
anything particularly odd going on there

1724
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:02,460
looks good right and so I think that

1725
01:25:01,109 --> 01:25:03,479
should be fine if you look at what's

1726
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:05,100
happening the lights right now you can

1727
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:06,750
see they're already fairly complicated

1728
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,850
like you're getting fairly complicated

1729
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:10,979
effects from them you can see that nice

1730
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:12,420
specular character you see how the red

1731
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:13,949
light kind of plays off a little bit

1732
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:16,949
there right and you get a little bit of

1733
01:25:13,949 --> 01:25:20,279
shifting of the highlight so I think

1734
01:25:16,949 --> 01:25:22,319
we're in good shape and I guess that's

1735
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:28,319
good enough for me right I'm willing to

1736
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:30,269
say great ship it now we just need a way

1737
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:32,880
of putting light information into here

1738
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:34,350
that's gonna be good we've got a few

1739
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,140
minutes left so maybe let's start down

1740
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:38,670
that road we can now go ahead and

1741
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:42,660
actually say let's let's output the

1742
01:25:38,670 --> 01:25:44,520
probes right and the probe output is

1743
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:46,889
totally borked right now because we now

1744
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,990
need some we need some way and this this

1745
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:52,289
again again this is gonna be the hard

1746
01:25:48,989 --> 01:25:55,079
part now we need some way of taking our

1747
01:25:52,289 --> 01:25:57,840
probes and dumping probes down into the

1748
01:25:55,079 --> 01:26:01,699
voxel in some way that makes you know

1749
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:03,989
any sense whatsoever right

1750
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:05,789
and there's a lot of ways we could do

1751
01:26:03,989 --> 01:26:08,429
this but I think probably fundamentally

1752
01:26:05,789 --> 01:26:12,750
speaking this is maybe not a very good

1753
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:14,970
way to do it because since we're trying

1754
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:18,180
to do reconstructing of light fields

1755
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:20,280
here I don't really think like we may

1756
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:23,130
more want to loop over the probes

1757
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:25,529
themselves and sum them into the voxel

1758
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:30,119
as opposed to doing it this way which is

1759
01:26:25,529 --> 01:26:31,979
using the light closest voxel the

1760
01:26:30,119 --> 01:26:37,079
closest probe to the voxel to fill that

1761
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:39,329
voxel so I don't really know that this

1762
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:43,069
makes a lot of sense like the way that

1763
01:26:39,329 --> 01:26:43,069
this is this particular thing is working

1764
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:51,869
doesn't strike me as particularly

1765
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:53,820
intelligent really anyway so I don't

1766
01:26:51,869 --> 01:26:55,409
know that we really want that right and

1767
01:26:53,819 --> 01:27:03,359
so we're probably gonna want to make

1768
01:26:55,409 --> 01:27:05,279
this be a little bit more what we're

1769
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:06,899
gonna want to do here is say alright the

1770
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:08,899
light probes are just things that store

1771
01:27:06,899 --> 01:27:11,670
loading information over time and

1772
01:27:08,899 --> 01:27:13,969
they're the locations at which we try to

1773
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:16,109
compute what the light field is right

1774
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:17,909
but what we're fundamentally doing now

1775
01:27:16,109 --> 01:27:20,219
is now that we sort of know well we can

1776
01:27:17,909 --> 01:27:21,720
use these fairly cheap try linear voxel

1777
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:24,180
lookups to actually capture letting

1778
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:25,710
information pretty well it seems what

1779
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:28,710
we're trying to do now is say how do we

1780
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:32,149
separate how do we actually track and

1781
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:34,529
separate light into four components

1782
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:38,909
whose directions can vary arbitrarily

1783
01:27:34,529 --> 01:27:40,829
right and again this may be stupid it

1784
01:27:38,909 --> 01:27:43,590
may be that we should just use spherical

1785
01:27:40,829 --> 01:27:45,869
harmonics or something right but the

1786
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:47,850
reason I'm just not sure about them is I

1787
01:27:45,869 --> 01:27:49,470
just don't know how their behavior as a

1788
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:52,410
signed distance field would actually

1789
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:54,180
work out I suspect it if if I were

1790
01:27:52,409 --> 01:27:57,119
actually doing this on my own time and

1791
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:57,630
could spend you know an 80 hours this

1792
01:27:57,119 --> 01:27:59,099
week

1793
01:27:57,630 --> 01:28:01,199
just like diving into this and trying

1794
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:03,600
all kinds of crazy stuff what I would

1795
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:06,090
first probably try to do is figure out

1796
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,010
if there's a version of a circle

1797
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:10,890
Harmonix encoding that can work with a

1798
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:13,469
signed distance field because that's the

1799
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:15,940
probably what you want right

1800
01:28:13,469 --> 01:28:18,430
in this particular case I don't actually

1801
01:28:15,939 --> 01:28:19,960
know exactly how I'm going to do

1802
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:21,400
something here where we have to actually

1803
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,230
track directions and that's why I think

1804
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:26,409
that maybe the other way to do it would

1805
01:28:23,229 --> 01:28:29,559
be interesting but in the absence of

1806
01:28:26,409 --> 01:28:32,319
that we're gonna have to make something

1807
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:35,920
up because we don't have 80 hours to

1808
01:28:32,319 --> 01:28:37,479
spend 80 hours to put that in

1809
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,420
perspective we'd be probably like

1810
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:42,189
another 20% of the entire time of

1811
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:44,829
handmade hero so far or something like

1812
01:28:42,189 --> 01:28:47,169
that right handmade hero despite having

1813
01:28:44,829 --> 01:28:49,719
a day number that's really more like an

1814
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:51,880
hour number or half an hour number so

1815
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:53,619
like you're talking about a thousand

1816
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:56,949
hours we probably spent on handmade hero

1817
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:58,659
is all that's total time so the amount

1818
01:28:56,948 --> 01:29:01,269
of work I would do in two weeks of

1819
01:28:58,659 --> 01:29:04,059
exploration if something could be you

1820
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:06,340
know a tenth of the entire time we spent

1821
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:08,770
on handmade hero so far just to put in

1822
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:10,840
perspective how limited a resource we

1823
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:13,260
actually have time time actually is on

1824
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:16,989
here we just don't get much time right

1825
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:21,969
and so you know that's just a limitation

1826
01:29:16,988 --> 01:29:25,119
of the streaming format it doesn't

1827
01:29:21,969 --> 01:29:26,500
really work that way so what I want to

1828
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:28,630
do here is start to figure out like well

1829
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:31,448
how what are we gonna do how are we

1830
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:33,460
gonna make this stuff makes sense like

1831
01:29:31,448 --> 01:29:35,439
what's gonna happen and so if you think

1832
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:43,140
about what's going on we effectively

1833
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:43,139
have a we effectively have sort of a

1834
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:56,889
we are going to be tracking lights that

1835
01:29:51,369 --> 01:29:59,769
we see in the world using ray casting

1836
01:29:56,890 --> 01:30:01,990
right and so all we're gonna know when

1837
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:04,780
we get back a ray cast is we're just

1838
01:30:01,989 --> 01:30:08,229
gonna set have a thing that says well we

1839
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:10,960
kind of know that in this direction we

1840
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:12,219
saw a light that was this bright like we

1841
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:16,050
saw lighting coming in that was this

1842
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:19,659
much lighting and so if you sort of

1843
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:23,640
imagine how we're gonna track that

1844
01:30:19,659 --> 01:30:26,229
information the question becomes well

1845
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:28,720
what is the thing that allows us to just

1846
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:30,759
over time some lights together but that

1847
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:34,030
we can then reconstruct a lighting field

1848
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:36,070
from it in some way and I really just

1849
01:30:34,029 --> 01:30:38,710
don't know right look I don't have an

1850
01:30:36,069 --> 01:30:40,179
idea of how to do that one way might be

1851
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:41,470
and maybe this is something we should

1852
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:45,850
start with because hey it would give us

1853
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:47,770
a way of transitioning later but one way

1854
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:49,630
might be to say well on the CPU side

1855
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:54,610
maybe our light probes just store

1856
01:30:49,630 --> 01:30:55,480
spherical harmonics exactly since we

1857
01:30:54,609 --> 01:30:59,170
they don't have to be interpolated

1858
01:30:55,479 --> 01:31:01,839
really right and then what we do is we

1859
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:03,940
just extract the top and lights from the

1860
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:06,789
circle harmonics and put those down as

1861
01:31:03,939 --> 01:31:08,469
the light field right and then if later

1862
01:31:06,789 --> 01:31:10,420
we decided we actually want to just

1863
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:12,699
interpolate spherical harmonics directly

1864
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:14,289
in the actual shader from the samples

1865
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:15,849
instead because we figure out we can

1866
01:31:14,289 --> 01:31:17,800
actually do that with off your artifact

1867
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:22,270
which I'm not sure we can but let's say

1868
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:23,199
we could then we're in good shape to do

1869
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:24,940
that because what we're actually

1870
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:26,829
tracking is spherical harmonics so it's

1871
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:34,059
not so hard anymore to like make that

1872
01:31:26,829 --> 01:31:36,039
work right I don't know right I wish I

1873
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:37,240
had the answer I'm not sure we're more

1874
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:39,279
or less at a time so I probably won't

1875
01:31:37,239 --> 01:31:41,739
really do anything here because I'm not

1876
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:44,259
even sure what I would necessarily do so

1877
01:31:41,739 --> 01:31:45,909
I guess I'll leave this on sphere and

1878
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:49,060
we'll go to the QA and then we're gonna

1879
01:31:45,909 --> 01:31:51,010
think like next weekend that'll be kind

1880
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:53,530
of what we need to figure out right like

1881
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:54,970
what what are we actually doing right

1882
01:31:53,529 --> 01:31:58,029
like what what will be the strategy

1883
01:31:54,970 --> 01:32:01,949
there now that we know it's pretty easy

1884
01:31:58,029 --> 01:32:01,949
to reconstruct light fields from voxel

1885
01:32:02,649 --> 01:32:14,509
you know it it's it's pretty interesting

1886
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:16,640
right and I mean it's worth kind of

1887
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:18,590
noting that like at this point - another

1888
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,590
thing is is you know let's say you had

1889
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:23,810
lots and lots of light sources in there

1890
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:25,940
and you just wanted them radial you

1891
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:27,260
could actually simulate lots of like you

1892
01:32:25,939 --> 01:32:28,669
know you could simulate a hundred radio

1893
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:32,470
light sources with just this lookup

1894
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:34,579
scheme without changing the number of

1895
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:38,740
voxels because you just use the four

1896
01:32:34,579 --> 01:32:44,960
brightest ones at any given point right

1897
01:32:38,739 --> 01:32:48,439
so yeah I'm pretty I'm chuffed to bits

1898
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:50,649
as they say I just now need to think

1899
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:52,909
about how I want to like dump the

1900
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:54,619
information down to the sampler and you

1901
01:32:52,909 --> 01:32:57,050
know maybe make some changes the sampler

1902
01:32:54,619 --> 01:33:00,099
as we go based on what the right values

1903
01:32:57,050 --> 01:33:00,100
to interpolate actually are

1904
01:33:06,899 --> 01:33:11,618
another interesting possibility here as

1905
01:33:09,368 --> 01:33:14,498
I'm thinking it through as well is you

1906
01:33:11,618 --> 01:33:16,238
know the way that this is being coding

1907
01:33:14,498 --> 01:33:18,788
you could also think of the color

1908
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:22,598
channel as being a separate thing like

1909
01:33:18,788 --> 01:33:24,149
we could have we could track colors

1910
01:33:22,599 --> 01:33:28,900
differently from the way that we track

1911
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:30,759
intensities because the eye is more

1912
01:33:28,899 --> 01:33:33,399
sensitive to intensities than color and

1913
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:35,019
so if the color was more of a wash but

1914
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:36,698
the intensities is the thing that's

1915
01:33:35,019 --> 01:33:39,010
actually getting interpolated by science

1916
01:33:36,698 --> 01:33:45,308
films that may make it easier for us

1917
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:46,840
because then we could sort of we could

1918
01:33:45,309 --> 01:33:48,610
play it a little faster and looser when

1919
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,828
we're actually at summation time so be

1920
01:33:48,609 --> 01:33:52,899
it'll be interesting to see but I'm

1921
01:33:50,828 --> 01:33:55,408
pretty pleased all right let's go ahead

1922
01:33:52,899 --> 01:33:55,408
and go to QA

1923
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:18,000
have you taken anything you implanted

1924
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:26,250
and handmade here and used it in your

1925
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:30,869
other work um no not yet but I probably

1926
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:33,060
will take the PNG stuff we did and move

1927
01:34:30,869 --> 01:34:35,010
that over to my own little PNG like I'll

1928
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:39,179
probably optimize it and make a little

1929
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:44,190
PNG file that I use because right now

1930
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:46,260
like I mostly only do Photoshop IO and

1931
01:34:44,189 --> 01:34:49,079
it would be nice to have a PNG IO as

1932
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:52,530
well so PNG IO

1933
01:34:49,079 --> 01:34:53,850
might be might be something my steal

1934
01:34:52,529 --> 01:34:56,609
because I'd never implemented one of

1935
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:58,079
those and we have Lim downstream and

1936
01:34:56,609 --> 01:34:59,698
that went really well and now that I

1937
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:24,329
have a reference code for I could make a

1938
01:34:59,698 --> 01:35:27,269
nice fast one and what are you working

1939
01:35:24,329 --> 01:35:29,429
on during the week well I am the

1940
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:36,540
programmer the only programmer at Mali

1941
01:35:29,429 --> 01:35:40,230
Rockets so you know we have several

1942
01:35:36,539 --> 01:35:42,210
projects this one is one of them there's

1943
01:35:40,229 --> 01:35:44,519
one that's unannounced and then of

1944
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:48,829
course we also do this one although I my

1945
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:50,850
involvement this one is limited so

1946
01:35:48,829 --> 01:35:54,090
that's what I work on during the week

1947
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:59,489
but you can also go here for sort of our

1948
01:35:54,090 --> 01:36:03,739
general news and just information about

1949
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:03,738
our projects this tends to be up on here

1950
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:09,819
also the thing you can do is if you

1951
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:14,020
click this button kind of a little

1952
01:36:09,819 --> 01:36:16,029
hidden feature if you click the head at

1953
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:17,710
the top of any Mali rocket page you can

1954
01:36:16,029 --> 01:36:19,988
get all the other Mali rocket pages

1955
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:23,109
right so it's pretty easy to like link

1956
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:24,789
them together and like jump around so

1957
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:26,738
like I had been here all right you can

1958
01:36:24,789 --> 01:36:28,649
get to me out of the infinite if you got

1959
01:36:26,738 --> 01:36:30,569
mount the infinite you can get to 1935

1960
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:37,019
right

1961
01:36:30,569 --> 01:36:37,019
you need to Anna draws it get to my blog

1962
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:40,889
that's pretty easy

1963
01:36:42,069 --> 01:36:46,849
how will wall stop light same bouncing

1964
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:50,509
rays as before yeah pretty much

1965
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:53,270
so the main thing that we have to do now

1966
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:54,470
and and it's the part that I'm not like

1967
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:56,390
I said I'm not sure how we're gonna do

1968
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:57,350
it exactly so I like the sampling it's

1969
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:59,090
interesting but we may need to play

1970
01:36:57,350 --> 01:37:01,010
around a little bit the main thing we

1971
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:05,060
need to now is so now we re enable the

1972
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:06,800
ray caster right which we wrote and that

1973
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:09,590
will tell us how the light moves around

1974
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:13,010
the scene but the problem is we have to

1975
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:17,590
figure out how to translate a ray

1976
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:20,390
tracing input into a try linearly

1977
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:24,050
reconstruct Abal set of light fields

1978
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:30,640
right and that is the thing that I don't

1979
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:30,640
know like exactly how we will do right

1980
01:37:33,908 --> 01:37:42,329
I may do something really nutso first

1981
01:37:39,429 --> 01:37:42,329
right

1982
01:37:54,149 --> 01:37:59,759
I assume there's a source of income not

1983
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:01,619
working on projects for pay well we have

1984
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,230
some limited sources of income but we

1985
01:38:01,619 --> 01:38:09,300
are we're also funded through basically

1986
01:38:04,229 --> 01:38:11,219
1935 s completion but we have to pay

1987
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,390
that back right so we may you know we

1988
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:14,520
may just disappear and be out of

1989
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:20,039
business after that if our games don't

1990
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:21,390
make some money back so who knows but we

1991
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:22,409
do have some limited sources of income

1992
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:25,170
as well like you know for example

1993
01:38:22,409 --> 01:38:30,149
handmade hero purchases is income it's

1994
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:32,220
not much but it's something and and so

1995
01:38:30,149 --> 01:38:34,379
on but yeah until our actual games start

1996
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:37,650
coming out and our purchasable it's hard

1997
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:41,119
to know what will be successful and

1998
01:38:37,649 --> 01:38:43,199
still exist similarly now the infinite I

1999
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:45,090
think it's actually a really good comic

2000
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:46,949
to be completely honest I know I'm

2001
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:50,130
biased because obviously like I wouldn't

2002
01:38:46,949 --> 01:38:53,159
have greenlit it if I didn't think it

2003
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:54,630
was cool but I think as it gets a little

2004
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:57,539
more established to it and you can buy

2005
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:59,520
an actual bound book of it I think it'll

2006
01:38:57,539 --> 01:39:01,199
be pretty popular too it's already

2007
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,120
pretty popular with kids actually and

2008
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:05,279
it's kind of an all-ages thing I don't

2009
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:07,710
know I think it's pretty good and I

2010
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:09,840
think I think as it gets further along

2011
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:14,850
it kind of becomes more clear that's

2012
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:16,710
it's actually pretty interesting that's

2013
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:18,780
what I would say so I think that'll also

2014
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:20,100
make some money too but anything that's

2015
01:39:18,779 --> 01:39:21,960
like comic like that that tells kind of

2016
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:26,220
a story kind of has to get to the point

2017
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:27,750
where it's actually more complete and

2018
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:30,750
furthermore people don't really like

2019
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:31,800
reading comics online you know they only

2020
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:33,560
kind of comics they like to read online

2021
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:36,390
like Dilbert kind of things or you know

2022
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:37,830
like the oatmeal or xkcd where they're

2023
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:40,860
kind of like they're not really like a

2024
01:39:37,829 --> 01:39:42,659
story they're like social commentary or

2025
01:39:40,859 --> 01:39:46,529
something where you just read one page

2026
01:39:42,659 --> 01:39:47,639
and that's it so we don't really know

2027
01:39:46,529 --> 01:39:49,109
how successful that project will be

2028
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:50,490
either because we'll have to see what

2029
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:51,899
happens when we actually take it to some

2030
01:39:50,489 --> 01:39:55,019
cons and have a printed volume be like

2031
01:39:51,899 --> 01:39:57,269
here's book 1 you know let's see whether

2032
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:58,830
people like it right so I think that

2033
01:39:57,270 --> 01:40:02,580
might make some money as well so we do

2034
01:39:58,829 --> 01:40:03,840
have some limited income now but we'll

2035
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:06,119
really only know what our income

2036
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:08,610
situation is after 1935 and

2037
01:40:06,119 --> 01:40:11,250
our unannounced project are available

2038
01:40:08,609 --> 01:40:13,880
and selling and whether anyone buys them

2039
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,880
right I hope they do

2040
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:25,050
any to Utrecht you'd you realize you

2041
01:40:23,939 --> 01:40:26,519
could be a very wealthy man if you

2042
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:30,720
accept a small project for a few weeks

2043
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:36,410
right I not really at least not that I

2044
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:38,750
know of I have had you know pretty good

2045
01:40:36,409 --> 01:40:44,579
consulting rates in the past certainly

2046
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:46,619
but you know one of the problems with

2047
01:40:44,579 --> 01:40:48,720
running a company in the u.s. especially

2048
01:40:46,619 --> 01:40:53,970
in a place like Seattle or haven't

2049
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:56,159
helped you like I I shed emotional tears

2050
01:40:53,970 --> 01:40:58,230
for John blow like every day inside a

2051
01:40:56,159 --> 01:41:02,569
little bit running a company in San

2052
01:40:58,229 --> 01:41:05,488
Francisco right it's just like oh my god

2053
01:41:02,569 --> 01:41:09,090
the cost of living in the cost of

2054
01:41:05,488 --> 01:41:13,199
employee is here or contractor work is

2055
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:15,480
like astronomical you know and so the

2056
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:17,220
problem is that you're talking about

2057
01:41:15,479 --> 01:41:18,719
making a game you know you're looking at

2058
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:22,560
like a million dollars or something of

2059
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:24,500
cost to make a game if you want it to be

2060
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,940
like a serious game like that's good and

2061
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:28,979
it has good art on it and stuff like

2062
01:41:26,939 --> 01:41:30,779
that

2063
01:41:28,979 --> 01:41:33,179
if you're in these areas it's very

2064
01:41:30,779 --> 01:41:36,479
expensive right and it's it's not it's

2065
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:38,159
it's it varies by region dramatically

2066
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:41,399
right like the cost to make a game in

2067
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:42,930
San Francisco we're talking about people

2068
01:41:41,399 --> 01:41:43,979
working you know actual employees

2069
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,690
working essentially the cost to make you

2070
01:41:43,979 --> 01:41:47,429
came to San Francisco versus the cosmic

2071
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:50,210
game in Croatia versus the cost to make

2072
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:53,489
a game in Argentina or whatever right

2073
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:55,619
it's very different and it's not because

2074
01:41:53,488 --> 01:41:58,769
the people are better right it's just

2075
01:41:55,619 --> 01:42:03,090
the it's just the cost of that area

2076
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:04,710
right because there are great developers

2077
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:06,150
in other parts of the world they just

2078
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:12,480
happen to live in places that are a lot

2079
01:42:06,149 --> 01:42:16,829
lower cost of living right and so I

2080
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:21,659
guess all I would say is there's not

2081
01:42:16,829 --> 01:42:24,300
much I can do to as an individual taking

2082
01:42:21,659 --> 01:42:27,180
a project for a month or two that would

2083
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:30,750
pay me enough money that it would matter

2084
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:32,550
to the success of the company right no

2085
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:36,350
one's gonna pay me like five million

2086
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:36,350
dollars to do a three-month project

2087
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:45,109
if you are please email me right but no

2088
01:42:41,569 --> 01:42:47,539
one's gonna do that right you can make a

2089
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:49,279
ton of money in like a jackpot fashion

2090
01:42:47,539 --> 01:42:50,449
by like doing something like working for

2091
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:52,489
a startup company in getting a lot of

2092
01:42:50,449 --> 01:42:57,199
stock right and like cashing out or

2093
01:42:52,489 --> 01:42:58,849
something like that right but

2094
01:42:57,199 --> 01:43:00,859
realistically if you're just talking

2095
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:02,900
about contract programming there I don't

2096
01:43:00,859 --> 01:43:04,759
know of anywhere where you can get like

2097
01:43:02,899 --> 01:43:06,739
literally millions of dollars for short

2098
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:09,020
term work and the reality of the

2099
01:43:06,739 --> 01:43:11,840
situation is that trying to make games

2100
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:14,930
in high-priced regions you're talking

2101
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:19,400
about money on that scale and it's it

2102
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:20,750
sucks I you know it does but you know

2103
01:43:19,399 --> 01:43:27,319
sometimes you just get unlucky and

2104
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:28,819
that's where you live right and and you

2105
01:43:27,319 --> 01:43:31,340
know maybe we should all move to Montana

2106
01:43:28,819 --> 01:43:34,819
and we probably should I don't know why

2107
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:36,829
we're still sticking around right but we

2108
01:43:34,819 --> 01:43:38,449
could all move to Montana and for the

2109
01:43:36,829 --> 01:43:40,369
same amount that you're paying every

2110
01:43:38,449 --> 01:43:42,529
month in rent in Seattle or San

2111
01:43:40,369 --> 01:43:47,090
Francisco you could own you know the

2112
01:43:42,529 --> 01:43:56,210
state of Montana right and so I think

2113
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:59,000
like to a large extent the there's a lot

2114
01:43:56,210 --> 01:44:03,350
of disparity and it's just because you

2115
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:05,569
know web companies and stuff generate an

2116
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:07,430
unfair amount of money largely due to

2117
01:44:05,569 --> 01:44:13,569
the fact that they have an unfair

2118
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:17,930
playing field you know at the risk of

2119
01:44:13,569 --> 01:44:21,019
the a long digression into economics you

2120
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:24,110
know most of what the reason why we have

2121
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:27,620
these incredible wealth concentrations

2122
01:44:24,109 --> 01:44:30,849
in a few places is is pretty much just

2123
01:44:27,619 --> 01:44:34,010
100% unfair competition right

2124
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:35,390
period and the reason I say that is

2125
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:37,850
because if you look at a company like

2126
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:39,980
for example Facebook and you're like how

2127
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:42,410
is it that this company is able to be so

2128
01:44:39,979 --> 01:44:44,539
wealthy the answer is very simple they

2129
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:47,420
are exempt from most of the laws that

2130
01:44:44,539 --> 01:44:49,640
other people had to actually obey that's

2131
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:52,010
why if they actually have

2132
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:53,930
to follow copyright law they would be

2133
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:55,250
out of business already the number of

2134
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:56,650
lawsuits they would have had to settle

2135
01:44:55,250 --> 01:45:02,569
for copyright infringement alone

2136
01:44:56,649 --> 01:45:05,689
Facebook wouldn't exist right and so you

2137
01:45:02,569 --> 01:45:07,609
look at a lot of the reasons why web

2138
01:45:05,689 --> 01:45:09,829
companies exist at all it's because of

2139
01:45:07,609 --> 01:45:11,719
unfair competition they haven't had to

2140
01:45:09,829 --> 01:45:13,729
comply with the same laws that all

2141
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:15,619
existing companies have had to comply

2142
01:45:13,729 --> 01:45:21,979
with and that's really why they're

2143
01:45:15,619 --> 01:45:26,510
wealthy it's no surprise when you have

2144
01:45:21,979 --> 01:45:29,179
people who can basically you know not

2145
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:30,560
have any regulation that they beat a

2146
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:32,210
bunch of companies that have to be

2147
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:34,039
regulated right and that's just the way

2148
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:39,500
it works so there's not much you can

2149
01:45:34,039 --> 01:45:42,079
really do about that and eventually that

2150
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:44,390
won't be true because what you know this

2151
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:45,529
is always the progress of industry you

2152
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:47,600
know in the old days there used to be

2153
01:45:45,529 --> 01:45:50,210
things called company towns in the US

2154
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:53,120
for example right a company owned a town

2155
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:56,359
they ran the post office they were the

2156
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:58,809
governor right or the mayor right they

2157
01:45:56,359 --> 01:46:03,949
supplied the police effectively right

2158
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:07,370
they made the law that's what happens at

2159
01:46:03,949 --> 01:46:09,889
the start of a new type of Industry when

2160
01:46:07,369 --> 01:46:12,319
they are settling something eventually

2161
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:15,039
an ende wealth concentration is

2162
01:46:12,319 --> 01:46:17,869
phenomenal right this is what happened

2163
01:46:15,039 --> 01:46:19,909
in the settling of the united states as

2164
01:46:17,869 --> 01:46:22,039
well right and that is because it is

2165
01:46:19,909 --> 01:46:23,300
largely lawless right it has not been

2166
01:46:22,039 --> 01:46:29,359
reined in and people are doing whatever

2167
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:31,789
they want no I'm saying that's what

2168
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:34,509
happened with technology right that's

2169
01:46:31,789 --> 01:46:39,489
what happened with the internet and

2170
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:41,539
eventually you know people don't

2171
01:46:39,489 --> 01:46:42,920
probably appreciate it as much but

2172
01:46:41,539 --> 01:46:46,039
that's what will happen to the internet

2173
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:49,609
as well so governments are now

2174
01:46:46,039 --> 01:46:52,220
regulating it like crazy gdpr is a very

2175
01:46:49,609 --> 01:46:53,539
good example of the EU saying you know

2176
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:56,150
what we've got a bunch of rules we're

2177
01:46:53,539 --> 01:47:00,319
going to impose the EU is thinking of

2178
01:46:56,149 --> 01:47:03,198
imposing rules like click wrappings

2179
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:06,889
rules and stuff like you you have to pay

2180
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:09,288
you link to things right and what that

2181
01:47:06,889 --> 01:47:10,819
is is just not unusual and it's not

2182
01:47:09,288 --> 01:47:13,130
government overreach or anything like

2183
01:47:10,819 --> 01:47:16,038
that any more than any of these other

2184
01:47:13,130 --> 01:47:17,900
things are what it is is government

2185
01:47:16,038 --> 01:47:19,728
eventually moves in to regulate things

2186
01:47:17,899 --> 01:47:21,018
once they are important and once they're

2187
01:47:19,729 --> 01:47:25,400
valuable right

2188
01:47:21,019 --> 01:47:27,860
and once those laws arrive all of this

2189
01:47:25,399 --> 01:47:30,078
stuff normalizes out right because now

2190
01:47:27,859 --> 01:47:32,029
it's a level playing field and the

2191
01:47:30,078 --> 01:47:34,518
government wants their take and the

2192
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:36,768
government takes control and it's no

2193
01:47:34,519 --> 01:47:38,389
longer a giant party where you are the

2194
01:47:36,769 --> 01:47:42,079
government and you take all the taxes

2195
01:47:38,389 --> 01:47:44,300
right so that's really what we've seen

2196
01:47:42,078 --> 01:47:46,549
and for people who are either you could

2197
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:48,739
argue lucky enough or maybe you want to

2198
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:51,050
say unlucky enough to live in the

2199
01:47:48,738 --> 01:47:54,259
centers where these effectively lawless

2200
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:56,479
corporations have been occupying the

2201
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:58,248
physical real estate well big surprise

2202
01:47:56,479 --> 01:48:00,590
everything is incredibly expensive

2203
01:47:58,248 --> 01:48:02,238
because they have effectively unlimited

2204
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:04,069
money because they have been able to

2205
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:06,618
conduct business outside of any

2206
01:48:04,069 --> 01:48:08,569
regulations and as you might expect

2207
01:48:06,618 --> 01:48:10,219
anything unregulated beats things that

2208
01:48:08,569 --> 01:48:13,639
are regulated and that's where the money

2209
01:48:10,219 --> 01:48:16,158
moves right so for those of us who live

2210
01:48:13,639 --> 01:48:18,889
in Seattle or San Francisco or a couple

2211
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:21,828
other places that are similar what ends

2212
01:48:18,889 --> 01:48:23,359
up happening is you know you have to

2213
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:25,488
like rise with those rates and there's

2214
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:27,708
nothing you can really do about it you

2215
01:48:25,488 --> 01:48:29,448
can move away if you want to and that's

2216
01:48:27,708 --> 01:48:33,038
certainly an option it's an option I

2217
01:48:29,448 --> 01:48:35,658
would consider right or you can stay and

2218
01:48:33,038 --> 01:48:37,189
you have to basically like be really

2219
01:48:35,658 --> 01:48:38,839
competitive and you have to be much

2220
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:43,848
better than you would have to otherwise

2221
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:46,340
be right that's the life this is just

2222
01:48:43,849 --> 01:48:48,219
how the world works there's no sense

2223
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:52,458
crying about it it's just how it is and

2224
01:48:48,219 --> 01:48:54,260
so I moved to Seattle in 1995 my first

2225
01:48:52,458 --> 01:48:57,469
apartment cost four hundred ninety five

2226
01:48:54,260 --> 01:49:00,260
dollars a month and it was totally fine

2227
01:48:57,469 --> 01:49:01,609
wasn't a nice place but I mean it wasn't

2228
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:03,349
even on the ground floor there's a third

2229
01:49:01,609 --> 01:49:06,978
floor apartment for four hundred ninety

2230
01:49:03,349 --> 01:49:08,659
five dollars a month that same apartment

2231
01:49:06,979 --> 01:49:10,280
probably now costs at least eighteen

2232
01:49:08,658 --> 01:49:12,339
hundred dollars a month would be my desk

2233
01:49:10,279 --> 01:49:13,920
and I doubt it's been renovated at all

2234
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:19,050
this

2235
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:21,300
the same and so you know I just I never

2236
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:24,840
left so I'm stuck with it that's just

2237
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:29,070
the way it is now it's worth noting that

2238
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:30,360
it benefited me though because during

2239
01:49:29,069 --> 01:49:32,039
the time that I did work in mystery I

2240
01:49:30,359 --> 01:49:34,349
was able to stockpile some money so I

2241
01:49:32,039 --> 01:49:36,269
you know some of the stuff we did at my

2242
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:39,780
rocket I been cold myself right because

2243
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:41,370
I had some money and the reason I was

2244
01:49:39,779 --> 01:49:42,840
able to get that money was specifically

2245
01:49:41,369 --> 01:49:47,000
because I was an area that effectively

2246
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:49,319
overpays me right like I can work on

2247
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,300
projects that pay me a lot more and I

2248
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:54,059
know the people I'm in the area right

2249
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:57,630
and so you know it does benefit me a

2250
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:59,940
little bit if I choose to go to work it

2251
01:49:57,630 --> 01:50:02,010
benefits me greatly but the problem is

2252
01:49:59,939 --> 01:50:03,779
when you then go to try and do products

2253
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:05,610
independently they're small in scale but

2254
01:50:03,779 --> 01:50:08,309
aren't operating in the same kind of

2255
01:50:05,609 --> 01:50:10,079
lawless space that you know don't really

2256
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:12,179
have much benefit they don't get a lot

2257
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:13,890
of benefit from deregulation you know

2258
01:50:12,179 --> 01:50:16,770
games don't really benefit hugely from

2259
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:21,119
deregulation the way that the web

2260
01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:23,940
services do I you just you gotta take

2261
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:25,289
the good with the bad right so sorry for

2262
01:50:23,939 --> 01:50:26,759
that long discussion of but that's just

2263
01:50:25,289 --> 01:50:28,140
that's the truth right that's just how

2264
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:30,360
the world works and there's nothing you

2265
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:32,039
can do about it as an individual you

2266
01:50:30,359 --> 01:50:33,899
know maybe collectively you can do

2267
01:50:32,039 --> 01:50:37,460
things about it right because you you

2268
01:50:33,899 --> 01:50:42,659
know vote for your government or you

2269
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:44,880
participate in some kind of fora that

2270
01:50:42,659 --> 01:50:46,109
that that shapes the public thinking

2271
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,029
about these things or who knows what

2272
01:50:46,109 --> 01:50:50,488
right so maybe you can do things about

2273
01:50:48,029 --> 01:50:52,800
it who knows but you know absent doing

2274
01:50:50,488 --> 01:50:56,519
something about it you have to kind of

2275
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:58,770
just play along with the the way that

2276
01:50:56,520 --> 01:51:01,520
that things are structured right it's

2277
01:50:58,770 --> 01:51:01,520
just something to do

2278
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:12,810
in terms of rigor techniques how is your

2279
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:14,039
style changes of course this project are

2280
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:15,420
there things you did at the beginning of

2281
01:51:14,039 --> 01:51:16,260
this project that you think we're steps

2282
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:18,630
the wrong direction or would you

2283
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:21,030
differently um well we've we've

2284
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:22,859
corrected most of our mistakes on on

2285
01:51:21,029 --> 01:51:23,939
Hammad here and that was the goal you

2286
01:51:22,859 --> 01:51:27,210
know I wanted to show how you correct

2287
01:51:23,939 --> 01:51:28,619
those things there definitely are a few

2288
01:51:27,210 --> 01:51:29,909
things so the the biggest thing I would

2289
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:32,189
say the biggest difference is when I

2290
01:51:29,909 --> 01:51:35,869
started hand Madeira I had very little

2291
01:51:32,189 --> 01:51:38,759
multi-thread programming experience and

2292
01:51:35,869 --> 01:51:41,489
very little out of order CPU

2293
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:44,430
optimization experience I now have a lot

2294
01:51:41,489 --> 01:51:46,909
more of both of those and so the

2295
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:49,860
sections that we did on those were poor

2296
01:51:46,909 --> 01:51:53,359
you know if I was doing multi-threading

2297
01:51:49,859 --> 01:51:56,159
or out of order optimization stuff today

2298
01:51:53,359 --> 01:51:58,979
it would have been a lot better I just I

2299
01:51:56,159 --> 01:52:02,849
just know like way more and so those

2300
01:51:58,979 --> 01:52:04,109
were pretty poor they don't matter a

2301
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:08,030
huge amount to this particular product

2302
01:52:04,109 --> 01:52:12,119
project but you know that was the case

2303
01:52:08,029 --> 01:52:14,869
and the other thing is I would say the

2304
01:52:12,119 --> 01:52:17,159
debug system we overcomplicated too much

2305
01:52:14,869 --> 01:52:20,099
or just I shouldn't say overcomplicated

2306
01:52:17,159 --> 01:52:21,869
we complicated it too much and we should

2307
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:26,039
have stuck with simpler put more

2308
01:52:21,869 --> 01:52:32,699
purpose-built things so that could be

2309
01:52:26,039 --> 01:52:34,739
simplified yeah I think other than that

2310
01:52:32,699 --> 01:52:36,329
I think we're roughly I was happy with

2311
01:52:34,739 --> 01:52:37,139
most stuff and I was happy with those

2312
01:52:36,329 --> 01:52:39,059
things too I mean I

2313
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:41,250
the goal of handmade here was was to

2314
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:44,700
show you know what's realistic for a

2315
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:45,810
programmer to be doing they're supposed

2316
01:52:44,699 --> 01:52:47,159
to be mistakes they're supposed to be

2317
01:52:45,810 --> 01:52:48,780
areas that they don't know about because

2318
01:52:47,159 --> 01:52:50,220
nobody knows everything I mean that

2319
01:52:48,779 --> 01:52:51,630
there are no programmers who just know

2320
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:53,369
how to make everything perfectly every

2321
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:55,470
time right that just doesn't exist and

2322
01:52:53,369 --> 01:53:00,449
so I want people to have a very

2323
01:52:55,470 --> 01:53:01,680
realistic expectation you know I don't

2324
01:53:00,449 --> 01:53:03,090
think I would have trouble getting hired

2325
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:05,640
at a game engine company pretty much

2326
01:53:03,090 --> 01:53:07,619
anywhere at this point in my career but

2327
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:09,240
as you see on handmade here oh I have

2328
01:53:07,619 --> 01:53:11,010
questions about stuff all the time right

2329
01:53:09,239 --> 01:53:12,779
I'm always like I wondered about this or

2330
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:15,510
I would like to talk to an expert in at

2331
01:53:12,779 --> 01:53:18,090
in blah because I don't know right and I

2332
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:22,320
want people to understand that that is

2333
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:25,409
the standard even at a pretty like

2334
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:27,869
far a long point in someone's game

2335
01:53:25,409 --> 01:53:31,079
development career you do not know

2336
01:53:27,869 --> 01:53:34,738
everything and you never will I don't

2337
01:53:31,079 --> 01:53:38,069
care who you pick they don't write and

2338
01:53:34,738 --> 01:53:39,779
so you know having a realistic

2339
01:53:38,069 --> 01:53:44,579
expectation of what you're supposed to

2340
01:53:39,779 --> 01:53:45,960
be able to do best case was important to

2341
01:53:44,579 --> 01:53:47,970
me and it's important that people see

2342
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:50,640
that on handmade hero I want them to see

2343
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:52,770
me make mistakes I want them to see me

2344
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:54,900
have to debug things I want them to see

2345
01:53:52,770 --> 01:53:58,430
them you have to change my mind

2346
01:53:54,899 --> 01:54:04,529
because to me that's like the value is

2347
01:53:58,430 --> 01:54:08,520
having a realistic portrayal of what

2348
01:54:04,529 --> 01:54:11,059
it's like to program not a sort of a

2349
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:12,840
grande iced heroic version where I

2350
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:14,250
already know when I'm going to do

2351
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:16,260
exactly on stream and then just

2352
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:19,500
magically do it and it all works right

2353
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:21,570
because to me that's sending a very

2354
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:23,699
incorrect message about what you should

2355
01:54:21,569 --> 01:54:28,259
be able to do and what you shouldn't be

2356
01:54:23,699 --> 01:54:31,920
able to do when you are a game engine

2357
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:34,640
developer who you know is established

2358
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:38,430
right when you're past the novice stage

2359
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:39,900
and so hopefully you know we've we've

2360
01:54:38,430 --> 01:54:45,630
captured that on handmade here pretty

2361
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:49,829
well and you know hopefully people feel

2362
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:53,100
comfortable with making mistakes and not

2363
01:54:49,829 --> 01:54:56,309
knowing everything and asking other

2364
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:58,579
people or expecting that there will be

2365
01:54:56,310 --> 01:55:03,150
people who know things that you don't

2366
01:54:58,579 --> 01:55:05,100
and to not feel like that's something

2367
01:55:03,149 --> 01:55:06,210
that goes away to not feel like that's

2368
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:11,660
something that only happens because

2369
01:55:06,210 --> 01:55:11,659
you're a beginner right and so

2370
01:55:13,939 --> 01:55:18,920
can memory fragmentation happen on a GPU

2371
01:55:22,069 --> 01:55:30,389
well gosh that's a really tricky

2372
01:55:28,288 --> 01:55:36,328
question and I guess not what I'm

2373
01:55:30,389 --> 01:55:37,769
prepared to answer so I apologize the

2374
01:55:36,328 --> 01:55:42,840
reason that I'm hesitant to answer that

2375
01:55:37,769 --> 01:55:45,420
question is because obviously any piece

2376
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:48,479
of hardware that has a memory system in

2377
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:52,078
it can have fragmentation problems you

2378
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:59,458
know that's just obviously the case

2379
01:55:52,078 --> 01:56:04,738
right but the intervening factor that

2380
01:55:59,458 --> 01:56:08,279
you get with the GPU is that 99.9% of

2381
01:56:04,738 --> 01:56:13,399
all of the code that goes to a GPU is

2382
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:17,099
using some degree of blind handles right

2383
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:18,958
so if you imagine for example in OpenGL

2384
01:56:17,099 --> 01:56:20,788
which admittedly is a bit high level

2385
01:56:18,958 --> 01:56:25,050
compared to something like Vulcan or d3

2386
01:56:20,788 --> 01:56:26,670
d12 but let's suppose you just looked at

2387
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:28,110
what would happen with an OpenGL app

2388
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:30,779
well you'll notice that all of our

2389
01:56:28,109 --> 01:56:35,488
textures are described to the GPU in

2390
01:56:30,779 --> 01:56:38,849
what way handles right so when we say

2391
01:56:35,488 --> 01:56:42,799
we're trying to draw this you know thing

2392
01:56:38,849 --> 01:56:45,269
to the screen it's texture number 37

2393
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:47,729
we're not talking about memory we're

2394
01:56:45,269 --> 01:56:52,340
just talking about a slot an abstract

2395
01:56:47,729 --> 01:56:55,380
slot right what that means is that it is

2396
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:57,389
relatively inexpensive for a driver to

2397
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:59,489
do memory compaction behind our back we

2398
01:56:57,389 --> 01:57:01,800
don't know where slot 37s data lives

2399
01:56:59,488 --> 01:57:05,188
could be anywhere we talked about it on

2400
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:07,949
frame three maybe it translates slot

2401
01:57:05,189 --> 01:57:12,139
slot 37 to one chunk of memory we talked

2402
01:57:07,948 --> 01:57:14,759
about it on frame 97 it's moved it right

2403
01:57:12,139 --> 01:57:15,590
could have easily moved it we have no

2404
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:19,349
idea

2405
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:26,579
so I guess what I would say is that

2406
01:57:19,349 --> 01:57:28,409
probably GPUs probably don't have

2407
01:57:26,579 --> 01:57:32,000
as much of a problem with memory

2408
01:57:28,409 --> 01:57:34,889
fragmentation as they otherwise would

2409
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:37,260
because a large number of the things

2410
01:57:34,890 --> 01:57:40,590
that use them and interface with them

2411
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:43,560
don't actually know where the things

2412
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:46,230
they've allocated are which allows the

2413
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:48,950
driver pretty much carte blanche to

2414
01:57:46,229 --> 01:57:51,959
rearrange them

2415
01:57:48,949 --> 01:57:53,489
now the reason I'm hesitant to just say

2416
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:54,930
well so there's no problem with

2417
01:57:53,489 --> 01:57:57,239
fragmentation on a GPU because the

2418
01:57:54,930 --> 01:58:01,070
driver could just fix it is because

2419
01:57:57,239 --> 01:58:05,309
again the flipside is also true for

2420
01:58:01,069 --> 01:58:07,649
example bind list textures are a good

2421
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:14,690
example of not really possibly being

2422
01:58:07,649 --> 01:58:19,229
able to do remapping and you know the

2423
01:58:14,689 --> 01:58:22,079
the overall effect there is that certain

2424
01:58:19,229 --> 01:58:25,649
lower level access to the GPU that is

2425
01:58:22,079 --> 01:58:28,859
actively encouraged by Nvidia and AMD

2426
01:58:25,649 --> 01:58:31,289
and whatnot does start to expose the

2427
01:58:28,859 --> 01:58:34,439
actual location of things and once

2428
01:58:31,289 --> 01:58:36,899
that's true the graphics card will have

2429
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:39,569
a harder time managing the fragmentation

2430
01:58:36,899 --> 01:58:41,939
now it's still not a given that you have

2431
01:58:39,569 --> 01:58:43,920
a fragmentation problem because in order

2432
01:58:41,939 --> 01:58:46,739
to have a memory fragmentation problem

2433
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:49,949
you have to be looking at memory holes

2434
01:58:46,739 --> 01:58:53,250
that happen at a granularity that isn't

2435
01:58:49,949 --> 01:58:57,840
at the virtual page size of this card if

2436
01:58:53,250 --> 01:58:59,819
it has memory mapping itself right and I

2437
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:04,770
guess I don't know the specifics and

2438
01:58:59,819 --> 01:59:07,859
those sorts of things right so all I can

2439
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:09,270
really tell you is yes fragmentation can

2440
01:59:07,859 --> 01:59:11,969
be a problem anytime you have

2441
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:14,730
unpredictable memory allocation and

2442
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:16,140
de-allocation patterns know the GPU does

2443
01:59:14,729 --> 01:59:17,459
not have as hard a problem perhaps as

2444
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:20,100
other people because of the way the

2445
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:22,020
api's are designed but yes it still

2446
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:24,630
could happen because some of those api's

2447
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:27,570
do expose details that may be low-level

2448
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:31,920
enough to create a problem hopefully

2449
01:59:27,569 --> 01:59:34,949
that helps and yes these pants are very

2450
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:37,230
comfy how would you compare windbg and

2451
01:59:34,949 --> 01:59:39,389
remedy BG should I consider switching to

2452
01:59:37,229 --> 01:59:40,349
remedy if I'm using windbg yes you

2453
01:59:39,390 --> 01:59:42,420
absolutely should

2454
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:50,190
consider switching I would compare them

2455
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:53,430
as such I would say windbg is like 10

2456
01:59:50,189 --> 01:59:56,969
out of 10 on features and like 0 out of

2457
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:59,730
10 on usability right it has like every

2458
01:59:56,970 --> 02:00:01,740
feature Under the Sun most of the

2459
01:59:59,729 --> 02:00:04,439
features windbg has I probably even know

2460
02:00:01,739 --> 02:00:06,479
about like I mean there's a huge array

2461
02:00:04,439 --> 02:00:08,609
of command line options and plugins and

2462
02:00:06,479 --> 02:00:09,929
like the number of debug features windbg

2463
02:00:08,609 --> 02:00:13,889
has is insane

2464
02:00:09,930 --> 02:00:16,260
right remedy has like by comparison very

2465
02:00:13,890 --> 02:00:19,430
few features like the number of features

2466
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:23,159
in remedy BG is pretty low compared to

2467
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:27,840
windbg that's true but the usability is

2468
02:00:23,159 --> 02:00:30,149
like 10 out of 10 right so what I do and

2469
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:33,619
what I would encourage you to do buy a

2470
02:00:30,149 --> 02:00:36,029
copy of remedy use it as much as you can

2471
02:00:33,619 --> 02:00:38,579
when you get to something that you can't

2472
02:00:36,029 --> 02:00:41,670
debug with remedy begrudgingly downshift

2473
02:00:38,579 --> 02:00:45,630
to win BG ring to BG right that's what I

2474
02:00:41,670 --> 02:00:48,600
do because the day to day debugging that

2475
02:00:45,630 --> 02:00:50,310
you do doesn't require most of the

2476
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:52,200
features of windbg so you're just

2477
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:56,610
suffering with a horrible user interface

2478
02:00:52,199 --> 02:01:00,090
for no reason why not let remedy upgrade

2479
02:00:56,609 --> 02:01:01,679
that experience for you right and it

2480
02:01:00,090 --> 02:01:05,250
takes 10 seconds to launch another

2481
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:10,230
debugger if on the particular days when

2482
02:01:05,250 --> 02:01:13,020
you need to to actually address that

2483
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:16,889
problem right when you need to like oh

2484
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:18,720
there's a particular feature you know I

2485
02:01:16,890 --> 02:01:20,820
need to download symbols from Windows

2486
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:23,730
symbol server and step through a thing

2487
02:01:20,819 --> 02:01:25,679
and do a mini dump and blob right when

2488
02:01:23,729 --> 02:01:27,659
you start to use all like tons of debug

2489
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:37,380
features there that that need to get

2490
02:01:27,659 --> 02:01:40,949
like when you need to sort of get like a

2491
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:43,289
power user debugger interface then you

2492
02:01:40,949 --> 02:01:45,329
know it takes 10 seconds to fire up one

2493
02:01:43,289 --> 02:01:47,699
DBG just go ahead and do it but the rest

2494
02:01:45,329 --> 02:01:50,189
of time I would use remedy right and

2495
02:01:47,699 --> 02:01:52,859
that's my opinion on it and that's what

2496
02:01:50,189 --> 02:01:54,099
I actually do I don't find myself

2497
02:01:52,859 --> 02:01:57,489
needing wind EEG

2498
02:01:54,100 --> 02:02:00,400
the ever weeks will often go by before I

2499
02:01:57,489 --> 02:02:02,229
need to switch to it but your mileage

2500
02:02:00,399 --> 02:02:04,329
may vary right because it depends along

2501
02:02:02,229 --> 02:02:07,329
the kind of debugging you do and what

2502
02:02:04,329 --> 02:02:10,149
you need remedy BG is also always

2503
02:02:07,329 --> 02:02:13,479
improving it's better this month than it

2504
02:02:10,149 --> 02:02:15,009
was last month right and so the other

2505
02:02:13,479 --> 02:02:15,909
thing I would say is if it doesn't work

2506
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:17,949
for you right now

2507
02:02:15,909 --> 02:02:19,359
because you try it and you're just like

2508
02:02:17,949 --> 02:02:22,510
an ass that doesn't have enough features

2509
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:27,489
I need X Y &amp; Z you know make sure you

2510
02:02:22,510 --> 02:02:29,739
file them on the windbg github there's

2511
02:02:27,489 --> 02:02:30,760
feature requests github make sure your

2512
02:02:29,739 --> 02:02:32,289
file what you need on there

2513
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:35,350
and then come back and check in six

2514
02:02:32,289 --> 02:02:38,019
months right the upgrades are free so

2515
02:02:35,350 --> 02:02:40,150
far so you know you pay your twenty

2516
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:44,020
bucks or whatever it is and you know

2517
02:02:40,149 --> 02:02:47,170
when it's ready it's ready for you so so

2518
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:49,060
yeah that's that's my take on it but you

2519
02:02:47,170 --> 02:02:51,569
know you can you have to make your own

2520
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:51,570
decision sir

2521
02:03:01,369 --> 02:03:09,970
we're going to learn more about

2522
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:09,970
out-of-order optimization I don't know

2523
02:03:11,710 --> 02:03:17,539
sorry could you explain the strict

2524
02:03:15,739 --> 02:03:19,399
binary is it possible to optimize a

2525
02:03:17,539 --> 02:03:21,920
binary even if there's no access to the

2526
02:03:19,399 --> 02:03:26,269
source code sure I don't know what you

2527
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:28,149
mean by stripped binary there's a couple

2528
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:31,010
things that could mean so I can't really

2529
02:03:28,149 --> 02:03:33,469
explain a stripped binary because I'm

2530
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:37,430
not I'm just not sure what stripped

2531
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:39,230
binary means a binary is a binary and if

2532
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:41,450
maybe you're talking about a binary that

2533
02:03:39,229 --> 02:03:45,409
doesn't still have debug information

2534
02:03:41,449 --> 02:03:46,699
with it or something I don't know but in

2535
02:03:45,409 --> 02:03:47,899
terms of whether it's possible to opt I

2536
02:03:46,699 --> 02:03:50,809
as a binary if there's no access to

2537
02:03:47,899 --> 02:03:52,279
source code yes it certainly is there's

2538
02:03:50,810 --> 02:03:55,820
a lot of techniques you can use to do

2539
02:03:52,279 --> 02:03:59,449
that but there's some pretty easy ways

2540
02:03:55,819 --> 02:04:01,639
so the easiest way by far to optimize a

2541
02:03:59,449 --> 02:04:03,619
stripped binary at least you know and

2542
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:05,630
again I'm not a reverse engineer so this

2543
02:04:03,619 --> 02:04:08,149
may not even be the easiest way take it

2544
02:04:05,630 --> 02:04:11,449
with a grain of salt but a very easy way

2545
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:14,659
to optimize a stripped binary is to just

2546
02:04:11,449 --> 02:04:17,239
relocate functions right so for example

2547
02:04:14,659 --> 02:04:19,399
if you have a particular code path it

2548
02:04:17,239 --> 02:04:22,630
issues a call right so there's a call

2549
02:04:19,399 --> 02:04:26,619
instruction that calls out to a function

2550
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:29,270
any call site like that you can usually

2551
02:04:26,619 --> 02:04:32,300
optimize that by calling somewhere else

2552
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:34,550
so what you can do is take whatever the

2553
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:38,270
function was that it's calling right a

2554
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:40,130
more optimal version link it in you know

2555
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:42,050
place it somewhere in the in the

2556
02:04:40,130 --> 02:04:45,970
executable and jump there instead of

2557
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:45,970
jumping where they were jumping right

2558
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:50,869
and that's that's a pretty obvious way

2559
02:04:49,189 --> 02:04:53,000
another way a lot of people do it is

2560
02:04:50,869 --> 02:04:54,590
they'll just patch over some part of a

2561
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,659
function with a jump called jump

2562
02:04:54,590 --> 02:05:00,489
somewhere else and then returns there

2563
02:04:56,659 --> 02:05:00,489
right it's all kinds of stuff like that

2564
02:05:11,590 --> 02:05:17,350
so many resources on why new programming

2565
02:05:14,050 --> 02:05:19,029
isn't that good I mean nothing

2566
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:20,289
definitive I would like there to be

2567
02:05:19,029 --> 02:05:22,059
something more definitive but you know

2568
02:05:20,289 --> 02:05:25,329
even recently on Twitter I tried to ask

2569
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:26,920
for people to just do the opposite like

2570
02:05:25,329 --> 02:05:30,069
do you have any resources on wihout

2571
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:31,569
programming is good and like I didn't

2572
02:05:30,069 --> 02:05:33,369
even really get any answers there was

2573
02:05:31,569 --> 02:05:35,229
literally like a hundred replies and

2574
02:05:33,369 --> 02:05:38,199
most of them were disagreeing with each

2575
02:05:35,229 --> 02:05:40,750
other right so I don't even know what

2576
02:05:38,199 --> 02:05:42,760
people claim is good about OOP

2577
02:05:40,750 --> 02:05:43,989
so it's hard to tell say why it's bad

2578
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:47,590
when you don't even know what you're

2579
02:05:43,989 --> 02:05:49,029
talking about right and so I find the

2580
02:05:47,590 --> 02:05:50,739
whole situation frustrating and I'm just

2581
02:05:49,029 --> 02:05:52,389
disinclined to even engage with it it's

2582
02:05:50,739 --> 02:05:54,340
like if you want to program in it go

2583
02:05:52,390 --> 02:05:58,869
right ahead just don't bother me about

2584
02:05:54,340 --> 02:06:00,610
it right what would be the best way to

2585
02:05:58,869 --> 02:06:02,170
prevent overdrawn a software rasterizer

2586
02:06:00,609 --> 02:06:03,909
in particular with a voxel scene like

2587
02:06:02,170 --> 02:06:06,730
minecraft I asked this before but didn't

2588
02:06:03,909 --> 02:06:08,409
specify the type of game well you know

2589
02:06:06,729 --> 02:06:11,889
most of the time what you're talking

2590
02:06:08,409 --> 02:06:13,510
about with preventing overdraw is you're

2591
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:16,270
just trying to figure out ahead of time

2592
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:17,110
how you can draw like front to back and

2593
02:06:16,270 --> 02:06:19,330
know that you don't need to draw

2594
02:06:17,109 --> 02:06:22,389
anything else right so typically what

2595
02:06:19,329 --> 02:06:24,550
you do in something where like for

2596
02:06:22,390 --> 02:06:26,410
example minecraft typically what you

2597
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:30,039
would do in a game like that is you

2598
02:06:26,409 --> 02:06:32,289
would pre process and I don't mean

2599
02:06:30,039 --> 02:06:34,750
pretty like at load time I mean like pre

2600
02:06:32,289 --> 02:06:37,359
as in before the you know in the middle

2601
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:39,970
of a frame or during the run of the game

2602
02:06:37,359 --> 02:06:41,769
right you would take large sections of

2603
02:06:39,970 --> 02:06:44,800
the voxel and you would find solid

2604
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:46,600
regions of them right and then when

2605
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:48,159
you're doing your rendering as you

2606
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:50,710
render you would probably want to sleep

2607
02:06:48,159 --> 02:06:55,329
from the front backwards so as you go

2608
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:59,319
right and you can do two things one is

2609
02:06:55,329 --> 02:07:01,210
you can lean on those large voxel

2610
02:06:59,319 --> 02:07:02,889
clusters that you've built into maybe

2611
02:07:01,210 --> 02:07:06,760
like larger cute you know like

2612
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:10,090
rectangular occluders to just frustum

2613
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:11,650
cull the projection of that against the

2614
02:07:10,090 --> 02:07:14,110
whole voxel world and no you don't even

2615
02:07:11,649 --> 02:07:15,879
need to consider anything in that area

2616
02:07:14,109 --> 02:07:18,369
so you don't even process that part of

2617
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:22,060
the box alright and then the other thing

2618
02:07:18,369 --> 02:07:25,679
you do is as you go forwards you keep

2619
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:27,860
track of some resolution on the screen

2620
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:31,590
like let's say sixteen by sixteen

2621
02:07:27,859 --> 02:07:32,908
squares and you just keep track of

2622
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:35,940
whether you've drawn them or not

2623
02:07:32,908 --> 02:07:37,799
and so if you progress from front to

2624
02:07:35,939 --> 02:07:41,069
back what you can easily do in a boxing

2625
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:43,860
world what you do is you just go when

2626
02:07:41,069 --> 02:07:46,979
I'm about to rasterize if I've already

2627
02:07:43,859 --> 02:07:49,408
drawn everything in this 16 by 16 block

2628
02:07:46,979 --> 02:07:51,268
I just no longer even ever rasterize

2629
02:07:49,408 --> 02:07:54,979
anything in it I just early out any

2630
02:07:51,269 --> 02:07:54,980
pixel block that's you in there

2631
02:08:02,908 --> 02:08:05,978
I've heard you mention before that you

2632
02:08:04,779 --> 02:08:07,748
don't like call back should they be

2633
02:08:05,979 --> 02:08:09,489
invited at all costs how would you avoid

2634
02:08:07,748 --> 02:08:12,099
them if using recursion navigate a tree

2635
02:08:09,488 --> 02:08:14,078
like structure yeah I mean I don't like

2636
02:08:12,099 --> 02:08:15,760
callbacks typically because I find that

2637
02:08:14,078 --> 02:08:18,088
they make it very hard to use the code

2638
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:21,849
that's involved part of that is because

2639
02:08:18,088 --> 02:08:25,479
C and C++ are bad like closure kind of

2640
02:08:21,849 --> 02:08:27,279
things they try tried to improve C++ as

2641
02:08:25,479 --> 02:08:29,708
handling of that and they've made some

2642
02:08:27,279 --> 02:08:33,698
improvements but mostly it's still bad

2643
02:08:29,708 --> 02:08:36,729
so you know a lot of it is because of

2644
02:08:33,698 --> 02:08:38,558
that but in terms of running at all cost

2645
02:08:36,729 --> 02:08:40,989
no I mean if you can't turn something

2646
02:08:38,559 --> 02:08:42,128
into an iterator for some reason and you

2647
02:08:40,988 --> 02:08:44,378
really feel like you need a callback

2648
02:08:42,128 --> 02:08:46,868
then sure you know you can use one but

2649
02:08:44,378 --> 02:08:48,578
they just have a high cost so don't do

2650
02:08:46,868 --> 02:08:52,418
that unless you're really sure that the

2651
02:08:48,578 --> 02:08:55,808
alternatives are really bad right it's

2652
02:08:52,418 --> 02:08:57,578
what I would say what's your opinion on

2653
02:08:55,809 --> 02:08:59,679
the whiteboard interviews and the big

2654
02:08:57,578 --> 02:09:03,509
tech companies like Google um I think

2655
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:03,510
they're stupid I've said this before

2656
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:07,538
assuming you're talking about a white

2657
02:09:06,519 --> 02:09:08,769
board interview like I give you a

2658
02:09:07,538 --> 02:09:10,809
programming problem and you solve on a

2659
02:09:08,769 --> 02:09:13,329
white board I think they're dumb I think

2660
02:09:10,809 --> 02:09:15,369
what you get out of white board

2661
02:09:13,328 --> 02:09:18,698
interviews it's kind of exactly what you

2662
02:09:15,368 --> 02:09:21,569
have at Google in terms of the common

2663
02:09:18,698 --> 02:09:24,848
case employee which is to say people who

2664
02:09:21,569 --> 02:09:27,158
are smart on their feet but probably

2665
02:09:24,849 --> 02:09:30,909
aren't very good programmers and I think

2666
02:09:27,158 --> 02:09:32,498
that's mostly what you get right now you

2667
02:09:30,908 --> 02:09:34,688
may get good programmers who happen to

2668
02:09:32,498 --> 02:09:36,969
come through that process anyway if they

2669
02:09:34,689 --> 02:09:38,168
are also smart on their feet but you're

2670
02:09:36,969 --> 02:09:40,510
not really screened for the thing you

2671
02:09:38,168 --> 02:09:42,969
need which is good programmers because

2672
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:44,739
you know programmers don't work on a

2673
02:09:42,969 --> 02:09:48,458
whiteboard it's just not how you write

2674
02:09:44,738 --> 02:09:51,698
code um so you know I don't think

2675
02:09:48,458 --> 02:09:53,948
they're very useful I think they screen

2676
02:09:51,698 --> 02:09:55,509
out people who have maybe poor social

2677
02:09:53,948 --> 02:09:58,238
skills or who have trouble communicating

2678
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:59,708
and I know that places like Google are

2679
02:09:58,238 --> 02:10:01,628
always like no we want good

2680
02:09:59,708 --> 02:10:03,429
communication asleep no you don't like

2681
02:10:01,628 --> 02:10:04,569
no like the people who have written some

2682
02:10:03,429 --> 02:10:06,668
of the best software in history are

2683
02:10:04,569 --> 02:10:08,288
terrible communicators you don't want to

2684
02:10:06,668 --> 02:10:09,760
screen them out and why do you even have

2685
02:10:08,288 --> 02:10:11,828
managers if you can't deal with people

2686
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:13,809
like that like again it's just it's it's

2687
02:10:11,828 --> 02:10:15,608
a really backwards and counter to the

2688
02:10:13,809 --> 02:10:16,360
history of computing like way of

2689
02:10:15,609 --> 02:10:18,130
thinking about compute

2690
02:10:16,359 --> 02:10:21,729
really kind of disgust me it's like the

2691
02:10:18,130 --> 02:10:23,829
new kind of way that people try to claim

2692
02:10:21,729 --> 02:10:25,029
is good to build competing companies and

2693
02:10:23,829 --> 02:10:27,100
I think the proof is in the pudding

2694
02:10:25,029 --> 02:10:30,939
Google products are terrible I mean you

2695
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:34,480
know they get worse every week it takes

2696
02:10:30,939 --> 02:10:36,279
multiple minutes for me to use Google

2697
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:38,429
Drive now like there's I have a

2698
02:10:36,279 --> 02:10:42,819
directory in Google Drive that has 800

2699
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:47,280
right shocking 800 files in it 800 total

2700
02:10:42,819 --> 02:10:50,710
files right 800 that's the number 9 2000

2701
02:10:47,279 --> 02:10:52,809
it takes something like 30 seconds to

2702
02:10:50,710 --> 02:10:54,340
produce a listing and the listing is

2703
02:10:52,810 --> 02:10:56,980
wrong it's not done yet

2704
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:59,440
so you know you asked for a sorted

2705
02:10:56,979 --> 02:11:02,799
listing A to Z it's missing a bunch of

2706
02:10:59,439 --> 02:11:05,889
stuff and then like a minute later those

2707
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:10,119
things show up right that's that's the

2708
02:11:05,890 --> 02:11:11,710
engineering right and so you know I

2709
02:11:10,119 --> 02:11:15,010
don't I don't think they have anything

2710
02:11:11,710 --> 02:11:16,779
to tell in my opinion right I think the

2711
02:11:15,010 --> 02:11:20,350
pudding is pretty rotten that comes out

2712
02:11:16,779 --> 02:11:22,000
of these companies so you know I don't

2713
02:11:20,350 --> 02:11:24,490
think they can speak highly of their

2714
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:25,630
interviewing process or if they if maybe

2715
02:11:24,489 --> 02:11:27,729
they're interviewing process is good

2716
02:11:25,630 --> 02:11:30,159
then maybe their manager process is bad

2717
02:11:27,729 --> 02:11:32,349
I don't know but they produce very low

2718
02:11:30,159 --> 02:11:35,619
quality software like like extremely low

2719
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:41,530
quality I would consider it about as low

2720
02:11:35,619 --> 02:11:43,059
quality as you can get and still say

2721
02:11:41,529 --> 02:11:46,829
that it's the product I don't know like

2722
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:46,830
it's very very bad right

2723
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:04,649
so many questions today I gotta go I'm

2724
02:12:03,779 --> 02:12:06,509
getting hungry

2725
02:12:04,649 --> 02:12:09,089
if virtual memory exists how are games

2726
02:12:06,510 --> 02:12:16,079
still able to be hacked it's because

2727
02:12:09,090 --> 02:12:17,909
offsets are constant I guess I'm not

2728
02:12:16,079 --> 02:12:21,329
sure I understand the question exactly

2729
02:12:17,909 --> 02:12:27,260
but you just mean how do you modify a

2730
02:12:21,329 --> 02:12:27,260
binary if you have virtual memory or I

2731
02:12:27,859 --> 02:12:32,279
don't understand the question I'm sorry

2732
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:36,869
have you read about dean velvel workshop

2733
02:12:32,279 --> 02:12:39,719
assembly and also assembly archive no I

2734
02:12:36,869 --> 02:12:41,189
don't think I know what that is is there

2735
02:12:39,719 --> 02:12:43,529
an errata page there just in case you

2736
02:12:41,189 --> 02:12:44,909
show that I can submit - probably not

2737
02:12:43,529 --> 02:12:49,259
but you can sign up to podcast at Jeff

2738
02:12:44,909 --> 02:12:51,119
in case you show calm the horse ones

2739
02:12:49,260 --> 02:12:52,680
brown asked how do you design memories

2740
02:12:51,119 --> 02:12:55,710
for multiple dynamic arrays to please

2741
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:58,530
the cache I'll be honest I don't like

2742
02:12:55,710 --> 02:13:01,680
dynamic arrays for exactly that reason I

2743
02:12:58,529 --> 02:13:05,279
find that dynamic arrays don't really

2744
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:10,500
lend themselves well to to cache

2745
02:13:05,279 --> 02:13:12,000
coherency over time in that way and I

2746
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:14,069
find that they also make it hard to

2747
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,529
manage your memory properly to avoid

2748
02:13:14,069 --> 02:13:20,880
fragmentation and stuff like that so I'm

2749
02:13:16,529 --> 02:13:22,500
not a fan I'm not a huge fan so I pretty

2750
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:28,289
much never use dynamic arrays pretty

2751
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:29,789
much ever and so I guess I can't really

2752
02:13:28,289 --> 02:13:32,250
answer because I don't have a lot of

2753
02:13:29,789 --> 02:13:33,600
strong opinions about that don't think

2754
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:34,829
the reason for localized software was

2755
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:38,699
because people wanted to do things

2756
02:13:34,829 --> 02:13:40,229
faster I don't know I don't know what

2757
02:13:38,698 --> 02:13:42,238
the reason is for low quality software

2758
02:13:40,229 --> 02:13:43,799
it can't be speed because Google's got

2759
02:13:42,238 --> 02:13:45,599
so many employees it should be possible

2760
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:48,270
to ship a reasonable software product

2761
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:49,350
you know I don't know I don't know why

2762
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:53,820
web companies for you such low quality

2763
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:55,440
software I have no idea I would like to

2764
02:13:53,819 --> 02:13:56,639
express my deepest appointment lack of

2765
02:13:55,439 --> 02:14:00,139
new jeans the episodes yes sorry about

2766
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:00,140
that we'll try to fix that sometime

2767
02:14:15,359 --> 02:14:18,570
the horse is real I mean for software

2768
02:14:17,368 --> 02:14:24,238
for simulation something like

2769
02:14:18,569 --> 02:14:25,248
Mathematica I don't know I know what you

2770
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:27,029
mean sorry

2771
02:14:25,248 --> 02:14:30,208
shark and x3 do you think it's possible

2772
02:14:27,029 --> 02:14:31,529
to turn Webber around I mean you know it

2773
02:14:30,208 --> 02:14:34,198
probably assorted stuff out eventually I

2774
02:14:31,529 --> 02:14:36,478
mean if people ever have the ability to

2775
02:14:34,198 --> 02:14:37,918
compete I don't know I mean one of the

2776
02:14:36,479 --> 02:14:39,899
problems is it's again it's too many

2777
02:14:37,918 --> 02:14:42,658
bundled services that they come together

2778
02:14:39,899 --> 02:14:45,050
it's very hard to disaggregate you know

2779
02:14:42,658 --> 02:14:47,338
like maybe you make a better messenger

2780
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:48,479
then Facebook Messenger but can you

2781
02:14:47,338 --> 02:14:49,588
really compete with Facebook message

2782
02:14:48,479 --> 02:14:52,349
because everyone's already on Facebook

2783
02:14:49,588 --> 02:14:53,698
right things like this I don't know to

2784
02:14:52,349 --> 02:14:55,739
what extent competition will solve the

2785
02:14:53,698 --> 02:14:56,969
problem but it's obvious that like

2786
02:14:55,738 --> 02:14:58,259
pretty much all of these companies you

2787
02:14:56,969 --> 02:14:59,729
could easily make a product that's

2788
02:14:58,260 --> 02:15:01,619
better than the product I just don't

2789
02:14:59,729 --> 02:15:03,588
know to what extent you can succeed in

2790
02:15:01,618 --> 02:15:05,728
the market by making a better product

2791
02:15:03,588 --> 02:15:07,918
you know making a better product in

2792
02:15:05,729 --> 02:15:11,689
Google Drive would be like trivial I

2793
02:15:07,918 --> 02:15:14,368
mean it's it's it's absolutely horrible

2794
02:15:11,689 --> 02:15:18,389
and I you know but I don't know I don't

2795
02:15:14,368 --> 02:15:22,558
know how hard it is to compete I don't

2796
02:15:18,389 --> 02:15:23,668
know it's not my it's not my industry if

2797
02:15:22,559 --> 02:15:26,219
you're an employer which candidate would

2798
02:15:23,668 --> 02:15:30,779
you choose 4.0 GPA with no side project

2799
02:15:26,219 --> 02:15:32,519
2.5 GPA with lots of side projects so in

2800
02:15:30,779 --> 02:15:35,188
my experience I wouldn't care at all

2801
02:15:32,519 --> 02:15:42,239
about the GPA things I don't care about

2802
02:15:35,189 --> 02:15:44,429
GPA what college you went to unless was

2803
02:15:42,238 --> 02:15:47,428
Harvard in which case I might just mark

2804
02:15:44,429 --> 02:15:56,868
you down as a negative but assuming that

2805
02:15:47,429 --> 02:15:59,399
it was not and and like probably like

2806
02:15:56,868 --> 02:16:02,338
whiteboard interview skills right don't

2807
02:15:59,399 --> 02:16:04,559
care about any of those three I do I

2808
02:16:02,338 --> 02:16:06,929
would want to see projects I want to see

2809
02:16:04,559 --> 02:16:09,059
what you've done and I want to interview

2810
02:16:06,929 --> 02:16:11,639
you and ask you about those products at

2811
02:16:09,059 --> 02:16:14,338
a deep level and see how well you're

2812
02:16:11,639 --> 02:16:19,050
able to actually convince me that you

2813
02:16:14,338 --> 02:16:20,849
know them and I try to do that in a way

2814
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:23,070
that's very comfortable so that you're

2815
02:16:20,849 --> 02:16:25,050
not stressed and it doesn't feel like

2816
02:16:23,069 --> 02:16:27,058
I'm pressuring you you know I'm never

2817
02:16:25,050 --> 02:16:29,520
gonna ask you to solve a problem that

2818
02:16:27,059 --> 02:16:33,260
you're unfamiliar with

2819
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:35,340
and I and that's really crucial right

2820
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:37,649
because what I'm interested to know is

2821
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:40,260
given the time you've already spent on

2822
02:16:37,649 --> 02:16:43,199
something did you solve the problems

2823
02:16:40,260 --> 02:16:44,940
then right and did you internalize the

2824
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:46,139
knowledge then that's what I want to

2825
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:47,040
know because that's what you're gonna do

2826
02:16:46,138 --> 02:16:49,500
when you work for me

2827
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:52,080
I'm never gonna come to you in the

2828
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:56,760
middle of the frickin day and be like

2829
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:59,520
hey Bob or whatever can you solve this

2830
02:16:56,760 --> 02:17:04,139
problem on the whiteboard right now like

2831
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:06,060
that that's not a thing and any problem

2832
02:17:04,138 --> 02:17:07,379
it's solvable on a whiteboard in 30

2833
02:17:06,059 --> 02:17:10,829
minutes is a problem we've already

2834
02:17:07,379 --> 02:17:12,629
solved in computer science so it doesn't

2835
02:17:10,829 --> 02:17:16,260
matter right the thing is I need you to

2836
02:17:12,629 --> 02:17:18,119
solve take weeks of thought and the work

2837
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:20,520
I want you to do is typing in a lot of

2838
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:23,579
code that works it's not on a whiteboard

2839
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:26,280
it doesn't have to do with getting a

2840
02:17:23,579 --> 02:17:27,959
slightly faster string sort that doesn't

2841
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:30,060
loop through the array twice or whatever

2842
02:17:27,959 --> 02:17:33,299
stupid idea the Google engineer asked

2843
02:17:30,059 --> 02:17:35,189
you to do on a whiteboard right so don't

2844
02:17:33,299 --> 02:17:37,769
care about any of that it's all bad ways

2845
02:17:35,190 --> 02:17:39,840
to pick an employee and it leads to bad

2846
02:17:37,770 --> 02:17:41,310
software I think in the end because

2847
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:49,319
you're not screening for what you

2848
02:17:41,309 --> 02:17:51,000
actually needed and you know I can't

2849
02:17:49,319 --> 02:17:53,218
speak to why places like Google are

2850
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:55,319
still doing it but you know like I said

2851
02:17:53,218 --> 02:17:56,218
if the proof was in the pudding I'd

2852
02:17:55,319 --> 02:17:58,468
changed my mind

2853
02:17:56,218 --> 02:17:59,789
if Google software worked I'd say their

2854
02:17:58,468 --> 02:18:02,549
interview process must be pretty good

2855
02:17:59,790 --> 02:18:04,800
but Google software is horrible so it

2856
02:18:02,549 --> 02:18:06,239
can't be right I mean or maybe it's

2857
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:07,799
something else maybe they repress good

2858
02:18:06,239 --> 02:18:11,099
something else is bad I couldn't tell

2859
02:18:07,799 --> 02:18:13,679
you but it's pretty clear that what you

2860
02:18:11,099 --> 02:18:16,590
get out of the other end of their entire

2861
02:18:13,679 --> 02:18:18,450
process is very low quality software so

2862
02:18:16,590 --> 02:18:21,329
low quality that it's you know it's

2863
02:18:18,450 --> 02:18:24,030
laughably bad right you can actually get

2864
02:18:21,329 --> 02:18:26,039
distributed file systems from 1970 that

2865
02:18:24,030 --> 02:18:29,130
are faster than Google Drive as far as I

2866
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:31,980
can tell right I remember using BBS's

2867
02:18:29,129 --> 02:18:35,009
that could list the files on the BBS

2868
02:18:31,979 --> 02:18:38,699
over a acoustic coupler moham basically

2869
02:18:35,010 --> 02:18:40,950
faster than Google Drive and they don't

2870
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:42,500
seem to care right so or they care but

2871
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:46,460
can't fix it I don't know

2872
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:48,648
so I just I can't say enough negative

2873
02:18:46,459 --> 02:18:52,039
things about the level of quality that

2874
02:18:48,648 --> 02:18:54,829
comes out of that pipeline and why it's

2875
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:57,380
so low is anyone's guess I'm not an

2876
02:18:54,829 --> 02:18:59,058
institutional analyst so I can't tell

2877
02:18:57,379 --> 02:19:01,549
you why they seem to produce such

2878
02:18:59,058 --> 02:19:04,629
consistently poor quality software but

2879
02:19:01,549 --> 02:19:04,629
you know

2880
02:19:22,010 --> 02:19:25,679
time-traveling hey KC I know you're busy

2881
02:19:24,209 --> 02:19:27,358
and all but can you stand up for me and

2882
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:29,429
reverse this link to list on the left

2883
02:19:27,359 --> 02:19:32,189
foot yeah exactly I mean it's just it's

2884
02:19:29,429 --> 02:19:33,478
silly right it's kind of like if you

2885
02:19:32,189 --> 02:19:35,609
were like well we need to do job

2886
02:19:33,478 --> 02:19:38,188
interviews for a plumber right that's

2887
02:19:35,609 --> 02:19:40,679
what we're hiring and they come in and

2888
02:19:38,189 --> 02:19:42,870
they're like okay yeah so what we need

2889
02:19:40,679 --> 02:19:50,779
you to do for a plumber is is like stand

2890
02:19:42,870 --> 02:19:55,710
up and draw for me on the whiteboard

2891
02:19:50,779 --> 02:19:59,130
like what the crud like cross section of

2892
02:19:55,709 --> 02:20:01,589
a pipe would be if the outside was this

2893
02:19:59,129 --> 02:20:05,009
thick and the inside was this or any

2894
02:20:01,590 --> 02:20:07,049
like that does it you don't even really

2895
02:20:05,010 --> 02:20:09,870
do that when you're plumbing right it's

2896
02:20:07,049 --> 02:20:12,420
like plumbing is not that activity and

2897
02:20:09,870 --> 02:20:14,790
maybe you could argue once in a while

2898
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:20,359
you sort of need to do this thing but

2899
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:23,670
like it's really tangential right and

2900
02:20:20,359 --> 02:20:25,380
again like I'm inclined to sort of say

2901
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:27,840
that that interview process in general

2902
02:20:25,379 --> 02:20:29,579
does actually cause a real problem and

2903
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:32,478
it leads to poor suffer because what

2904
02:20:29,579 --> 02:20:41,568
you're doing is putting an emphasis on

2905
02:20:32,478 --> 02:20:51,688
sort of like myopic focus on quickly

2906
02:20:41,568 --> 02:20:54,510
doing existing tricks mental tricks that

2907
02:20:51,689 --> 02:20:56,460
is exactly not what gets you a well

2908
02:20:54,510 --> 02:20:58,109
working system that can list eight

2909
02:20:56,459 --> 02:21:02,068
hundred files in less than a minute

2910
02:20:58,109 --> 02:21:03,809
right the problem with Google Drive is

2911
02:21:02,068 --> 02:21:07,648
not that somebody didn't know how to

2912
02:21:03,809 --> 02:21:12,449
sort the names the slowest sort in the

2913
02:21:07,648 --> 02:21:14,818
world an Ncube sort can sort eight

2914
02:21:12,450 --> 02:21:17,250
hundred names probably faster than

2915
02:21:14,818 --> 02:21:19,590
google drivers right now so that is not

2916
02:21:17,250 --> 02:21:21,840
the problem the problem is that what you

2917
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:24,978
needed is people capable of writing

2918
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:27,389
actual software and that is different

2919
02:21:24,978 --> 02:21:29,459
algorithms are not the hard part of

2920
02:21:27,389 --> 02:21:32,159
software they haven't been the hard part

2921
02:21:29,459 --> 02:21:35,489
of software for about two decades right

2922
02:21:32,159 --> 02:21:39,119
and so screening for people who under

2923
02:21:35,489 --> 02:21:41,459
and algorithms is largely useless anyone

2924
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:43,561
who wrote a program incorrectly if

2925
02:21:41,459 --> 02:21:45,959
Google drive's problem was that the

2926
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:48,720
person who wrote it use an Ncube sort I

2927
02:21:45,959 --> 02:21:52,680
can fix that tomorrow in 30 seconds

2928
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:54,869
right well no in 30 minutes right all I

2929
02:21:52,681 --> 02:21:57,630
do is go into the sort and replace it

2930
02:21:54,870 --> 02:21:59,101
with one that works but when you hire

2931
02:21:57,629 --> 02:22:01,529
people who think that the way to program

2932
02:21:59,101 --> 02:22:03,150
is you just take like the Python script

2933
02:22:01,530 --> 02:22:04,891
and you hook it up to the thing that

2934
02:22:03,149 --> 02:22:06,140
does left pad and then you do the blob

2935
02:22:04,890 --> 02:22:08,609
on the block right

2936
02:22:06,140 --> 02:22:11,940
who cares if that person knows how to do

2937
02:22:08,610 --> 02:22:14,851
a login sort and login sort who cares

2938
02:22:11,940 --> 02:22:17,940
they've spent so much of the computer's

2939
02:22:14,851 --> 02:22:19,290
resources doing nothing that it doesn't

2940
02:22:17,940 --> 02:22:22,409
matter how fast they can make it do

2941
02:22:19,290 --> 02:22:24,830
something because the something 2.1

2942
02:22:22,409 --> 02:22:28,530
percent of the time and the nothing took

2943
02:22:24,829 --> 02:22:30,840
99.9 right so now you end up with a

2944
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:33,540
Google Drive that's sitting there for 70

2945
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:36,299
years going through god knows what

2946
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:38,820
gyrations because of their distributed

2947
02:22:36,299 --> 02:22:41,789
file system server has to spin up the

2948
02:22:38,819 --> 02:22:44,279
Python instance that knows how to figure

2949
02:22:41,790 --> 02:22:46,980
out which of these twelve wins matched

2950
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:48,780
to the user grid which then goes and

2951
02:22:46,979 --> 02:22:52,049
queries the security system for the

2952
02:22:48,780 --> 02:22:53,971
ticket that was implemented by some

2953
02:22:52,049 --> 02:22:56,069
other thing because we had to junction

2954
02:22:53,970 --> 02:22:57,840
together the thing that does Google apps

2955
02:22:56,069 --> 02:23:00,209
versus the thing that does the personal

2956
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:03,870
version of Google and oh by the way that

2957
02:23:00,209 --> 02:23:05,399
runs on ipv6 but this was an ipv4 so we

2958
02:23:03,870 --> 02:23:07,681
had to run the like thing that does the

2959
02:23:05,399 --> 02:23:10,020
translation layer to mat oh and by the

2960
02:23:07,681 --> 02:23:12,271
way that thing has a bug in it so it

2961
02:23:10,021 --> 02:23:14,489
actually has to redo the TCP connection

2962
02:23:12,271 --> 02:23:16,409
every time because it accidentally leaks

2963
02:23:14,489 --> 02:23:18,569
that handle and we forgot about that

2964
02:23:16,409 --> 02:23:20,729
and so now that thing we just restart

2965
02:23:18,569 --> 02:23:25,279
and and eventually you're somehow at the

2966
02:23:20,729 --> 02:23:28,020
point we're taking 800 file directory

2967
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:29,340
you know the architecture is just forget

2968
02:23:28,021 --> 02:23:31,021
it like we can't there's nothing we can

2969
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:33,210
do and the date is already stored across

2970
02:23:31,021 --> 02:23:34,620
12 different data centers and you know

2971
02:23:33,209 --> 02:23:36,359
just forget it there's nothing I can do

2972
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:40,590
you hire me to fix that and I'm like I

2973
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:42,360
can't okay right I can't fix it because

2974
02:23:40,590 --> 02:23:43,890
it's too far gone and it's not something

2975
02:23:42,360 --> 02:23:47,989
that's ever going to produce a reliable

2976
02:23:43,890 --> 02:23:47,989
like you know experience for the user

2977
02:24:05,469 --> 02:24:07,989
praying about toilet question but why

2978
02:24:07,059 --> 02:24:10,719
does it feel like you would enjoy

2979
02:24:07,989 --> 02:24:15,090
knitting um I would not enjoy anything

2980
02:24:10,719 --> 02:24:17,739
sorry I don't don't care for knitting

2981
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:20,100
highly repetitive processes are tough

2982
02:24:17,739 --> 02:24:20,100
for me

2983
02:24:40,329 --> 02:24:44,059
people probably make this are for a slow

2984
02:24:42,409 --> 02:24:44,899
and crappy on purpose not be fired I

2985
02:24:44,059 --> 02:24:48,079
don't think so

2986
02:24:44,899 --> 02:24:52,729
I don't think so I think it's a skill

2987
02:24:48,079 --> 02:24:55,430
it's a skill gap it's a skill gap right

2988
02:24:52,729 --> 02:24:57,889
I mean another way to look at it is

2989
02:24:55,430 --> 02:25:01,790
suppose someone went to school for

2990
02:24:57,889 --> 02:25:03,379
mechanical engineering right and I

2991
02:25:01,790 --> 02:25:05,360
screened you on mechanical engineering

2992
02:25:03,379 --> 02:25:07,639
knowledge so like tell me how

2993
02:25:05,360 --> 02:25:12,200
load-bearing this beam has to be right

2994
02:25:07,639 --> 02:25:14,389
and then I take you know thirty of those

2995
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:16,220
mechanical engineers and I put them on a

2996
02:25:14,389 --> 02:25:19,309
construction site and I say build this a

2997
02:25:16,219 --> 02:25:19,879
scraper right it's probably an epic

2998
02:25:19,309 --> 02:25:22,189
disaster

2999
02:25:19,879 --> 02:25:24,409
because they have no idea they don't

3000
02:25:22,190 --> 02:25:26,840
even know how to operate a crane right

3001
02:25:24,409 --> 02:25:29,299
and that to me is like the Google

3002
02:25:26,840 --> 02:25:31,069
interview process it's interviewing

3003
02:25:29,299 --> 02:25:32,629
people for a skill that's unrelated to

3004
02:25:31,069 --> 02:25:36,049
the skill they actually need to do their

3005
02:25:32,629 --> 02:25:38,270
job right and so the problem with that

3006
02:25:36,049 --> 02:25:40,129
is then you get people who may or may

3007
02:25:38,271 --> 02:25:42,710
not know how to do the job some

3008
02:25:40,129 --> 02:25:45,379
mechanical engineers will probably make

3009
02:25:42,709 --> 02:25:46,729
great carpenters or already know how to

3010
02:25:45,379 --> 02:25:47,329
do carpentry because they did it in

3011
02:25:46,729 --> 02:25:50,899
their spare time

3012
02:25:47,329 --> 02:25:55,039
others have no idea don't want to know

3013
02:25:50,899 --> 02:25:56,600
will never learn and they just are

3014
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:58,940
useless at building a building right

3015
02:25:56,600 --> 02:26:00,290
they were they could be used to design

3016
02:25:58,940 --> 02:26:03,649
the building but they can't build it

3017
02:26:00,290 --> 02:26:06,170
right and to me that's the problem when

3018
02:26:03,649 --> 02:26:08,329
you interview on an unrelated skill you

3019
02:26:06,170 --> 02:26:11,629
end up with workers who may or may not

3020
02:26:08,329 --> 02:26:13,700
have that skill I may or may not have

3021
02:26:11,629 --> 02:26:16,489
the skill you need right you have skill

3022
02:26:13,700 --> 02:26:18,170
a which is developing useful good

3023
02:26:16,489 --> 02:26:21,139
software that works at a high quality

3024
02:26:18,170 --> 02:26:22,879
level you have skill B which is trick

3025
02:26:21,139 --> 02:26:25,579
problems on a white board if you

3026
02:26:22,879 --> 02:26:27,289
optimize for skill B you have no idea if

3027
02:26:25,579 --> 02:26:29,329
you've got skill a sometimes you might

3028
02:26:27,290 --> 02:26:31,040
sometimes you might not you could argue

3029
02:26:29,329 --> 02:26:36,069
that B correlates with a a little bit

3030
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:36,070
and it might a little bit but not a lot

3031
02:26:43,989 --> 02:26:46,629
where's some research to learn grab

3032
02:26:45,549 --> 02:26:50,409
storing how much math is really

3033
02:26:46,629 --> 02:26:52,449
necessary a lot of math I'm not sure

3034
02:26:50,409 --> 02:26:54,909
what the best resources are but you need

3035
02:26:52,450 --> 02:26:56,500
a lot of math graphics programming in

3036
02:26:54,909 --> 02:26:58,000
particular requires a lot of math if

3037
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:59,139
you're not comfortable you don't really

3038
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,920
want to be a graphics programmer right

3039
02:26:59,139 --> 02:27:02,978
there's probably other types of

3040
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:04,299
programming you can do a lot of web

3041
02:27:02,978 --> 02:27:06,969
programming sorts of stuff doesn't

3042
02:27:04,299 --> 02:27:09,539
really require math because a lot of the

3043
02:27:06,969 --> 02:27:12,909
math is done for you and somewhere else

3044
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:15,250
grabs programming your your write up and

3045
02:27:12,909 --> 02:27:18,010
up in the math if the math is is front

3046
02:27:15,250 --> 02:27:21,540
centers so if you don't want to learn

3047
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:21,540
math don't be a graphics programmer

3048
02:27:40,750 --> 02:27:44,260
if not with Dinoco race how would you

3049
02:27:42,579 --> 02:27:45,639
start dynamic the growing data when you

3050
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:47,738
can't predict how much memory you will

3051
02:27:45,639 --> 02:27:50,079
need and need to store it so the

3052
02:27:47,738 --> 02:27:53,109
handmade hero temporary memory concept

3053
02:27:50,079 --> 02:27:54,579
doesn't solve the problem I mean again

3054
02:27:53,109 --> 02:27:57,220
can you give me an example like what are

3055
02:27:54,579 --> 02:28:00,879
you doing and then I could tell you how

3056
02:27:57,219 --> 02:28:03,728
I might approach it have you or would

3057
02:28:00,879 --> 02:28:09,250
you ever use go - um I guess what I

3058
02:28:03,728 --> 02:28:12,099
would say is I was taught programming at

3059
02:28:09,250 --> 02:28:14,648
a time when nobody knows go - as a

3060
02:28:12,100 --> 02:28:18,068
result I don't use go - I don't know

3061
02:28:14,648 --> 02:28:20,170
anything that's good I think it's

3062
02:28:18,068 --> 02:28:22,629
probably a cognitive deficiency for me

3063
02:28:20,170 --> 02:28:25,930
that I don't use go - and I think it's

3064
02:28:22,629 --> 02:28:30,599
probably a language design deficiency of

3065
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:35,200
C and C++ that they don't have a more

3066
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:36,790
broad idea of of how go-to integrates

3067
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:42,189
into code right because it's pretty

3068
02:28:36,790 --> 02:28:44,670
simplistic so I don't use go to but I

3069
02:28:42,189 --> 02:28:48,460
should it's maybe the way I would put it

3070
02:28:44,670 --> 02:28:50,670
and the reason I say that is because the

3071
02:28:48,459 --> 02:28:52,509
older I get the more I appreciate that

3072
02:28:50,670 --> 02:28:53,500
programming should be about telling the

3073
02:28:52,510 --> 02:28:55,300
cpu what to do

3074
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:59,379
it's not about screwing around with your

3075
02:28:55,299 --> 02:29:03,099
language and the only thing a cpu does

3076
02:28:59,379 --> 02:29:05,978
is go - there is no other thing a CPU

3077
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:07,479
does there is the concept of a function

3078
02:29:05,978 --> 02:29:10,000
call in the sense that there is a go to

3079
02:29:07,478 --> 02:29:11,559
that automatically pushes a return value

3080
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:17,049
on the stack but that's kind of an

3081
02:29:11,559 --> 02:29:20,859
optimization right but go - is it like

3082
02:29:17,049 --> 02:29:23,199
loops there's no loops on a CPU there's

3083
02:29:20,859 --> 02:29:26,979
go twos right there's tests and jump

3084
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:28,270
right and there's no switch statements

3085
02:29:26,978 --> 02:29:30,699
on a CPU

3086
02:29:28,270 --> 02:29:33,159
there's just jump and you can do a

3087
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:34,779
relative like a variable jump if you

3088
02:29:33,159 --> 02:29:36,129
really get fancy but compilers don't

3089
02:29:34,779 --> 02:29:37,659
ever generate that as far as I know so

3090
02:29:36,129 --> 02:29:41,019
it's just test and jump test and jump

3091
02:29:37,659 --> 02:29:42,549
test and jump test and jump so 99% of

3092
02:29:41,020 --> 02:29:43,560
everything you typed into a computer is

3093
02:29:42,549 --> 02:29:48,608
test and jump

3094
02:29:43,559 --> 02:29:52,889
you know conditional while for do all of

3095
02:29:48,609 --> 02:29:54,630
these switch tests and jump right

3096
02:29:52,889 --> 02:29:56,879
so the fact that we would consider go to

3097
02:29:54,629 --> 02:29:58,528
somehow weird or anomalous is kind of

3098
02:29:56,879 --> 02:30:00,358
ridiculous because it's happening all

3099
02:29:58,529 --> 02:30:02,579
the time and why you wouldn't want

3100
02:30:00,359 --> 02:30:04,350
access to that I don't know so I

3101
02:30:02,579 --> 02:30:06,568
consider it deficient that I don't use

3102
02:30:04,350 --> 02:30:09,779
go to I wish that I had not developed my

3103
02:30:06,568 --> 02:30:11,100
style of programming at that time and at

3104
02:30:09,779 --> 02:30:12,750
some point I probably will investigate

3105
02:30:11,100 --> 02:30:14,279
it more probably when I actually go

3106
02:30:12,750 --> 02:30:15,600
ahead and just start programming my own

3107
02:30:14,279 --> 02:30:19,140
language at some point which is kind of

3108
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:22,068
inevitable I suppose I will make go

3109
02:30:19,139 --> 02:30:22,068
Tuesday first class

3110
02:30:33,659 --> 02:30:37,110
switches can in some cases generate

3111
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:40,891
indirect jumps yeah I mean switches can

3112
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:43,681
in in theory if your compiler was super

3113
02:30:40,890 --> 02:30:46,859
crazy you could even have a switch

3114
02:30:43,681 --> 02:30:52,980
statement that padded the cases and it

3115
02:30:46,860 --> 02:30:58,620
could jump with a with expression right

3116
02:30:52,979 --> 02:31:00,569
like a computed jump so they're like the

3117
02:30:58,620 --> 02:31:02,730
nature of a switch statement is such

3118
02:31:00,569 --> 02:31:05,550
that you could do things very fancy a

3119
02:31:02,729 --> 02:31:07,170
lot of compilers don't do that a lot of

3120
02:31:05,550 --> 02:31:09,359
compilers yet either just have test and

3121
02:31:07,170 --> 02:31:12,810
jump or they make a table and load from

3122
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:14,190
the table and jump but they only do that

3123
02:31:12,810 --> 02:31:15,569
in certain circumstances like if they

3124
02:31:14,190 --> 02:31:19,681
can actually guarantee that's fairly

3125
02:31:15,569 --> 02:31:22,879
dense probably I want to say not sure

3126
02:31:19,681 --> 02:31:22,880
exactly what they use for there

3127
02:31:34,709 --> 02:31:41,199
will you be an early adopter of ji I

3128
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:42,129
don't know I may be near experience what

3129
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:44,470
do you think are good ways to manage

3130
02:31:42,129 --> 02:31:46,029
tougher projects I don't know I don't

3131
02:31:44,469 --> 02:31:47,319
really deal with large-scale project

3132
02:31:46,030 --> 02:31:55,690
management I'm a kind of wrong when they

3133
02:31:47,319 --> 02:31:57,399
ask argh or the dynamic array example in

3134
02:31:55,690 --> 02:31:59,500
one a list of active connections on a

3135
02:31:57,399 --> 02:32:01,810
server to an array of enemies in a game

3136
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:05,709
well in either of those it's trivial

3137
02:32:01,810 --> 02:32:08,079
right on a 64-bit computer just put

3138
02:32:05,709 --> 02:32:12,969
those at base addresses that have you

3139
02:32:08,079 --> 02:32:14,860
know 4 gigabytes of unused address space

3140
02:32:12,969 --> 02:32:20,379
following them and just grow them as

3141
02:32:14,860 --> 02:32:22,450
necessary done right you never need to

3142
02:32:20,379 --> 02:32:24,689
reallocate anything you just commit more

3143
02:32:22,450 --> 02:32:24,690
pages

3144
02:32:33,239 --> 02:32:37,079
if you have several unpredictably

3145
02:32:35,250 --> 02:32:39,120
growing dynamic arrays saying a math

3146
02:32:37,079 --> 02:32:40,829
simulation how would you separate by a

3147
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:42,329
large distance in a memory no order your

3148
02:32:40,829 --> 02:32:43,680
pile blocks on top of each other what

3149
02:32:42,329 --> 02:32:47,010
does the caste refer is it even a

3150
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:48,389
concern I've never done anything exactly

3151
02:32:47,010 --> 02:32:51,180
like that so basically you're saying

3152
02:32:48,389 --> 02:32:52,609
like well I've got so random crap coming

3153
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:58,530
in from a user it could be anything

3154
02:32:52,610 --> 02:33:01,409
right that I don't know what I would

3155
02:32:58,530 --> 02:33:03,540
probably prefer I would have to see what

3156
02:33:01,409 --> 02:33:09,809
kinds of things shake out from actually

3157
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:12,870
trying it first right because it depends

3158
02:33:09,809 --> 02:33:16,109
if I see that the sizes tend to be used

3159
02:33:12,870 --> 02:33:19,260
are similar right so if what you tend to

3160
02:33:16,110 --> 02:33:22,560
get there is like well you know we get a

3161
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:24,750
pretty even distribution 10 elements 100

3162
02:33:22,559 --> 02:33:26,309
elements 50 elements whatever and

3163
02:33:24,750 --> 02:33:30,629
they're just kind of random I might just

3164
02:33:26,309 --> 02:33:34,409
use buckets you know I got array chunks

3165
02:33:30,629 --> 02:33:37,349
0 to 32 array chunks 0 to 60 for array

3166
02:33:34,409 --> 02:33:41,209
chunks 0 to 128 you know whatever and I

3167
02:33:37,350 --> 02:33:43,860
allocate and just give those back as

3168
02:33:41,209 --> 02:33:46,289
like I keep a free list of ones of

3169
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:49,319
certain sizes quickly right so just

3170
02:33:46,290 --> 02:33:51,960
basically you know a standard sort of

3171
02:33:49,319 --> 02:33:53,489
general-purpose allocator but that's

3172
02:33:51,959 --> 02:33:56,459
geared towards what I need would

3173
02:33:53,489 --> 02:33:58,789
probably all I would do anything large

3174
02:33:56,459 --> 02:34:01,859
so anything that's gonna be like

3175
02:33:58,790 --> 02:34:04,740
multiple 4k pages I just probably map

3176
02:34:01,860 --> 02:34:07,800
that one by itself through the OS right

3177
02:34:04,739 --> 02:34:10,440
and then free it through the rest when

3178
02:34:07,799 --> 02:34:12,239
I'm done yeah I'm saying because those

3179
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:15,030
are so huge that just filling them up is

3180
02:34:12,239 --> 02:34:17,670
gonna be take a while anyway

3181
02:34:15,030 --> 02:34:19,739
so I'm not so concerned about avoiding

3182
02:34:17,670 --> 02:34:25,370
round-tripping to the OS to actually

3183
02:34:19,739 --> 02:34:25,369
change the memory map I'm saying

3184
02:34:29,829 --> 02:34:42,680
alright my lord that was a lot of

3185
02:34:32,809 --> 02:34:54,170
questions all right let's close it down

3186
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:55,579
people thank you everybody for joining

3187
02:34:54,170 --> 02:34:57,559
me Philip sort of handmade here at so a

3188
02:34:55,579 --> 02:34:59,809
pleasure coding with you as always if

3189
02:34:57,559 --> 02:35:01,250
you would like to follow along a series

3190
02:34:59,809 --> 02:35:04,789
at home you can always peer to the game

3191
02:35:01,250 --> 02:35:05,870
at handmade hero dot o-r-g it comes with

3192
02:35:04,790 --> 02:35:07,580
source code so if you want to follow

3193
02:35:05,870 --> 02:35:08,840
along with it at home you can do that

3194
02:35:07,579 --> 02:35:10,370
maybe you want to play with that

3195
02:35:08,840 --> 02:35:13,309
lighting see if you can beat me to a

3196
02:35:10,370 --> 02:35:15,470
good way of encoding light in there

3197
02:35:13,309 --> 02:35:17,148
dynamically we've got some interesting

3198
