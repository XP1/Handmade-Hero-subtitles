00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,799
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,400
hero

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,719
lighting edition uh we are going to

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,519
today take a look at

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,199
the last sort of the last thing that i

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,960
think is a quality issue with the

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,800
lighting we

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,199
just kind of have

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,439
um a

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,118
we we've we've got some pretty good

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
stuff here uh

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,960
it looks really good the lighting i

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,679
think is high quality but

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,000
when we look at just right around single

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:38,479
bright light sources

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,480
it's just not a very high quality um

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,599
a high quality result

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:46,319
it's very like squary and also a little

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,480
bit uh irregular and this is the best

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,520
case scenario when we've cranked up sort

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,319
of

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,079
uh the bounce level so this is you know

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,238
that this is a number that we could

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,920
easily do on the on the gpu right now

25
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,558
we're off cpu side only so it's a little

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,399
bit slower frame rate than it should be

27
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,079
if we were going to try and roll out

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,239
something

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,118
like this exactly but

30
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,438
um

31
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,680
you know even even if we want to talk

32
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,879
about just cpu side what we can do right

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
now

34
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,478
it's actually quite good if we drop this

35
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,079
down

36
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,159
you know to like eight

37
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,519
uh instead of 16

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,560
samples

39
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,560
you know raise per per texel there

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,079
you can see that we get a really smooth

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,320
frame rate here

42
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,359
uh and it actually looks quite good

43
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,839
everywhere else so so just

44
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,519
those small moving light sources right

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,759
they're just not

46
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,759
good enough in my opinion

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,599
and they definitely have that like made

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,599
with unity personal learning edition

49
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,478
kind of vibe to them right

50
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,199
um and it would be nice you know because

51
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,438
the idea here is to do some reasonable

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,399
quality engine programming it would be

53
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,478
nice if we could get uh rid of that

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,920
because it's it makes the rest of the

55
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,799
lighting not look as good right it's

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,200
like a it's a quality

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,118
uh it's like a polished quality step

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,840
down you know what i'm saying

59
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,239
uh and so i guess i would say what we

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,800
want here i think is to look at ways to

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,439
mitigate that and we looked at some

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,920
uh ways of trying to improve it last

63
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,598
time and they really weren't sufficient

64
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,238
and i don't think they're going to work

65
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,439
long term so i i thought about it over

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,200
the week

67
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,039
as i often do kind of just like in the

68
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,000
back of my head while i'm doing regular

69
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:35,280
work sometimes i think uh about handmade

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,759
hero stuff uh because it just pops in

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,919
and what i was thinking is that

72
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,518
i originally said maybe once you know

73
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,000
you you probably remember me actually

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,480
literally saying this i was like what if

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
we instead of you know everything right

76
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,079
now

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,080
light probes cast rays and they hit

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,519
things in this case there's a light

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
hovering above the hero's head that we

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,680
were using for testing right now

81
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,000
uh and the

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
the rays from the various light probes

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,919
they hit that thing

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,360
and that's how they know uh that there's

85
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,719
a that there's light that they should

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,680
represent

87
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,560
and that works quite nice for diffuse

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,800
like gather right

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,800
uh

90
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,439
they in all of these scenarios when you

91
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,920
look at where the light's getting

92
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:27,039
gathered everywhere else um this

93
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,119
actually looks quite good right

94
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,318
and the reason that it looks quite good

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,840
is because of the exact inverse of what

96
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,079
normally happens

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,000
with forward lighting

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,760
like the kind you would see if you just

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
use light source with shadow maps

100
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,239
what you see is the lighting quality

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
looks very high looks very convincing

102
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,840
and good

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,959
in areas where there's a lot of light

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
coming from

105
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,759
a lot of different directions

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,840
that's what makes indirect like this

107
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,158
global illumination

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,560
it's what it does really well what it

109
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,239
doesn't do very well is that part where

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,158
you just have the direct light source

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,280
shining

112
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,798
right on

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,799
a particular thing um

114
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,879
and that is this scenario uh in a

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,439
nutshell right what we've got here is a

116
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,240
small fast-moving light source

117
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:27,120
um and it just doesn't produce the same

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,800
kind of like nice results uh that you

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,959
would expect

120
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,280
there's also a fair bit of flicker that

121
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,159
comes from these lights because again

122
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,399
since they uh since it is a small light

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,360
and it's in a wide area and there's not

124
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,000
much other light around right

125
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,520
you get more of that sampling noise we

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,918
could try to take that out with better

127
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,120
sampling uh more focused sampling

128
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,319
various things

129
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,439
but to me that is actually not a problem

130
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,040
so to me that you can just chalk up

131
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,040
um too

132
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,600
effectively like

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,600
oh that's just you know

134
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,919
the lights are a little flickery right

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
it looks atmospheric almost

136
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,159
so to me i'm not really concerned if

137
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,680
that was the problem if that was the

138
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,199
only problem we were looking at i'd call

139
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
it done i'm like i'm fine with that as

140
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,160
an artistic thing

141
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,240
i'm not worried about that at all it

142
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,000
does not ruin the look of the game at

143
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,918
all to me what ruins the look of the

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
game for me is this

145
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,439
this bit right

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560
um

147
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,519
that is just not quite good enough to me

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,000
it just looks very square and weird

149
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,599
and more importantly in a way that's not

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,759
actually the case

151
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
anywhere else so you know when you look

152
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,600
at these kind of larger more diffused

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,080
lights over here

154
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,160
um and you know elsewhere in the game

155
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,959
you just don't get like that's not

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,160
happening right uh everything else looks

157
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,159
softer it looks nicer it looks cleaner

158
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,600
and then you get into you know to here

159
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,400
and it just looks really ugly and square

160
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
so

161
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:06,159
that's really the thing that concerns me

162
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:08,079
and so what i said last time

163
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,639
well maybe one thing we could do is we

164
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,399
could try rasterizing light sources

165
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,600
forward like

166
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,439
instead of of strictly you know being uh

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,560
um

168
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,079
you know you know

169
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,120
instead of exclusively having light

170
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,519
probes cast rays backwards and hit light

171
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,240
sources and sample them

172
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,799
what if we did a forward pass where each

173
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,680
light source would walk through

174
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,160
uh the squares it overlapped

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,959
and it would write its lighting directly

176
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,639
in

177
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,638
so it wouldn't have to

178
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,759
uh actually

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,199
it wouldn't need to do that part of the

180
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,479
process

181
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,478
where it you know

182
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,799
we wouldn't need to worry about the fact

183
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,160
that it's hard to sample a small light

184
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
source

185
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
because that's basically what's going on

186
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,478
here it's like this light is like

187
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,318
missing

188
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,478
entirely like none of you know we're not

189
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,199
getting any light contribution here

190
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,360
not because this light might wouldn't

191
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,840
necessarily contribute here

192
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,080
but just because this light source

193
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,318
itself

194
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,359
is probably never getting hit by any of

195
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,080
the rays just accidentally right

196
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,280
so even though uh that light source and

197
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,800
i can make that a little bit more

198
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,918
explicit like if i go in here um

199
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,280
and

200
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,038
we

201
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,038
you know

202
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,079
turn on the spatial grid

203
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,680
um

204
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,079
drawing

205
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,720
uh and then wait for it to like the

206
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,800
compiler to finish and there you go

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,120
um we should be able to turn on drawing

208
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,439
of light sources and see them you know

209
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,720
what i'm saying and uh

210
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,719
honestly i guess i don't know

211
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,509
not sure like exactly what we're drawing

212
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,639
here um

213
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:02,639
[Music]

214
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,918
so i think that's actually the emitter

215
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,199
right that light i think is actually the

216
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,038
emitter uh it's it's quite low to the

217
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,400
ground that's probably another reason

218
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,038
why these things are not seeing it

219
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,038
easily if it was up higher uh that might

220
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,120
not be a problem i wonder what it would

221
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,439
look like up higher this is not really

222
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,280
what i was expecting to see

223
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,038
um

224
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,878
but i guess that's where we placed it

225
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,319
maybe we should fix that first because

226
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,918
that's also maybe a little misleading

227
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,000
since i thought

228
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,199
it was a little higher up but either way

229
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,479
still i think we're going to have the

230
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,759
same problem it's just that's

231
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,320
interesting i wonder if that's why it's

232
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,480
a little bit more exaggerated uh than

233
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,959
the other light sources

234
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,080
maybe it is i don't know let's find out

235
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:53,039
um so in here when we add the the light

236
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,480
this is us adding the light here

237
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,480
and um

238
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,679
yeah i guess you know normally you would

239
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,360
probably expect to have seen something

240
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,479
elevating it off the ground like like

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,200
here

242
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,720
uh and and we didn't so when the player

243
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,440
got added it didn't it didn't actually

244
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,480
do that um so that's interesting uh so

245
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,399
so now

246
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,920
uh it should be a little higher up i

247
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,559
think yeah there we go it's like you

248
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,559
know on the on the hero's head right

249
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,559
uh and we could we could put it even

250
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,559
maybe a little higher than that

251
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,599
um hmm

252
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,359
so that is a bit interesting i

253
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,839
i guess that was somewhat surprising i

254
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,159
wasn't necessarily expecting that

255
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,600
um

256
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,519
that's interesting so if we now look

257
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,200
actually you can see that that the fact

258
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
that it was lower to the ground was

259
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,560
actually a pretty big deal with the in

260
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
terms of

261
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,719
how square the lighting was uh which is

262
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,920
interesting

263
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,040
and so i guess maybe that was a bit

264
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,399
misleading

265
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,838
like uh i didn't quite realize that that

266
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,159
we had

267
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,160
um

268
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,120
i didn't quite realize that that was

269
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,959
contributing as much as it was it

270
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,759
actually looks a lot better

271
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,599
uh in in this way

272
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,639
maybe you know if that was it you

273
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,959
wouldn't really be that concerned so

274
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,958
um

275
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,440
gosh i don't know does that mean we

276
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,360
should just move on like that would be

277
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,959
fine developing the game that way and

278
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,278
then maybe i still do a little bit of

279
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,838
fixing at the end but that's

280
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,759
that's surprisingly good i guess is what

281
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:34,000
i would say compared to what we thought

282
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:36,159
we had which was not as good um

283
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,078
and and uh yeah i i don't really know

284
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,439
what to make of that i guess that's just

285
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,799
because when it's sitting on the ground

286
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,959
like that

287
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,639
uh you have a lot of

288
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,518
there's quite a difference in how it's

289
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,199
going to be hit it's it's a bit strange

290
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,078
but you know i guess i could believe

291
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,278
that

292
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:52,719
i

293
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,879
all right let's

294
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,200
hmm okay

295
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,200
well

296
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,399
um huh

297
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,759
uh

298
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,958
i don't know

299
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
yeah all right

300
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,599
so so

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,440
do we just say that's good enough for

302
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,759
now then i don't know

303
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,800
uh it's still a bit square right i mean

304
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:25,439
it's not it's not fabulous right um but

305
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:27,120
but it's a lot better than it was so hmm

306
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,800
well

307
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,720
that's a tough one

308
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,319
uh i i would i would classify that

309
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,879
as a tough one

310
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,879
and i'm not sure what to make of it um

311
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,759
maybe we just

312
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,199
gosh

313
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,360
i mean maybe we just call that good

314
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,040
enough for now

315
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,879
i mean i feel like that's more than good

316
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,559
enough to do the rest of the game with

317
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,278
uh and then we could you know we could

318
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,399
do

319
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:07,600
before shipping maybe some more cleanup

320
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,519
of it um

321
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,360
i added a light to the glove here

322
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,639
you still get a fair bit of lag on the

323
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
glove but

324
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,720
well

325
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,480
yeah and it still is a bit square right

326
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,480
i mean it's not great

327
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,040
so you know there is that

328
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,120
um

329
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,838
so i guess i'm a little bit torn i i

330
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,120
don't know now should i pursue this a

331
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,079
little bit further or is that good

332
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,078
enough

333
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,078
and

334
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:36,719
uh yeah this is there's no tone mapping

335
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,639
um on right now tone mapping i think in

336
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,879
theory when we add tone mapping i think

337
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,799
it will actually improve

338
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,039
the perception of how the lighting is i

339
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,958
think i don't know that that's true but

340
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,039
it might so that might give us a little

341
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,599
more i don't know that it will

342
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,360
fundamentally fix the squariness

343
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
um

344
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,278
it might uh

345
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,560
i don't know i mean we could try it it's

346
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,958
certainly not that

347
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,599
difficult to try

348
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,039
but yeah wow okay well i'm just i'm just

349
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,000
not sure that wasn't what i was

350
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,078
expecting to find uh i do wonder so if

351
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,159
the the glove

352
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,239
floats above the ground a little bit uh

353
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,559
if we added the light if we push the

354
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,639
light of the glove up what does that do

355
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,119
to it because i don't know

356
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,600
um what that does either so i'm going to

357
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,560
take a look but yeah gosh i just i i

358
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,560
don't know i i really couldn't tell you

359
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,559
um

360
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,198
uh

361
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,519
that's really a tough call

362
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:37,519
um

363
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,800
i guess i would say like i don't know

364
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:49,198
it's still a open question to me like if

365
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,439
some of that squareness

366
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,559
can be uh

367
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
repaired

368
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,759
and

369
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,760
you know i don't know

370
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,759
um

371
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,839
all right i guess here's what here's

372
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:14,399
what i'll say since i don't really know

373
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,760
maybe what we should do is

374
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,240
actually go ahead and do the tone

375
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,240
mapping

376
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,320
uh

377
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,720
and put in some

378
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,639
put in some semblance of like

379
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,278
what we would expect to have happen is

380
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,600
sort of like a final

381
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,360
rendering pass like something that's

382
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,800
going to take

383
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,120
and

384
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:40,120
you know produce an output

385
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,120
um

386
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,518
yeah you know i mean

387
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:52,679
that seems like maybe the best idea is

388
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,679
to just go ahead and do that um

389
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,559
i mean the reason i say that is just

390
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,518
because we know we need to probably do

391
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,278
that

392
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,759
you know we we know that tone mapping is

393
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,759
not a huge deal and it will improve the

394
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,000
look of the game so we probably would

395
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,360
want to do it

396
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,519
and

397
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,440
i guess i don't can't think of a reason

398
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:26,240
not to do that

399
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,240
so maybe we just do that um and

400
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,320
you know i i guess i don't know which

401
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,120
tone mapping i want to do uh i don't not

402
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,800
being someone who

403
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,480
really does this

404
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,479
part of stuff for a living um

405
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:51,680
you know there's a fair number of

406
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:54,240
different ways that we could use the

407
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,919
use our outputs on on

408
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,959
yeah on tone mapping

409
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,000
so anyway uh you know the the way you

410
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,039
typically do

411
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,480
tone mapping is is uh

412
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,918
it looks like this i mean it always

413
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,279
looks like this basically what you're

414
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,679
doing is

415
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,038
uh you take some kind of an incoming

416
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,919
light level

417
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:16,400
and and this is the aces which is like

418
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,400
this kind of standardized curve i don't

419
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,280
think i've ever used this one but you

420
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,439
know i know about it so i'm you know

421
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,199
effectively what this is doing is it

422
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,720
produces a curve

423
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,200
that approximates some kind of a of a

424
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,360
film like like a literally like a piece

425
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,798
of film how it will respond to incoming

426
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,279
light and it's just a piecewise

427
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,359
polynomial

428
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,240
uh in this case it's irrational

429
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,839
um

430
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,599
it is a rational not irrational

431
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,959
uh it is a rational um and if we drop

432
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,319
this into like desmos or something you

433
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,600
can see what it looks like i mean that

434
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,279
blog entry probably had that uh as well

435
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,839
um

436
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:01,918
but like here so

437
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,279
uh if we graph like y equals x with this

438
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,759
nonsense here

439
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,720
uh and then we put in these

440
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:11,440
these numbers uh in response to it in

441
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,519
fact uh we could leave them as sliders

442
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,960
so that we can play with them later as

443
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,038
well

444
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,679
so if we take a look

445
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:19,679
at a

446
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,879
b

447
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:23,679
c d

448
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,600
uh

449
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,360
it said that a was 2.51 and that b

450
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,918
is

451
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:33,599
0.03

452
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,759
and 2.43 for c

453
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,959
uh and

454
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:39,440
0.59 for

455
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,319
uh where is e

456
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,759
what happened to e

457
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,359
oh you know what it thinks e is e it

458
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,000
probably thinks that's euler's number

459
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,479
and i can understand that

460
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,558
um am i allowed to say in this case e is

461
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,839
not e

462
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,839
i don't know if i am or not

463
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,640
um

464
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,120
well you know what let's call it um

465
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,119
z

466
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,880
how do i add a slider for something in

467
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,038
this program i don't know desmos very

468
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,120
well there we'll do it that way

469
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,519
at least it works

470
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,079
so z which is e in this case i just

471
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,200
wanted to get a slider for it

472
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:33,119
okay so now we've got our abcd

473
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,960
and z which is actually e in in this

474
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,639
and so x comes in and it's a brightness

475
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,798
level and here is the parameters on it

476
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,600
here's the the curve that they drew but

477
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,960
we've got our own one here i guess so

478
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,959
you know here's what this looks like

479
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,000
uh and you can kind of see like in their

480
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,799
drawing of this it's a little

481
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,200
exaggerated uh at that point

482
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,240
you know they're sort of showing

483
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
a

484
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,679
a

485
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,119
a flatter version of it

486
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,559
um perhaps

487
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,558
than are we they go out to 10. i don't

488
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,440
know ours doesn't look quite like theirs

489
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,480
looks that i put something in

490
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,200
um

491
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,200
incorrectly

492
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,159
251.003

493
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,359
243 059

494
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,599
014

495
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,159
and it's x

496
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,319
ax plus b

497
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,760
over x times

498
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,200
c times x plus z

499
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,440
i don't know looks like it's right but

500
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,519
does you know am i wrong

501
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:47,519
they're going from one to oh

502
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,599
i see why this is a log scale

503
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,720
um so in order to get ours to look like

504
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,759
there's uh we would have to make this be

505
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:01,319
a log axis i don't actually know

506
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,319
if this program does this it might um

507
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,679
not seeing it though

508
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,120
so i don't know we might not quite be

509
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,798
able to get it

510
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,959
to match but that's just because right

511
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:17,400
it's a log scale so you would expect it

512
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,400
to be yeah i don't i don't see

513
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,119
i don't really see any way we can do

514
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,080
that

515
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,599
so

516
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,678
i don't think we can get a log scale but

517
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,000
point being they've elongated this part

518
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,640
down here right

519
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,640
this is plotted on a log scale uh so for

520
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,919
them right they're basically looking at

521
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,038
one that goes from zero to ten

522
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,559
like so

523
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,720
but they've stretched it so that like

524
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,319
the part from here to here is like as

525
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,200
long as the part from here to here right

526
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,038
they've

527
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,080
they've kind of uh

528
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,079
log stepped it right

529
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,600
fox yeah

530
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:53,359
uh

531
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,959
does anyone know sorry i guess i'll just

532
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,599
ask does anyone know if you can get a

533
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,120
log scale i don't know if you can

534
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,038
i don't see it

535
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,279
that's what i was looking for

536
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,279
but

537
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,880
i mean it doesn't really matter because

538
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:16,279
like if we wanted to

539
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,280
we could do something like

540
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,038
right uh maybe um i guess it's

541
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,440
but it's the wrong way around uh so just

542
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,440
log that like log of the whole thing

543
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,440
sorry

544
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,519
that will not work

545
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,599
it almost worked

546
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,280
um

547
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,079
yeah because we want to be able to say

548
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,000
like well what would the output be if

549
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,558
you were to

550
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,798
plot the output so so i guess you would

551
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:05,918
do like like

552
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,400
yeah

553
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,240
like i don't know

554
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
uh this won't work i don't think but i

555
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,679
could be wrong about that because that's

556
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,079
that's a different

557
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,519
um way to do it right log of this whole

558
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,359
thing is not gonna do it because we

559
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,279
don't want the output plotted log we

560
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,119
want the input plotted log

561
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,519
if they had out if the output if they

562
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,879
had done a log on y then sure but they

563
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,639
didn't

564
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,120
so i don't know i guess we can't quite

565
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,080
get a match

566
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,959
of that

567
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,158
but

568
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,880
um

569
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,520
otherwise yes you can see what this

570
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,200
curve is attempting to do uh either way

571
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,879
yeah as i was gonna say like we could do

572
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,880
10 to the x

573
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,278
in there um

574
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,080
yeah exactly right i am bad as matt at

575
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,919
math as well but like uh

576
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,720
we wanted the opposite of what that was

577
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,960
doing we wanted to do

578
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,960
um

579
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,559
probably shouldn't deleted that

580
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,278
uh so you know

581
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,400
if we did

582
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,159
10 to the x

583
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,960
that's the opposite of log i actually

584
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:27,440
put in log which is not what we wanted

585
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,360
um so if i maybe do this

586
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,640
we can get it to simulate what would

587
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,240
happen if you brought it on a long scale

588
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,520
um

589
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,120
maybe

590
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,440
uh and then we put

591
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,439
in our constants again

592
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,440
right

593
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,880
copied in backwards order

594
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,000
i should have clicked on the uh add

595
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,159
slider buttons in the opposite order

596
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,278
right

597
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,760
um

598
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,319
so like in theory now yeah like you can

599
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:07,599
see now it looks a lot more like theirs

600
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:10,399
right it kind of goes slow right slow up

601
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:15,839
and over you know what i'm saying

602
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,840
um and you can also see here that like

603
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,278
what the effect of these dials actually

604
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,759
is

605
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,319
right so you can see like

606
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,278
a kind of controls like where we're

607
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,158
headed

608
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:26,880
right

609
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,799
um

610
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,039
b is that knee

611
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,079
that that top knee

612
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,158
um

613
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,918
c is is the angle like that that exit

614
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,799
angle there right

615
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,600
um

616
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:44,879
d is the other part of that top knee

617
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,639
and uh z is the where the like where the

618
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,480
inflection point like how you roll it

619
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,559
forward right

620
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,079
um so like you could you know just

621
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:53,678
intuitively as you play with them you

622
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,519
can see what they affect and you could

623
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,120
tweak it

624
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,759
we don't really care about that so much

625
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:02,399
the point is just that this is sort of

626
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,400
the kind of curve that you want

627
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,240
for film

628
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,480
when you're trying to do like what does

629
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,640
it look like to expose film

630
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,440
you want something that

631
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,200
has this sort of natural asymptotic like

632
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,480
going down towards black going up

633
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,880
towards white

634
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,038
that's you know

635
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,240
gradual and in the middle is somewhat

636
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,079
linear

637
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,319
that way no matter how bright things get

638
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,319
they always sort of fall somewhere in

639
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,119
your mappable range no matter how bright

640
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,119
it gets right

641
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,399
um

642
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,360
and so more importantly you can see that

643
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
this

644
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,199
even though this is like an official acs

645
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,359
um

646
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,200
like tone mapping curve

647
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,678
you can kind of see that it's very

648
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,120
simple like this is not particularly

649
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,960
complicated

650
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,439
it is rational

651
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,350
uh which is not fabulous

652
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,798
and you know um

653
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:57,359
[Music]

654
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:00,558
i think i remember this

655
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,479
oh is this gone

656
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,558
that's unfortunate all right can we get

657
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,960
that this was a good article

658
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:10,399
is that gone

659
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,038
no one's ever really gone

660
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,600
can i uh

661
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,599
can i get it back

662
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,158
um

663
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,159
did i do that wrong

664
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,479
yes so was this the one

665
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,480
um

666
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,798
so you know this one's still rational i

667
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,960
i could be

668
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,440
very wrong

669
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,399
but i could have sworn the last time i

670
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,320
worked on something like this

671
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:06,000
i did one that

672
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,079
that was basically

673
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,398
that did wasn't actually rational so it

674
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,359
didn't have a a divide but that

675
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:16,359
basically did what i wanted

676
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,359
um

677
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,799
and it's

678
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,519
i guess i don't remember where i got it

679
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,720
from maybe i worked it out myself

680
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,519
i don't

681
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,640
know uh it's been a long time

682
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,960
so anyway the point is a divide is

683
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,278
somewhat expensive

684
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,360
but these days it's not that bad so you

685
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,038
might and since you only really do it at

686
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,918
the end you know you're only going to do

687
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,038
one of these for a pixel right

688
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,559
well possibly more if you're doing

689
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:45,839
multi-sampling but you're not doing very

690
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,079
many

691
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,798
uh you know i guess people just don't

692
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,480
care these days but

693
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,879
it is true that it divides a lot more

694
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,480
expensive than like you know

695
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,480
uh just a

696
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,919
straight ahead multiply add the rest of

697
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,759
this stuff is all f mads which is the

698
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,960
cheapest possible thing but then you got

699
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,640
this divided in here and that's somewhat

700
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,079
expensive now i don't think it really

701
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,919
matters because like i said we're not

702
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,199
doing it that it's not a heavy lifting

703
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,038
kind of a thing

704
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,399
um it's not happening like many times

705
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,119
per pixel

706
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:18,000
so you know it's probably fine but in

707
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,678
general uh this curve

708
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,599
i guess we start with

709
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,960
maybe let's start with this curve

710
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:27,199
because hey it's well known

711
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,759
it's a standard

712
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,960
uh and we can tweak it pretty easily if

713
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,200
we want to

714
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,759
uh so maybe this is this is where we

715
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,600
start um like i said a little less

716
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,359
comfortable

717
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:42,079
with it uh

718
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,639
be just because of the fact that i

719
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,720
don't know that you really need a divide

720
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,520
i don't know that this has to be so

721
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,880
precise as to need a rational

722
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,398
in it um and that just feels off to me

723
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,360
it doesn't feel like something you would

724
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,239
need

725
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,490
but you know i guess apparently

726
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,240
that's how they did this so

727
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,720
[Music]

728
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,720
yeah um

729
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:16,038
you know i don't care enough to go to go

730
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,038
further i suppose

731
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,639
so this is just literally their curve

732
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,960
and

733
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,960
you know

734
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,080
we've got our params we have f32 defined

735
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,398
here right yeah

736
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,079
i you can't put f's

737
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,678
if i remember correctly in the version

738
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,759
we're using here

739
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,679
so it's going to look a little bit

740
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,558
different

741
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,360
but otherwise it's the same

742
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,879
and so basically we pass in an x which

743
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,079
is the incoming light and it just

744
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,799
returns the tone mapped version of it so

745
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:09,839
that would be a basic filmic tone map

746
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:12,720
and we literally can just drop that in i

747
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,558
think uh at when we're done

748
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,759
so you know in here

749
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:16,839
you've got

750
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,398
lighting

751
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:19,159
summation

752
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,368
i

753
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,369
[Music]

754
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,360
what the heck

755
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:35,038
what is

756
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,519
what is that

757
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,519
here for

758
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:46,079
uh anytime we go spelunking in this

759
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,519
nonsense shader that we wrote um it's

760
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,519
always a bit of a

761
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,839
an absurd

762
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,120
like what

763
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,319
i i don't know what the heck that's

764
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,038
supposed to be

765
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,359
why is it being clamped

766
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:17,359
um

767
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,000
i don't know we don't need the light

768
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:25,599
floor anymore i don't think uh because

769
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,599
it's not defined to be anything anyway

770
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,759
right it's just zero um

771
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,359
so all right we're gonna get rid of this

772
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,599
and this

773
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,839
and we're gonna start here

774
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,839
um

775
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,359
so we're just simplifying things a

776
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,599
little bit

777
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,599
uh

778
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,440
is anyone calling this function

779
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:02,000
yeah this is just old old stuff so we've

780
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,240
we've excised all of that stuff out it's

781
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,240
gone

782
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,679
uh

783
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,839
what is this open just like

784
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,320
saturate oh uh right that would be a d

785
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,480
that's that's a

786
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,918
a d 3d kind of a thing

787
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,000
um

788
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,840
an hl sl

789
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,919
so

790
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:24,959
we don't want that uh that's just a

791
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,799
clamp01 is all that is saturate is just

792
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,079
their term for clamping between zero and

793
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,398
one

794
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,240
uh and i think we already defined our

795
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,839
own clamp01

796
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,798
right yeah

797
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,798
so

798
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,158
we can just just use the standard thing

799
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,918
that we would do and that will do the

800
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,159
correct thing uh

801
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,679
it's just you know

802
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,919
it's just a nomenclature difference

803
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,320
between glsl and

804
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,919
hlsl which i assume that the code that

805
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:51,918
they were talking about

806
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,799
was hlsl there so that's why it had a

807
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,038
saturated in it right

808
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,918
which is totally reasonable

809
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,829
okay

810
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:04,799
uh that's about it i think um

811
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:07,119
[Music]

812
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,280
so here's us doing our thing hopping

813
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,480
around and

814
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,839
having a party and hopping party

815
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,159
uh and so now we need to put in this

816
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,759
tone mapping and i don't think there's

817
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,519
gonna be a huge difference between what

818
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,639
we see i don't think it's going to be

819
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,480
huge

820
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,358
but again at least now this way it will

821
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,440
be

822
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:30,159
roughly correct and you can see in here

823
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,000
so we've got our surface reflect

824
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,000
i we have a fogging factor but i i can't

825
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,280
really say why

826
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,280
uh

827
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,519
anymore because we don't use the fog

828
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,000
maybe we leave that in because we want

829
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,320
to use fog in the future

830
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,599
um

831
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,919
i guess i don't know

832
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,079
anyway uh so we've got some other

833
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:57,118
garbage here we've got like a lerp

834
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,519
between this and a frag emission value

835
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,440
uh and that that frag emission thing is

836
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,280
here i don't know

837
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,200
who actually sets the fragments and

838
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,320
stuff we're going to have to look

839
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:07,759
at that stuff because we're going to

840
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,280
need it later we're probably going to

841
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,079
want to render light sources that are

842
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,640
emitters right

843
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,480
and then when they are emitting you can

844
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,920
see here they would then flow through

845
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,480
and they would uh do a like a boost

846
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,480
basically

847
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:27,919
and this clamp01 now i think we just

848
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,480
want to replace this right here

849
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,559
with our asus film map

850
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,358
uh so rather than just clamping between

851
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,599
zero and one we wanna feed this into

852
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,239
uh the tone mapper

853
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,480
um so here's what that looks like

854
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:45,279
and you know you can already see it

855
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,880
looks a lot better right it looks a lot

856
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,040
more dramatic

857
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,320
being fed through the tone mapper

858
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:51,599
um

859
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,440
it's just nice

860
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,760
right uh

861
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,200
a lot more just a lot more dramatic a

862
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,640
lot more

863
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,279
uh

864
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:04,639
stark and interesting right

865
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,880
um so but i would say the squariness

866
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:09,759
right still totally there uh it doesn't

867
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,640
really help um

868
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,800
if anything it sort of exacerbates that

869
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,960
and uh so while everything else looks

870
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,200
really good like any area that has a lot

871
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,880
of light looks ten times better

872
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,960
uh areas of low light have that

873
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,800
squareness problem but but yeah i mean

874
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,800
it just it's a nice response curve it

875
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,640
looks a lot better there's no question

876
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,119
about that right

877
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:36,679
it definitely looks a lot better

878
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,680
so uh yeah i guess i would say

879
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
um

880
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
i mean based on that i'd say i might

881
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,759
still want to do the light rasterization

882
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
because yeah this looks good the tone

883
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,680
mapping is definitely an improvement um

884
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,559
we would want to keep that

885
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,039
but

886
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,719
the squariness persists it doesn't

887
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,199
really help

888
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,358
with the squariness very much

889
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:22,358
um and

890
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,358
i guess we also don't know so if i

891
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,599
if i switch these to spheres

892
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:37,838
i don't know what that does if anything

893
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,838
um

894
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,200
but basically no change the squariness

895
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,960
kind of remains they get dimmer because

896
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,719
they're smaller

897
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,880
right um

898
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,399
but

899
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,440
not really

900
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,760
a dramatic difference i wouldn't say

901
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,760
um

902
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,559
yeah

903
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,598
so

904
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,240
gosh

905
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:10,160
i think that kind of argues for still

906
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,159
doing the rasterization step

907
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,760
i think that i think that argues

908
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,320
for doing the rasterization step

909
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,320
because

910
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,960
obviously we could change the way we're

911
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,199
doing interpolation and maybe that would

912
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,240
help it's true

913
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,159
but

914
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,598
i also don't know

915
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,639
that

916
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,079
i i feel like we probably have some a

917
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,838
lot of mileage we could get out of just

918
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,720
more

919
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:48,078
accurate

920
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,078
light source

921
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,079
placement

922
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,320
into the into the the voxel

923
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
so

924
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:11,920
you

925
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,880
i guess i don't know what what to do

926
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,960
next

927
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,480
uh my guess is we should just try

928
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,838
rasterization direct direct

929
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,838
rasterization i think

930
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,559
that feels like what you would want

931
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:01,559
um

932
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,240
uh dr zul the light prepositions are

933
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,240
already jittered

934
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:22,400
um

935
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,239
if you would like to see

936
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,960
uh what i mean

937
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:26,959
by that

938
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,960
here is

939
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:38,960
one of the ray samples

940
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,960
this is just the first one taken

941
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:45,119
uh and you can see that it's already

942
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,119
jittered right

943
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,358
so

944
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,838
so

945
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,838
you know

946
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,318
so uh yeah i don't have a lot else to

947
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,800
say about that

948
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,960
um i guess i'm i'm not really sure what

949
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,839
i think i should do for the next step

950
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,519
here

951
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:34,078
what i will say is the lighting looks

952
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:36,480
awesome i'm very happy with it

953
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,839
uh so i really have no complaints about

954
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,358
it and i think you could ship a game

955
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:40,880
this way i just think that that

956
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,279
squariness

957
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,559
i think i can probably fix it if i do

958
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,560
direct rasterization of the light

959
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,679
sources and because the lighting looks

960
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,159
so good

961
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,358
and you know it kind of brings it down

962
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,358
like when you're out here like for

963
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,000
example and you get that squariness it

964
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,519
just kind of brings the quality down um

965
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,159
i think i should probably just try it

966
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,000
because if it did fix it then that would

967
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,399
be like the lighting would basically be

968
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,599
perfect i mean everywhere else the

969
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,039
lighting is

970
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,800
spectacular

971
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,199
um

972
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,800
to the point where stuff now just looks

973
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,799
so freaking good uh

974
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,760
it just looks so damn good that i i feel

975
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,719
like if

976
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,760
it's a shame to let one thing

977
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:28,239
uh bring it down like that and it's just

978
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,319
because i think uh we don't have a good

979
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,000
way of handling when you're close to a

980
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,880
light source so you get a

981
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,599
that drastic almost a step function when

982
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,318
all the rays then miss or a large number

983
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,079
of rays miss and you don't so you don't

984
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,719
have a proper interpolant you end up

985
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,720
getting that sort of square

986
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:48,959
fall off i

987
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:51,919
i mean like yeah because it just it just

988
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,838
looks really good

989
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,559
now and i feel like uh we

990
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:00,480
would really be doing a disservice uh if

991
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,679
we didn't at least try to get it perfect

992
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,000
because it's

993
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,318
it's really good looking

994
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,318
um

995
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:12,078
so um and like here's an example of of

996
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,400
playing the game with only one light

997
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,160
source and just i mean look at how good

998
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,519
that looks right

999
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:20,399
like

1000
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:23,280
the indirect lighting is just awesome

1001
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,920
um

1002
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,400
it's just so much better than what i'm

1003
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,599
used to seeing in a lot of cases it just

1004
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,920
looks great

1005
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,920
i mean that's just amazing

1006
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,159
um

1007
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,000
and if we did move this to the gpu it

1008
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:41,039
would look even better because like

1009
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,159
don't forget on the gpu it's going to be

1010
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,639
rather than you know eight samples

1011
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,118
uh it's gonna be like

1012
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:52,239
it would be like 64 samples or something

1013
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,119
you know we could do so you know it'd be

1014
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:57,039
the quality level would be like that

1015
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,920
um

1016
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,358
so very little flicker as well

1017
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,358
right

1018
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:04,358
um

1019
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,719
and that that would just be like really

1020
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,839
really really

1021
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,039
hard to argue with at that point right

1022
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:15,039
um

1023
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,400
so i don't know

1024
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,119
i feel like we should do the

1025
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,039
rasterization just to see if it helps if

1026
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,440
i knew for sure it would definitely fix

1027
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:24,400
it i would say it's it's absolutely what

1028
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
we do

1029
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,079
um

1030
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,838
but i you know there's a possibility

1031
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,519
that it simply won't fix it and then

1032
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:31,940
we've done

1033
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,719
um

1034
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,039
[Music]

1035
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,879
we've done that work for no reason right

1036
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,559
but i mean you know that's that's engine

1037
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,480
programming engine programming is about

1038
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,159
trying stuff and finding something that

1039
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,240
works

1040
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,399
that's your job as an engine programmer

1041
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:49,838
it's the game designer's job then to

1042
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,920
have this nice situation where

1043
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,920
everything just works right we build

1044
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,519
this for them

1045
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,280
so that they can go make a game that's

1046
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,039
the whole point uh we do the

1047
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,519
experimentation

1048
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,679
on the engine so that they can do

1049
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,639
experimentation on the game design right

1050
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:09,519
i mean that's how that works

1051
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:11,199
so so i don't mind at all uh but it is

1052
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:14,000
the case that you know we may go do the

1053
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:17,199
rasterization and it doesn't matter

1054
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,358
right like it doesn't actually fix it uh

1055
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:21,519
so you know

1056
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,838
um so anyway

1057
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,838
uh

1058
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,119
i guess we just try it

1059
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,359
uh and we

1060
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,680
see what we can do

1061
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:35,679
um

1062
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:43,119
if you look at what's going on here it's

1063
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,358
pretty clear so you know like if i go

1064
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,358
and

1065
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,318
if you take a look at the light probe

1066
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,720
locations

1067
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,639
that are implicated by you know this

1068
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:04,000
this thing

1069
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:06,078
what we would be looking at is basically

1070
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,639
a five by five

1071
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,640
square

1072
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,240
right uh and the question would be

1073
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,319
i mean i guess i don't even really know

1074
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:30,558
that maybe it's only a three by three

1075
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,639
square

1076
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,200
so you know for a given light it's gonna

1077
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,719
be we'd rasterize it into the three by

1078
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,159
three

1079
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,239
i mean technically it's a stack because

1080
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,639
we would do both you know be the bottom

1081
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:45,639
and the top there

1082
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:45,639
um

1083
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,559
i'm gonna hop out into an area where

1084
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,159
it's more pronounced and and try to take

1085
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,559
a look at what's happening with the

1086
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:06,279
light prep see if i can get a better

1087
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,280
feel for why

1088
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,240
you know why we're seeing that

1089
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,679
and i gotta be honest with you i

1090
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:18,078
i

1091
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,159
don't

1092
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,280
you know looking at this i'm starting to

1093
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:25,838
think maybe interpolation

1094
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,680
really would be

1095
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,920
sort of more of it

1096
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:32,000
because those look about right

1097
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,960
and i'm just i'm wondering are we doing

1098
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,358
something wrong

1099
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,358
um

1100
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:45,039
because

1101
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:47,598
i even linear interpolation should not

1102
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,838
really be having such a hard

1103
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,838
edge

1104
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:54,799
i mean linear interpolation is capable

1105
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,838
of reproducing a literally an exact

1106
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,720
circle

1107
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:02,039
uh

1108
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:02,039
linear interpolation just is is not

1109
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:08,558
does not really explain

1110
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,558
uh

1111
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,880
does not really explain

1112
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:19,199
why we're getting that hard edge

1113
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,200
um

1114
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:29,759
so i'm a little nervous about this

1115
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,720
because i think

1116
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,800
i think we're seeing something else

1117
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,039
uh i wonder if this has to do with

1118
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,760
mixing specular let's turn off the

1119
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:41,759
specular out off because right now we

1120
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,559
have those both on which is not

1121
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,559
necessarily great

1122
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
so this material parameter uh i'm going

1123
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:01,279
to turn it down to zero

1124
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,519
so that the

1125
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,519
uh it's only looking at the diffuse map

1126
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:13,280
uh so that is kind of what i thought

1127
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:17,920
so if you look at just the diffuse map

1128
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:21,720
you actually don't quite have that same

1129
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,720
problem do you

1130
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,760
i mean it still has more of a square

1131
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:40,639
aspect than you would like

1132
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,960
but it's not nearly like the same as

1133
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,400
with the spec map where it's very hard

1134
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,240
edged

1135
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,039
right

1136
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,039
that's the spec map

1137
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:03,119
all right so hold on a second here folks

1138
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,760
everyone hold on a second

1139
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,200
i'm going to look at debugger octahedral

1140
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,920
values

1141
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:12,318
and we're going to turn on the values

1142
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,960
and we're going to use the spec atlas

1143
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:19,719
instead of the diffuse atlas so we can

1144
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,720
see what we actually have

1145
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:41,400
i mean no

1146
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,400
like it still doesn't

1147
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:00,279
something just does not add up here

1148
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,440
some something weird

1149
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,079
something feels off because when you

1150
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,400
look at what's happening with the actual

1151
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,400
light probes

1152
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,559
you know they

1153
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,760
there's still a fair bit of light being

1154
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,000
collected

1155
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:53,200
by this

1156
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,719
and maybe that's not really true because

1157
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:59,039
maybe what we're seeing there

1158
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:59,039
is

1159
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:03,199
it really does feel like it

1160
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:06,400
maybe what we're seeing there is

1161
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:09,039
like well yeah if you look like this

1162
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,880
it is pretty smooth right so what you're

1163
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,558
seeing there is just the transition from

1164
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,400
a reflection vector that looks up into

1165
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,319
the part that does have the light source

1166
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,559
versus one that doesn't have the light

1167
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:21,119
source you're just seeing that

1168
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:24,119
you know that difference

1169
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,119
um

1170
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:43,039
so that seems pretty weird let's go take

1171
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:46,960
a look um at what we're doing there

1172
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,079
because i don't actually know

1173
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,280
well i don't actually know what we're

1174
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,000
doing there

1175
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,519
let's be completely honest we just don't

1176
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,039
know

1177
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:59,440
so uh when we sample the lighting

1178
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:02,880
which you can see us doing here

1179
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,960
we pull out you know from the octahedral

1180
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,838
map a particular lighting sample and we

1181
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,838
merge them together here we've asked for

1182
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:11,199
just the specular so that we could look

1183
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:12,960
at it

1184
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,879
because the diffuse map is obviously a

1185
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,358
blur

1186
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,800
um a cosine weighted blur of the spec

1187
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:20,799
map which is you know what you expect

1188
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,760
um

1189
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,880
so we sample the lighting each time and

1190
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,280
we do it

1191
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,039
we sample at each of the eight

1192
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,079
corn you know the the eight corners of

1193
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:36,719
the the the voxel you know cage you

1194
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,720
would be in

1195
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,640
uh and we

1196
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:45,598
use those to do a standard tri-linear

1197
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:47,920
interpolation right here is this lurping

1198
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,000
z you know between the up the up and the

1199
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:54,318
down basically

1200
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,880
uh using the the z we then lerp the y

1201
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:58,558
uh and then finally the x uh to produce

1202
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,000
the final result

1203
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,720
that you know that's what you would

1204
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,559
expect to see um that's the standard

1205
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:08,639
trilinear

1206
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:10,079
right um not a lot of

1207
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,078
anything particularly weird going on

1208
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,079
there

1209
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,880
um

1210
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:28,719
so it's hard to say that that you know

1211
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,480
that doesn't look particularly odd now

1212
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:33,679
it's possible that there's some bugs in

1213
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,240
here though right like

1214
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:37,358
you know suppose we were computing vox r

1215
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:39,519
wrong

1216
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:41,519
you know what i mean like that could

1217
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,039
lead to you having

1218
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:44,400
you know a harder

1219
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:47,039
you know

1220
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,838
fall off than you should

1221
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:49,838
um

1222
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,559
light look up voxel dimension

1223
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:09,000
minus one

1224
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:09,000
times vox uvw

1225
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,880
uh

1226
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,280
i can't say that makes a huge amount of

1227
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,280
sense to me

1228
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,720
like why

1229
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:18,240
are we sending down the total dimension

1230
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,240
as being one less than it should be

1231
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,679
i guess

1232
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,680
because that's a little weird

1233
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:45,240
um

1234
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:45,239
right that's not

1235
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:18,159
i mean

1236
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,199
am i the only one who thinks this is

1237
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:26,798
strange

1238
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,798
uh you know maybe i am but

1239
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,160
like what are we sending down for the

1240
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:36,639
vox imf total dim in the first place

1241
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:36,639
what do we send down for vox in

1242
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:45,119
this value

1243
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:45,118
voxel in turtle dim

1244
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:53,480
what does that get set to

1245
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:08,000
i mean someone must set that right

1246
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:13,399
so who

1247
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:22,960
so it's in set light bounds

1248
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,880
and it's it's here

1249
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,239
so this feels a little sloppy

1250
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,399
um

1251
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:10,639
this this is

1252
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,639
making me a little nervous so

1253
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,559
this

1254
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:17,920
doesn't

1255
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:20,079
make sense exactly

1256
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,838
i mean it sort of does don't get me

1257
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,240
wrong

1258
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:24,239
um

1259
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:32,239
but i think it's interpolating off by

1260
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,240
0.5 in a way

1261
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,239
right

1262
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:12,639
i don't know what to make of that

1263
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:14,239
so let's take a look at what this looks

1264
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:17,759
like with and without it it's because

1265
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:20,479
it's really confusing and i'm not sure

1266
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,599
how to process that it's it's very odd

1267
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,920
and

1268
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,640
i want to understand it better so if i

1269
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,639
delete this

1270
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:31,679
um so that we don't have the minus one

1271
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:34,719
it should shift we should see the

1272
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:36,239
lighting shift yeah like that

1273
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:39,838
um

1274
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:40,798
and presumably it should be

1275
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:42,239
more

1276
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:44,239
wrong

1277
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:46,798
or otherwise i don't know why we had it

1278
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:49,118
shifted like that

1279
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:49,119
um

1280
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,838
right i mean

1281
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,039
but why you would one that i'm not quite

1282
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,798
sure

1283
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:14,240
because it's sort of like it feels more

1284
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:16,079
it feels like we're correcting for

1285
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:17,038
something that we did wrong in the first

1286
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,000
place

1287
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,839
and so i'm not sure about that minus one

1288
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,679
i'm not sure i can justify that minus

1289
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,960
one very well

1290
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:29,000
now granted this has nothing to do with

1291
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,000
what we were actually looking at

1292
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,400
i'm also not sure how us changing our

1293
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:40,400
orientation here should have any effect

1294
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,480
because i thought we turned off

1295
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,720
the specular

1296
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,960
oh no we're looking entirely at specular

1297
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,959
never mind

1298
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,480
um

1299
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:00,078
so i i

1300
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,480
don't

1301
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:05,480
love that

1302
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,480
and

1303
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:28,038
i feel that's i don't know i really just

1304
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:28,038
kind of that feels suspicious to me

1305
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,880
and furthermore so if you take a look

1306
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:45,440
you know let's suppose i was correct

1307
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,559
that there should be a minus one there

1308
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,639
well

1309
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,640
is there a minus one in here because

1310
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:52,558
these are the same code path like one's

1311
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:54,879
on the gpu side

1312
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,720
and one's on the cpu side

1313
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,400
and you can see here like we've got like

1314
01:03:56,719 --> 01:03:59,679
all right you know

1315
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,838
i

1316
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:03,038
we're doing the same stuff

1317
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,099
we

1318
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,960
do like um

1319
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:08,960
[Music]

1320
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,119
an f chord and a b chord right that's

1321
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:15,199
this this stuff right here

1322
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:17,920
uh inverse cell dimension times p minus

1323
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:20,159
total bounds right

1324
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,159
um

1325
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:28,798
it's a very similar computation

1326
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,720
in this case we're trying to actually

1327
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:33,519
get a number that we index into because

1328
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:35,598
this one's you know in zero to one land

1329
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:37,038
and this one's in zero to count so

1330
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:39,039
that's why you know it's a little bit

1331
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,839
different

1332
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,839
uh

1333
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:58,679
so i mean this is this is just getting

1334
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,680
the exact cell count

1335
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,880
and so you would think this would too

1336
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:18,160
i guess there is a difference in that

1337
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:20,239
the zero to one uv scale thing is kind

1338
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:23,279
of messed up the way that opengl does

1339
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:24,798
textures is really bizarre and strange i

1340
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,720
mean the way all 3d graphics cards do

1341
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:27,838
them i've never understood it it's very

1342
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:29,038
weird and

1343
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:30,798
unnatural

1344
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,640
um

1345
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:34,239
it's just kind of wrong like like i

1346
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,118
think it's just objectively wrong the

1347
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:38,479
way they do texture lookups personally

1348
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,838
um

1349
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,519
it's just

1350
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:42,960
and it doesn't work with almost anything

1351
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,239
like it's why they had to struggle so

1352
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,318
long with weird things they tried to add

1353
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:47,598
like texture borders and all the stuff

1354
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:49,119
it's just wrong

1355
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,880
uh the way that they decided to do

1356
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,318
texture mapping so you know maybe it

1357
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,720
could be that i'm not thinking through

1358
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:56,318
the weird like okay zero

1359
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:58,318
is actually like

1360
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:00,798
half a pixel back from the center of the

1361
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:06,079
first pixel and one is actually half a

1362
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:07,599
pixel forward from the last you know

1363
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,200
pixel

1364
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,880
and if you actually internalize that

1365
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:12,960
there's that's the extra one that you're

1366
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,200
removing when you do this

1367
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,199
right

1368
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,119
so maybe i could believe that

1369
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:22,879
um i'll let it go for now with just the

1370
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,400
to-do because

1371
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,200
you know it doesn't have anything to do

1372
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,639
with

1373
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:28,639
what i'm looking at

1374
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:29,598
i'm looking at the squariness

1375
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:31,598
um

1376
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:35,599
but

1377
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:38,599
yeah that was a bit disquieting as well

1378
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,599
um

1379
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,639
so i think you can also see when we look

1380
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,760
at the specular map right

1381
01:06:54,639 --> 01:07:01,279
you can see that i can make the falloff

1382
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:04,240
either be hard or soft based on what the

1383
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,559
reflection angle is and i guess that's

1384
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:09,759
just yeah that all that's doing

1385
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:12,160
is it's because you have that blur

1386
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,319
uh from the spec map to the diffuse map

1387
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:15,759
the spec map just immediately falls off

1388
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:19,038
when you no longer are targeting the

1389
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,480
light source the texels on that side

1390
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,799
won't have

1391
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,798
um

1392
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:28,920
any contribution at all

1393
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,920
right

1394
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:47,039
so i guess what i'm trying to say

1395
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,640
is this whole thing might

1396
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,680
might

1397
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:53,920
um implicate the part of the code that i

1398
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,558
sort of said we would get rid of

1399
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,960
but maybe we actually secretly need it

1400
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:02,079
um which is actually not so much better

1401
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:04,240
interpolation on the voxel

1402
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,079
because maybe we don't really need that

1403
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:07,519
maybe our main problem is better

1404
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:12,559
interpolation

1405
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:12,559
in the octahedral map um

1406
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:19,319
i really don't want that to be true

1407
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:35,319
uh because it would be really nice if

1408
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,319
that wasn't the case

1409
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:53,920
you

1410
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:21,920
you

1411
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,040
well okay

1412
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:58,480
so here's what i'll say because i'm not

1413
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:59,600
really sure

1414
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:00,839
uh

1415
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,159
maybe we just

1416
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:06,800
try some different things like maybe we

1417
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:08,960
try a different interpolator

1418
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,640
i've had multiple people write in asking

1419
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,279
for me to do this

1420
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:15,440
and so you know maybe now is a good time

1421
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:17,840
to say let's experiment let's answer the

1422
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:19,759
question of would an interpolator make

1423
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,960
any difference here anyway

1424
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:25,920
um and i think someone sent me one and

1425
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:28,079
it's been i i've been delinquent in not

1426
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,679
trying it i said i would try it

1427
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:32,158
and i just haven't gotten around to it

1428
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:35,600
so i will i will bring it up here

1429
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:38,158
and uh i will will mention it and uh

1430
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,480
we'll see if there's if it if it really

1431
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:40,479
helps

1432
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,840
um or not and it was uh

1433
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:52,960
okay so it was from sebastian mester

1434
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,079
uh i'm sure i'm like pronouncing that

1435
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,840
wrong because it's like probably

1436
01:10:54,079 --> 01:11:01,198
sebastian master or something like this

1437
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:02,880
but uh they said hey casey i just looked

1438
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:04,238
at your most recent youtube video if

1439
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,920
you're looking at a different blending

1440
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:08,399
function for handmade heroes raytrace

1441
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,560
voxels here's a cool one

1442
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:16,319
uh and he says float f float x return x

1443
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:20,400
times x times three minus two times x

1444
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:21,920
um float g is return f u v dot u times f

1445
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:24,399
u v dot v

1446
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,760
and it says it's hat shaped

1447
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:27,679
uh continuous with the continuous

1448
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,400
derivative and the four samples always

1449
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,560
add up to one the derivatives are also

1450
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:34,799
zero at the edges which makes it really

1451
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,280
nice for blending light values at the

1452
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,119
far edges of the square

1453
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:40,719
um so it was probably hard for you to

1454
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,640
understand what i was reading exactly

1455
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,840
because i read some equations there that

1456
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,920
you know probably were hard to see but

1457
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:48,239
it's actually very simple um so let me

1458
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,840
just show you

1459
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:53,119
show you

1460
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,640
um soy sauce let me just soy sauce this

1461
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:56,559
uh

1462
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:00,480
in here what he was suggesting so that

1463
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:02,560
you can see what i can see uh as well so

1464
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,319
uh what they were saying is i don't know

1465
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,760
what we're gonna call this uh we'll call

1466
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:08,479
this a mester

1467
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,679
um in honor of the the fellow who wrote

1468
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:11,599
in

1469
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:14,719
i so what

1470
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,960
he was saying was that look you pass in

1471
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:21,359
um an x value

1472
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:24,158
and it returns x times x times three

1473
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:27,279
minus 2 x

1474
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:28,479
right so just a like a

1475
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:29,599
cubic

1476
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:32,079
right

1477
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,800
um and you know what since we were

1478
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:37,359
having the decimals party today

1479
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,719
there's no reason we can't uh decimals

1480
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:41,599
this up

1481
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:44,640
right so if we

1482
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,640
if we put that in there

1483
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,239
uh you can see that it's actually not

1484
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:49,840
that dissimilar

1485
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:52,639
uh to the lighting one right it's

1486
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,079
another one of these little sigmoid guys

1487
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,440
uh and it just kind of goes like a

1488
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:56,800
little smoother up and then a little

1489
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:58,639
smoother out

1490
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,480
so rather than just a harsh line it's

1491
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,239
got like a little bend

1492
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:03,359
right

1493
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:04,959
um

1494
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:08,000
and uh

1495
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:10,158
yeah so that's the first part of it but

1496
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,920
he had a second part

1497
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:13,439
uh which he said that was when you

1498
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,158
actually look up

1499
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,879
uh the value

1500
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,879
like where you're going to look up the

1501
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,719
value i guess

1502
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,199
so i think what he was saying is that

1503
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,719
when you actually do like uh the

1504
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:29,119
coordinates

1505
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:31,359
you do you pass in the coordinates that

1506
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,840
you're going to look up

1507
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:33,839
i guess

1508
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,760
you know what i don't really understand

1509
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,760
this part

1510
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,280
i don't really understand this part so

1511
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:52,719
here's another one that this is the

1512
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:54,238
other part of it and i guess i'm just

1513
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,920
not sure where it comes from so like

1514
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:57,919
here's the uv

1515
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,840
uh and he said

1516
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:04,000
uh

1517
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:04,000
that we would do the first one

1518
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:16,320
uh so basically like doing this falloff

1519
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:18,479
function on the u times the fall

1520
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:19,920
function on the v

1521
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:22,238
and

1522
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,399
so i guess

1523
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:26,559
this is just a way to produce the

1524
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:29,799
interpolant

1525
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,800
in 2d

1526
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:35,600
i'm not sure how that really helps us

1527
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:37,279
though because we're doing 3d i don't

1528
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,760
really know so i'm not sure how this was

1529
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:40,759
meant to be applied

1530
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:49,678
is i guess what i would say

1531
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,190
uh you could do three of them

1532
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,440
um

1533
01:14:50,189 --> 01:14:54,319
[Music]

1534
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:54,319
so like

1535
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,719
this

1536
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,840
right um

1537
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:11,039
so so

1538
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,239
you could do that and

1539
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,640
but i don't know if that's really what

1540
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:17,519
the person intended so you know i guess

1541
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,480
i apologize i probably should have asked

1542
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,760
um

1543
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:23,678
some clarifying questions at the time

1544
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,199
um and so

1545
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,520
yeah maybe that's

1546
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:30,879
less good so maybe this is not what they

1547
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,800
so i apologize to the the viewer because

1548
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:36,159
i don't actually know

1549
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:39,360
if this is what they were recommending

1550
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:42,479
i assume this is for the lerp uh

1551
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:44,158
preconditioning the lerp

1552
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,879
uh but i really don't know

1553
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:47,920
so we could try this and see but it may

1554
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,480
not actually be what they were

1555
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:53,840
suggesting so i apologize so here is our

1556
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:55,839
vox r uh and so basically what we would

1557
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,480
be doing here is just i think the

1558
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:01,520
intention of this would be before we in

1559
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:03,678
combine the values using uh trilinear we

1560
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,480
would first precondition this

1561
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,480
uh

1562
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:10,238
value to sort of conform to that sigmoid

1563
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:13,279
function and

1564
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:16,158
i i think that's what they wanted but

1565
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:19,359
honestly i i just don't really know

1566
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:20,960
oops i've i've made a horrible error

1567
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:23,198
um

1568
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:26,480
mester three

1569
01:16:23,198 --> 01:16:29,479
must be broken what did i screw up

1570
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:29,479
um

1571
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:38,479
oh wait but that only gives you back one

1572
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,400
value

1573
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:43,119
yeah now that like like this doesn't

1574
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:45,198
actually return a v3

1575
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:48,319
so

1576
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:52,279
how does that help you

1577
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:52,279
again i don't really see

1578
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:04,718
i don't really quite see how the

1579
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,199
blending's supposed to work because you

1580
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,719
need to be able to produce a three you

1581
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:11,279
need to be able to produce three blend

1582
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:12,319
coefficients right

1583
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:14,719
um

1584
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:17,679
and i i don't understand what this g

1585
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:20,239
value is i could just call this on each

1586
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:23,239
dimension separately

1587
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:23,238
um

1588
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,760
but i just don't get what the uv parts

1589
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,760
for

1590
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,800
right because i it's trilinear so i need

1591
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,640
three linear interpolation values i

1592
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,079
could feed each of them into the first

1593
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,079
mester

1594
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:57,519
but the second mester what would it be

1595
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:59,359
for

1596
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,400
i just don't know where i would bother

1597
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:02,399
where would that go

1598
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:05,759
right

1599
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,000
so like you know this function it's

1600
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,400
pretty easy for me to take this and just

1601
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,479
feed all of them into that

1602
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:14,559
um you know that's the most

1603
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,359
straightforward thing to do

1604
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,640
so

1605
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:20,880
where we had the vox r before right

1606
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,880
um

1607
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:26,319
right here

1608
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,719
we would just say like okay yeah each of

1609
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:28,719
these

1610
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:41,799
you know what i'm saying

1611
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,440
so each of these we could feed through

1612
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:49,920
that interpolant that's not hard right

1613
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:51,759
but i just don't see how that uses i

1614
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,719
don't see how the second function gets

1615
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,880
used um i'm not sure oops

1616
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,489
uh

1617
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,400
so that mester two and three

1618
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:02,079
[Music]

1619
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:04,479
these two or well the three he didn't

1620
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:06,158
say but this two this one

1621
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:07,439
i don't get

1622
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,359
right

1623
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:12,000
um so this is not going to be useful

1624
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:13,119
tests um i apologize

1625
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,640
i guess i'll just need to get

1626
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:17,039
clarification

1627
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,199
on what was supposed to happen there

1628
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:20,719
um because i don't know

1629
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:22,149
i do not know

1630
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:24,319
what they wanted me to do

1631
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:25,359
[Music]

1632
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:28,000
so

1633
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:30,238
so i can do it to each of the axes

1634
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,158
independently but what that other one

1635
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:36,959
was supposed to be i don't know

1636
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:38,158
um so here's what that looks like

1637
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,000
uh

1638
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:42,559
and you know it's

1639
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,760
it's better you can still see what it's

1640
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:48,719
doing but it it turns the squares into

1641
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,800
sort of rounder

1642
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:51,520
versions of of themselves i'll turn off

1643
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,640
the

1644
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,719
um

1645
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:58,039
octahedral values so that you can see it

1646
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,039
a little bit better

1647
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,079
um

1648
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,239
and it's nicer

1649
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:14,719
right i mean to be sure it's definitely

1650
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:16,799
a little bit nicer uh but i don't know

1651
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,960
that it really solves the problem like

1652
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,119
it it hides the problem but

1653
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,800
i don't know like the i still think

1654
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:24,639
there's some kind of core problem with

1655
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,719
the fact that we're not really capturing

1656
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:28,560
that lighting well enough i don't know

1657
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:31,359
maybe it's fine

1658
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:34,719
um it i think it does help a little

1659
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:34,719
uh but it's not

1660
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:39,799
it's not quite right um

1661
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:08,279
so

1662
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:08,279
yeah

1663
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:30,800
i'm gonna go ahead and turn back on our

1664
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:33,199
other lights also so i can see how that

1665
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,520
affected

1666
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:35,519
um

1667
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:40,399
you know just if the if the interior is

1668
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:42,638
lit again

1669
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:44,799
what does that look like uh just so we

1670
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,600
can get a better sense of it

1671
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,199
um

1672
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,199
i would say it doesn't really affect

1673
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:50,799
those lights in any particular way like

1674
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:54,000
they don't look better or worse they

1675
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,840
just look fine either one

1676
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,359
so i would say it's pretty low cost to

1677
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,039
keep this uh

1678
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:00,399
if we didn't make any other improvements

1679
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:02,158
we would probably want to keep it

1680
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:04,158
because it it looks better than the

1681
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:06,399
alternative i think

1682
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:06,399
um

1683
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:12,319
you know i would i would say it probably

1684
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:16,199
does look better than the alternative

1685
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:16,198
it's still not great though

1686
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,920
um

1687
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:41,759
so yeah i'm still not completely

1688
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:41,760
thrilled with that and

1689
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,399
i kind of want to do a little bit of

1690
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:49,399
testing i guess is what i would say

1691
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:03,119
so so i might do that um

1692
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:05,279
now yeah so so like in the chat

1693
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:07,198
frisio9 said i still believe this might

1694
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:08,639
just be an artifact of too low voxel

1695
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:10,799
resolution

1696
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:13,760
and what we see is actually expected

1697
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:18,480
given the current constraints um

1698
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:19,440
i'm pretty sure that is not true

1699
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:22,718
so

1700
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:23,919
a linearly interpolated voxel can

1701
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:28,000
capture

1702
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:29,760
spherical falloff perfectly

1703
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,600
at any

1704
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,199
resolution

1705
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:36,000
um

1706
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:36,960
the only thing it can't do

1707
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,639
is

1708
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,760
capture the

1709
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,119
uh the

1710
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,480
if if

1711
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:44,559
two

1712
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,638
it can't capture an interior curve so if

1713
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,600
you're curving from

1714
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,960
like

1715
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,440
uh

1716
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,439
like if you think of quartering a circle

1717
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:55,198
if two quarters of the circle have to

1718
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:56,158
happen inside the same voxel cell it

1719
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:58,079
wouldn't

1720
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:59,359
right

1721
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:03,920
um

1722
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:05,119
and so uh it's it's i think a problem

1723
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,920
not

1724
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:08,319
with

1725
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,319
um

1726
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:17,840
with the fact that we are using a voxel

1727
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:17,839
and and more a problem that just we are

1728
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,239
not producing the right function in our

1729
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,039
voxel

1730
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:26,879
and let me try to substantiate that

1731
01:24:25,039 --> 01:24:30,479
slash debug this

1732
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:31,520
so let's suppose that we um take out

1733
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:35,039
the

1734
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:36,639
uh this this particular this

1735
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:38,560
sort of

1736
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:40,800
interpolant here

1737
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:43,280
uh and go back to standard linear uh

1738
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,440
which again i think looks great honestly

1739
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:47,759
i i think it looks good

1740
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:48,879
and really my only complaint is

1741
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,119
this sort of

1742
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:53,760
we're getting things are too blocky you

1743
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:55,119
know out here

1744
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,560
right

1745
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:58,559
i so

1746
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,920
what i would like to do is say well what

1747
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,360
would happen

1748
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,639
just to just to sort of motivate this a

1749
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:04,399
little bit what would happen if i

1750
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:07,119
literally just set

1751
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,319
uh the values in the voxel

1752
01:25:07,119 --> 01:25:09,519
to be

1753
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:11,039
uh

1754
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,080
directly

1755
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:16,000
the falloff function from a point

1756
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:18,479
and again this is just me trying to kind

1757
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,960
of like convince you and or for my

1758
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:22,559
debugging purposes so that i can have a

1759
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,760
known function that i can put in there

1760
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:28,239
and validate which again is also

1761
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,039
would be really handy right

1762
01:25:28,238 --> 01:25:31,198
um

1763
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:33,519
let's make sure that that actually would

1764
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:34,960
look okay and look correct uh and then

1765
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,800
you can also see it so that you know

1766
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,399
that i'm not lying

1767
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,320
and or it doesn't work and then i know

1768
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:41,839
we have a bug because i'm quite certain

1769
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:43,920
that this works

1770
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,319
in math uh

1771
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,399
maybe not in our code

1772
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:50,479
so let's suppose we go into the internal

1773
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:55,119
lighting core i if you look at what

1774
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:57,359
happens right we set up these work units

1775
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:59,519
uh and they all go and do their little

1776
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:02,880
uh happy dance

1777
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:05,679
uh and that happy dance is is full cast

1778
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,119
right uh so full cast is the is the work

1779
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:10,079
function

1780
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:16,000
uh what we do is we loop over all of the

1781
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:18,158
voxels assigned to a particular thread

1782
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,439
and uh we

1783
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:22,879
so like each thread takes a an xz

1784
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:25,359
cross section

1785
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:27,279
right of of the atlas each each thread

1786
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:29,519
does

1787
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:29,519
um

1788
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,600
which by the way we probably have to fix

1789
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:35,279
to doing a

1790
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,440
a more

1791
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:39,519
discrete partic partition than that

1792
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,839
because if you had something that was

1793
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,120
more threads they would not be able to

1794
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,760
effectively work on it we probably need

1795
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:48,079
to split x up because before we were

1796
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,960
assuming like oh well okay

1797
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:50,319
um

1798
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,198
you know there's going to be a lot of

1799
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:53,840
these

1800
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:56,719
and blah blah now there's only really

1801
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:58,960
like there's only two sheets in z

1802
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,960
so

1803
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,400
yeah you know maybe that is not the

1804
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:06,879
smartest thing and maybe we should

1805
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:10,479
partition it so that we have like more

1806
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:15,560
like z is split for each one as well so

1807
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:15,559
there's just more granularity there like

1808
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,760
because like let's suppose you ran this

1809
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:43,599
on like a thread ripper or something

1810
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,360
you know what i'm saying

1811
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,000
um

1812
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:51,519
you know like

1813
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,960
you're not gonna get uh

1814
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:55,120
you're not gonna get any acceleration

1815
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,480
because there aren't 64 different pieces

1816
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:58,158
to work on

1817
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:00,238
so you know

1818
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:01,359
um

1819
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:03,759
so yeah

1820
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,759
yeah yeah

1821
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:11,359
so let's go ahead and and uh take a look

1822
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,120
and if i just go ahead what i was going

1823
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:16,399
to do is to say like what if we just put

1824
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:19,039
in a hard-coded light value here

1825
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:20,960
so instead of doing full cast we just

1826
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:23,039
did something that wrote

1827
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,719
specifically to the octahedral map like

1828
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:27,760
a thing

1829
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:29,600
that was a circular pattern so we could

1830
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,639
verify that the falloff

1831
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,480
you know was

1832
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,159
was roughly correct

1833
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:36,799
right that it that

1834
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:42,599
we would reconstruct it properly

1835
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:42,600
um and and what we could do is say

1836
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:58,639
i mean i'm not sure exactly how you

1837
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,239
would want to how you'd want to do this

1838
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:02,159
like do we want to just write them all

1839
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:03,759
into the same

1840
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:06,079
into the same one

1841
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,079
um

1842
01:29:06,158 --> 01:29:10,839
like the transfer pps value here

1843
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:20,559
so what i'm saying is like look we would

1844
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:22,960
say okay

1845
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,840
transfer pps

1846
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,840
i

1847
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,560
so we're going to have to produce eight

1848
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:41,759
values here so maybe what we do is we

1849
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,760
just set them all the same thing

1850
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,760
temporarily

1851
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:58,880
uh and then we set you know this fall

1852
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:02,719
off funk this is what we're actually

1853
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:05,199
gonna do here we would lerp between

1854
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:07,600
you know zero

1855
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:08,879
uh and one i guess we don't really need

1856
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,639
to do that because we know we can just

1857
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,560
produce that value so

1858
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:14,480
maybe the falloff funk is just gonna be

1859
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:17,600
fall off

1860
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:20,479
like three times and then fall off

1861
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,400
uh is gonna be like clamp clamp01 some

1862
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:24,638
distance function

1863
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:24,638
right

1864
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:30,520
uh you know one minus some distance

1865
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,520
between

1866
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:40,238
so i guess we just do length

1867
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,600
uh

1868
01:30:40,238 --> 01:30:43,599
you know the the length of

1869
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,880
between some light location

1870
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:51,198
which we'll just put at the origin for

1871
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,800
now

1872
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:55,359
uh and we'll just say that it's going to

1873
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:58,239
be the length of the light location to

1874
01:30:55,359 --> 01:30:58,238
wherever we're at

1875
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:03,039
it's not the ray origin it's the center

1876
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:06,319
of the thing so it's

1877
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:06,319
whatever that light probe p

1878
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:16,519
um so that should be a radial falloff

1879
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,520
um

1880
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,800
what is the complaint compiler

1881
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:30,920
i agree that should not be a parentheses

1882
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,079
um

1883
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,920
so i guess what i would say is like that

1884
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:43,439
to me

1885
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,199
looks just wrong

1886
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:47,359
so i think there's something else going

1887
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:49,439
on bad here right because that should

1888
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:53,639
not

1889
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:53,638
that should not really be the case

1890
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,439
of course it's inside one so maybe not i

1891
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:09,479
don't know we'll find out

1892
01:32:05,439 --> 01:32:09,479
we'll find out in a second

1893
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:23,840
okay so i'm

1894
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:26,840
pretty sure that is completely wrong

1895
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,840
um

1896
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,400
that interpolation is broken

1897
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:37,760
i'm pretty sure

1898
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:40,880
um

1899
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:42,960
and so if that's

1900
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:44,400
maybe i filled this out wrong but if i

1901
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,399
did actually fill this out correctly

1902
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:48,158
this would be why we're getting so such

1903
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:53,638
squarey stuff because that should not it

1904
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:53,638
should not look anything like that um

1905
01:32:54,479 --> 01:33:00,319
well okay that's not actually true

1906
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:02,238
so you have to do the subtraction you do

1907
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:04,559
have to have a light floor in order for

1908
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:05,519
that to work

1909
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:09,280
so

1910
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:11,600
i guess i would say well

1911
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:13,119
not exactly

1912
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:15,199
um

1913
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:18,639
so let me keep going on that front

1914
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:22,000
because you do need to not have it

1915
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:23,920
ever hit actual zero

1916
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,479
so you have to be able to do the floor

1917
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:28,960
the thing that i removed before

1918
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:32,799
you need to have so in other words right

1919
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,800
here where we do this lerp

1920
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:38,638
and we produce this light value

1921
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:42,319
uh at the end of it

1922
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:44,000
we do have to basically floor like drop

1923
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:45,198
this down

1924
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,800
further

1925
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:48,000
first

1926
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,000
so

1927
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
um

1928
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:54,000
in other words

1929
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:05,520
some value here

1930
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:09,039
that we agree on is our floor value has

1931
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:11,280
to be removed prior to the rest of the

1932
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:12,960
process right

1933
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:15,198
and we're going to have to clamp it as

1934
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,198
well

1935
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,840
so so that's gonna be

1936
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:23,039
an issue um

1937
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:26,039
like it's gotta get clamped to zero

1938
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:26,039
which

1939
01:34:39,198 --> 01:34:43,599
it's clamp zero inf yeah that's the one

1940
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:47,319
oops

1941
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,560
let's do it this way

1942
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,320
okay

1943
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:06,239
so basically like after we sort of

1944
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:07,198
you know do this whatever random fog

1945
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:08,799
thing which we should probably just

1946
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:11,118
remove for now because if we're gonna do

1947
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,119
fog we would do it differently

1948
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:15,039
um

1949
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:17,039
and hey look there's our exact circle

1950
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:18,560
which is what we would expect

1951
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:20,880
right

1952
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,880
um

1953
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,480
something's a bit odd about that though

1954
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:27,118
like

1955
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:29,839
i guess i'm not sure why it creates such

1956
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:29,839
a stark

1957
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:36,239
uh is it because this is too much light

1958
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:37,920
to be removing i don't actually know

1959
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:42,439
is it because the clamp zero infinity is

1960
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:42,440
broken what's happening there

1961
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:54,319
i'm not really sure why that's happening

1962
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:55,840
right like like uh

1963
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:57,039
i will say that that part was was

1964
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:00,560
confusing

1965
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:00,560
that was legit confusing

1966
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:11,439
um but here you can see that the proper

1967
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:14,239
reconstruction of a circle once you

1968
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:15,919
remove a floor value from it so that the

1969
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:18,079
the function doesn't get confused

1970
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:20,719
outside of there

1971
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:23,118
um i don't know what to expect if you

1972
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,639
were to remove a slight floor value

1973
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:26,799
prior to feeding it through that

1974
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:29,039
function in general

1975
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,039
um

1976
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,840
so

1977
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:35,759
that's

1978
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,159
i don't know

1979
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:41,430
what that will do um

1980
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:41,430
[Music]

1981
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:46,399
so

1982
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:48,399
yeah

1983
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:50,158
and and i don't know why there's no

1984
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:51,679
other lighting like where is all the

1985
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:54,000
lighting i don't know what's going on

1986
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:55,279
right now did i break something else

1987
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,000
when i was

1988
01:36:55,279 --> 01:36:58,000
messing with that

1989
01:36:59,359 --> 01:37:04,559
because if i take this

1990
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:06,399
out if i take this out of the equation

1991
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:10,719
the rest of it should run pro the same

1992
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:10,719
right this was all i changed i thought

1993
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:20,439
what am i missing

1994
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,399
what horror hath i

1995
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,880
inflicted upon thy world

1996
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:32,359
like all i added i added literally just

1997
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,359
that right

1998
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:43,920
how is it possible is all of the

1999
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:47,239
lighting happening literally between 0

2000
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:47,239
and 0.05

2001
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:55,359
that doesn't seem possible is clamp zero

2002
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:59,719
inf actually busted

2003
01:37:55,359 --> 01:37:59,719
or am i misunderstanding something

2004
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,639
i mean that looks right

2005
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:14,639
so is it just like so let's suppose i

2006
01:38:11,439 --> 01:38:14,638
said i subtract nothing

2007
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,840
don't subtract anything

2008
01:38:21,118 --> 01:38:23,599
all good

2009
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:31,600
and now let's suppose i i

2010
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:33,439
100 like one hundredth of the total

2011
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:35,920
light value

2012
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:38,238
what happens then

2013
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:41,118
so subtracting

2014
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:43,519
only just that much

2015
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:48,559
is like where all of our light is how

2016
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:48,560
about one one thousandth of the light

2017
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:56,198
that is just crazy

2018
01:39:02,319 --> 01:39:05,759
it's crazy right

2019
01:39:04,399 --> 01:39:08,319
don't you think

2020
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,920
how small that is all right so suppose

2021
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:11,118
we um

2022
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:13,840
were to

2023
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:16,719
to subtract a larger amount i'm just

2024
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:20,079
curious what this does

2025
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:20,079
uh to our interpolator

2026
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,880
i mean

2027
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:27,840
it's very circular

2028
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:31,840
right

2029
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:35,360
i mean it is right so it does seem like

2030
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:37,920
it's a function reconstruction problem

2031
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:40,920
do you know what i'm saying

2032
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,920
um

2033
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,239
uh this is not specular by the way

2034
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:51,439
whoever said that in chat uh this is

2035
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:51,439
just the diffuse map right

2036
01:39:52,238 --> 01:39:55,638
at this point

2037
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,199
right

2038
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:02,399
so we're only looking at diffuse uh

2039
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:02,399
specular would be this

2040
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:09,079
that's that's specular

2041
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,760
right

2042
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,819
so um

2043
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,819
[Music]

2044
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,840
gosh

2045
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:35,118
i am

2046
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:36,639
uh well that both confirms and surprises

2047
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:40,000
me

2048
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:42,000
it confirms what i was thinking before

2049
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
but also it surprises me that so much of

2050
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,640
the light is down in the lower

2051
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,719
end of the range

2052
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:48,719
[Music]

2053
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:54,759
alrighty then

2054
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,760
um

2055
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:18,800
yeah

2056
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,960
well anyway

2057
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:23,119
um so

2058
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,840
that confirms my suspicion though right

2059
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:25,679
so

2060
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:30,000
if you look at what happens when you try

2061
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:30,000
to interpolate the linear function

2062
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:33,760
you can see pretty clearly that where

2063
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:35,760
you get the square artifacts are where

2064
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:38,400
you lose the ability to interpolate

2065
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,719
because you no longer have a sample

2066
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:42,479
anymore of that function the function

2067
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:44,239
that you were trying to

2068
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,158
reproduce

2069
01:41:44,238 --> 01:41:48,319
you don't have a sample of that function

2070
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:52,079
in the next cell over the function is

2071
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:54,319
just has gone straight to zero

2072
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:54,319
um

2073
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:02,239
and so

2074
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:04,319
if you capture the light and you say

2075
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:06,799
well we're just going to use

2076
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:08,079
like a natural floor function that we

2077
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,159
remove out

2078
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:12,399
after we do the interpolation you get

2079
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:14,000
your correct circles back

2080
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:16,960
but the problem is you also get

2081
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,960
incorrect light levels

2082
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:21,560
so how do you fix that

2083
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:47,919
hmm

2084
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:50,799
i say

2085
01:42:49,359 --> 01:42:53,359
hmm

2086
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,400
is is the thing that i'm saying so i

2087
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:56,799
don't know

2088
01:42:54,399 --> 01:42:58,238
i mean i don't really know how you would

2089
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,480
fix that

2090
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:02,799
and

2091
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:05,039
you know if you crank it down to

2092
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:07,119
whatever level would be necessary to

2093
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:09,600
actually

2094
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:11,839
uh deal with the light levels as they

2095
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,840
are

2096
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,239
um

2097
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:21,839
it doesn't help you right so like this

2098
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:23,119
level of flooring doesn't do anything

2099
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:26,000
right

2100
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:28,238
um whereas this level of flooring does

2101
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,439
but it removes so much light

2102
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:33,759
that it doesn't help you reproduce the

2103
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:36,559
circles that you want

2104
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:38,000
i mean you get nice circles but

2105
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:40,719
you've removed so much light that you

2106
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,719
can't see anything

2107
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:50,440
although it is kind of a nice effect

2108
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:50,439
it's not one we can really use

2109
01:44:18,158 --> 01:44:21,839
is the acs film functioning trading the

2110
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,960
venice um

2111
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,880
no

2112
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,920
not particularly it's it's pretty

2113
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,350
neutral

2114
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,760
um

2115
01:44:26,350 --> 01:44:29,679
[Music]

2116
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:32,000
you can actually see like okay so that's

2117
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:34,480
what it looks like with the acs film

2118
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,479
function

2119
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:39,760
and

2120
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:42,319
oops if i just

2121
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,320
remove it

2122
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:50,799
uh you can watch the change

2123
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:55,199
you know

2124
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,040
that's it

2125
01:44:55,198 --> 01:44:58,879
uh if anything i'd say it's slightly

2126
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:03,639
better

2127
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,639
right let's go back this is without it

2128
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:07,279
and there's with it uh

2129
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,279
you know neither is great but it seems

2130
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,600
like the acs one's actually a little bit

2131
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:13,599
better

2132
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:17,839
to me

2133
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:31,679
so i don't

2134
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:33,920
know um i don't have a strong opinion

2135
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:36,719
about it i would say this looks good

2136
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:37,600
enough probably now um with the film in

2137
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:40,079
there

2138
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:40,079
i don't know

2139
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:45,319
uh it's pretty reasonable

2140
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:53,198
like i feel like you could ship this and

2141
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:56,319
maybe what you do is you just don't you

2142
01:45:53,198 --> 01:45:58,799
don't make a lot of regions

2143
01:45:56,319 --> 01:46:02,238
that have this kind of feel to them

2144
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:03,840
right like don't do exactly this

2145
01:46:02,238 --> 01:46:05,919
because you you know whenever you're in

2146
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:08,239
a region that actually has any kind of a

2147
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:11,199
lighting scheme at all it looks totally

2148
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:13,839
good right everything looks great

2149
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,839
um

2150
01:46:21,439 --> 01:46:27,599
and even this area looks like okay

2151
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:29,679
it's not great

2152
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:32,000
it's only really the grasses

2153
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:35,039
that look pretty bad uh for whatever

2154
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,039
reason they're you know

2155
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,840
we have hopped out of the game

2156
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:47,079
so

2157
01:47:00,158 --> 01:47:03,679
so i guess what i will say is it does

2158
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:08,199
kind of answer the question of like look

2159
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:08,199
if you don't have the floor flooring

2160
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:12,559
then linear interpolation is not going

2161
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:15,439
to cut it

2162
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:17,760
right i mean that's just kind of

2163
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:17,759
true

2164
01:47:18,158 --> 01:47:22,198
uh

2165
01:47:19,198 --> 01:47:22,198
so

2166
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:37,839
so i guess there's not a lot we can

2167
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,840
really do because you know

2168
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:43,359
would be practical to up the voxel

2169
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:45,279
resolution

2170
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:46,880
uh yeah i mean i guess

2171
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:48,559
i don't know

2172
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:52,159
i don't know that we can really it'll

2173
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:53,679
just make the square be

2174
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:55,599
smaller i don't know that that's really

2175
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:57,440
going to help but i mean yeah like we

2176
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,520
could because maybe

2177
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:01,118
maybe if we move this to the gpu we can

2178
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,880
increase the voxel resolution to the

2179
01:48:01,118 --> 01:48:05,039
point where it's fine

2180
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,560
um

2181
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:09,679
yeah i don't think that's a realistic

2182
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:12,719
option right now but like with

2183
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:14,399
you know with the with moving it to the

2184
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:15,439
gpu we would get a massive speed

2185
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:18,238
increase

2186
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:19,839
uh or even just to a more modern cpu

2187
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:21,039
we'd get a massive speed increase we'd

2188
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,039
get like

2189
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:24,880
four x or something moving to a zen

2190
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:27,679
three right so

2191
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:28,800
you know you could pretty easily double

2192
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:32,319
both

2193
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:33,199
uh your voxel

2194
01:48:32,319 --> 01:48:35,519
uh

2195
01:48:33,198 --> 01:48:37,118
dimensions for sure so yeah i mean

2196
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,480
that's definitely true

2197
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:39,519
um

2198
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:41,599
so

2199
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:43,199
let's give that a shot i guess so the

2200
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:46,079
the problem we're gonna have is that i

2201
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:48,799
don't actually remember how the vauxhall

2202
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:51,679
look up dim stuff even really works

2203
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:53,920
but so let's suppose that i i double it

2204
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:53,920
here

2205
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:57,920
like so

2206
01:48:56,158 --> 01:48:59,279
and i think we might have to introduce a

2207
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:01,359
corresponding scale because i don't know

2208
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:02,800
that we actually divide up i think we

2209
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:04,158
actually just use

2210
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:06,159
they're they're always placed so that

2211
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:07,519
would just do a larger

2212
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:09,599
uh region

2213
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:11,360
right it's not going to actually

2214
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:13,760
like that's just going to produce a

2215
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:15,519
larger lighting region like you can see

2216
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:16,960
uh that it's actually totally messed up

2217
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:19,280
right like this

2218
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:21,520
this part right now is is going to be

2219
01:49:19,279 --> 01:49:23,759
like indexing out of

2220
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,560
out of bounds right because it's too

2221
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,800
large

2222
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:28,480
so we would need like a way to shrink

2223
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:30,880
that down and

2224
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:33,118
uh so the

2225
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:35,679
the part that actually like uh starts

2226
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:35,679
the lighting

2227
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:40,559
that would have to

2228
01:49:38,189 --> 01:49:43,039
[Music]

2229
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:46,960
have

2230
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:48,880
uh that resolution so so

2231
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:51,520
this

2232
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,960
um would have to be like

2233
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:56,679
a point

2234
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,679
five thing

2235
01:50:08,479 --> 01:50:12,559
i don't know why that's

2236
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,800
producing a

2237
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:17,119
uh difference there why we're getting an

2238
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,800
out of bounds actually look at that

2239
01:50:17,118 --> 01:50:23,319
um don't

2240
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:23,320
think we sh should

2241
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:33,118
what is the spatial cell dim

2242
01:50:30,649 --> 01:50:37,399
[Music]

2243
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:37,399
two times the voxel cell dim

2244
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:45,599
atlas cell count

2245
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:47,280
is a specialist size yeah so i think

2246
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:49,840
we should probably look at why why i

2247
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:51,599
don't know why that's having

2248
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:53,440
a weird

2249
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:54,719
effect on anything

2250
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:57,118
um

2251
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:59,279
i guess technically that should be

2252
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:01,519
a 1.0 there but

2253
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:01,519
um

2254
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:08,158
yeah we might have to switch into debug

2255
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:10,400
mode and find out what's the problem

2256
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:10,399
there

2257
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,719
like who what is what is going on here

2258
01:51:15,039 --> 01:51:18,238
in the grid to build spatial partition

2259
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:21,840
it's like

2260
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:21,839
it's getting like an out of bounds

2261
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,920
uh look up here for some reason but i

2262
01:51:24,319 --> 01:51:27,920
don't actually know why that would be

2263
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,520
happening

2264
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:39,960
doesn't make a lot of sense

2265
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,920
you

2266
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,520
yeah i'm not sure that's that's a bit

2267
01:52:24,079 --> 01:52:26,880
disquieting so i don't know why that

2268
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,239
would happen so let's take a quick look

2269
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,760
at why that is maybe it's something

2270
01:52:28,238 --> 01:52:31,118
obvious that we should be thinking about

2271
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,079
so i'm going to switch this to d and i'm

2272
01:52:31,118 --> 01:52:34,479
going to let it crash and then i'm going

2273
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:35,679
to look at what's going on there

2274
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:37,198
because i would like to be able to

2275
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:38,560
change that resolution

2276
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:40,399
even though i don't think we can afford

2277
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:43,280
it at the moment like i agree that we

2278
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:43,279
should run that test

2279
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:46,800
just so we have a better idea

2280
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:53,279
uh so give this a second

2281
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:54,000
um

2282
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:55,198
to

2283
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,520
to put

2284
01:52:55,198 --> 01:53:01,719
poot itself

2285
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:01,719
it's it's gonna have to put forth

2286
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:07,119
don't seem to be getting a lot of

2287
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:08,158
crashiness here

2288
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:11,479
probably just because it's not running

2289
01:54:08,158 --> 01:54:11,479
fast enough

2290
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:42,920
this is riveting

2291
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:15,439
okay

2292
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:17,599
so we finally after much waiting get to

2293
01:55:15,439 --> 01:55:19,919
the part that we are looking for here

2294
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:21,199
which is in flat index

2295
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,440
uh from

2296
01:55:21,198 --> 01:55:25,359
and the index that it's asking for is

2297
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:27,839
out of bounds of the grid so you know

2298
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:27,839
the grid

2299
01:55:28,079 --> 01:55:36,639
uh has a cell count 30 22 1

2300
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:37,520
and you know it's asking for 18 9 1

2301
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:39,039
uh

2302
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:39,920
and

2303
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:41,599
you know

2304
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,960
that that is

2305
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,560
it's the z

2306
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:46,350
value there

2307
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:48,560
that's actually incorrect so

2308
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:50,079
[Music]

2309
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:52,800
not sure i

2310
01:55:50,079 --> 01:55:55,279
know what's going on there because

2311
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,880
i would have expected it to be another

2312
01:55:55,279 --> 01:55:59,359
one of the

2313
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:00,400
i guess yeah i wouldn't expect a z to

2314
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:02,000
ever be a problem

2315
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:04,000
and in fact when we were doing these

2316
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,439
insertions since there are not multiple

2317
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,960
levels of z

2318
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:11,039
uh the min max node here uh this part

2319
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,158
doesn't i don't even know why we're

2320
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:13,118
getting

2321
01:56:12,158 --> 01:56:15,759
that

2322
01:56:13,118 --> 01:56:17,920
happening in the first place

2323
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:19,760
the spatial grid itself what it does

2324
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:22,319
good index for p

2325
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:24,800
yeah like i guess our z is just not

2326
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:27,198
clamped to the correct amount we can fix

2327
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:29,920
that pretty easily by just removing this

2328
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:32,000
iterator because we don't allow there to

2329
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:33,920
be multiple z's anyway so the z is

2330
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,158
always zero and we don't actually need

2331
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:38,480
to loop over it

2332
01:56:36,158 --> 01:56:38,479
um

2333
01:56:39,039 --> 01:56:42,399
and i guess in the reason that we were

2334
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:44,639
having this problem is because

2335
01:56:42,399 --> 01:56:47,039
the get index for p it's just on the

2336
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:49,679
outside of where those bounds should be

2337
01:56:47,039 --> 01:56:51,279
so i guess changing the resolution i

2338
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:52,639
don't know why that would actually cause

2339
01:56:51,279 --> 01:56:54,880
that problem though because we're not

2340
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:56,480
changing the z part of this so it is a

2341
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:57,679
little bit concerning

2342
01:56:56,479 --> 01:56:59,359
um

2343
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:00,719
but i guess i will say that you know we

2344
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:02,319
probably should simplify this because we

2345
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:03,920
did remove z

2346
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:05,759
so we don't have

2347
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:07,599
like there isn't multiple z now it's

2348
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:09,840
it's literally just that

2349
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:11,039
um so that entire thing should never be

2350
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:12,719
a problem

2351
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:14,880
but you know

2352
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:14,880
i

2353
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:19,519
i don't really know

2354
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:26,960
we didn't like optimize this code path

2355
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:28,800
for the non-z case that we ended up

2356
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:31,118
switching to

2357
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:33,840
uh where you know the spatial index for

2358
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:35,279
z is just always going to be zero

2359
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:37,119
uh

2360
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:39,840
no matter what happens in this case

2361
01:57:37,118 --> 01:57:39,839
right

2362
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:51,000
same with this

2363
01:57:56,719 --> 01:58:00,239
so let me take a quick look and just

2364
01:57:58,319 --> 01:58:01,920
make sure that all these things yeah

2365
01:58:00,238 --> 01:58:04,919
like we even had an assertion there for

2366
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,920
it

2367
01:58:12,079 --> 01:58:15,760
uh and i don't know what's going on

2368
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:18,639
there i guess the problem is somehow our

2369
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:22,159
z bounds are not

2370
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:22,159
as high as they should be

2371
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:28,079
i'm not sure exactly what was going on

2372
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:29,039
with that let's see if this fixes it

2373
01:58:28,079 --> 01:58:30,960
because i don't really want to

2374
01:58:29,039 --> 01:58:33,039
investigate that right now

2375
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:34,639
but you know again we took z out of

2376
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:38,000
everything and we did it pretty quickly

2377
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:39,840
so we probably don't quite have it right

2378
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,679
um but i don't know

2379
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:44,400
this may not be enough to fix it let's

2380
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:47,399
let it freak out again with the stupid

2381
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:47,399
glove

2382
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:11,440
so i would say it definitely looks

2383
01:59:10,479 --> 01:59:15,000
better

2384
01:59:11,439 --> 01:59:15,000
right i mean

2385
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:34,158
i mean i could convince myself

2386
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:34,158
that that was better

2387
01:59:36,319 --> 01:59:41,840
you do see the sampling error more right

2388
01:59:38,399 --> 01:59:45,000
you can see like the shining

2389
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:45,000
it's interesting

2390
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:49,839
so let's

2391
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:52,400
let's

2392
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,400
take a look

2393
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:00,920
and if we increase that one more time

2394
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:23,520
uh we've got to yeah that's going to be

2395
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:26,639
too dense for it because remember we're

2396
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:28,400
sending down floats for these things so

2397
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:30,639
i mean it's not

2398
02:00:28,399 --> 02:00:33,598
yet you're not wrong like it definitely

2399
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:36,880
does improve the situation

2400
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:39,440
um so maybe it is just not

2401
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:41,599
sufficient sampling levels

2402
02:00:39,439 --> 02:00:43,279
for what we need

2403
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:45,760
and if that's the case and i guess we're

2404
02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:47,359
just kind of screwed like use bigger

2405
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:49,520
light sources

2406
02:00:47,359 --> 02:00:50,880
is your pretty much your only option at

2407
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:53,880
that point

2408
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:53,880
um

2409
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:18,319
so i don't know

2410
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,319
i don't know

2411
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:23,840
i do not know

2412
02:01:32,479 --> 02:01:37,839
yeah bigger and slightly weaker light

2413
02:01:34,238 --> 02:01:37,839
source right um

2414
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:54,800
all right well

2415
02:01:53,118 --> 02:01:56,238
i don't know

2416
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:57,920
i'm not feeling particularly inspired

2417
02:01:56,238 --> 02:01:59,919
today so i can't say that i have any

2418
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:01,170
really great ideas about what we would

2419
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:02,840
do after this

2420
02:02:01,170 --> 02:02:05,440
[Music]

2421
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:08,239
um it's not quite as good as i would

2422
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:11,039
like but it's also still pretty good um

2423
02:02:08,238 --> 02:02:13,439
we could just try like you know playing

2424
02:02:11,039 --> 02:02:16,079
to the strengths of the system

2425
02:02:13,439 --> 02:02:17,678
and you know using light sources that

2426
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:20,158
are going to be

2427
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:22,560
like larger than

2428
02:02:20,158 --> 02:02:23,359
what we're currently making

2429
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:26,480
uh

2430
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:28,880
that's certainly one option

2431
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:32,079
like here you know we've got these are

2432
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:33,679
you know maybe we we update these to be

2433
02:02:32,079 --> 02:02:35,920
more like

2434
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:38,239
larger lights

2435
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:42,239
maybe like 0.7 or whatever and then we

2436
02:02:38,238 --> 02:02:42,238
drop the brightness down

2437
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:49,840
and maybe that's fine i don't know uh

2438
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:52,639
because again like we can make the light

2439
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:55,440
itself the thing itself be bright

2440
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:58,480
um and so maybe we just use larger light

2441
02:02:55,439 --> 02:03:01,359
sources and we call it a day uh because

2442
02:02:58,479 --> 02:03:02,799
i don't know how squary those would look

2443
02:03:01,359 --> 02:03:04,079
um

2444
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:05,199
like i don't know it's still a bit

2445
02:03:04,079 --> 02:03:07,519
squarey

2446
02:03:05,198 --> 02:03:07,519
um

2447
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:11,440
but it's not that bad like i can live

2448
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,000
with that

2449
02:03:11,439 --> 02:03:15,598
um

2450
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,520
we do have the ability to change the

2451
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:18,239
interpolator again i'm not sure we want

2452
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:20,320
to

2453
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:22,319
uh but we do have the ability to change

2454
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:24,639
it and we don't really know also to try

2455
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:26,719
other interpolators

2456
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:28,159
um but i don't really think that's going

2457
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:30,480
to solve our problem to be completely

2458
02:03:28,158 --> 02:03:32,638
honest with you

2459
02:03:30,479 --> 02:03:32,638
i

2460
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:37,520
i don't know any amount of interpolation

2461
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:40,319
is really going to fix that

2462
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:42,159
i mean maybe it does

2463
02:03:40,319 --> 02:03:43,118
i don't know

2464
02:03:42,158 --> 02:03:45,439
um

2465
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:47,359
like it still just kind of looks

2466
02:03:45,439 --> 02:03:50,719
like it looks it just looks

2467
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:52,399
a little bit more radial but oh well

2468
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:54,078
um

2469
02:03:52,399 --> 02:03:55,439
so i don't know so maybe you just have

2470
02:03:54,078 --> 02:03:57,359
to make sure maybe there's like a

2471
02:03:55,439 --> 02:03:59,919
certain nyquist maybe we try to like

2472
02:03:57,359 --> 02:04:01,519
move it to the gpu and get

2473
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:02,639
um

2474
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:05,119
and make it

2475
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:07,279
go faster so that we can have a denser

2476
02:04:05,118 --> 02:04:08,479
sampling i don't know

2477
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:11,479
right

2478
02:04:08,479 --> 02:04:11,479
um

2479
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,920
i don't know

2480
02:04:17,359 --> 02:04:21,359
is it trivial to move to the gpu i mean

2481
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:22,960
yes and no

2482
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:25,279
it's trivial in the sense that there's

2483
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:28,078
no log there's be like the exact same

2484
02:04:25,279 --> 02:04:29,519
logic basically it's very very time

2485
02:04:28,078 --> 02:04:31,840
consuming and annoying because

2486
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:33,440
programming sucks like the way that

2487
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:35,599
these things are written

2488
02:04:33,439 --> 02:04:36,638
has to be completely different and you

2489
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:38,639
know the

2490
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:41,118
gpus suck to program in general because

2491
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:42,880
the environment for debugging is

2492
02:04:41,118 --> 02:04:44,559
super lousy

2493
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:47,279
um

2494
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:49,840
so yeah so maybe i mean let's put it

2495
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:52,639
this way looking at this

2496
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:57,360
you might say that like you could

2497
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:57,359
believe if you just cranked up the um

2498
02:04:58,319 --> 02:05:04,078
if you just cranked up the actual like

2499
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:06,560
resolution that maybe that's enough but

2500
02:05:04,078 --> 02:05:08,399
i don't know i mean it still also kind

2501
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:10,880
of looks very squarey

2502
02:05:08,399 --> 02:05:12,399
in here it doesn't and i think part of

2503
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:14,400
that is just

2504
02:05:12,399 --> 02:05:17,039
again when you get out here the reason

2505
02:05:14,399 --> 02:05:19,839
is there's no there's nothing else

2506
02:05:17,039 --> 02:05:21,359
you're only seeing just that fall off

2507
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:23,679
right

2508
02:05:21,359 --> 02:05:23,679
um

2509
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:29,840
because there's basically no bounce

2510
02:05:28,078 --> 02:05:32,238
lighting there's no nothing

2511
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:35,560
there right whereas everywhere else you

2512
02:05:32,238 --> 02:05:35,559
get more

2513
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:40,559
there's more that's filling it in and

2514
02:05:38,158 --> 02:05:40,559
you know

2515
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,320
so i don't know

2516
02:06:17,039 --> 02:06:23,158
what is the right solution to this

2517
02:06:20,158 --> 02:06:23,158
problem

2518
02:06:54,078 --> 02:06:57,198
so let's ask

2519
02:06:55,520 --> 02:07:00,239
a question

2520
02:06:57,198 --> 02:07:02,960
let's ask the following question

2521
02:07:00,238 --> 02:07:05,839
suppose we were to increase the power of

2522
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:05,840
the light source

2523
02:07:10,479 --> 02:07:14,078
right

2524
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:16,480
so let's say that i increase the power

2525
02:07:14,078 --> 02:07:19,920
of this light source to a very high

2526
02:07:16,479 --> 02:07:21,519
level it's at five now or something

2527
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:23,359
right

2528
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:25,040
um

2529
02:07:23,359 --> 02:07:26,799
again i'm just

2530
02:07:25,039 --> 02:07:30,238
trying to think about how you would go

2531
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:30,239
about fixing this problem

2532
02:07:30,479 --> 02:07:34,638
so suppose we change this so that the

2533
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:36,960
lights are larger uh you know than they

2534
02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:39,599
should be or whatever and then they're

2535
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:42,639
super powerful like here's my blown out

2536
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:44,639
light source gonna come get you

2537
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:47,199
uh and then i remove the light floor

2538
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:49,920
from the very powerful light so you know

2539
02:07:47,198 --> 02:07:52,238
we're we're gonna try the light floor

2540
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:56,560
removal trick again

2541
02:07:52,238 --> 02:07:57,839
so i say like okay clamp zero in

2542
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:01,119
um

2543
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:02,449
surface reflect rgb minus v3

2544
02:08:01,118 --> 02:08:03,679
and it's like gonna remove

2545
02:08:02,449 --> 02:08:06,000
[Music]

2546
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:06,000
um

2547
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:08,960
you know some amount i don't remember

2548
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:11,360
how much

2549
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:13,679
we need to remove uh oops

2550
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:13,679
um

2551
02:08:14,238 --> 02:08:17,598
i forgot the semicolon

2552
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:23,599
the entire world crashed because i

2553
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:25,520
forgot the semicolon isn't that the

2554
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:28,719
programming way

2555
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:28,719
not in python it's not

2556
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:40,479
so right like you can kind of see now

2557
02:08:38,238 --> 02:08:40,479
that

2558
02:08:42,078 --> 02:08:49,000
if you just increase the power of the

2559
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:49,000
light source you can still get that

2560
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:54,159
that same trick

2561
02:08:54,719 --> 02:08:58,000
and now it looks right

2562
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:05,840
i feel like i feel like there's a way to

2563
02:09:03,279 --> 02:09:05,840
do this

2564
02:09:55,279 --> 02:10:01,039
i feel like there's a way to do this

2565
02:09:58,078 --> 02:10:03,599
and i just don't quite understand

2566
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:03,599
it enough

2567
02:10:05,599 --> 02:10:09,159
to do it

2568
02:10:21,679 --> 02:10:24,679
um

2569
02:10:28,078 --> 02:10:32,479
on a second

2570
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:34,399
let's change the way we're writing this

2571
02:10:32,479 --> 02:10:38,078
just so it's a little easier to see so

2572
02:10:34,399 --> 02:10:38,078
we're a hundred times in our light

2573
02:10:38,319 --> 02:10:41,359
uh and then that would mean you just

2574
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:44,239
subtract one

2575
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:46,559
from it for now

2576
02:10:44,238 --> 02:10:46,559
okay

2577
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:58,239
and and here's

2578
02:10:57,198 --> 02:11:00,879
us

2579
02:10:58,238 --> 02:11:02,959
in our room doing stuff

2580
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:03,679
right

2581
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:06,639
uh

2582
02:11:03,679 --> 02:11:10,440
then we go and say

2583
02:11:06,639 --> 02:11:10,440
okay we want

2584
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:17,040
we want the fall off

2585
02:11:19,118 --> 02:11:27,078
to be smoother to zero though

2586
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:27,078
right so when we subtract the one away

2587
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:49,198
well i guess i'm not sure exactly why

2588
02:11:47,198 --> 02:11:50,719
that produces i'm still not quite sure

2589
02:11:49,198 --> 02:11:53,678
why it produces exactly what we're

2590
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:57,118
seeing now so that is a little bit tough

2591
02:11:53,679 --> 02:12:01,000
but let's say i 10x these lights

2592
02:11:57,118 --> 02:12:01,000
so they're in the mix again

2593
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:26,078
i feel like i don't understand quite why

2594
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:27,520
we are getting

2595
02:12:26,078 --> 02:12:29,359
so i'm doing something wrong we

2596
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:31,360
shouldn't actually be getting what i'm

2597
02:12:29,359 --> 02:12:34,359
seeing right now

2598
02:12:31,359 --> 02:12:34,359
um

2599
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:38,800
after the flooring trick it's

2600
02:12:47,439 --> 02:12:54,519
doesn't quite make sense to me

2601
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:54,520
why that would be happening

2602
02:13:15,279 --> 02:13:18,559
i'm a little bit confused as to why that

2603
02:13:17,118 --> 02:13:20,238
would be happening

2604
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:22,480
oops i'm going to

2605
02:13:20,238 --> 02:13:24,479
power these lights up even more i'm

2606
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:25,919
going to make these full bright

2607
02:13:24,479 --> 02:13:31,078
so i just want to see what's going on

2608
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:31,078
because i don't quite understand it

2609
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:49,679
yes something's a little bit off about

2610
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:51,280
this

2611
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:52,960
because all that should be happening is

2612
02:13:51,279 --> 02:13:57,118
things should be getting a little bit

2613
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:58,399
dimmer as you turn that number up

2614
02:13:57,118 --> 02:14:02,920
but that's not

2615
02:13:58,399 --> 02:14:02,920
really what's happening right

2616
02:14:21,118 --> 02:14:24,399
what if we tried to

2617
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:27,279
like i wonder to what extent this would

2618
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:28,158
work if we just try to sort of clamp

2619
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:29,519
well

2620
02:14:28,158 --> 02:14:31,198
i guess it's not really going to work

2621
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:34,560
but i'm saying like is i wonder if

2622
02:14:31,198 --> 02:14:34,559
there's a way to really like

2623
02:14:35,399 --> 02:14:41,198
sort of smooth out that transition

2624
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:42,320
region

2625
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:43,609
differently

2626
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:45,359
than what we're doing so

2627
02:14:43,609 --> 02:14:48,319
[Music]

2628
02:14:45,359 --> 02:14:51,319
all right so so let's not do that

2629
02:14:48,319 --> 02:14:51,319
and

2630
02:14:56,399 --> 02:15:00,238
you know we'll go back to what i was

2631
02:14:57,599 --> 02:15:00,239
doing before

2632
02:15:04,639 --> 02:15:06,639
all right

2633
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:09,639
um

2634
02:15:06,639 --> 02:15:09,639
so

2635
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:14,480
if we don't subtract one

2636
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:20,239
i guess i didn't need to restart it but

2637
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:22,319
i did

2638
02:15:20,238 --> 02:15:24,718
if we don't subtract one here is our

2639
02:15:22,319 --> 02:15:24,719
world

2640
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:29,359
uh everything looks hunky-dory

2641
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:37,199
but we have our blockiness problem

2642
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:39,520
it's a little too blocky

2643
02:15:37,198 --> 02:15:42,399
so if i go

2644
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:44,560
in here and like what happens if i just

2645
02:15:42,399 --> 02:15:46,879
say

2646
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:46,880
you know

2647
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:53,840
what happens if i square the light value

2648
02:15:56,238 --> 02:15:59,598
more blocky less blocky

2649
02:16:01,039 --> 02:16:08,960
like way less blocky

2650
02:16:04,078 --> 02:16:08,960
not very much light but way less blocky

2651
02:16:09,039 --> 02:16:12,039
right

2652
02:16:32,318 --> 02:16:36,159
and i i guess i would say it's for this

2653
02:16:34,398 --> 02:16:39,439
for exactly that reason right because

2654
02:16:36,159 --> 02:16:42,239
now a lot of that tail those low

2655
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:43,280
the low values in the tail

2656
02:16:42,239 --> 02:16:45,280
are now

2657
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:48,800
you can't see where they actually hit

2658
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:52,280
their zero they're spread out further

2659
02:16:48,799 --> 02:16:52,279
you know what i'm saying

2660
02:17:38,718 --> 02:17:43,919
so i wonder if there's something we can

2661
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:47,199
do um

2662
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:48,799
so let's go back to our desmos here

2663
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:49,519
i wonder if there's something we could

2664
02:17:48,799 --> 02:17:52,638
do

2665
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:52,639
where we would be

2666
02:17:54,558 --> 02:17:58,718
kind of flattening that bottom part more

2667
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:59,760
heavily

2668
02:17:58,718 --> 02:18:02,159
so

2669
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:05,159
like if we were to take this

2670
02:18:02,159 --> 02:18:05,159
thing

2671
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,398
and um

2672
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:43,679
is that right

2673
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:54,719
all right

2674
02:18:52,638 --> 02:18:58,079
so

2675
02:18:54,718 --> 02:18:58,079
is that undo yeah

2676
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:10,239
so yeah i'm thinking what if we did more

2677
02:19:07,679 --> 02:19:10,239
like that

2678
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:14,880
right

2679
02:19:12,879 --> 02:19:16,638
um and now we would need to kind of

2680
02:19:14,879 --> 02:19:20,518
adjust potentially the rest of this

2681
02:19:16,638 --> 02:19:20,518
thing although maybe not

2682
02:19:20,558 --> 02:19:25,599
so what's b normally

2683
02:19:22,718 --> 02:19:25,598
vso3

2684
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:35,840
so what if we just said no no no b is

2685
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:35,840
zero

2686
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:41,398
what happens then

2687
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:41,398
more blocky less blocky

2688
02:19:50,559 --> 02:19:54,159
kind of hard to say

2689
02:19:52,239 --> 02:19:57,920
not really that big of a difference

2690
02:19:54,159 --> 02:19:57,920
either way i guess one would

2691
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:03,840
one would argue

2692
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:20,800
so we may want to play with that value

2693
02:20:18,959 --> 02:20:23,799
as well let's let's zoom on in there

2694
02:20:20,799 --> 02:20:23,799
again

2695
02:20:42,959 --> 02:20:48,079
i really wish it didn't i really really

2696
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:49,840
wish it did not reset the

2697
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:51,760
view

2698
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:54,760
that makes it really hard to compare

2699
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:54,760
right

2700
02:21:02,478 --> 02:21:06,119
so z at 0.5

2701
02:21:44,239 --> 02:21:48,680
i don't know still not really good

2702
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:48,680
enough

2703
02:21:56,398 --> 02:22:00,959
oh i did type 0.5 oh whoops okay hold on

2704
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:03,840
a second yeah let me let me take a look

2705
02:22:00,959 --> 02:22:03,839
at that really quickly

2706
02:22:06,478 --> 02:22:10,719
but i don't think this is gonna work

2707
02:22:08,478 --> 02:22:10,719
like

2708
02:22:12,639 --> 02:22:17,199
it's not quite a it's not quite a

2709
02:22:15,439 --> 02:22:20,200
winning strategy you know what i'm

2710
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:20,200
saying

2711
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:37,639
like it's pretty good

2712
02:22:38,239 --> 02:22:44,359
it's pretty good it's just not quite a

2713
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:44,359
winning strategy

2714
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:14,520
uh

2715
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:27,880
it's not quite a winning strategy

2716
02:23:33,439 --> 02:23:36,840
so i don't know

2717
02:24:02,159 --> 02:24:06,239
i don't know

2718
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:06,240
we may have to perk on this

2719
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:10,720
i

2720
02:24:08,239 --> 02:24:13,439
and like i said maybe we just go forward

2721
02:24:10,719 --> 02:24:14,879
with this and say look you know we know

2722
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:17,200
roughly like

2723
02:24:14,879 --> 02:24:19,759
this is basically like what the game

2724
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:22,640
will then look like right like

2725
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:26,079
like this is good enough that we can you

2726
02:24:22,639 --> 02:24:27,760
know maybe add a maybe add like a glow

2727
02:24:26,079 --> 02:24:29,439
pass

2728
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:31,600
on there and then and then you're

2729
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:33,280
basically like that's it right that's

2730
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:36,479
what the game looks like

2731
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:38,960
and you know the the squariness is not

2732
02:24:36,478 --> 02:24:40,559
maybe fabulous but you just say look it

2733
02:24:38,959 --> 02:24:42,478
won't really change the look of the game

2734
02:24:40,559 --> 02:24:44,079
it'll just improve the quality if later

2735
02:24:42,478 --> 02:24:45,519
we try

2736
02:24:44,079 --> 02:24:48,000
doing something where maybe we do it on

2737
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:50,960
the gpu and do a denser sampling or

2738
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,959
something right

2739
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:58,000
uh and so maybe we just call it a day

2740
02:24:55,520 --> 02:25:00,239
and say okay we can go ahead and

2741
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,239
and

2742
02:25:00,398 --> 02:25:03,199
pull the 3d out of the collision

2743
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,318
detector

2744
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:06,399
and then

2745
02:25:04,318 --> 02:25:07,680
you know put in some of the gameplay

2746
02:25:06,398 --> 02:25:09,680
rooms

2747
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:12,079
and just see assuming that they all look

2748
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:13,520
fine in this we just say look if the

2749
02:25:12,079 --> 02:25:14,639
quality improves later it improves but

2750
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:17,520
we don't

2751
02:25:14,639 --> 02:25:19,840
like we know what it looks like now

2752
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:21,760
the lighting you can you can have all of

2753
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:22,880
the game design

2754
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:24,478
rooms

2755
02:25:22,879 --> 02:25:26,639
can just assume that the lighting looks

2756
02:25:24,478 --> 02:25:28,159
basically like this and if the quality

2757
02:25:26,639 --> 02:25:29,840
improves from here it shouldn't like

2758
02:25:28,159 --> 02:25:32,398
materially change everything in the

2759
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:34,000
design right like it shouldn't

2760
02:25:32,398 --> 02:25:35,439
like break anything at that point i

2761
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:38,439
don't think

2762
02:25:35,439 --> 02:25:38,439
um

2763
02:25:38,799 --> 02:25:41,279
so i would say like yeah we just add

2764
02:25:40,159 --> 02:25:42,959
some bloom

2765
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:45,280
because we need that like add

2766
02:25:42,959 --> 02:25:46,879
self-illumination and bloom to our past

2767
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:48,399
because right now i don't even know how

2768
02:25:46,879 --> 02:25:50,079
that's specified

2769
02:25:48,398 --> 02:25:52,719
um i think we had something random in

2770
02:25:50,079 --> 02:25:54,559
there for it but it's like not

2771
02:25:52,719 --> 02:25:56,239
i don't really remember exactly how like

2772
02:25:54,559 --> 02:25:58,000
that's how these things

2773
02:25:56,239 --> 02:26:00,079
it's how this stuff is showing up right

2774
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,680
now kind of like a bad self-illumination

2775
02:26:00,079 --> 02:26:03,280
thing that's happening

2776
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:04,318
um so i know we've got something in

2777
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:06,000
there that's getting past anyway we

2778
02:26:04,318 --> 02:26:09,359
should go clean that up and make sure

2779
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:09,359
we're passing down something sane

2780
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,719
uh and the other thing we should

2781
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:14,560
probably do is send these things down to

2782
02:26:12,719 --> 02:26:16,079
16 bit or something we are sending these

2783
02:26:14,559 --> 02:26:17,279
down as full float right now for no

2784
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:18,879
reason at all

2785
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:21,520
uh and that doesn't need to be happening

2786
02:26:18,879 --> 02:26:22,719
either i suppose but you know

2787
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:23,760
so

2788
02:26:22,719 --> 02:26:25,519
all right

2789
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:26,960
so let's call it a day i think that's

2790
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:28,560
good enough for now

2791
02:26:26,959 --> 02:26:31,919
um

2792
02:26:28,559 --> 02:26:33,199
we'll have to think a bit uh

2793
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:36,239
we'll have to think about what we want

2794
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:37,840
to do and maybe the answer is like look

2795
02:26:36,239 --> 02:26:41,039
for any further quality we're just going

2796
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:44,559
to go ahead and and do this on the gpu

2797
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:46,800
and try to sample the voxel more densely

2798
02:26:44,559 --> 02:26:47,600
and that's that that's how that's going

2799
02:26:46,799 --> 02:26:49,039
to

2800
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:51,120
improve the

2801
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,960
you know

2802
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:55,120
the look or whatever

2803
02:26:52,959 --> 02:26:56,239
else you know is supposed to happen

2804
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:58,479
there

2805
02:26:56,239 --> 02:27:00,398
um i also don't know i assume that the

2806
02:26:58,478 --> 02:27:03,199
the spheres

2807
02:27:00,398 --> 02:27:04,559
doesn't help here either uh

2808
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:08,319
i don't think we tried it with the

2809
02:27:04,559 --> 02:27:08,318
latest version necessarily but

2810
02:27:08,879 --> 02:27:13,358
uh with the spheres

2811
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:16,079
i don't think it would change anything

2812
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:17,520
but we should double check to make sure

2813
02:27:16,079 --> 02:27:20,840
that it wouldn't because i don't

2814
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:20,840
actually know

2815
02:27:30,239 --> 02:27:34,639
i don't see any really material

2816
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:34,639
difference there

2817
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:39,478
looks about the same

2818
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:02,880
it also really looks

2819
02:28:00,959 --> 02:28:04,559
the other thing too is

2820
02:28:02,879 --> 02:28:06,478
at eight samples

2821
02:28:04,559 --> 02:28:08,639
it actually also looks great as long as

2822
02:28:06,478 --> 02:28:10,159
you're in an area with some reasonable

2823
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:12,318
amount of light

2824
02:28:10,159 --> 02:28:14,318
so you really only need the 16 samples

2825
02:28:12,318 --> 02:28:16,000
when you're in an area like this

2826
02:28:14,318 --> 02:28:17,760
where it's higher and even then you can

2827
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,600
get away with it so i may leave it at

2828
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:20,478
eight for now as well

2829
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,880
uh

2830
02:28:20,478 --> 02:28:24,879
and and we'll go from there

2831
02:28:22,879 --> 02:28:26,318
all right i'm happy with this i'm happy

2832
02:28:24,879 --> 02:28:27,599
to call this the lighting that we'll use

2833
02:28:26,318 --> 02:28:29,920
for now

2834
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:29,920
um

2835
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:35,040
yeah i'm happy with that

2836
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:36,960
we can we can just

2837
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:38,800
we can just make that be that

2838
02:28:36,959 --> 02:28:41,358
i don't think we have to go any further

2839
02:28:38,799 --> 02:28:44,478
than that for now

2840
02:28:41,359 --> 02:28:44,479
all right good work team

2841
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:50,239
i can still punch through walls we'll be

2842
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:51,600
fixing that in a moment but

2843
02:28:50,239 --> 02:28:53,280
all right

2844
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:55,600
all right i'm going to call that a day i

2845
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:58,159
think we're good uh next time we'll just

2846
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,920
add bloom i think is what we'll do

2847
02:28:58,159 --> 02:29:02,000
and then we'll just say that's as good

2848
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:04,000
as it's gonna get until we basically

2849
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:06,559
ship like

2850
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:10,159
you know maybe we put this on the gpu

2851
02:29:06,559 --> 02:29:11,279
way way um

2852
02:29:10,159 --> 02:29:12,559
go back to

2853
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:14,000
yeah the frame rate's a little too high

2854
02:29:12,559 --> 02:29:16,000
okay fair enough

2855
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,559
um but i think that's it

2856
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:20,639
so we're gonna we're gonna call it

2857
02:29:18,559 --> 02:29:22,318
that's just where it's at

2858
02:29:20,639 --> 02:29:23,760
so thank you everyone for joining me

2859
02:29:22,318 --> 02:29:25,680
it's been a pleasure coding this always

2860
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:27,280
i think the lighting looks fantastic

2861
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:29,680
unfortunately we do have that blockiness

2862
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:29,680
problem

2863
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:35,880
nothing's perfect um

2864
02:29:36,239 --> 02:29:40,000
and

2865
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:41,920
i guess what i would say is

2866
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,680
we can probably just lean on the gpu to

2867
02:29:41,920 --> 02:29:46,318
solve that for us in the future we can

2868
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:48,559
probably just say you know what

2869
02:29:46,318 --> 02:29:51,359
um if you want really amazing

2870
02:29:48,559 --> 02:29:53,519
circular-ness on your lights then go buy

2871
02:29:51,359 --> 02:29:54,720
an nvidia rtx if you can actually find

2872
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:56,800
one

2873
02:29:54,719 --> 02:29:59,599
um steal one from the cryptocurrency

2874
02:29:56,799 --> 02:29:59,599
miner next door

2875
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:03,840
uh and

2876
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:05,439
you know we'll do a gpu pass at the end

2877
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:08,318
where where we just put the lighting on

2878
02:30:05,439 --> 02:30:10,318
the gpu side and and go buy more

2879
02:30:08,318 --> 02:30:11,760
hardware if you want to look cleaner

2880
02:30:10,318 --> 02:30:13,199
right

2881
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:13,380
um

2882
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:16,479
so

2883
02:30:13,379 --> 02:30:19,119
[Music]

2884
02:30:16,478 --> 02:30:21,438
so yeah

2885
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:23,280
so there you go

2886
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:25,439
we did the rtx on comparison yeah

2887
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:26,399
exactly all right thanks er for joining

2888
02:30:25,439 --> 02:30:28,159
me

2889
02:30:26,398 --> 02:30:30,079
uh i'll be back here next week maybe

2890
02:30:28,159 --> 02:30:31,600
we'll do the bloom and then we'll just

2891
02:30:30,079 --> 02:30:32,478
call the lighting kind of shelled for

2892
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:33,920
now

2893
02:30:32,478 --> 02:30:35,438
and move on to cleaning up some of the

2894
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:36,799
other stuff i

2895
02:30:35,439 --> 02:30:38,960
probably need to get the room trend

2896
02:30:36,799 --> 02:30:40,239
going try to generate some stuff like

2897
02:30:38,959 --> 02:30:41,279
room gen and collection detection so

2898
02:30:40,239 --> 02:30:42,799
that we can kind of just like play

2899
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:44,800
through some rooms

2900
02:30:42,799 --> 02:30:46,398
um

2901
02:30:44,799 --> 02:30:48,398
and get the lighting i want the lighting

2902
02:30:46,398 --> 02:30:51,119
to work nicely with like the gameplay

2903
02:30:48,398 --> 02:30:52,000
down there uh so just try to make that

2904
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:52,800
stuff

2905
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,318
uh

2906
02:30:52,799 --> 02:30:55,599
make some more sense so we'll we'll get

2907
02:30:54,318 --> 02:30:56,478
that going

2908
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:58,239
uh

2909
02:30:56,478 --> 02:30:59,679
that's it for today until next time have

2910
02:30:58,239 --> 02:31:03,199
fun program everyone and i'll see you on

2911
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:03,200
the internet take it easy everybody
