1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
have someone come and talk to us about

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:07,139
it Hann VidCon is sort of the the

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,179
overall like structural aspects of you

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,099
know how teens work at large game

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,900
companies or how the whole process you

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,759
know how hiring works how do you

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,230
management works things like you know

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,960
coding guidelines all these sorts of

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,859
things there's tons of stuff involved in

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,480
that and I just like can't really offer

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,340
much insight into it because in a

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,810
project like handmade hero again much

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:33,058
like the asset scale session with Chris

14
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:36,089
we we just don't run into any of these

15
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:38,128
things but you know having a team work

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,070
well is just as important as having the

17
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,979
code work well if not more so and so

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,429
I've invited Marco Kugler from Blizzard

19
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:49,378
to talk to us about how basically their

20
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:52,049
their studio functions and answer all of

21
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,939
the questions that I actually often get

22
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:57,030
asked on screen but unfortunately can't

23
00:00:53,939 --> 00:01:00,628
answer because I really just don't have

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,299
that kind of experience to to give sort

25
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:07,099
of a good answer so please welcome Marco

26
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,099
and we'll be talking about

27
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,429
so give us some background because this

28
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,370
is new to me too

29
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,320
like how where did you get started in

30
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,329
game programming you you've worked at a

31
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,459
too big engine companies like high tech

32
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:24,719
and Blizzard so tell us a little bit

33
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:28,109
about your backgrounds for people who

34
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,090
don't know you already ok so I mean as

35
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:32,700
many in here I probably started out as a

36
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,400
hobbyist just being interested in

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,430
playing games and then trying to figure

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,909
out how they function and I'm from

39
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,250
Germany so I went through kind of school

40
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,969
there studied computer science there

41
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,299
wasn't a lot of kind of game curriculum

42
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:53,129
out there so a lot of the knowledge was

43
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,978
kind of like self-taught you'll find

44
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:59,489
people online and maybe collaborate on a

45
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:01,799
few projects some folks might recognize

46
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:05,909
like flip code or or communities like

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,859
that so so that's where I kind of got to

48
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,310
ask my questions and had knowledgeable

49
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,430
people give answers and then after I

50
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,870
finished my computer science degree I

51
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:19,140
was like thinking about what what am I

52
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,259
going to do with it there's this scary

53
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:25,559
game programming thing and maybe there's

54
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,030
a safer thing that is like staying at at

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,039
a university and maybe doing like

56
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,289
computer graphics research and stuff

57
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,109
like that so I was like well I'm gonna

58
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:36,150
give this games thing a try I sent out a

59
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,049
bunch of resumes mostly with graphics

60
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,769
demos and a company that at that point

61
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:45,239
hadn't released anything called Crytek

62
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:49,140
they were the first to respond I got to

63
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,150
interview and was hired to work on the

64
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:54,059
first console project that critique was

65
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,890
going to work on on the original Xbox so

66
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,379
xbox crisis

67
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,328
No No

68
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,968
[Music]

69
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:05,700
yeah the the project like I arrived and

70
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:08,818
I was supposed to be like a gameplay

71
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:13,949
programmer on that and within a month it

72
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:16,729
got cancelled okay so then they moved

73
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:19,318
everybody over to work on farcry and

74
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:21,149
that's kind of the first game that I got

75
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:25,560
to work on so I got to do that for the

76
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:28,760
like final year of that as a game play

77
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,759
and at the end multiplayer programmer

78
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:35,759
and just fixing things working on weapon

79
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:39,239
systems and first-person shooters and

80
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,250
then because Crytek is kind of like a

81
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:48,329
small company at that time right

82
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:50,669
how big is small I think it was up to 60

83
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:57,239
people like 60 people that shipped

84
00:03:50,669 --> 00:04:00,510
farcry and the lead programmer of farcry

85
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,280
left and they were like oh we need a new

86
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:04,709
lead programmer so I ended up being the

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,158
lead programmer for crisis at the start

88
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,269
of that project okay and then because

89
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:13,048
titles mean very little things that

90
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,609
small companies yes then at some point

91
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,538
the person that was tech director on

92
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:20,158
that game he left so they're like all

93
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:23,430
right I guess you're gonna be tech

94
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:25,589
director of that okay so yes for people

95
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,530
who are unfamiliar with the term and

96
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:29,668
also even for people who are the company

97
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,319
to company there's definitely some

98
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:33,269
variation there it's not quite the

99
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,158
Hollywood model where it's like this job

100
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:37,049
means this specific thing can you say

101
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:37,978
late for Hollywood it means something

102
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,598
completely different

103
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:44,129
yeah you're talking to more like a Texan

104
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:45,779
yes so I mean more how their roles are

105
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:48,120
very really decide so the director does

106
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,918
you know this and this right in our case

107
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,870
tech director at different companies can

108
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,758
mean sort of very different things so

109
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,399
can you give us a little sort of

110
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,720
background on at Crytek what's the

111
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,370
difference between say a tech director

112
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,880
and a lead programmer or something like

113
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,129
this um I think so

114
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,110
at Crytek the structure was you had the

115
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:10,120
game team and you had the R&amp;D team and

116
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,910
the R&amp;D team worked on the engine and

117
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,519
the tech director was similar to the

118
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,590
lead programmer they're not lead game

119
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:21,490
programmer but lead programmer I said

120
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:23,919
and as such you were interfacing with

121
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,600
the engine team and kind of making sure

122
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,350
that the needs of the game are met by

123
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,460
the engine obviously since we're kind of

124
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,910
primarily like the engine was developed

125
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:36,909
for crisis at the time a lot of those

126
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,630
needs were very entangled and because of

127
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:43,330
kind of the graphics background I had I

128
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:46,719
was able to speak Rd enough to be able

129
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:49,419
to talk to those guys and yeah kind of

130
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,610
their learned all about 30 modern

131
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:55,060
workflows at the time of just being able

132
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,689
to rapidly iterate on stuff and yeah and

133
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,819
then after after crisis at some point I

134
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:03,370
was like I want to not work on the

135
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:07,269
first-person shooter and I have always

136
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,970
liked desert and and now I worked on

137
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:11,829
something that me being in Germany is

138
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,050
probably gonna get recognized but

139
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:17,859
somebody over here when I sent my resume

140
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:21,300
and so I took the chance to to talk with

141
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:27,460
lizard and I was playing Wow at the time

142
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:30,610
so as a lot of people were and yeah got

143
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:34,870
to interview for that as an engine

144
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,850
programmer God because Crytek

145
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,720
always kind of wanted to work on that

146
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,520
and had the chance at the end but there

147
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,050
were just a lot of kind of proceeded

148
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,399
positions from the people that kind of

149
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:51,879
found that yes for me and the core

150
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:54,339
engine team there and at blizzards I my

151
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,889
application data for Blizzard was

152
00:06:54,339 --> 00:07:00,250
basically me kind of looking at World of

153
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,779
Warcraft and kind of deducing well you

154
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,430
must be doing these things and these

155
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:05,979
things and this is kind of maybe how

156
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:08,019
your engine works and without having to

157
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,450
go in and redo everything

158
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:13,209
there's maybe this list of things that

159
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,129
you could be doing okay in terms of like

160
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:17,319
making the game look a bit more modern

161
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:20,079
and

162
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:23,079
not appraising it but remastering some

163
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,909
of the old parts and yeah you kind of

164
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,439
sent them a list of low-hanging fruit if

165
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,530
you will you were like I think the

166
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:31,149
zoning is you hard for you to do and

167
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,569
you'd get some bang for the buck out of

168
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:36,189
this looking from the outside in yeah

169
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:38,740
making a lot of assumptions over how

170
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,930
things work those were all though

171
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,939
hanging fruits yeah and I think not

172
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:50,620
everything on that this is currently

173
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:52,389
done yes okay there's a lot of things

174
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,319
you wouldn't expect how they were done

175
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:59,019
the way they were done okay that's and

176
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,300
so how long have you been tech director

177
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,829
there so if in tech director for almost

178
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,960
four years okay

179
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:08,319
I went some time I guess the third tech

180
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,349
director on on world of warcraft and

181
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:15,849
I've been at the company for seven and a

182
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:17,890
half years okay so I guess let me sort

183
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,360
of ask some of the questions and you can

184
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,129
go anywhere you want with usage or

185
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,009
please don't feel as you have to say

186
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:25,389
anywhere within them but let me start

187
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,219
off by asking some some fairly basic

188
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:29,969
stuff and you kind of one of the things

189
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,440
that I wanted to ask you kind of already

190
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,418
started getting into it which was how

191
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,000
you apply to branch out with Blizzard

192
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:40,120
for example so yeah let's talk about

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,190
that sort of whole segment of how the

194
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,710
company would be run so it start may be

195
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,540
about giving some idea of what is the

196
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,240
team structure wizard in terms of the

197
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:50,559
programmers you know how do they get

198
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,299
hired like what how do they break down

199
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,189
into two teams like that give us some

200
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,959
idea of what it takes to actually make

201
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,410
the company function as a programming

202
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,590
team at this point right so yeah one

203
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:05,379
thing to say is that at lizard isn't a a

204
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,690
firm rule like one way to view Blizzard

205
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:11,110
is more like there's Blizzard and then

206
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,570
there is a bunch of semi independent

207
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:17,680
studios that which work on different

208
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:19,840
teams so like I work on team two which

209
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,809
was the second game play a game team

210
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,899
that Blizzard kind of had at the time

211
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:28,809
and yeah like you have the people that

212
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,539
work on the RTS stuff there's folks that

213
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:34,189
work on

214
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:36,289
I'll blow over watch hearthstone and so

215
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,649
forth and then you have also on the

216
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:42,588
engineering side kind of shared more

217
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:45,559
shared teams like battlenet there's a

218
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:48,819
huge group they were online platform

219
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,708
stuff and then corporate applications

220
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:53,870
things that like groups of people that

221
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:57,198
work on say the performance appraisal

222
00:09:53,870 --> 00:10:00,049
tool that you run like reviews or

223
00:09:57,198 --> 00:10:01,909
something literally mechanical aspects

224
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:03,740
of running the company are you know they

225
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:07,850
might automate some of these yeah and

226
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,350
these teams all work at this

227
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:14,629
traditionally when I joined the company

228
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:16,930
they were almost autonomous and over

229
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:20,528
time like especially like in the last

230
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:22,638
four years or so there's been a shift to

231
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:24,259
trying to share more technology between

232
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,829
those groups and and trying to

233
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:30,889
standardize a bit more because it just

234
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:32,359
doesn't scale right nice and there's you

235
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:34,879
have like an engine team here here here

236
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,860
here and so that they really are fairly

237
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,389
separate meaning you know it's maybe a

238
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,399
library gets passed back and forth but

239
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:42,198
for the most part it's fairly insular in

240
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,509
terms of the stuff that ships and

241
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:47,000
Warcraft is not the stuff that ships in

242
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:48,528
Diablo or something like this yeah if

243
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,698
there's knowledge that gets exchanged

244
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:56,299
there's I think like some folks call it

245
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:59,528
code stealing because we tasted because

246
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:02,509
co-chairing like starts implying

247
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:05,750
maintenance and support and that gets

248
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:07,370
difficult for people that have their

249
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,568
production schedules to to kind of

250
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:16,039
manage but as I kind of said that that

251
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:17,688
is shifting a bit at the moment so in

252
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:21,500
terms of the structure of World of

253
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:25,549
Warcraft as tech director I'm

254
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,019
responsible for like the teams that

255
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:30,109
build kind of the internal tools we use

256
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:33,169
for development the team that is

257
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:37,310
operating the live service the client

258
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:40,099
team and and kind of infrastructure

259
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:41,859
teams as well and I interface with other

260
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,589
groups that deal with like this

261
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:48,159
how we build a data center and this is

262
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:49,959
the hardware we need to deploy in China

263
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:54,879
or whatever in order to make things go

264
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:58,599
fast and the engineering groups that

265
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:02,470
that I have in particular are trying to

266
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:05,139
go mentally around fake the space so we

267
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,240
have gameplay which I actually have 2d

268
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:09,069
gameplay programmers that report in to

269
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,919
me because the the group is fairly large

270
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,410
and we we try to minimize the number of

271
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,729
people that folks have to manage I do

272
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:17,679
suppose that a game like World of

273
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,620
Warcraft has considerably more gameplay

274
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,629
programming than perhaps you know at

275
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,100
least for its time certainly a

276
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:26,708
contemporary game that was not massive

277
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,480
multiplayer or is that not true um so

278
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:31,088
the original World of Warcraft was

279
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,649
shipped I think with 10 engineers Wow

280
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:38,200
and a team of also like a core team of

281
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:44,470
40 people that I think at the end was

282
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:48,129
like around 60 12 years ago and I think

283
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,860
about four years of development time and

284
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:53,980
that's that's actually very clean for an

285
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,829
MMO I feel like that's probably pretty

286
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,680
tough - pretty tough to go into that and

287
00:12:56,828 --> 00:13:00,669
and have it work out that well I think

288
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,769
people didn't know what they were

289
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:05,889
getting into and that's why they were

290
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:07,659
able to put to do it and the way it was

291
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:09,939
described to me at that time is that a

292
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:12,360
lot of people I mean obviously we were

293
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,740
super passionate about like MMOs and

294
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:20,350
EverQuest and those things right

295
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:23,799
so but they they had like they didn't do

296
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,959
anything super super awesome okay but

297
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:29,439
they didn't do anything shitty okay and

298
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:34,509
so they they got a mean like a mean

299
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,910
level of systems that work reason to be

300
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:38,919
well enough to support this thing right

301
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:40,179
which i think is really the criteria for

302
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,559
having clean ship right it's like you

303
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,929
have to make sure everything is up to

304
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,759
the competency level necessary to make

305
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:47,769
the game be what it needs to be right

306
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,879
and you know yeah if you

307
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:50,318
ended up with a system that's really

308
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,300
good but then one of us is really bad

309
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:53,649
the bad ones gonna cost you a lot more

310
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:56,618
than the Goodwin visor you probably

311
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,239
right right yeah and I mean there's

312
00:13:56,619 --> 00:14:00,759
probably some stuff that we should get

313
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:03,670
into later about how those assumptions

314
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:07,600
that were made like for like 16 years

315
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:11,198
ago aren't really contemporary anymore

316
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:15,129
and and what things that weren't shitty

317
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:17,169
in the past the work that goes into

318
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:19,778
trying to fix that up as as we kind of

319
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:24,759
go along but anyway going back to team

320
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:27,129
kind of structures so we got gameplay we

321
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,230
have server those are the folks that

322
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:32,709
work on the actual like server code as

323
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:36,428
well as kind of the like maintaining the

324
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:38,458
life service then when you say maintain

325
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:40,269
the life service you just mean like I

326
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,948
guess I'm not sure exactly things

327
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:43,058
because you know content could be a part

328
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,278
of that technically like so what do you

329
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:48,009
what do you mean by main to in that

330
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,289
sense so well life service the the game

331
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:53,829
is running let's say somebody discovers

332
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:56,318
a dupe okay okay so server engineers

333
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:59,138
will go analyze that the game is running

334
00:14:56,318 --> 00:15:02,740
people are figuring out a way to break

335
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:04,509
servers or make them crash and they so

336
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,789
there's sort of like an emergency team

337
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:09,129
in some sense in monitor performance the

338
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:11,458
health of the service from a from a

339
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:13,990
server standpoint but it's not

340
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:16,659
monitoring its it's also analyzing kind

341
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:19,329
of the bottlenecks of the code making

342
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:21,938
sure to deploy strategic fixes

343
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:24,938
rolling those outs and there's different

344
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:26,678
disciplines on the server team we have

345
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:30,490
something called reliability engineers

346
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:33,428
that that try to troubleshoot kind of

347
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,619
before it even gets to to other

348
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:36,789
engineers and the team just to kind of

349
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:38,759
point them already in the right

350
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:43,328
direction they also do a lot of

351
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:45,278
deployment of of data hot fixes and like

352
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:47,258
hot fixing as a whole is probably

353
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,470
something that we should also cover

354
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:51,129
later hot fixing yeah there's a bunch of

355
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,259
good stuff there

356
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:56,110
I'm keeping notes yeah then we have

357
00:15:53,259 --> 00:16:00,278
database programmers Wow

358
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,528
lives and breathes kind of with its DB

359
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:02,970
database

360
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,990
programmers in this case mean people who

361
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,160
are programming and off-the-shelf

362
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,769
database where people are programming a

363
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:12,389
database that's custom we are using

364
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:14,459
Oracle ok and they're writing database

365
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:17,850
like they've read in programs for or to

366
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:20,068
Oracle yes got it and there's as the

367
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,850
distinction kind of between the static

368
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:25,528
database which is the world itself like

369
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,120
where are the spawns in the world and

370
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:30,088
all that stuff and then the persistent

371
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,999
DB which is all your player data like

372
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,439
the items you know and spells and stuff

373
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:38,939
like that yes

374
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:42,480
so that kind of covers server then we

375
00:16:38,938 --> 00:16:45,629
have tools team that works on our editor

376
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,920
and other various tools that you start

377
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:56,459
assembling localization tools and and

378
00:16:49,919 --> 00:17:00,289
that type of stuff then engine graphics

379
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:03,958
engine we used to have kind of a shared

380
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:07,230
Mac team at blizzards we just this week

381
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,879
I think decided that like one of the

382
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,099
programmers is now gonna be embedded

383
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,230
with the engine team so because Mac team

384
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,088
means basically there is a centralized

385
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,828
team that just does all the Mac boarding

386
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:18,568
for all of the other teams even though

387
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,730
they're completely different engines and

388
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:22,588
so on right they they work more as a

389
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,459
graphics abstraction and an OS

390
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:33,000
abstraction team and most of the engines

391
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:35,279
initially were kind of tx9 based but the

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,529
backends that I've seen on WoW since

393
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,398
I've been on Wow where there was an

394
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:43,589
OpenGL back-end for Windows there was an

395
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:45,599
OpenGL back-end for the Mac there's a

396
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:47,369
metal back-end for the Mac there's a dx9

397
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,918
back-end for Windows there's a dx11

398
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:56,369
back-end for Windows and we'll see what

399
00:17:49,919 --> 00:18:01,020
else we can collect in the future and

400
00:17:56,369 --> 00:18:03,479
you're just yeah as your as kind of

401
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:05,639
technology moved along your these things

402
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,730
become only soft supported and they

403
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,679
become unnecessary once we can drop

404
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,400
support for Windows XP we probably don't

405
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,940
need the X and

406
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:18,059
anymore so so that type of stuff and I

407
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,220
suppose that the tail on that support is

408
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:22,980
much longer for you because massive

409
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,079
multiplayer games you know can sell

410
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,730
worldwide and you are going to be

411
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,279
supporting like you know hardware from

412
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,720
people who've been playing for yeah how

413
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,339
many years at this point you could have

414
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,259
been playing what you said 16 is that

415
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,509
the number 16 was the beginning of

416
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,920
development malgo yes a 12 would be

417
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:39,629
their release so you might have people

418
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,600
who have literally been playing for 12

419
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:48,059
years on some windows XP box we do we do

420
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,558
and it's depressing if you look at you

421
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:52,349
look at percentages or whatever of that

422
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:55,289
right and any go like well it's you know

423
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:57,209
it's like 1% but it's 1% of how many

424
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,069
million right and then the cycle is it

425
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,009
may be worth to keep it alive and it's a

426
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:03,029
royal custom player right yeah whatever

427
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,589
it's like someone who's with you all the

428
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:06,000
time he's got to feel bad right because

429
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:08,849
you're like well if we turned up through

430
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,190
this thing then but I mean yeah yeah

431
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:13,799
Windows XP gets increasingly harder to

432
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:17,070
afford and especially if you rely on any

433
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:19,289
kind of third-party libraries or

434
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:20,909
whatever righteous they will stop suit

435
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,920
like they've dropped support a long time

436
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,259
ago right so just trying to get things

437
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,080
to compile you you need to hack around

438
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:30,660
kind of like what else to do out of the

439
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:35,089
box red cannot do it yeah say in your

440
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:40,170
language it yeah switch it over so then

441
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:43,409
engine UI is a specialized team so they

442
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,480
work on role as well as a lot of and I

443
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,970
mean yes as an MMO there's there's a lot

444
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,329
of UI but then we also have to support

445
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:54,210
an add-on ecosystem and infrastructure

446
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:57,449
so the community gets to solve all the

447
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:03,120
UI it'll pause that we kind of commit

448
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:05,779
yes then just this is a staggering

449
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:09,419
number of teams that you have to

450
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:12,450
basically I have 90 direct reports at

451
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,789
the moment okay so just kind of working

452
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,850
my way through systems

453
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:19,740
is a group that deals with a lot of the

454
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:25,049
infrastructure whether it's like build

455
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:29,160
systems or for content delivery like

456
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:31,589
being able to stream like you want to

457
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,240
install a partial set of the builds you

458
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:35,339
can still play

459
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,089
we background download stuff while

460
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:40,859
you're kind of installing on the fly

461
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:43,769
because I think Wow is installed right

462
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:46,349
now is 45 gigabytes or something like

463
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:48,450
because it just keeps adding content and

464
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:51,119
because it just keeps yep and we don't

465
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,100
yeah we don't really deprecated the old

466
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,429
stuff because somebody might want to log

467
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:58,859
in at some point and wants to be in gold

468
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:05,160
Shire and level 2 yeah that's where they

469
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:08,099
stop okay then we have a little bit of

470
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,880
an odd team because we it's hard to find

471
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:14,549
a name for it share technology and the

472
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,470
spirit behind that was to take some of

473
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:21,569
the parts of the WoW infrastructure and

474
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:23,579
D Wi-Fi it so that it could be more

475
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:25,379
readily shared within the company but

476
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:31,319
all right now those guys are focusing a

477
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:33,030
lot on our DB kind of systems that both

478
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:37,169
our internal development tools rely on

479
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:39,329
as well as deployment tools okay so they

480
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,990
were originally and you know intended to

481
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:46,710
sort of be almost like a mmm code mining

482
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,569
where we would kind of say this is good

483
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,700
or something else let's try to get it

484
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:52,259
out and and packaged up in a way that

485
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,789
people could use it but they're kind of

486
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:56,279
committed to something else the moment

487
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:58,200
yeah there was some like some efforts

488
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:03,089
were done there we're like wow

489
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,340
schenectady out and then we started

490
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:08,459
sharing that with the overwatch team and

491
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:11,009
they added UDP support to it because we

492
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,950
didn't really write their first person

493
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:16,430
shooter so baby writes these things and

494
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:20,400
then last but not least is automation

495
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:22,950
who are also a bit new to kind of the

496
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,500
WoW team like there was an automation

497
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,910
group that was within blizzards and and

498
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,990
some folks that were supposed to do

499
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:32,580
stuff for

500
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:34,769
for Wow as a whole but just make to ease

501
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:36,509
communication we kind of started

502
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:39,299
embedding them and now they're part of

503
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:41,879
the team and they did a lot of the

504
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:44,669
stress testing we have some automated

505
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,910
systems that do performance measurements

506
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,170
so as we're building content you know

507
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,050
these automated systems that are

508
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,279
monitoring the like building of the game

509
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:57,740
are monitoring the running of the game

510
00:22:53,279 --> 00:23:01,470
um whereas it both so the performance

511
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:05,160
measurement tool is basically loads up

512
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:07,500
certain maps of the game and will place

513
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,500
cameras around the world and you know

514
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,400
get kind of all six directions or

515
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,289
whatever and then create heat maps of

516
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,720
the data because we have a lot of

517
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:22,678
content creators and staying on top of

518
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,380
everything as it's being created like is

519
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:28,470
very difficult I can and you kind of

520
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,090
need to back into that not for me this

521
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,769
is all the art there's committed stream

522
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:34,889
but more like this is all the art as

523
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:37,558
it's being put together and then the

524
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,929
earlier can work on performance the

525
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:44,910
better I'm sure a lot of people kind of

526
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:46,440
know that it's easy and simple but but

527
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,640
yeah there's just phases in the project

528
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,590
where you're paying more attention to

529
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,890
here's new feature development and then

530
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:55,259
at the end comes the OH all this pretty

531
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,170
stuff you may it doesn't really work on

532
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:01,558
our min spec anymore so we're gonna have

533
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:04,140
to start removing it and and making sure

534
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:09,240
that that happens early I think is it's

535
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,830
important so these are sorry and like

536
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,890
that was kind of the performance side

537
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:16,889
but they the stress testing that was

538
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:21,120
more a server performance type of thing

539
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:25,200
where they have a way of simulating kind

540
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:27,989
of user clients on the server and they

541
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,360
spawn up like hundreds of thousands of

542
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,099
them zero and then see what happens and

543
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:35,639
see where the breaking points are gotcha

544
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:40,079
yeah okay so that's actually it

545
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,400
tremendously sort of vast thing to

546
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,369
manage I guess so

547
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,480
it's kind of a fairly tree like

548
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:47,069
structure at that point I'm you said you

549
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,569
have nine reports which is actually a

550
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,909
lot there but it is those each

551
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:53,879
represents fairly large skews mean how

552
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:57,990
big are these these teams I guess um so

553
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:00,780
total it's 65 engineers including the

554
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,130
leads and that that work on the

555
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,500
engineering team of world of warcraft

556
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:07,050
okay so the teams themselves aren't huge

557
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,910
the teams themselves we try to keep them

558
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:12,089
small some are a bit bigger than we

559
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,710
would like because it means that like

560
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:16,079
somebody who is managing like I'm

561
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,750
managing nine people and ideally we'd

562
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:22,319
like to have it around five to seven per

563
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:27,390
manager I see but some of the new

564
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:29,579
arrivals with like automation they it

565
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:32,130
just is the structure we have I'm not

566
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:35,939
sure I do have a partner in this which

567
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:40,020
is Jonathan moon Shaw he's a engineering

568
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:43,140
manager so this is something which again

569
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,759
not every Blizzard team has but some

570
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,640
Blizzard teams do have and the

571
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:51,150
engineering manager partners with me and

572
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,890
the the leads to kind of manage more the

573
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,400
career side of an engineer at the

574
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:59,340
company okay whereas the lead is

575
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:02,130
responsible for the kind of yeah the

576
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:04,500
more the work itself like the actual

577
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:08,280
engineering work that that person does

578
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,980
obviously that's not a clear you know

579
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,359
water water oil right yeah it's not a

580
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,730
perfect split yeah

581
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,009
but having somebody to help off tank

582
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:21,539
certain problems getting a second

583
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:24,119
opinion or a second partner for for an

584
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:26,250
engineer to reach out to to help with

585
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:30,599
career growth and answering those

586
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:32,640
questions it's been very valuable so

587
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:33,928
let's talk about that a little bit

588
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,690
that's one of things I definitely wanted

589
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:39,929
to hear about so if you wouldn't mind

590
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,150
could we walk through for people who

591
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:43,980
like you know maybe they haven't had a

592
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,590
job in the game industry before so

593
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,140
either they're you know a student or

594
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:50,879
somebody learning at home and wants to

595
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,909
someday working a mystery or there's

596
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,859
somebody from a different discipline

597
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,989
you know they do web development or they

598
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:58,788
do you know I mean any really any kind

599
00:26:56,989 --> 00:27:00,319
of development and wants to come to

600
00:26:58,788 --> 00:27:02,769
games and you know knowing it's gonna be

601
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,028
kind of a different structure there so

602
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:06,769
look if you wouldn't mind could we can

603
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:09,589
we to start with West's like how do

604
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:11,210
people come to Blizzard I mean even you

605
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:13,249
yourself who was coming in at a fairly

606
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,429
high level in that transition actually

607
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:17,929
did submit a resume which was yes so

608
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:19,249
could you talk a little bit about since

609
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:19,970
you have a little bit of knowledge about

610
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:23,419
that process

611
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:27,739
where do potential candidates come from

612
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:29,778
and how do you find people who may

613
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:32,929
become you know you want to interview

614
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:37,489
this person or whatever well there's

615
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:40,249
many different paths right so obviously

616
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:42,649
kind of a simpler one is you you've

617
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:46,608
already worked in games like I did and

618
00:27:42,648 --> 00:27:48,408
and then you write a resume and you send

619
00:27:46,608 --> 00:27:51,798
that in and you apply for a certain

620
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:53,599
position and people will kind of look at

621
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:57,288
that resume see how much you're aligned

622
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:59,960
with the job that you're applying for

623
00:27:57,288 --> 00:28:01,429
and then there's usually and this is

624
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,460
kind of the same for everybody there's

625
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:06,919
there's a phone screen where you have

626
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,159
like a 30 minute or 1 hour kind of phone

627
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:12,229
conversations and some small kind of

628
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,139
technical checks that that happened

629
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:16,249
during that time just make sure that

630
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:17,478
you're going to be able to survive in

631
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:22,999
the code base that you're going to land

632
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:26,330
in I see and then that leads to usually

633
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:30,259
an on-site interview and just so again

634
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:33,019
for so I have a good handle on it so you

635
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:35,628
know resumes are coming in from a formal

636
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:37,190
submission process yes so there is you

637
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:38,558
know I go to a website and submit it or

638
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:43,099
something like that happens there's

639
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:45,348
recruiting an HR who will look at like

640
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:47,358
they will pre screen based on

641
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:50,239
conversations that we have with them to

642
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:51,798
kind of guide them for the fit that we

643
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:56,210
are looking for in a certain position

644
00:28:51,798 --> 00:29:00,348
and then you will get a bunch of resumes

645
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:05,269
for like a game play program or position

646
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:06,439
I said and then we we basically look at

647
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:08,179
those and we say

648
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,429
you know like these three candidates

649
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:13,429
look interesting can you maybe set up a

650
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:15,259
phone screen and then that leads to and

651
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:18,048
that phone screen is with actual

652
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:21,288
engineers a team that is not an HR or a

653
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:23,388
recruiter doing the phone screen the yes

654
00:29:21,288 --> 00:29:25,429
the phone screen gets done with usually

655
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:29,058
the the hiring manager which is the lead

656
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:33,639
and our engineering manager and

657
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:37,819
sometimes I'm in there too and the

658
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:39,859
recruiter still tries to be and like the

659
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:42,200
touch point for the person so if he has

660
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:45,709
any questions about the interview

661
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,919
process the company the area you know

662
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,579
like how does relocation work or are

663
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:51,769
those things

664
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:54,168
that's usually the the recruiter that

665
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:57,378
would be answering those questions and

666
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:59,389
then yeah the actual technical part of

667
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:01,278
the interview gets done by the engineers

668
00:29:59,388 --> 00:30:05,209
on the team and the people that you'd be

669
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:08,019
working with and then when we invite

670
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:10,340
somebody over for for an interview

671
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:13,548
there's a programming test that we

672
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:15,859
administer I say um and then the first

673
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:18,288
part of kind of the interview is let's

674
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:24,369
talk about the test and okay the way the

675
00:30:18,288 --> 00:30:29,509
test is done is it's a a bunch of

676
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:32,388
programming questions C C++ and it's

677
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:34,099
intended not to be kind of the thing

678
00:30:32,388 --> 00:30:38,740
that decides whether you get the job or

679
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:38,740
not right like we compile it doesn't run

680
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:47,450
I actually had to do this test with

681
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:52,668
words and anybody that has to write C

682
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:55,240
code with word no that's what I was I

683
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:58,429
was brought into a room there was like

684
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,128
there was a laptop it didn't have any

685
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:04,309
development environment on it so and

686
00:31:01,128 --> 00:31:06,548
there you load up the dock file and then

687
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:06,548
you

688
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:13,530
so strictly out of curiosity so now it's

689
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,269
notepad plus plus or whatever so you

690
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:17,399
actually get something that understands

691
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:20,879
code okay there's gonna say that that's

692
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:23,580
a very odd thing for an engineering

693
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,890
candidate to walk in and see a tool that

694
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:27,389
would be more appropriate for like the

695
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,610
writers on the team or something that is

696
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,620
but how did that happen nobody knows

697
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:40,859
that we totally make sure that you both

698
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:44,039
face all your keywords correctly just to

699
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:46,139
emphasize that you know like whether you

700
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,230
forget a semicolon or not doesn't really

701
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,280
matter so just like sketch it out and we

702
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,929
don't want you have to worry about like

703
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:53,279
you're not familiar with developer

704
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:54,690
studio because you came from a UNIX

705
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,389
environment or something like that

706
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,919
generally I think the spirit behind the

707
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:07,830
word file was that you shouldn't be

708
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:11,730
given something that you can run right

709
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:13,349
area still has that criteria and that's

710
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,839
also why we're not like if it doesn't

711
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:18,839
work it's not the end of the world but

712
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,480
the idea of the test is to to kind of

713
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:25,379
start a conversation right and there is

714
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,390
usually more than one solution to one of

715
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,240
the problems and then you can talk about

716
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:34,980
the trade-offs and why this is faster

717
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:38,220
versus that and aside from just a kind

718
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,429
of the raw skill of oh yeah I know how

719
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,289
to manage memory or you know I I know

720
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:46,169
how to deal with a linked list or

721
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:48,240
something like that right and so just to

722
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:49,799
sort of get a full picture of that

723
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,289
process I think I understand it pretty

724
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:55,109
well now but yep the the part where we

725
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:57,750
do a phone screen yep

726
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:59,069
we're looking potentially for different

727
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,599
things on every phone screen meaning

728
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:03,089
depending on what we were hiring the

729
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:04,439
person for we might be talking about it

730
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:06,269
in Sun screen or is the phone screen

731
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,500
like fairly standard it's like every

732
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:10,710
phone screen is gonna be this way

733
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,929
because it's just a entry into the

734
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,759
system and then the code test is the

735
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:17,190
thing that maybe changes depending on

736
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,859
the candidates you know prospective

737
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:22,769
position so the phone screen has

738
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:27,000
there's like a very small kind of fixed

739
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:29,279
side to it which is a set of again like

740
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,659
C C++ type questions just kind of

741
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:35,609
general computer knowledge just to get a

742
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,250
little bit of a baseline and then I

743
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:41,548
think like the rest of the phone screen

744
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:44,308
is more about you see a resume and

745
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:46,230
you're trying to kind of like everybody

746
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:47,879
writes a resume in a different way right

747
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,190
some people are better at highlighting

748
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,470
what they did versus others and it's

749
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,870
about kind of understanding the

750
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:57,329
candidate more like you've worked on

751
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:58,829
this thing what did you actually like

752
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,960
what did you do

753
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:03,389
what were your responsibility is for was

754
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,090
something cool that you worked on why do

755
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,590
you want to be a blizzard while you're

756
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:10,409
looking for a change like some of the

757
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:13,319
initial kind of questions that you would

758
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:17,429
have for a candidate and then and then

759
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,019
the actual test is more while we have

760
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:24,210
like a few variations we don't have a

761
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:26,608
lot of variations on the test and the

762
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,108
idea is though for like somebody even

763
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:30,289
coming in at an associate level they

764
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:33,299
should be able to finish the test and

765
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:35,519
they might take the fall a lot of time

766
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,389
where somebody more senior is able to

767
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:41,699
either give better answers or I finish

768
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:43,710
the test faster and and those are kind

769
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:45,739
of good things to to lead up with like

770
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,510
what do you think of the test what were

771
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:51,809
the things that you spent more time on

772
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:56,869
than others right and and that just

773
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:59,400
helps kind of set a few baseline things

774
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:02,789
for the rest of the conversation right

775
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,530
and so in some sense I guess if I go to

776
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:05,849
the first part of that phone screen is

777
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,740
sort of saying like we're gonna you know

778
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:09,059
we saw this resume we think this might

779
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:11,699
be somebody who we might be interested

780
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:14,159
in we're gonna try and help make sure we

781
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:16,618
regularize these these resumes a little

782
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,659
bit like basically help people who maybe

783
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:20,220
you know aren't good at giving us the

784
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:22,949
information we actually want so that

785
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:25,679
we're not discarding their resume out of

786
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:29,039
hand if you will right and you know okay

787
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,269
so for the code test obviously you

788
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,929
wouldn't want to say what they were but

789
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:34,818
can you give some sort of like a

790
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:36,608
example of something that's not what you

791
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:39,769
get for a coat test in terms of

792
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:42,259
complexity level like okay you know how

793
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:43,608
hard of a test are we talking about here

794
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,430
in term you know and I know that's a

795
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:47,630
hard question answer cuz code there's no

796
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:49,909
universal difficulty scale but like you

797
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,230
know what's it on the order of in turn

798
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:53,088
in that terms is there any way you could

799
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:54,199
give us some idea without divulging you

800
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:57,679
know at the thing that you want to keep

801
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:59,000
safe I mean probably if you because we

802
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:07,039
don't change it a lot you could probably

803
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:14,659
Google for it although we're going to

804
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:16,849
change it after this now but mostly I

805
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:22,399
would say data structure type questions

806
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:26,059
or answering a like analyze this data in

807
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,309
a certain way or data transformation

808
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:31,490
like using this input produce this

809
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:33,290
output type of things so you just kind

810
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:36,019
of want to see if they understand the

811
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:37,068
fundamental concept of like let's take

812
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:38,690
some input that we have this

813
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:40,009
well-defined let's build some data

814
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,420
structures that we will need to do

815
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,190
something to it and then let's get it

816
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:47,240
into the output format can they do this

817
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:51,858
process yeah and it generally says you

818
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:55,098
know try to you know take runtime

819
00:36:51,858 --> 00:37:01,039
considerations into account obviously

820
00:36:55,099 --> 00:37:02,869
correctness matters as well and yeah and

821
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,949
a few of those there's just a bunch of

822
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:10,099
trade-offs and memory management is also

823
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:14,058
a part of it because that's I think one

824
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:17,780
of the skills that were like it's

825
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:20,480
getting harder for people to learn Yesi

826
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,809
cuz they're like with unity and unreal

827
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,250
out there there's a lot of people that

828
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:26,569
like start learning game development

829
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:30,699
that way yes and they might not

830
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:33,858
necessarily get exposed to what it takes

831
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:36,230
to actually make something which is why

832
00:37:33,858 --> 00:37:38,179
yes I think your your video series is

833
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:42,108
really helpful and I deal with that

834
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:44,179
thank you and yeah and it it does come

835
00:37:42,108 --> 00:37:45,319
down to like hey why is it inkless

836
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:47,210
faster

837
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:51,890
slower than you know iterating through

838
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:53,840
an array I see like do they do you

839
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:57,019
actually understand by that which is why

840
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,610
that happens right so those are kind of

841
00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:01,940
things that we deal with in the code

842
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:04,010
test then depending on if you you know

843
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,690
if you apply for an engine position

844
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,280
there's other stuff that you're going to

845
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:10,010
talk to outright that is much more

846
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,550
specific whether that's how to implement

847
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:17,210
certain effects or dealing with 3d math

848
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:21,740
type problems animation and like those

849
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:23,780
types of types of things so that's kind

850
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:27,739
of for like the interview part obviously

851
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,870
is kind of the same for everybody then

852
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:33,289
there is the yes I've worked at a games

853
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:37,329
company and this is my resume we have an

854
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:39,500
internship program that is very popular

855
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:41,750
unfortunately which means that somebody

856
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:44,179
mark to get into somebody will say you

857
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,980
know I I'm okay with like one of the

858
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:50,899
leads will say I'm okay with taking on

859
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:55,280
an intern and I think that is like a

860
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:58,090
three month period or so and then

861
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,280
through our university relations program

862
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:02,750
there's a bunch of in like resumes and

863
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,160
applications that are being solicited

864
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:07,010
through that nice and then you get a

865
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:09,969
folder with 120 applications for one

866
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:12,650
internship for one internship and

867
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:16,009
obviously that's that's kind of a long

868
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:19,550
shot but one of the things that I've

869
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:23,390
seen at least is that after this interns

870
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:26,140
sometimes return I see and then there's

871
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:28,609
also kind of a part of the program where

872
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:31,190
there's the possibility to offer them

873
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:33,140
already kind of a job so that once they

874
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:35,360
finish there are there in the pipeline

875
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:37,730
sir exactly so that they kind of know

876
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,099
what their future might look like right

877
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,570
and could you just briefly mention

878
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:44,150
something you said there you said

879
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:46,610
University Relations program yeah what

880
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:49,519
exactly does that entail because I mean

881
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:51,769
it's that yeah I guess I have no I

882
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:57,349
imagine some things that could be but I

883
00:39:51,769 --> 00:40:04,219
have no idea um I think I actually don't

884
00:39:57,349 --> 00:40:06,860
know but that's I think there is with

885
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:11,029
internships it's also it's kind of which

886
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:13,280
area do you do you service that from so

887
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:16,940
I think University Relations is a bit

888
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,640
more local in general working with

889
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:22,010
universities near Irvine so it doesn't

890
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,629
like a university in Europe for example

891
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:26,240
like where you went to school might not

892
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,190
be if you have a certain curriculum I

893
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,619
it also as a contact point I think for a

894
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:34,220
university to reach out to to start

895
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:36,859
making a connection I say but the extent

896
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:38,929
to how far they go I actually don't know

897
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:43,430
the details of that okay so that makes

898
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:44,750
sense so so basically like yeah the for

899
00:40:43,429 --> 00:40:47,359
the intern positions that's a pretty

900
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:50,869
massive influx of resumes right is it's

901
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,480
similar for your full positions is it a

902
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:57,199
hundred and twenty people in a binder

903
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:01,369
not where we see them it is probably for

904
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:04,009
recruiting like there's I don't know the

905
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:10,429
exact rate of job applications that we

906
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:15,650
get so yeah I feel that we usually end

907
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:18,230
up picking between like we maybe get

908
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:21,139
like three or four resumes on kind of

909
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:24,079
the first pull and then if if those if

910
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:26,230
those don't work out then there's a

911
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,449
trickle that comes through I said then

912
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,719
once we kind of find the candidate then

913
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:36,469
and we obviously close that position

914
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:37,879
okay yeah actually for a universe like

915
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:42,439
for four people fresh out of school

916
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:44,329
other than the intern way it's it's

917
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,670
almost the same like you you send in

918
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:51,769
your resume and ideally like the things

919
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:54,470
that we like to see is maybe some hobby

920
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:58,759
project type experience right I think

921
00:41:54,469 --> 00:42:00,619
there's a lot of value in like having

922
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,650
started a project and kind of having

923
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:08,739
gone through a life cycle and

924
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:11,450
a project can be a game a project can be

925
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:14,239
just I'm working on this library that

926
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:15,919
does this thing right but but something

927
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,079
that you could in theory give to some

928
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,079
other person for them to run right I

929
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,869
think that takes a certain level of

930
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:27,799
preparation that is very valuable

931
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:32,869
um so seeing some completed work that

932
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:34,940
the person took initiative to create is

933
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:36,469
going to be something and in that will

934
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,750
stand up it'll stand out and and so I

935
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:42,799
guess one question I have there is that

936
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:44,630
is that something that the whole sort of

937
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,600
pipeline knows I mean is that something

938
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,849
that you know when HR screening the

939
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,339
applicants that they are going to also

940
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:54,019
see that and go oh we know that the

941
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,559
engineering team likes to see these

942
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:59,750
things so we may you know we won't

943
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:01,610
accidentally sort of cull those out when

944
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:03,590
that was possibly a good thing or or is

945
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:06,740
it is it more like well by the time it

946
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:09,470
gets to I wish it I mean it's it's fuzzy

947
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:12,409
okay right it depends on which recruiter

948
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:14,539
you're working with and over time like

949
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:16,339
the longer you work with a certain

950
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:19,039
recruiter and we have one that is kind

951
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:21,380
of assigned to our team like they start

952
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:23,929
learning obviously kind of the things

953
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:27,289
that you're looking for so it's yeah

954
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:31,429
it's like a feedback loop and usually

955
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:32,960
when we see like a good resume like we

956
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:34,309
will highlight that as well so that they

957
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,000
kind of know I'll you know this is the

958
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:40,940
type of stuff right but yeah project

959
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,090
experience making it easy to like if you

960
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:46,309
made a demo like having some some video

961
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:49,240
up there as kind of a first like easy

962
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:52,130
way to to consume it so I don't install

963
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:55,429
thousands of yes more programs that that

964
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:57,710
helps right and I guess that's just

965
00:43:55,429 --> 00:44:00,619
general advice for if you're trying to

966
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:04,039
go get a job easier you make it for the

967
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:05,690
people screening resume you've got to to

968
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:08,360
know that you're awesome right the the

969
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,710
better okay yeah that's a good point so

970
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,079
I bet a lot of people don't necessarily

971
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:14,760
think of it that way but yeah it's like

972
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,469
hey how can I make it

973
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,020
that when you go to look at my resume

974
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:20,579
the important parts are very easy to get

975
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:21,960
to and if there's something that I've

976
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:24,989
done that I think is a particularly good

977
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,730
example of why you should hire me make

978
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:28,799
it one click like make it I just click

979
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,809
and I can see it and some people feel

980
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,370
like they'll have a link to their github

981
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:34,469
or something like that so you can

982
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:37,769
actually look at some code and that is

983
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:39,480
pretty awesome okay yeah all right so

984
00:44:37,769 --> 00:44:41,909
that's that's actually really great I

985
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,579
mean that was a that's so much of the

986
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:46,920
stuff that I've often asked is the

987
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:49,590
answer is in there actually okay what do

988
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,690
this said because a lot of times you

989
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:54,090
know people ask this and the game

990
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:57,030
industry is so different now from when I

991
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:59,490
you know got into it that I my

992
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:02,100
experience is meaningless like it has no

993
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:03,599
bearing on how you know one might get

994
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:09,960
into the game industry today just need

995
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:12,409
to hire people so it's it's really kind

996
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,900
of kind of nice to have that picture

997
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:17,429
okay so did I is there anything I should

998
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,500
have asked about that that I didn't ask

999
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:20,789
before I go on to sort of the next part

1000
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:25,739
of that which is not gonna be about

1001
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:31,050
maybe the hiring process um there's so

1002
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:34,469
we we kind of covered the how to I think

1003
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:36,900
also like a cover letter I think is very

1004
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:39,599
meaningful and conveying why you want to

1005
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:44,190
be there so why what brought you to

1006
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:46,619
Blizzard yeah kind of the motivations I

1007
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:49,200
think they speak volumes sometimes and

1008
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:52,309
and making sure that that is in a cover

1009
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:54,629
letter I think is super helpful okay and

1010
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:56,699
yeah our engineering manager will always

1011
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,430
be upset when he sees no cover letter

1012
00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:01,319
really okay yeah there's like just

1013
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:04,079
sending about the bunch of resumes no no

1014
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,840
personal touch or or something like that

1015
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,519
so it's kind of it's quite literally a

1016
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:11,640
smaller make it personal I mean it's

1017
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:14,280
just again applying for any job if you

1018
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:15,960
tailor it more to like the job that

1019
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,840
you're applying for you're more likely

1020
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,550
to you know when somebody is screening

1021
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,440
it they're more likely to go like oh

1022
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,880
yeah like he actually wants to be here

1023
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,409
for these reasons and that's great and

1024
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:30,920
and that matters

1025
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:33,199
so you know putting that part of the the

1026
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,239
PI plant side so let's say I am one of

1027
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,949
the people fortunate enough to you know

1028
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:39,318
make it through this process and you

1029
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:41,808
know I'm gonna get a job here right so

1030
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:44,710
it's like make me an offer we you know

1031
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:49,309
we move out there whatever is happening

1032
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:53,210
what's sort of I guess what does the

1033
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:54,859
person expect in terms of like what did

1034
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:57,139
they do day one like in other words

1035
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:58,608
talking again from more of the beginners

1036
00:46:57,139 --> 00:47:00,710
perspective so obviously like in your

1037
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:02,538
situation you know your expectations

1038
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,249
well I already know game development I'm

1039
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:06,769
just coming in my my things gonna be

1040
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:08,179
about learning this team and this engine

1041
00:47:06,768 --> 00:47:09,258
and whatever but for somebody who's

1042
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:11,808
never worked in the game is for and this

1043
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:14,150
is their first job right you know what

1044
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:16,039
is it like to come start working there

1045
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:19,278
day one and sort of like what are the

1046
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:20,839
expectations around what someone who

1047
00:47:19,278 --> 00:47:24,349
works in the game industry is like going

1048
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:26,949
to start doing in in their you know

1049
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:30,650
inaugural year or something like so

1050
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:33,528
they've won actually like Blizzard does

1051
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:35,900
something different there on day one

1052
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:40,248
okay one you arrive and you're actually

1053
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:41,989
there's kind of a big onboarding type of

1054
00:47:40,248 --> 00:47:46,088
meeting with a bunch of people that are

1055
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:49,249
starting kind of the same week where

1056
00:47:46,088 --> 00:47:52,369
there's like HR talks about some of the

1057
00:47:49,248 --> 00:47:54,528
some of the things like health benefits

1058
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,358
and health insurance and things that you

1059
00:47:54,528 --> 00:47:57,829
might not really know how to deal with

1060
00:47:56,358 --> 00:47:59,748
and I think this is all the paperwork

1061
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:03,920
that we need to do and that type of

1062
00:47:59,748 --> 00:48:06,169
stuff then there's something that

1063
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,700
Blizzard does as well which is talking

1064
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:11,719
about kind of the company core values

1065
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:15,078
and and there's a scavenger hunt for you

1066
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:19,519
to kind of explore the campus so you

1067
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:21,229
know where we like we I think Blizzard

1068
00:48:19,518 --> 00:48:26,808
when they moved to the current location

1069
00:48:21,228 --> 00:48:29,629
it was three buildings now it's 21 Wow

1070
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:31,729
and there's there's cool statues there's

1071
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,349
museums you know you should get enough

1072
00:48:31,728 --> 00:48:35,108
information that when a friend comes and

1073
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:38,449
visits you you can show them kind of

1074
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:41,808
around and find the cafeteria and and

1075
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:44,659
that type myself so that's kind of day

1076
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:48,380
one and then at the end you arrive at

1077
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:51,619
the team and you you do kind of a hello

1078
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:56,390
but that's your first day so you really

1079
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:58,068
on the team is kind of you're literally

1080
00:48:56,389 --> 00:49:01,068
taking care of business the first day

1081
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:04,849
that happen yeah but in a fun way like a

1082
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:08,630
they do stuff that like usually one of

1083
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:10,880
the executives will be there and be

1084
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:13,068
there to ask questions to write like so

1085
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,209
you might get lucky and mike moore has

1086
00:49:13,068 --> 00:49:19,759
time to do that type of stuff right so

1087
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:25,298
so that's I think pretty cool then the

1088
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:28,130
second day you should arrive to a

1089
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:31,929
desktop that's been set up in the area

1090
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:35,599
where you're gonna sit the code has been

1091
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:37,579
downloaded and compiled once and that is

1092
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,890
stuff that gets kind of set up first

1093
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:43,339
time so instead of doing the four hour

1094
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:44,838
let's build the game the first time oh I

1095
00:49:43,338 --> 00:49:45,739
did not have access to this network

1096
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:50,150
source

1097
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:54,199
oh my my SBN password is this or

1098
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:56,599
whatever so so that ideally is already

1099
00:49:54,199 --> 00:50:00,949
taken care of sometimes we miss a few

1100
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:04,579
things but that we try I think is is

1101
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:06,769
already kind of cool and then you the

1102
00:50:04,579 --> 00:50:08,989
the lead for the team that you got hired

1103
00:50:06,768 --> 00:50:11,838
to will usually end up spending most of

1104
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:13,749
the day with you okay just kind of

1105
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:18,798
walking you a bit through the codebase

1106
00:50:13,748 --> 00:50:22,838
and usually they they have kind of a

1107
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:26,449
smallish problem picked out for you two

1108
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:29,449
to kind of deal with that keeps you in

1109
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:32,298
like one or two files so that it's

1110
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:34,789
fairly isolated and it might be a low

1111
00:50:32,298 --> 00:50:35,929
bug or a reminder that sits on some

1112
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:36,369
backlog right

1113
00:50:35,929 --> 00:50:38,920
so this

1114
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:41,230
sort of a thing where the EU has done

1115
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,028
some preparation for your arrival where

1116
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:45,309
they've literally the bug list and gone

1117
00:50:43,028 --> 00:50:46,719
this would be a good thing for the you

1118
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:50,170
know the new hire to take a look at

1119
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:53,919
right let me go and you know give that

1120
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:56,019
to them try to ease you in and explain

1121
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,519
only enough to kind of solve that

1122
00:50:56,018 --> 00:51:01,058
problem you might already have the

1123
00:50:57,518 --> 00:51:04,808
solution right but yes but yeah and then

1124
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:07,720
have that person ask questions and we

1125
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:09,460
encourage asking questions and just

1126
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:12,068
start taking a lot of notes there's

1127
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,630
weird nomenclature like a lot of there's

1128
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:15,849
weird nomenclature that you have to

1129
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:18,460
learn a code base that means something I

1130
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:22,240
remember on the the engine team when I

1131
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:24,608
arrived I always just like it was do

1132
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,879
that this do that that second what is it

1133
00:51:24,608 --> 00:51:29,739
do dad like why what does the detail do

1134
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,559
dad yes so it turns out the detail do

1135
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:34,629
that is like of the procedural

1136
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:43,690
vegetation that's okay on the ground

1137
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:45,910
okay and and and a map obj is a it's

1138
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:48,999
more like a building type of thing but a

1139
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:50,828
chair in theory it's also an object in

1140
00:51:48,998 --> 00:51:51,909
the map right actually it's it's just

1141
00:51:50,829 --> 00:51:54,309
it's different right

1142
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:56,768
so there's a lot of kind of ingrained

1143
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:59,710
terminology that you have to get used to

1144
00:51:56,768 --> 00:52:03,248
and you you kind of build a little

1145
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:06,039
dictionary a lot of console commands in

1146
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:10,058
order to kind of start up stuff like

1147
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:12,339
working on Wow a lot of people they'll

1148
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:15,309
be running their own kind of local

1149
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:18,278
server on their machine that they would

1150
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:19,720
then connect to there's also there's

1151
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:21,518
also servers that are running for the

1152
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:23,259
team but depending on what you do you

1153
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:27,308
you might have to control your own

1154
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:28,659
server right and that just is kind of a

1155
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:31,989
lot of stuff that you need to teach

1156
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:33,608
somebody initially just to here's how to

1157
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:36,369
actually have your version of the game

1158
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:38,348
talk to a thing right right because

1159
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:40,298
you're dealing with getting programs

1160
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:41,890
connected and having getting a state

1161
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:44,498
established which is right you know not

1162
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:46,389
actually that typical in in you know

1163
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:48,519
sort of more you know straightforward

1164
00:52:46,389 --> 00:52:52,150
game development I suppose yeah

1165
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:56,099
but yeah then ideally you're working on

1166
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:58,420
that project and when you're ready to to

1167
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:02,380
check in you'll get your first code

1168
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:07,269
review so we we talk like every check-in

1169
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:10,090
gets code reviewed we tend to prefer

1170
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:13,539
kind of well up to now we preferred

1171
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:16,870
in-person code reviews we are switching

1172
00:53:13,539 --> 00:53:18,070
now to do more kind of asynchronous code

1173
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:21,449
reviews because the number of

1174
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:24,370
interruptions is high is high and and

1175
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:27,909
being evil able to keep people kind of

1176
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:30,880
in the flow state I think is it's useful

1177
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:32,079
and so sometimes there's massive code

1178
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,170
reviews and being able to crowdsource

1179
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:38,289
them is good also a lot of sense so what

1180
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,730
are if you could talk a little about the

1181
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:41,289
code review process is there anything

1182
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:42,610
particularly I mean I suppose most

1183
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:44,500
people probably roughly know what a code

1184
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:47,470
view is but is there anything particular

1185
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:51,670
about a code review at Blizzard that's

1186
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:57,309
you know or rough sketch of how how it

1187
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:59,050
works a rough sketch well for example

1188
00:53:57,309 --> 00:54:03,730
who even does the code review right like

1189
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:05,710
I check in 94 somebody who is who's new

1190
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:07,690
to the company of the person that would

1191
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:10,720
assign the task is going to be the lead

1192
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:12,840
right so they would do obviously the

1193
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:15,879
first code review

1194
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:18,010
ideally explaining kind of this is this

1195
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,349
is why we do this this is why doing a

1196
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:21,970
like these are the people that you

1197
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:24,489
should be getting code reviews from and

1198
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:26,169
and there's usually like a set of more

1199
00:54:24,489 --> 00:54:28,869
senior engineers on each one of those

1200
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:31,769
groups that are named that would be

1201
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:37,029
targets for a code review and then

1202
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:40,239
depending on the subsystem there might

1203
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:42,280
be kind of yeah here's the the guy that

1204
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,559
deals with all the spell stuff okay so

1205
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,390
if I'm doing something in there that I

1206
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:51,820
don't understand he would be kind of the

1207
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:54,429
go-to person okay but ideally a specific

1208
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:56,140
person who is obviously the person has

1209
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:57,969
to code reviews there's a subject matter

1210
00:54:56,139 --> 00:55:00,989
expert as you're kind of have to go to

1211
00:54:57,969 --> 00:55:04,199
write like

1212
00:55:00,989 --> 00:55:05,848
yeah if you're dealing with this is how

1213
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:09,149
the DB autogen

1214
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:11,430
works you go talk to this person okay

1215
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:14,389
and those wouldn't be the tasks that

1216
00:55:11,429 --> 00:55:16,500
you'd be given on day one yes or two

1217
00:55:14,389 --> 00:55:18,210
because yeah

1218
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,030
that's that's kind of dealing with a lot

1219
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:23,309
of sensitive systems that could ripple

1220
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:30,180
through yeah and create 50 and ammonium

1221
00:55:23,309 --> 00:55:40,289
mega tasks so why don't we get to Giga

1222
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:42,179
tasks that's okay so you know from that

1223
00:55:40,289 --> 00:55:44,940
point after you know their first

1224
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:46,949
experiences that are they kind of now in

1225
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:49,349
the assignment pool in general I mean

1226
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:51,868
probably getting that there's still a

1227
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:55,710
few more like you you buy mine use them

1228
00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:57,780
you're kind of widen their kind of their

1229
00:55:55,710 --> 00:56:00,630
their expertise in the systems that they

1230
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:03,930
deal with try to keep the complexity

1231
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:06,539
level obviously fairly low don't give

1232
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:08,759
new folks necessarily mission critical

1233
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:11,820
tasks they're kind of nice to have that

1234
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:14,099
as we're because we're on wow we're

1235
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:19,200
continually we were working in a lot of

1236
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:21,619
branches and simultaneously and there's

1237
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:23,819
a complexity that comes with that that's

1238
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:24,990
again something you need to usually

1239
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:28,260
explain to somebody

1240
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:30,299
there's systems that automatically merge

1241
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,849
your changes from this branch to this

1242
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:35,190
branch so when you check in and somebody

1243
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:36,960
else has modified stuff upstream then

1244
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:39,210
you're like oh now I have a merge

1245
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,800
conflict and then it's like help I have

1246
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:44,159
a merge conflict right and right that

1247
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:46,440
becomes kind of a teaching moment at

1248
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:49,559
that point okay

1249
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,179
yeah all right so that that makes that

1250
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:52,619
that's a really great picture right like

1251
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:55,949
I already feel like I should stand that

1252
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:58,108
process much better okay like person not

1253
00:56:55,949 --> 00:57:00,989
working at Blizzard to now he's actually

1254
00:56:58,108 --> 00:57:02,279
doing work on the codebase so before we

1255
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:04,049
get into some other stuff here because I

1256
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,580
think that that's really like almost

1257
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:11,430
everything I wanted to know about that

1258
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:13,940
okay that stuff from having done this

1259
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:18,210
for several years now at Blizzard

1260
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:21,450
what are some of the things that you you

1261
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:22,588
know maybe I guess I'll put sort of two

1262
00:57:21,449 --> 00:57:23,879
parts of the question out there and you

1263
00:57:22,588 --> 00:57:27,000
can take them however you want or

1264
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:30,059
whatever first thing would be like what

1265
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,489
do you think makes a really good you

1266
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:34,200
know team member for one of your teams

1267
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:35,669
like you know having gone through the

1268
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:37,889
process of getting people and you get to

1269
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:40,079
be like this was a really good hire or

1270
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:41,460
we're really happy that this person came

1271
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,019
to work for us like what are the sorts

1272
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:45,720
of things that you find sort of make

1273
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:47,548
that that difference you know is it you

1274
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:50,098
know are they personality or they attack

1275
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:53,009
are they whatever and then the other

1276
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:54,960
part would be sort of what are the

1277
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:56,880
things that in general when especially

1278
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,000
talking about sort of like people who's

1279
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,588
you know maybe first or an early job is

1280
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,659
that Blizzard as opposed to you know

1281
00:58:01,588 --> 00:58:06,778
maybe more of a veteran programmer okay

1282
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:10,199
what are the things that you wish they

1283
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:11,849
came in knowing that they don't know or

1284
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:14,608
that luck maybe could do a better job

1285
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:17,490
this has nothing to do with you know is

1286
00:58:14,608 --> 00:58:19,199
this person you know capable or smart or

1287
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:22,108
can do the job it's more dislike they

1288
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:24,298
haven't had this experience and so we

1289
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:25,920
have to teach them these things that we

1290
00:58:24,298 --> 00:58:27,630
wish they already knew because we know

1291
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,909
they can do them but now we have to kind

1292
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:32,220
of do that education process does that

1293
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:39,750
make sense yeah it makes sense it's a

1294
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:44,788
hard quiet question yes takes no where

1295
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:48,838
to start so in terms of like good habits

1296
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:51,660
in general are I don't understand

1297
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:53,308
something I'm gonna ask a question and

1298
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:56,460
it's totally fine to ask a question

1299
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:58,980
right like I actually I think fairly

1300
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:01,199
like new programmers that it's their

1301
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:03,028
first job there may be afraid to ask

1302
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:06,149
questions they're going to try to solve

1303
00:59:03,028 --> 00:59:07,889
the problem on their own and because

1304
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:10,710
they don't want to be the guy that just

1305
00:59:07,889 --> 00:59:13,170
got hired you know and and the first

1306
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:16,318
task I'm failing why am i failing I

1307
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:19,019
can't fail right so so just it's

1308
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:23,278
perfectly fine to ask a question right

1309
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:26,130
and and leads I mean should be good to

1310
00:59:23,278 --> 00:59:27,329
kind of detect that and and kind of CEO

1311
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,849
haven't heard

1312
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:32,340
so I'm gonna check in a bit and see

1313
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:34,289
what's going on and and the thing is

1314
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:36,660
that you're all kind of working on this

1315
00:59:34,289 --> 00:59:38,880
together everybody tries to do good and

1316
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:41,909
and that is the other thing like in

1317
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,530
terms of things that are kind of a joy

1318
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:46,679
to work with are people that don't get

1319
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:49,400
upset when something isn't done the way

1320
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:53,369
that they would prefer and they like

1321
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:56,130
should try to see the good in what was

1322
00:59:53,369 --> 00:59:59,250
done before assuming that they're the

1323
00:59:56,130 --> 01:00:01,380
bad that they perceive you know that the

1324
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:04,349
person was maybe aware of doing yes

1325
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:06,480
except sometimes they weren't right so

1326
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:10,559
it's just like kind of that interaction

1327
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:12,659
style but people that are like where

1328
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,630
it's their first job it's often the

1329
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:17,699
first time that they're working with

1330
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:22,650
like other engineers ah right

1331
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:26,669
so I think that like some folks can be

1332
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:29,730
more territorial than others and and

1333
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:34,889
ideally people just don't really care

1334
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:36,539
about that that much I see right so yeah

1335
01:00:34,889 --> 01:00:42,199
I'm not structuring it really well but

1336
01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:46,019
these are just yeah these are like being

1337
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:48,179
proactive when I see a problem don't

1338
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:51,509
assume that somebody else is going to

1339
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:53,639
see it I say bring it up which goes in

1340
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:59,160
the same sense of the asking us across

1341
01:00:53,639 --> 01:01:04,049
asking questions being able to bridge

1342
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:06,839
the gap to art and design like it's easy

1343
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:09,930
for engineers to kind of focus on the

1344
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:12,750
tasks that they have and that usually

1345
01:01:09,929 --> 01:01:15,000
can lead to like on big teams in

1346
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:17,489
particular can just lead to a disconnect

1347
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,159
that if if it doesn't get broken down

1348
01:01:17,489 --> 01:01:21,899
early enough right like design things

1349
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:24,869
they're getting this you're doing this

1350
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:26,550
because you have your task in front of

1351
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:28,409
you but your task while it's in front of

1352
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:31,530
you might already be changing and people

1353
01:01:28,409 --> 01:01:34,170
are bad at updating things so so

1354
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:39,050
fostering communication I think is

1355
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:42,470
important like the folks that

1356
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:44,480
do well I think are the ones that aren't

1357
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:46,129
afraid to walk over to the artisan

1358
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,010
designers when they get their task and

1359
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:51,349
say hey I need to do this thing for you

1360
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:54,550
let's talk about that right okay

1361
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:58,989
and so it's really like communication

1362
01:01:54,550 --> 01:02:01,940
super important and is that mostly like

1363
01:01:58,989 --> 01:02:03,679
interests creation just being a person

1364
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:05,780
who is able to have a good conversation

1365
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,730
there he's really are talking about or

1366
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:11,330
are you also talking about if this

1367
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:13,070
person has some art you know sort of a

1368
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:15,500
little bit of background in that so that

1369
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:22,100
they can express themselves clearly I

1370
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:25,130
mean is let's bonus okay I understand

1371
01:02:22,099 --> 01:02:27,500
exactly when you speak to me art I like

1372
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:29,720
I understand art and when we talk

1373
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:35,510
designer we talk designer okay like

1374
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:38,269
that's awesome for working on Wow a bit

1375
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:41,030
of a weird requirement but some some

1376
01:02:38,269 --> 01:02:43,130
that isn't necessary but helps a lot is

1377
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:45,170
actually having played the game at least

1378
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:48,800
at some point in your life in order to

1379
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:54,559
understand which probably isn't that

1380
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:57,140
hard of a requirement but but for some

1381
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,480
people that's just not a game that like

1382
01:02:57,139 --> 01:03:01,579
they stay away from it like think some

1383
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:05,570
people actually go like this is too

1384
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:07,429
time-consuming yes like or depending on

1385
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:10,070
where people are at in their lifetime

1386
01:03:07,429 --> 01:03:12,858
like it was fine while I was at

1387
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:15,830
university or maybe on my first job but

1388
01:03:12,858 --> 01:03:18,500
now you know like Tom's transom well

1389
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:18,858
yeah families and kids and and that type

1390
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:23,389
of stuff

1391
01:03:18,858 --> 01:03:25,219
right but knowing the the lingo is super

1392
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:27,440
helpful in communicating when somebody

1393
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:30,108
says hey there's something that happens

1394
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,630
in gold tire or an organ or there's this

1395
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:33,980
thing that's broken and it's already

1396
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:35,930
played the game they already know what

1397
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,639
you're talking about where is I mean I

1398
01:03:35,929 --> 01:03:40,699
was joking at some point maybe we should

1399
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:42,529
have kind of this is the map of Azeroth

1400
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:44,179
and you need to at least know where a

1401
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:47,500
few places are

1402
01:03:44,179 --> 01:03:52,608
it's an interview question is like

1403
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:56,900
geography test I'm bad enough for

1404
01:03:52,608 --> 01:03:59,568
regular geography geography - no but

1405
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:01,369
alright it's just I mean it's something

1406
01:03:59,568 --> 01:04:03,288
that if you don't know it you're going

1407
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:04,940
to very quickly pick it up there's

1408
01:04:03,289 --> 01:04:10,210
obviously a bunch of shortcuts how to

1409
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:13,099
get around the world but yeah we we also

1410
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:16,940
like people that I would say probably

1411
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:20,510
half of the team or so still actively

1412
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:22,010
play the game which is pretty good for

1413
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:24,770
the games industry I think in people

1414
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:29,480
that play their own work surprisingly

1415
01:04:24,769 --> 01:04:31,699
high I think and and that just fosters a

1416
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,949
lot of discussion that is usually very

1417
01:04:31,699 --> 01:04:37,460
useful and it also means that you just

1418
01:04:33,949 --> 01:04:39,679
you get more credibility in a way by

1419
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:44,449
when somebody asks you hey we need to do

1420
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:47,028
this thing and and you go but it might

1421
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:48,528
break this other thing yes and without

1422
01:04:47,028 --> 01:04:52,369
playing the game you might not have a

1423
01:04:48,528 --> 01:04:54,500
right obviously not something that you

1424
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:56,890
can absolutely require and some people

1425
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:59,539
do it more casually than others yeah and

1426
01:04:56,889 --> 01:05:05,259
and and that is perfectly fine

1427
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:11,150
all right so cover kind of communication

1428
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:21,020
being proactive about things while being

1429
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:24,190
great engineers in particular you had in

1430
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:24,190
mind when you thought about that but

1431
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:31,449
there's I mean there there are people

1432
01:05:27,949 --> 01:05:35,929
who you can give a big task to and

1433
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:37,129
they're able to run with it organize it

1434
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:41,298
together with the help of a producer

1435
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:44,390
maybe and they're able to break tasks

1436
01:05:41,298 --> 01:05:47,778
down like big complex tasks down then

1437
01:05:44,389 --> 01:05:49,608
before maybe jumping into coding having

1438
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:51,139
a quick kind of check-in all right I'm

1439
01:05:49,608 --> 01:05:53,119
making some like noticing that they're

1440
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:56,058
making some important decisions and and

1441
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,980
being able to loop in the right people

1442
01:05:56,059 --> 01:05:59,140
at that point

1443
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:01,240
to get feedback gather all the

1444
01:05:59,139 --> 01:06:03,789
requirements maybe some of it changes

1445
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:05,500
and then there they're able to you know

1446
01:06:03,789 --> 01:06:07,869
the ideal engineer then is able to

1447
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,369
execute it you know at the time that

1448
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:12,450
they said it would take there are no

1449
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:15,550
surprises that happens all the time okay

1450
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:19,049
so now we're kind of because we have

1451
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:25,900
fantasy geography and the engineers

1452
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:31,000
it's a fantasy game no oh you're asking

1453
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:34,300
for the ideal so exactly what I wanted

1454
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,920
to know certainly yeah and yeah you win

1455
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:40,539
some of those battles and you lose some

1456
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:43,690
and you just try to kind of move on and

1457
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:46,599
and coexist and not step on other

1458
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:51,099
people's toes in a in a large code base

1459
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:53,889
and yeah I think those are kind of the

1460
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:55,539
things that I'm looking for so the

1461
01:06:53,889 --> 01:06:57,969
second part there's like what are the

1462
01:06:55,539 --> 01:06:59,619
things that for the newer people who you

1463
01:06:57,969 --> 01:07:01,750
get are people who maybe haven't had a

1464
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:03,820
job in the game history before or this

1465
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:05,019
maybe even their first job like what are

1466
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,280
the sorts of things if you've had

1467
01:07:05,019 --> 01:07:09,009
candidates like that who come through

1468
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:11,550
who you hire what are the sorts of

1469
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:14,830
things that you feel like they you know

1470
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:15,820
the education process prior to kinda

1471
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:17,230
buzzer could have been better at

1472
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,840
preparing them for the things you need

1473
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:22,358
them to do again so kind of factoring

1474
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,980
out there you know how good they are as

1475
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:26,559
an engineer it's just for what have they

1476
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:29,829
had the opportunity to learn already I

1477
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:33,250
think it's really the project experience

1478
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:35,049
like maybe it's somebody who has only

1479
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:37,690
studied computer science have they've

1480
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:41,560
worked with artists and designers do

1481
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:48,159
they understand the game development

1482
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:52,049
kind of process like when to make a like

1483
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:56,440
when to maybe make a prototype

1484
01:07:52,050 --> 01:08:00,039
when to like how to like some of the

1485
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:02,710
newer folks they tend to be very like I

1486
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:05,639
know it all as well okay right they'll

1487
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:07,528
more so than older folks oh yeah

1488
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:10,199
Noldor like age wise but I come further

1489
01:08:07,528 --> 01:08:13,190
back to Piper young younger folks can be

1490
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:17,908
very knowledgeable and they they know

1491
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:22,170
everybody were mentioning C++ and and

1492
01:08:17,908 --> 01:08:24,358
usually we get a lot of like in my own

1493
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:26,369
programming I'm able to use all of these

1494
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:29,699
things why can't I use these things on

1495
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:33,149
your project right type of complex C++

1496
01:08:29,698 --> 01:08:35,399
features super fast features and like

1497
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:38,579
supercilious eleven lambdas all that

1498
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:40,829
stuff like when when that was a hot

1499
01:08:38,579 --> 01:08:45,448
topic like that became a hot topic on

1500
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:47,880
the team because some folks at the

1501
01:08:45,448 --> 01:08:49,619
moment we switch to you know then the

1502
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,719
version of Visual Studio that starts

1503
01:08:49,619 --> 01:08:55,920
recording them it started kind of

1504
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:58,170
popping up in the code and and then we

1505
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,789
tried to put a bit of a stop to it and

1506
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:02,639
then that was like why are we stopping

1507
01:08:59,789 --> 01:09:04,829
this this is like like this is part of

1508
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:10,350
the language how can we say we're C++

1509
01:09:04,829 --> 01:09:12,960
developers or we can't do this and you

1510
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:16,560
try to just kind of deal with things

1511
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:18,359
like well let's actually like everybody

1512
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,900
the moment you introduce a feature like

1513
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:23,699
that like everybody on the team needs to

1514
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:27,329
understand the feature and especially

1515
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:29,698
some of the people that are on game

1516
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:31,198
development teams that have not been

1517
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:33,539
using those features for a long time

1518
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:36,059
they might not even get exposed to some

1519
01:09:33,539 --> 01:09:39,448
of the new language features and and

1520
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:42,029
they're sometimes the folks who have to

1521
01:09:39,448 --> 01:09:47,129
give advice on what should your code

1522
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:49,500
look like yes and and and there's like

1523
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:51,389
we we don't necessarily think as a

1524
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,859
community we may not even have learned

1525
01:09:51,389 --> 01:09:56,639
all the best practices around some of

1526
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:58,829
these features right so doing that

1527
01:09:56,639 --> 01:10:00,960
slowly and deliberately and kind of

1528
01:09:58,829 --> 01:10:02,789
vetting it through what is this going

1529
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,920
like as a ripple effect what is it going

1530
01:10:02,789 --> 01:10:07,500
to do to the codebase I think those are

1531
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,440
are things that you then have to stop

1532
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:12,899
some of the the folks that haven't

1533
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:14,849
worked in large-scale projects right

1534
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:17,549
that have only been coding for

1535
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:18,090
themselves and that is kind of tricky in

1536
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:21,570
that

1537
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:23,880
it's naysay means like no don't do this

1538
01:10:21,569 --> 01:10:26,069
right well I need to explain it in order

1539
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:28,020
for them to understand the perspective

1540
01:10:26,069 --> 01:10:29,579
to on it is kind of one of those things

1541
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,840
where like you know you kind of have to

1542
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:32,250
have gone through one of these things

1543
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,750
where it's like oh yeah and then we

1544
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:35,550
tried to port to the this and that

1545
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:37,109
compiler didn't support lambdas and then

1546
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:38,909
we had to read like if you've gone

1547
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:40,259
through that once and someone says let's

1548
01:10:38,909 --> 01:10:42,720
not adopt these things earlier it's like

1549
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,190
oh yeah like I understand why you said

1550
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,659
that but if you've never had those

1551
01:10:44,189 --> 01:10:47,909
experiences it's pretty hard for you to

1552
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:49,710
connect to it like you know

1553
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:51,899
empathetically in that sense because you

1554
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:53,670
you don't see those downsides that

1555
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:55,710
they've maybe gone through with the ISIS

1556
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:57,630
and it's just people's eyes aren't for a

1557
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:59,939
code review people's ions that aren't

1558
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:02,220
trained necessarily to look out for the

1559
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:04,139
bad things like you're starting to

1560
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:07,020
capture by reference and at some point

1561
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:09,450
somebody just starts not capturing by

1562
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:12,150
reference and then inner loops get

1563
01:11:09,449 --> 01:11:14,750
slower and I like wow like how did this

1564
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:18,479
happen right I see

1565
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:20,189
yeah in life time management that's

1566
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:22,199
another thing that I think people should

1567
01:11:20,189 --> 01:11:24,689
understand a lot more kind of coming on

1568
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:27,199
to a team memory management lifetime

1569
01:11:24,689 --> 01:11:30,179
management resource management a

1570
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:31,439
discipline of like they might have come

1571
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:34,920
from a place where they were happy to

1572
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:37,169
get things working nicely to actually

1573
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,569
knowing that everything you do it's like

1574
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:44,039
wow we always say kind of dies by a

1575
01:11:39,569 --> 01:11:45,750
thousand paper cuts and making sure that

1576
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:49,019
you're not adding paper cuts to the

1577
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:51,180
trivia to the did the messes is it

1578
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:57,510
important to the movement do the wound

1579
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:59,310
yeah heavy scarring okay so so sounds

1580
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:01,170
like to to assert degree that those kind

1581
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:03,750
of fell into two categories there in

1582
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:06,199
terms of things that you want to know

1583
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:09,270
one is it sounds like just kind of

1584
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:10,769
general lower level programming things

1585
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:12,660
like you know have some solid

1586
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:14,730
fundamentals around like like you know

1587
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:15,840
I've I don't always rely on a garbage

1588
01:12:14,729 --> 01:12:17,699
collector or something I know how I

1589
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:21,119
could do this myself I need to or you

1590
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:23,399
know I have some idea of what it's going

1591
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:25,079
to take to know when these things need

1592
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:27,000
to kind of get cleaned up or something

1593
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:28,979
like that which rather than just

1594
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,609
expecting something to do it for me and

1595
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:32,738
then the other one is seeing

1596
01:12:30,609 --> 01:12:34,569
more like well there's gonna be

1597
01:12:32,738 --> 01:12:37,419
decision-making kind of at a higher

1598
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:38,529
level in some of these instances like

1599
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:40,510
you were saying about you know what kind

1600
01:12:38,529 --> 01:12:43,719
of code stuff what kind of coding

1601
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:45,429
practices to use when to make decisions

1602
01:12:43,719 --> 01:12:47,139
about kind of your micro time management

1603
01:12:45,429 --> 01:12:49,000
like will I make a prototype here would

1604
01:12:47,139 --> 01:12:52,329
that be effective sure those are kind of

1605
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,500
more like just like a loose experience

1606
01:12:52,329 --> 01:12:55,029
things where we just kind of have to

1607
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:57,488
have a taste for it almost if you've

1608
01:12:55,029 --> 01:12:59,380
written the more code you've written the

1609
01:12:57,488 --> 01:13:00,968
better your the the better you tend to

1610
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:04,560
be at those things right and also

1611
01:13:00,969 --> 01:13:07,060
knowing that I don't need to take

1612
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:10,570
something towards the bitter end to

1613
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:13,480
fully understand it like if you're only

1614
01:13:10,569 --> 01:13:15,519
trying to solve this problem you don't

1615
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:18,609
have to solve all the other problems as

1616
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:21,070
well I resist in that space right all

1617
01:13:18,609 --> 01:13:23,319
right I think yeah I think that's that

1618
01:13:21,069 --> 01:13:26,189
that might be everything I have on the

1619
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:29,198
like non code side thing like that

1620
01:13:26,189 --> 01:13:30,879
essentially the the sort of I don't know

1621
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:33,789
which one call it the window into like

1622
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,300
the actual like employee side of game

1623
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:38,529
development did I miss anything

1624
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:40,630
you know I mean I guess I should say cuz

1625
01:13:38,529 --> 01:13:45,039
you know it and I don't so I may have

1626
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:46,900
you know well I think we like not every

1627
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:49,300
engineering position is kind of the same

1628
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:54,069
you see like if you're working on the UI

1629
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:56,110
team there are our best C++ practices or

1630
01:13:54,069 --> 01:14:00,939
C pepper practices and then there's like

1631
01:13:56,109 --> 01:14:03,399
Lua as a thing there so those are

1632
01:14:00,939 --> 01:14:08,469
certain skills that matter then if

1633
01:14:03,399 --> 01:14:10,738
you're on the tools team where you know

1634
01:14:08,469 --> 01:14:14,350
other tool sets my or toolkits might be

1635
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:17,468
things to to kind of learn and just have

1636
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:19,179
good understanding of time but yeah it

1637
01:14:17,469 --> 01:14:20,590
then gets very domain-specific right

1638
01:14:19,179 --> 01:14:24,460
yeah right yeah whatever the particular

1639
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:26,079
yeah and working Wow like you're going

1640
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:29,980
to probably get confronted with a DB at

1641
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:31,510
some point right Oracle back inside of

1642
01:14:29,979 --> 01:14:34,959
this so understanding a little bit of

1643
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:37,449
how relational the B's kind of work it

1644
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,520
helps right because unlike another game

1645
01:14:37,448 --> 01:14:41,469
project which maybe never need to know

1646
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,750
this thing here you you are guaranteed

1647
01:14:41,469 --> 01:14:46,260
at some point you will have something

1648
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:53,229
that relates to very very likely yeah

1649
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:55,600
relates yes yes okay so we've got about

1650
01:14:53,229 --> 01:14:58,719
15 minutes left I think I'm not mistaken

1651
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,340
so you had mentioned two things kind of

1652
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:03,400
while we were walking right through here

1653
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:06,310
you said you wanted to talk about

1654
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:09,039
sixteen-year-old assumptions so yeah I

1655
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:12,130
mean there really aren't a lot of games

1656
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:15,430
that have to have a lifecycle of 16

1657
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:19,720
years at least not at the scale of wow I

1658
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:21,460
would say so right yeah so I think like

1659
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:24,449
a lot of the problems that we deal with

1660
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:26,739
right now on world of warcraft there

1661
01:15:24,449 --> 01:15:28,689
some of them are just very simple

1662
01:15:26,739 --> 01:15:33,609
assumptions that were made a long time

1663
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:38,649
ago and and they take a lot of time to

1664
01:15:33,609 --> 01:15:40,539
undo actually so for example the last

1665
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:45,129
couple of years we kind of went through

1666
01:15:40,539 --> 01:15:47,529
this where in the past it was completely

1667
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:50,109
acceptable to just say hey you know like

1668
01:15:47,529 --> 01:15:51,460
once a week for like eight or twelve

1669
01:15:50,109 --> 01:15:53,829
hours we're gonna take the service

1670
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:57,310
offline and we're gonna be patching

1671
01:15:53,829 --> 01:15:59,050
stuff and we'll fix things in the DB and

1672
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:01,150
we'll deploy things and we'll install

1673
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:03,579
this software in the data center and and

1674
01:16:01,149 --> 01:16:05,739
do that and and nowadays I think if

1675
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:08,409
you're you're starting from scratch you

1676
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:11,409
probably would try to operate with like

1677
01:16:08,409 --> 01:16:13,979
zero percent downtime right and just

1678
01:16:11,409 --> 01:16:17,170
kind of have systems where you're doing

1679
01:16:13,979 --> 01:16:20,939
like a be deploys red green like

1680
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:23,800
transition drain this set of servers

1681
01:16:20,939 --> 01:16:26,979
spin up this set of servers migrate

1682
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:30,489
people over so which is a lot more

1683
01:16:26,979 --> 01:16:32,169
involved certainly which believe it or

1684
01:16:30,489 --> 01:16:37,869
not there's fundamental architectural

1685
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:41,230
decisions you need to make to so on Wow

1686
01:16:37,869 --> 01:16:43,180
there's just a lot of the effort in in

1687
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:45,699
terms of like what the engineers and the

1688
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:49,930
project to go towards paying down tech

1689
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:52,119
debt so probably like it's hard to put

1690
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:56,039
in numbers but like 25 percent of the

1691
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:59,159
time that engineers spend is usually

1692
01:16:56,039 --> 01:17:03,029
seeing older systems like that in order

1693
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:05,970
to just provide kind of a more modern

1694
01:17:03,029 --> 01:17:09,479
experience like even like on the engine

1695
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:13,949
side that might be which was like one of

1696
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:19,459
my first things that I worked on was hey

1697
01:17:13,949 --> 01:17:22,500
water is a like flip book texture oh and

1698
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:24,750
let's make that look a bit more modern

1699
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:27,539
and make sure you can see through it and

1700
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:29,430
flex off intersections and reflections

1701
01:17:27,539 --> 01:17:32,010
and their type of stuff right so that's

1702
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:33,510
like one way of paying down tech debt by

1703
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:35,760
the way you have to do it in a way that

1704
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:37,230
nobody has to go back and fix up any of

1705
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,430
the art because now it's time for that

1706
01:17:37,229 --> 01:17:39,809
because they're working on the next

1707
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:41,460
thing and the tests run on Windows XP

1708
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:44,310
and all these other things we're excited

1709
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:51,359
yes yeah you know has to run on Windows

1710
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:54,060
XP XP is probably 32-bit for a while at

1711
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:56,460
this point okay we while we were the

1712
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:58,350
first game that had a 64-bit version at

1713
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:00,600
Blizzard which is kind of funny because

1714
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:07,500
we're also the first game that had two

1715
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:09,329
dx11 back-end but yeah there's it's just

1716
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:13,590
you're you have an open-world game and

1717
01:18:09,329 --> 01:18:15,750
you're like players do what you don't

1718
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:18,150
want them to do and yes and you're

1719
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:20,489
allowing add-ons to function within your

1720
01:18:18,149 --> 01:18:23,189
process space as well right so you don't

1721
01:18:20,489 --> 01:18:24,210
really get a lot of memory management

1722
01:18:23,189 --> 01:18:26,399
control yes

1723
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:28,590
so like running out of memory on 32-bit

1724
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:29,969
is like the number one crash that we

1725
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:32,159
have read it in Wow

1726
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:34,260
yeah because especially players will

1727
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:36,539
have a diverse set of other processors

1728
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:38,130
running for their you know team

1729
01:18:36,539 --> 01:18:39,659
management things or whatever they're

1730
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,190
doing you well as long as it's not part

1731
01:18:39,659 --> 01:18:47,180
of your process base you're usually fine

1732
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:49,859
because that's true I guess and they so

1733
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:52,260
yeah yeah and I suppose there might be

1734
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:53,519
running or are they always running on

1735
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,020
32-bit Windows it will they'll be

1736
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,600
running the 64-bit executable if they're

1737
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:59,780
on a 64-bit machine so well Windows XP

1738
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:04,220
you don't get an option right yes that's

1739
01:18:59,779 --> 01:19:06,229
so then I think there was a bit of a

1740
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:08,240
problem where when you were installing

1741
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:08,629
windows 7 there's like two disks in the

1742
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:11,599
box

1743
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:13,880
and if you don't know you've picked you

1744
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,220
put top 130 to it yeah and that may or

1745
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:18,829
may not have been good so so even though

1746
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:22,520
you have a perfectly fine 64-bit machine

1747
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:24,319
that can run software you didn't know so

1748
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,070
I think there's a lot of cases like that

1749
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:27,649
out there

1750
01:19:25,069 --> 01:19:31,729
then I think there are some people who

1751
01:19:27,649 --> 01:19:34,969
run 32-bit clients on 64-bit OS s

1752
01:19:31,729 --> 01:19:38,809
because actually of tech debt that we

1753
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:40,340
created for ourselves which was we in

1754
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:44,450
order to prevent people from running out

1755
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:46,760
of memory we would actually cap some of

1756
01:19:44,449 --> 01:19:49,489
the the settings on the engine right I

1757
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:52,220
was like phew distance gets reduced a

1758
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:54,289
bit extra details on other things right

1759
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,860
so people that don't look at that

1760
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:57,560
carefully

1761
01:19:54,859 --> 01:19:58,969
like the way we capped it was wrong we

1762
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,010
we basically allow you to move the

1763
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:02,840
slider to the right okay but we didn't

1764
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:04,850
show you that we're actually capping

1765
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:07,190
things I say so people are assuming that

1766
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:09,650
they're running at max settings except

1767
01:20:07,189 --> 01:20:12,739
on 32-bit they're not ice and then if

1768
01:20:09,649 --> 01:20:14,960
they run 64-bit on their system with the

1769
01:20:12,739 --> 01:20:19,219
same settings you get slower it's slower

1770
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:24,739
so I run 32 bits so that was one mistake

1771
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:27,440
I wish I could take back then some

1772
01:20:24,739 --> 01:20:31,010
people run 32-bit because that's where

1773
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:34,609
the bot software Oh allows hooking more

1774
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:37,369
easily so there's entire efforts on just

1775
01:20:34,609 --> 01:20:39,589
trying to deal with cheaters and I guess

1776
01:20:37,369 --> 01:20:42,380
somebody would just say to upgrade to 64

1777
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:46,610
bit makes that a little bit harder at

1778
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:49,600
least yeah so a lot of time gets spent

1779
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:53,539
on that tech debt in general is also

1780
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:56,590
content creation sites our art pipeline

1781
01:20:53,539 --> 01:20:56,590
is horrible

1782
01:20:56,599 --> 01:21:00,828
we're currently spending a lot of effort

1783
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,698
and trying to make that a bit more of a

1784
01:21:00,828 --> 01:21:09,828
modern experience and a lot of the work

1785
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:13,939
on WoW is just done like you need to add

1786
01:21:09,828 --> 01:21:17,090
a new feature your and it's very late in

1787
01:21:13,939 --> 01:21:18,469
the process so you're very cautious to

1788
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:21,409
not disturb anything

1789
01:21:18,469 --> 01:21:23,448
yes and then that starts adding a lot of

1790
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:27,170
kind of special cases only for this one

1791
01:21:23,448 --> 01:21:31,000
Thursday which then you need to spend

1792
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:33,739
time on going back and fixing up and

1793
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,109
yeah and I find myself writing mails of

1794
01:21:33,738 --> 01:21:38,269
like it's okay for you to add this flag

1795
01:21:36,109 --> 01:21:42,408
as long as you add a task to remove it

1796
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:46,070
like in two months it's like a sunset

1797
01:21:42,408 --> 01:21:49,698
provision on this this fix yeah

1798
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:52,189
the to kind of understand how big that

1799
01:21:49,698 --> 01:21:55,848
problem can get when not managed

1800
01:21:52,189 --> 01:21:58,759
properly we in order like a spell is

1801
01:21:55,849 --> 01:22:02,060
kind of a basic execution unit that

1802
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:03,650
designers have okay so when they want

1803
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:05,719
something in the world to happen they

1804
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:08,448
cast a spell okay and the spell isn't

1805
01:22:05,719 --> 01:22:10,730
necessarily what you perceive in the

1806
01:22:08,448 --> 01:22:12,678
game as a spell right it's something

1807
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:15,678
that affects the change yeah like they

1808
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:18,920
can cast a spell at an area with a

1809
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:20,658
300-yard radius to find all the players

1810
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:23,029
that are there and then they have some

1811
01:22:20,658 --> 01:22:25,250
diverse script that they run to pick one

1812
01:22:23,029 --> 01:22:29,868
of those and then I say cast another

1813
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:31,340
spell that that guy and like it'll like

1814
01:22:29,868 --> 01:22:33,859
spawn the unit that is going to follow

1815
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:36,230
that person got it and then they cast

1816
01:22:33,859 --> 01:22:38,658
another spell that says oh now make a

1817
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:41,059
beam that goes to that unit and then

1818
01:22:38,658 --> 01:22:43,368
where that beam hits there's a pull

1819
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:45,289
spell that will do damage and that now

1820
01:22:43,368 --> 01:22:49,908
is like a laser beam that is following a

1821
01:22:45,289 --> 01:22:51,229
person and if you look at wow if you

1822
01:22:49,908 --> 01:22:53,960
were to recreate Wow

1823
01:22:51,229 --> 01:22:55,698
right I think you would build systems

1824
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:58,039
that are just like well we're gonna have

1825
01:22:55,698 --> 01:23:02,149
the beam system that can follow a player

1826
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:06,319
and you know like that's that but we

1827
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:08,299
have five spells for that okay because a

1828
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:10,058
designer was able to do it right and

1829
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:14,449
nobody kind of saw him doing it

1830
01:23:10,059 --> 01:23:16,250
so because everybody goes like I if I

1831
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:19,308
had to do that I wouldn't want to like

1832
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:23,000
can somebody just make a trace thing for

1833
01:23:19,309 --> 01:23:26,059
me well I mean in general both design

1834
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,399
and are usually come at things from the

1835
01:23:26,059 --> 01:23:30,860
perspective of you know I have a set of

1836
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:33,558
fix tools and I'm trying to get an end

1837
01:23:30,859 --> 01:23:35,719
result so it's yes it's especially

1838
01:23:33,559 --> 01:23:37,550
especially good designers and artists

1839
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:39,769
will oftentimes push thing as to a place

1840
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:41,869
where maybe it you know it's a little

1841
01:23:39,769 --> 01:23:43,309
more complicated than you like but it's

1842
01:23:41,868 --> 01:23:46,158
also what makes them good probably right

1843
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:47,809
yeah yeah I mean good designers and

1844
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:51,589
artists can do great things with yes

1845
01:23:47,809 --> 01:23:54,650
with very little yes but that comes with

1846
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:58,788
you know with the comprises right

1847
01:23:54,649 --> 01:24:06,408
and and these things just grow very

1848
01:23:58,788 --> 01:24:08,569
unbounded right so yeah so we've got

1849
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:11,029
five minutes left and I have one thing

1850
01:24:08,569 --> 01:24:12,408
that's hot fixing okay so you because

1851
01:24:11,029 --> 01:24:14,090
you mentioned it like you said I wanted

1852
01:24:12,408 --> 01:24:18,319
to talk about hot fixing so tell me

1853
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:21,110
I'm fixing like hot fix thing I actually

1854
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:23,058
think is one of the things that we do

1855
01:24:21,109 --> 01:24:25,808
better at and because we have different

1856
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:28,909
ways of hot fixing certain types of data

1857
01:24:25,809 --> 01:24:30,409
can you can you give me some like what

1858
01:24:28,908 --> 01:24:36,710
do you want the definition of hot fixing

1859
01:24:30,408 --> 01:24:40,939
to be forthright hot fixing to us is so

1860
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:43,519
a binary hot fix is something like a

1861
01:24:40,939 --> 01:24:46,669
client binary hot fix is me fixing your

1862
01:24:43,519 --> 01:24:48,829
executable on your machine okay so the

1863
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:50,389
server will needs to send you something

1864
01:24:48,828 --> 01:24:52,009
and it's going it was part of our

1865
01:24:50,389 --> 01:24:57,880
publishing pipeline it's like it's like

1866
01:24:52,010 --> 01:25:01,670
a patch right and we're able to do that

1867
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:03,710
like from you checking in a fix

1868
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:08,480
we're able to give that to a user in

1869
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:10,819
about an hour well what then we have

1870
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:16,908
data hot fixes that just get applied to

1871
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:18,979
the server that are like the server

1872
01:25:16,908 --> 01:25:20,839
receives the data and then gives it to

1873
01:25:18,979 --> 01:25:21,928
the clients yes so that they can fix up

1874
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:24,659
their data

1875
01:25:21,929 --> 01:25:28,168
and that allows us to tweak you know

1876
01:25:24,658 --> 01:25:31,978
like like the damage that this spell

1877
01:25:28,168 --> 01:25:36,738
does by X percent without yeah without

1878
01:25:31,979 --> 01:25:39,628
having to restart everything and then

1879
01:25:36,738 --> 01:25:41,728
server binary is you know like when a

1880
01:25:39,628 --> 01:25:44,038
server crashes there's a mechanism where

1881
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:46,469
it can pick up like a fixed version of

1882
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:51,719
the binary that won't crash so that we

1883
01:25:46,469 --> 01:25:53,788
can roll that out and like hop fixing is

1884
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:57,448
super important for us internally

1885
01:25:53,788 --> 01:26:01,738
because we the way we develop the game

1886
01:25:57,448 --> 01:26:03,509
we're all kind of working on one DB so

1887
01:26:01,738 --> 01:26:05,518
when you go into our editor and you

1888
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:08,639
change value of a spell and you save

1889
01:26:05,519 --> 01:26:11,159
right now that goes to a DB that we

1890
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:13,739
share on the floor and your edits are

1891
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:15,509
affecting kind of this stuff I see the

1892
01:26:13,738 --> 01:26:17,308
moment I would restart my server I'd be

1893
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:19,199
picking up some of those changes right I

1894
01:26:17,309 --> 01:26:21,929
see so although as you were saying

1895
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:24,058
earlier although people are running a

1896
01:26:21,929 --> 01:26:25,800
server locally on their machine they are

1897
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:28,590
not running a database locally on their

1898
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:31,349
machine right so like I could literally

1899
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:33,090
be trying to do something and think that

1900
01:26:31,349 --> 01:26:34,439
I tested something one way and it turns

1901
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:37,409
out that somebody right in the middle of

1902
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:38,760
my tests had done something and now but

1903
01:26:37,408 --> 01:26:40,679
that it sounds like a relatively

1904
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:43,559
difficult problem actually yeah I mean

1905
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:47,878
not to solve I mean to this is again

1906
01:26:43,559 --> 01:26:50,458
like a good example of work that we're

1907
01:26:47,878 --> 01:26:54,510
currently doing in order to like as the

1908
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:56,309
team grew there's more like people

1909
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:57,989
stepping on each other's toes because of

1910
01:26:56,309 --> 01:26:59,489
the way the infrastructure was yes yes

1911
01:26:57,988 --> 01:27:01,348
and at the start you're just like oh

1912
01:26:59,488 --> 01:27:04,259
we're all editing the same stuff we're

1913
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:06,269
seeing changes immediately iteration

1914
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:09,329
yeah it's a feature and it it kind of

1915
01:27:06,269 --> 01:27:11,998
goes a lot to to the promise that Chris

1916
01:27:09,328 --> 01:27:15,898
was explaining of like so how simple

1917
01:27:11,998 --> 01:27:18,688
decisions done like many years ago like

1918
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:21,300
the DB is central storage it's very easy

1919
01:27:18,689 --> 01:27:24,719
to add a column that is our version of

1920
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:27,090
instead of having an asset on disk right

1921
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:29,698
like the DB is almost the asset that you

1922
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:30,809
load yes by the way all spells are

1923
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:32,439
loaded by the clients

1924
01:27:30,809 --> 01:27:34,930
oh we're adding them at a rapid rate

1925
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:36,609
was blowing over memory boundaries and

1926
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:40,719
and those types of things so we have to

1927
01:27:36,609 --> 01:27:42,549
also do compression type work too to

1928
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:44,500
kind of get the data stay at a

1929
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:46,659
reasonable level because not everything

1930
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:49,810
was built in an asynchronous way and yes

1931
01:27:46,659 --> 01:27:52,329
and all of that but yeah one of the ways

1932
01:27:49,810 --> 01:27:54,670
to actually remove edits is to to then

1933
01:27:52,329 --> 01:27:55,809
move to a more local workflow and that

1934
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:57,190
is like one of the larger

1935
01:27:55,810 --> 01:28:00,820
transformations that we're currently

1936
01:27:57,189 --> 01:28:03,219
trying to get through in modernizing the

1937
01:28:00,819 --> 01:28:04,529
tech yeah and and what's kind of strange

1938
01:28:03,219 --> 01:28:08,649
about this is like when I joined

1939
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:11,019
Blizzard I thought all right there's

1940
01:28:08,649 --> 01:28:13,599
this like wow it's running as a service

1941
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:15,850
you know they gotta be like really

1942
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:19,600
careful to change anything because you

1943
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:21,460
could break so much right and I arrived

1944
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,739
into a culture were just like yes we're

1945
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:28,149
rewriting these systems like massively

1946
01:28:23,738 --> 01:28:29,948
and is there automated testing or unit

1947
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:31,839
tests that they have to run through well

1948
01:28:29,948 --> 01:28:36,549
not really

1949
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:39,250
we rely actually a lot on like PTR

1950
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:41,890
testing so we we invited a lot of people

1951
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:47,409
to be kind of test or see the new

1952
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:49,960
content early but help exercise the

1953
01:28:47,409 --> 01:28:52,649
systems as as a player would and that

1954
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:55,689
also gives us good usually good load

1955
01:28:52,649 --> 01:28:57,369
kind of characteristics it that you

1956
01:28:55,689 --> 01:29:00,460
don't quite get if you're just running

1957
01:28:57,369 --> 01:29:02,198
bots against your infrastructure because

1958
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:05,529
Bob is never going to behave the way a

1959
01:29:02,198 --> 01:29:07,779
player does but yeah seeing kind of this

1960
01:29:05,529 --> 01:29:10,179
no it's not set in stone there's

1961
01:29:07,779 --> 01:29:13,389
actually a lot of interesting work to do

1962
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:16,360
to modernize kind of the content

1963
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:19,449
creation pipeline to modernize the art

1964
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:20,859
pipeline to be able to give get more of

1965
01:29:19,448 --> 01:29:27,129
what you see is what you get type of

1966
01:29:20,859 --> 01:29:30,460
workflow is going like when I again like

1967
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:34,119
when I joined it was you were making

1968
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:37,480
some tweaks to the level and then with

1969
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:39,670
or at or an asset like you we're moving

1970
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:41,559
a tree and you had to run a map gen

1971
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:43,630
process that would then move the tree

1972
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:44,289
okay and then you fire up your client

1973
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:46,449
and your serve

1974
01:29:44,289 --> 01:29:49,779
and then you get the tree in the new

1975
01:29:46,449 --> 01:29:51,760
location okay so and rather than

1976
01:29:49,779 --> 01:29:53,349
changing all of that at once it was like

1977
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:56,320
hey maybe we can make this more like a

1978
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:58,480
like a console style work though that

1979
01:29:56,319 --> 01:30:00,759
when the client is running the editor

1980
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:03,339
can just tell the client like move move

1981
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:05,920
move your tree and then you get a bit

1982
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:09,460
more kind of instant feedback right yes

1983
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:11,109
but yeah that's that's kind of the work

1984
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:15,789
we do in terms of dealing with tech that

1985
01:30:11,109 --> 01:30:18,670
hot fixing is like applying a hot fix or

1986
01:30:15,789 --> 01:30:20,680
changing data is almost the same unit of

1987
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:22,750
change that we currently send to our

1988
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:24,490
server and being able to do that locally

1989
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:27,010
is stuff that looks really really

1990
01:30:24,489 --> 01:30:28,869
interesting to us right now cool so I

1991
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:30,220
think we are exactly at like 90 right

1992
01:30:28,869 --> 01:30:32,640
here yes sir

1993
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:44,920
thank you so much that was awesome

1994
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:44,920
[Applause]
