1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,120
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,638
hero show where we code a complete game

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,800
live on stream uh we are gonna probably

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:14,320
try to put some interesting

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,359
room designs into handmade hero today

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,399
i'm guessing

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,320
uh we were sort of like uh

8
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,559
last time wasn't last weekend because

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,079
obs pooped out on us last weekend

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,320
and we had to try and fix it hopefully

11
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,239
it'll stay working today we don't know

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,039
uh it worked for the pre-stream it might

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,280
work for the regular stream we'll see

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,239
so what we're gonna do today is probably

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,439
go in there and

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,320
use what we were doing uh two weekends

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,718
ago

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,399
when last we were able to program and

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,480
we're just gonna go ahead and and see if

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,600
we can put some interesting uh

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,159
room design in now that we have uh sort

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,160
of

23
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,198
ways of calling stuff that looks at the

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,359
entire

25
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:57,759
uh scene and you know like i said

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,719
mostly what we were doing that time was

27
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,079
we were just sort of re

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,478
trying to think of how i would call what

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,400
i would describe it as

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,159
we had sort of tried to make the system

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
a little bit too abstract at first

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,719
uh largely because we just didn't know

33
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,920
what we were doing i mean we didn't have

34
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,280
a plan for it we're just kind of putting

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,478
stuff in there

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,118
and i think we want it pretty hand coded

37
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,959
we don't want a lot of generic systems

38
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,519
in there just like doing stuff

39
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,199
because the game design side of things

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,079
is always very touchy and you want to

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
make a lot of little

42
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,719
like tweaks and so the goal is i'm just

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,320
trying to reorganize that code

44
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:37,519
so that in as so much as possible

45
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,478
i'm able to really like

46
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,519
hand code how things are decided you

47
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,719
know what i mean

48
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,199
um so we're trying to make a

49
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,200
scaffold like we're trying to make it so

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,478
that as much as possible

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,879
we don't have to think too hard about

52
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,920
where to put stuff in the code

53
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:01,519
so that we can make sort of arbitrary

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,040
uh game design tweaky stuff

55
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,199
that uh that creates the rooms

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
and probably we want to do this at all

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,520
levels so

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
again it's tough to give you a little

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,719
like

60
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,238
broader outline of what's going on um i

61
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,039
can even you know what we can even do

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,719
this now if

63
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,639
obs is still working let's let's find

64
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,560
out so just to give you

65
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:27,598
a slight outline of the idea

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,000
uh what we have right now is we

67
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,919
we want to start putting in like you

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,519
know gameplay stuff

69
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,919
because we're kind of out of engine

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,640
stuff to do and in order to put gameplay

71
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,958
stuff in there

72
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,399
we need ways of generating interesting

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,719
environments

74
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,920
from code because the idea is this

75
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,959
game's supposed to be sort of like a

76
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,839
binding of isaac

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,199
kind of feel to it in that you don't

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,719
explore

79
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:55,119
one specific world you like it generates

80
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,239
something for you each time

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,878
and when we do this it's it's important

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,039
that we

83
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,000
give ourselves the maximum amount of

84
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,679
flexibility

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,360
when programming the thing that

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,040
generates the world

87
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,560
because that's what the user is going to

88
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,919
be playing right they're going to be

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,840
interacting with this world

90
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,439
and so if we just kind of throw some

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,800
random numbers in there

92
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,479
and cross our fingers it's going to feel

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,159
exactly like that's what we did when

94
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,518
they play the game it's just gonna feel

95
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,719
like they're playing a bunch of random

96
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,000
numbers and it's not gonna be very

97
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,439
satisfying

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,598
so we need ways of hand coding

99
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,439
a lot of stuff like when we're like oh

100
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,798
it would be nice if when we put one of

101
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,799
these in the room there was a

102
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,400
sometimes this happened because that

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
makes an interesting gameplay thing

104
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
that's just human intuition and we need

105
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,479
to be able to like dump that

106
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,479
in to the generator easily so that we're

107
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,798
not struggling all the time to make

108
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,639
those things happen

109
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,239
at the same time it's a fairly

110
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,279
complicated problem because one of the

111
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,400
things that you get

112
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,598
with random generation is it's you've

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,560
got all these things happening at

114
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,560
different levels you've got

115
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,158
randomly placed rooms with randomly

116
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,680
placed goals and randomly placed

117
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,438
environments that randomly connect to

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,879
each other with random enemies

119
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,280
there's so much stuff in there that it

120
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,359
can be hard to organize that code

121
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,519
in such a way that allows all of it to

122
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,640
actually be smart about how it's doing

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,438
what it's doing

124
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,000
and so it's gonna be a little while i

125
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,040
think of

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,120
us just you know trying uh uh

127
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,560
architecturally trying things to get it

128
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,040
down to what is

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,000
what works well and is simple but that

130
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,759
also still

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,519
like actually allows us to generate what

132
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,840
we need to generate

133
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,959
uh in a convenient way so that's really

134
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,198
what we're doing

135
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,478
um and so we're just trying to feel out

136
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,240
where that is and

137
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,839
we previously on handmade hero didn't

138
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
really care about how things were

139
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,399
generated because we weren't trying to

140
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,599
do gameplay we were just doing engine

141
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,799
stuff and so it doesn't really matter

142
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,080
what we generate just as long as

143
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,160
generating anything

144
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,599
we can work on like the renderer or

145
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
whatever right

146
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,520
but now that we're actually trying to

147
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
say let's let's try to make the game

148
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,799
work in a way that's like fun to play or

149
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,520
that there's interesting things for the

150
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,000
player to do

151
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,120
in this world that's when we now need to

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,720
start saying look

153
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,319
the generation code is where all this

154
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,000
stuff is going to happen

155
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,599
every time we add something in the

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
gameplay code we're going to need to

157
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,720
back that up with it generating

158
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,280
you know interesting things happening in

159
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,199
the generator to expose that gameplay

160
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,918
we don't want that to be a pain in the

161
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,680
butt we need that to be nice and fluid

162
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,279
and so that's what we have to start

163
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,560
working on much like how we're starting

164
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,038
to work on the entity system

165
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,120
these two things are the gameplay part

166
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,439
right envy system and generation

167
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
are what determine the gameplay and so

168
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,680
we need to just refine these

169
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,439
uh to the point where it's very easy for

170
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,759
us to make

171
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,680
the changes uh that we need to make and

172
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,160
to make sure that the code operates in a

173
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,560
way

174
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,240
that allows us to express things cleanly

175
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,519
so that we're not struggling all the

176
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,000
time and cleanly is probably the wrong

177
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,000
word

178
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,439
succinctly so that we don't have to

179
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,519
constantly do all these like

180
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,160
larger systemic changes to make stuff

181
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:57,680
happen so that's what we're doing

182
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,160
um and we're going to give that a shot

183
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,319
right now some of that a shot right now

184
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,919
so if you take a look at how

185
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,400
we sort of left things you can see that

186
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,719
we just put like a little temporary door

187
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,560
it's just a stone graphic in there we

188
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,960
don't have a door graphic right now

189
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,720
um and when you hop on like a thing it

190
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,198
moves the door down or whatever

191
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
um and we have some stuff we wanted to

192
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,120
do gameplay wise

193
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,639
with the with the the pressure plates we

194
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
had some stuff we wanted to fix

195
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,160
we could fix those now too because

196
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,160
that's pretty straightforward but

197
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,360
mainly the thing we want to do is now

198
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,720
start putting

199
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,560
in pressure plate patterns into the room

200
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,080
and we kind of need rooms to um

201
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
we need to like work on that room

202
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,879
generation code so it's easy for us to

203
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,400
do things like

204
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:47,360
put down enemies

205
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,399
pressure plates and obstacles in a way

206
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,319
that works together

207
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,560
right and that's why i keep saying like

208
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,680
we need to make it more

209
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,959
hand coded in a way um because we just

210
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
don't currently have

211
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,198
any way of of expressing that stuff with

212
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,000
the way that we did

213
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,439
uh the generation code before right we

214
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,959
just don't have a way

215
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,478
we were just dumping things in and then

216
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,799
they randomly got placed

217
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,959
and that's really not going to cut it so

218
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,400
we're we we're trying to figure out ways

219
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:20,560
of making that be more

220
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:23,839
logical right that be more flexible

221
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,000
okay um so if we take a look at

222
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,918
the the energy generator code you can

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,639
see like the first change that we made

224
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,318
to try

225
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,680
and make oh how do we get this purple

226
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,680
that's a new four quarter thing we've

227
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,840
got like a bright purple for casey

228
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,519
is that like uh you know to let it let

229
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:43,038
me know it's me

230
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,878
um i don't even know

231
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,519
oh we look at this purple what's going

232
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,840
on with this crazy purple

233
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,159
ryan what's going on this crazy purple

234
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,799
that is some crazy purple right there

235
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,800
um anyway

236
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,599
i'm probably going to change that color

237
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,639
at some point

238
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,240
that is nuts um so we made one of the

239
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,439
first changes we wanted to make which is

240
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,160
you can see here that

241
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,079
now what happens is entities are not

242
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,360
generated individually they're generated

243
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,159
as part of patterns

244
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,160
and patterns are laid down inside their

245
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,319
own hand-coded routines

246
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,560
the reason i did this was again so that

247
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,120
i could hand code

248
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,000
crazy rules like whatever i want i

249
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,319
didn't have to make them fit some system

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,759
i could just have whatever crazy rule i

251
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,560
want and that

252
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,759
would uh be how you know it would be

253
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,119
laid out

254
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,120
so this is the first step in doing that

255
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,959
and now you can kind of see like all

256
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
right so the tile switch pattern for

257
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,838
example

258
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
we need to start making some tools that

259
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,040
allow me to lay these tiles out

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,559
easily right some way that i can make

261
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,439
the tile switch pattern

262
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,479
be intelligent and what you can see here

263
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,480
for example

264
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,920
is this tries to put uh four tiles down

265
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:06,000
right at the moment um

266
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,000
and it tries to put four tiles down but

267
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
so you know what i also noticed you know

268
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,360
i need to like have this male up there

269
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,200
so that i can do it uh my types aren't

270
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,600
highlighting anymore either

271
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
did you notice that like it used to be

272
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,000
that the types

273
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,680
would highlight um

274
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,720
but they don't anymore and i'm not sure

275
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:32,879
why um it might be because we haven't

276
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,399
actually set the correct thing but i

277
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,639
just wanna

278
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,519
if you'll excuse me for a moment i'm

279
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,919
just

280
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:45,360
just want to why don't types highlight

281
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:48,879
is this a setting and what

282
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,278
is this garish purple okay so i'll look

283
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,519
at those

284
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,320
those are probably actually pretty easy

285
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,959
answers

286
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,160
um i can probably figure them out myself

287
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,159
they're probably just settings

288
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,838
but uh i just want to note all of the

289
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,519
things that i noticed so that i can fine

290
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,720
tune it

291
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,278
all right so if we go ahead

292
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,160
and continue forward if we if we march

293
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,039
forward

294
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,919
um what i want to do is say all right

295
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,958
let's

296
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,958
try to make this grid thing um

297
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,519
let's try to make this pattern generator

298
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:24,559
actually generate patterns

299
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,519
uh that i care about right

300
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,958
so one way to do this there there's a

301
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,480
couple different things i might want to

302
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,239
do and i'm just going to kind of

303
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
mention them out loud so if you take a

304
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,519
look in here we've got this gen entity

305
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,600
pattern

306
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,120
this probably wants some parameters so

307
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
that when you put a pattern in a room

308
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,959
you can

309
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,839
you can specify stuff and things like

310
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,599
this

311
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,360
i don't really know exactly how i want

312
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,120
to do this but one thing i can pretty

313
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,039
much say

314
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,200
is you know we probably want something

315
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,319
in here that's like a difficulty

316
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,839
right um where we can just spam stuff

317
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,519
out there and say look when we call a

318
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,920
particular generator

319
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,519
we're going to want things in the room

320
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,719
to be coordinated in terms of how

321
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,200
difficult they are

322
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,759
so for example a really hard room might

323
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,560
generate

324
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,159
lots of patterns with high difficulty so

325
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,078
the enemy pattern

326
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,278
the tile switch pattern and the obstacle

327
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:19,599
pattern may all

328
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,958
be like hard lots of tiles with hard

329
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,720
restrictions

330
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,479
enemies with lots of hit points that do

331
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,920
a lot of damage these sorts of things

332
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
right

333
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,519
and similarly in other parts we may want

334
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,039
like a high difficulty tile pattern with

335
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,480
a low difficulty enemy

336
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,240
or low difficulty everything in

337
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,320
introductory areas right

338
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,720
so one thing that we probably want to do

339
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,680
is just carry a difficulty idea

340
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
idea along with the patterns so that

341
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,000
every

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,078
pattern generator can be tuned to be

343
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,320
able to generate things

344
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,120
reasonably and so like in here for

345
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,879
example

346
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,720
maybe when we look and we say like

347
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,879
random between like this

348
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,120
maybe in the tile switch pattern thing

349
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,679
we've got some ideas about how these

350
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,159
patterns

351
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,159
might go

352
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,679
um and there's probably going to be like

353
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,399
a lot of stuff in here

354
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,958
at first i'm just gonna say let's just

355
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,200
do

356
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,799
some simple patterns that have like you

357
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,759
know that generate some some pretty

358
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,120
simple sort of

359
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,439
directional things and uh

360
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,639
there's there's a couple things that we

361
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
probably want to add here which is

362
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,879
because

363
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,120
tiles are so important we probably also

364
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,200
want easy ways to test to see whether

365
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,759
there are tiles in places or not

366
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,120
right um and so that's something we

367
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,319
probably should add as well

368
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,399
like the grid should know so that as we

369
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,839
put things in the grid it knows like oh

370
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,240
here's where the tiles were or something

371
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,000
right

372
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,600
so we probably want that to happen as

373
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,919
well

374
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,879
all right so first things first i'm just

375
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,559
gonna do

376
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:58,879
uh some some simple setup stuff here

377
00:12:54,559 --> 00:13:02,000
uh where maybe we break things down

378
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:05,120
into difficulty like i'm gonna say

379
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,360
like if the difficulty is uh

380
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
and maybe we'll just call the difficulty

381
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,919
d just because we're going to use it

382
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,879
everywhere

383
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,199
so if i say like all right the pattern i

384
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,679
get

385
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,200
called with the pattern right yeah so if

386
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:22,159
the pattern difficulty

387
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,040
is less than like you know 25 if it's

388
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,679
less than

389
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,759
75 uh and then otherwise this is like

390
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,000
the hardest or whatever right

391
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,159
um then what i might do is say let's

392
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,440
take the tile counts and we'll put the

393
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,120
tile counts

394
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,440
um in as like some kind of a you know

395
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
of a thing that gets set on each of

396
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
these paths

397
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,159
right so um and i'll initialize it to

398
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,160
zero because

399
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,439
why not i don't really need to but i

400
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,600
might as well

401
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,839
so in here if you know if it's less you

402
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,839
know maybe there's only like four tiles

403
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,959
or whatever in a simple case um

404
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,279
you know just something really really

405
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,198
basic or maybe maybe there's only like

406
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,320
very few so sometimes there's only one i

407
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,639
don't know

408
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,120
so we could look in here and say we're

409
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,600
going to take the entropy here

410
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,360
the grid itself so if we look at the

411
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,470
edit grid

412
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,470
[Music]

413
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
um

414
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,278
interesting product

415
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,360
i wonder what product means

416
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,599
i don't know um i'm not sure

417
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,719
this is pretty confusing so like i typed

418
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,120
in edit grid

419
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,480
right um and it looks like it

420
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,320
shows me everything in the file

421
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,199
edit grid for some reason and i have no

422
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,959
idea

423
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,039
why that would happen like none of these

424
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,838
things are edit grid

425
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,799
um maybe what it's saying is here's the

426
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,120
things that use

427
00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:01,120
edit grid uh

428
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,519
but but it doesn't seem to because like

429
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,919
this doesn't use edit grid

430
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,919
at all

431
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:12,000
right so i feel like that's

432
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,519
really weird and i don't like that at

433
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,639
all um

434
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,480
i don't want it to find files at all

435
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,919
so let me let me add this it's gonna be

436
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,120
this thing of like making a bigger

437
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,240
bigger email

438
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,639
um why does

439
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,320
project search find file names

440
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,639
um maybe i called the wrong thing i

441
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,639
don't know

442
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,838
oh um

443
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,560
let me ask ryan it looks like ryan's

444
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
here

445
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,959
so i can ask ryan ryan and see

446
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,120
uh what what he has to say i don't know

447
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,559
if there's an answer there might be

448
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
we'll find out

449
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:27,198
um but but who knows

450
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,800
uh all right so anyway um i don't really

451
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:29,679
care because i don't really need it that

452
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,198
that badly

453
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,638
uh but again these are things i don't

454
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,240
wanna keep having these problems so i

455
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,879
just wanna get it to a good state and

456
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,720
leave it

457
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,240
so i'm hoping we can just you know iron

458
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,120
some of those out

459
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,320
so in the edit grid you can see that in

460
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,879
here the series

461
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,680
it comes in with the you know with the

462
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,759
grid

463
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,679
so i think i can just do something like

464
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,079
this where i just pull the series out

465
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,479
now

466
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,599
it's hard to say because it might be

467
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,800
that what i should do

468
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,440
is actually have the random like

469
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,278
random maybe should just be right on the

470
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,240
grid so that i don't even have to pull

471
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,519
it out

472
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,558
um but i don't know right

473
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,558
uh so so who knows

474
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,160
anyway so assuming we have the series in

475
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:13,439
here what i'm gonna do is say look

476
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,038
there's gonna be between

477
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,839
maybe one and four um tiles

478
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,720
in in those cases there's going to be

479
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,399
like between

480
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,400
four and 12 tiles in this case

481
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,600
uh and you know there's going to be

482
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,880
between um

483
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,678
maybe like 8 and 16 tiles in this case i

484
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,360
don't know

485
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,360
and we don't care i'm just trying to

486
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,439
like get some stuff set up that sort of

487
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,558
starts to look like something i could

488
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,519
imagine doing in

489
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:47,839
in-game programming in in game play

490
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,839
programming right

491
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,119
um and so when we do the tile counts

492
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
here

493
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,000
then what we need to do is figure out

494
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,400
what kind of patterns are going to be

495
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,599
and also like what kind of tiles they're

496
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,759
going to be

497
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,119
um because we want to have a couple

498
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,720
different tile

499
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:12,000
like types and so there's like a tile

500
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,798
there'd be like a tile rule

501
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,839
you know what i'm saying so there'd be

502
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,400
tiles that are like

503
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,079
you have to stand on this tile for a

504
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,038
certain number of seconds

505
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,558
potentially in order to trigger it right

506
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,839
um

507
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:27,599
so i feel like there's going to be a

508
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,359
couple things like that that we want to

509
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,079
set as well and those would get set in

510
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,839
here we just don't quite have that yet

511
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,359
so once we know how many tiles there are

512
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,199
then we have to kind of figure out what

513
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,359
kind of tile pattern we want to do

514
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,360
and the tile pattern i guess would be

515
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,159
like

516
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,079
um how it how it snakes through we can

517
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,360
have tile patterns like the tiles don't

518
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,319
have to be connected

519
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,000
but it probably is more fun to see them

520
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,279
connected a lot of the time

521
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,839
so we probably want to actually have

522
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,359
a specific idea of what kind of pattern

523
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,599
we're talking about

524
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,599
um

525
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,919
like

526
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,120
we probably want to choose like are we

527
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,678
doing a snake-like pattern

528
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,439
or a line-like pattern we probably want

529
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,720
these to be like hand-coded i guess is

530
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,759
what i'm saying we don't want them to be

531
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,400
random we want to say like

532
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,440
here's one that's like a one that goes

533
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,400
in directions and makes

534
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:32,240
turns right and here's one that you know

535
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,038
um that just randomly scatters

536
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,839
i don't know uh i don't have a concrete

537
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,160
idea but i just think we want there to

538
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,759
be

539
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,160
like we want there to be

540
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:47,200
discrete types of patterns and that the

541
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,640
player recognizes those patterns

542
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:54,000
specifically um

543
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,600
you know what i'm saying so like

544
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,359
and and to the point where this is

545
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,480
probably gonna be the sort of thing that

546
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,558
that even has its own like associated

547
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,839
nonsense right like it's probably gonna

548
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,038
have like

549
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:09,359
um

550
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,359
uh

551
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,038
something like this and and maybe we

552
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,038
even have you know like a

553
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,959
uh

554
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,960
a tracker

555
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,240
so we create one of these and we'd like

556
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,960
push you know

557
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,839
ones on there right and so i would

558
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,840
almost do like

559
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,839
okay we've got a tile pattern

560
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,640
um and we start making the tile pattern

561
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,720
by using different things and maybe we

562
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,679
have like a you know tile pattern

563
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:52,798
type and the tile pattern type

564
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,220
uh let's say there's just like line

565
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,308
um

566
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,308
[Music]

567
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,440
snake and scatter

568
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,190
i don't know so like scatter would just

569
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,519
kind of put them

570
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,798
[Music]

571
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:09,359
around line will just go in one straight

572
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,038
direction and snake will like bend

573
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,279
you know occasionally or something like

574
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,279
that

575
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,600
uh and so what we do here is say

576
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,119
you know what actually we can even make

577
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,359
this be like

578
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,359
uh

579
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,679
part of it so we do tile pattern pattern

580
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,720
right

581
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,600
and then in here we do pattern max tile

582
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,120
count

583
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:38,719
not moss stuck we do max tile count

584
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:42,239
to set it right and in here

585
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,319
we just go ahead and pick

586
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,159
the max tile count out of the series and

587
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,798
then in here we just do like

588
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,440
while pattern tile count is less than

589
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,759
pattern

590
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,759
max tile count you know pick

591
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,639
right um so we'd create this and this

592
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,400
way we can have functions that do

593
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,679
picking based on this sort of thing and

594
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,320
we can also do checking

595
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,320
you know what i mean

596
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:16,879
all right um

597
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:26,240
so the way that i would approach this is

598
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:29,440
i would say like

599
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:41,839
i would say uh for our tile pattern

600
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:44,320
thing here um

601
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,439
so i think what i want and again this is

602
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,879
all just me making stuff

603
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,919
up i'm not a game designer so please

604
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,120
just always take this stuff with a grain

605
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,240
of salt

606
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,519
i'm just doing the code that comes to

607
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,720
mind

608
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,119
based on having played games that's it

609
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,759
right so you know if you actually want

610
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:08,158
to know how to do

611
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,798
the process of deciding how to make this

612
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,640
stuff work

613
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,079
you really want to watch like john blows

614
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,200
stream not my stream

615
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,558
this is me just randomly saying

616
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,240
i'm going to place some patterns on the

617
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,000
floor

618
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,319
but i'm probably not doing it in a very

619
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,919
good way because there's probably

620
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,240
ways that if you did a lot of game

621
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,919
design code very well like john does

622
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,359
then you probably know how to do this

623
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,200
stuff right

624
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:36,240
um so i would i would highly recommend

625
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,279
not following

626
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,880
my logic of how i'm deciding what to do

627
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,639
here

628
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,640
you know i still feel like the way i

629
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,240
write code is good

630
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,520
if you can somehow separate that from

631
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,319
what i'm what i'm deciding to write

632
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,079
but you know please try to make that

633
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,480
separation your head as much as possible

634
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,319
because

635
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,599
the decision-making process here will be

636
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,839
poor right

637
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,959
uh so so you have to keep that in mind

638
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,199
because you know

639
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,600
you you want to take game design process

640
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,120
advice from an expert game designer

641
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,558
not an engine programmer engine

642
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,038
programmers don't know how to do game

643
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,678
design

644
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:13,278
so you know it's not it's not the right

645
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,798
person to listen to

646
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,599
so please keep that in the back of your

647
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,639
head this entire time

648
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,199
okay so anyway in here i just want to do

649
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,400
like a

650
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,440
a simple thing that's like uh

651
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,840
tile already exists or something

652
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,600
and so if you pass a tile pattern it'll

653
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,720
tell you if this particular

654
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:38,079
tile pattern has uh

655
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,000
this tile in it right so

656
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,000
at this particular position you know

657
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,440
what i'm saying and again i don't care

658
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,319
about this code right now so i'm

659
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,000
literally just going to write the

660
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,319
stupidest possible thing

661
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,919
i'm going to loop through all of the

662
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,960
tile indexes

663
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,278
in in the pattern and i'm just going to

664
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,038
see

665
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,759
if we've already placed one there we'll

666
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,158
reject it right

667
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,519
and that'll be that um i noticed four

668
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,000
coders indentations

669
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:15,839
is still broken also so that's another

670
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:15,839
one i should probably put in there

671
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,519
um it's weird it actually seems to is it

672
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:30,240
actually lining it up with that

673
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:30,240
uh i doubt that's true

674
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,159
no so it's just it's just a it's a

675
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,079
hard-coded four tabs in

676
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,400
for some reason it it looks like it's

677
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:41,599
correctly picking the hanging indent

678
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:47,200
but it's adding the actual tab stop

679
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,199
after the hanging indent for no reason

680
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:57,839
so so that's one

681
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:07,038
so uh um

682
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:10,079
ryan may may check the stream we'll see

683
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:14,000
uh let me let me go ahead and also

684
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:18,000
load in apps4coder bindings

685
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,720
so if we look at j

686
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,079
it's behind my head right now but if we

687
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,200
look at

688
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:27,519
the jump command

689
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,519
um

690
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,360
you can see like f4 search for

691
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,880
definition project wide

692
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:40,399
right um

693
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,240
if we search for edit grid

694
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,640
you can see that it just gives us like

695
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,919
every function that's in editgrid.h

696
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,960
or dot cpp even though all we really

697
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,840
wanted to know

698
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,798
is we really just wanted to jump to edit

699
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,918
grid

700
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:59,359
right um

701
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:03,038
so let me type this in f4

702
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:07,839
search for definition

703
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,839
project wide

704
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,480
right

705
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:21,839
and we don't know we don't really know

706
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,839
what's going on with that um

707
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,320
it's it's super weird uh

708
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,199
but you know i don't know what it's

709
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,200
doing it's doing something

710
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,558
anyway uh so i'm just going to look

711
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,679
through these and see

712
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:41,759
if the tile match

713
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,720
uh if the if the position that you're

714
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,599
going to put

715
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,360
um i'll call this i for index if the

716
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:52,079
tile that you're going to put in here

717
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:54,959
matches um then off you go

718
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,079
otherwise it doesn't right so the result

719
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:03,120
is false

720
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:06,319
the results equals you know

721
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,359
whether or not these two are equal tells

722
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,398
us the answer

723
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,759
and then we return the results

724
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,359
i've been trying to get in the habit of

725
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,798
not putting parentheses around my

726
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,119
returns because

727
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:17,839
there's no reason for it but i always do

728
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,079
it

729
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,079
um

730
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,640
i don't know why i got in the habit uh

731
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,480
it's been since

732
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,200
like i think literally since i was like

733
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,720
started programming c but i'm not sure

734
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,360
why i would have done that i don't know

735
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,000
who would have

736
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:41,599
told me to do that or why um

737
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,798
i i don't know uh so that that's a good

738
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,639
uh that's a good question so anyway

739
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,679
uh let me just go ahead and change this

740
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,360
name because that's right pattern

741
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,720
already exists so let's just call this

742
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:54,000
tiles

743
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,839
and we will uh

744
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,919
try placing these so the very first step

745
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,720
not is not very interesting

746
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,720
all i'm going to do

747
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:09,599
at first is make something

748
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,599
that

749
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,798
i guess we'll just say like

750
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,959
at first all we're gonna do is make

751
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,640
something that doesn't ever place

752
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,120
overlapping tiles

753
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,759
which is very simple right so all we're

754
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,359
gonna do

755
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:31,679
is say look let's start by

756
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:34,719
placing one tile maybe as a random tile

757
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,759
so you know maybe something

758
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,038
like this where we say find a random

759
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,558
open tile

760
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,640
and at the moment that's doing this

761
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,200
but we could just place it randomly so

762
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,200
who knows

763
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,919
um so at the moment anyway if we take a

764
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,159
look at these two

765
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,000
uh we could randomize those we'll leave

766
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,679
it placed at the center for now so that

767
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,200
it's easy for us to look at what's going

768
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,840
on

769
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,840
but then what i would say is so tile at

770
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,839
uh

771
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:23,839
rel index is probably what we want

772
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:23,839
so our gen v3s

773
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,360
in this case

774
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,398
yeah in this case so i'm just going to

775
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,519
do this and say

776
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,158
tell at rel index is going to be the

777
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,359
first

778
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,360
one that we put in there

779
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,519
and i guess i'm not sure

780
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,439
if if we can't find a place to put the

781
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,398
pattern i guess we just don't put in the

782
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,440
pattern

783
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,719
right that just is a failure you know i

784
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,240
mean i don't know

785
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:05,839
uh but but i guess that's

786
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,839
i guess that's what we would want um

787
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,158
so i think that's what i would do and

788
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,278
then i'll just say like uh a pen tile or

789
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,200
something

790
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,839
and we'll just say look we're gonna give

791
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,840
the tiles

792
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,278
this new um index here so we're going to

793
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:26,798
put one tile in there

794
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,798
and then what we're going to do is we're

795
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:31,038
going to keep going until

796
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,558
we we can't anymore so in here what

797
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,558
we'll do is say

798
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:38,000
uh you know maybe we do this for now

799
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,839
and again like i don't really want to

800
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,038
keep doing this so we're not going to do

801
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,720
this forever but

802
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:49,519
uh we'll just do a random unilateral uh

803
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:53,278
where we just say please give us random

804
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,399
tiles that are open

805
00:31:53,278 --> 00:32:01,839
and if the thing we get back

806
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,839
uh happens to be

807
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:09,599
one of the ones we already placed

808
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,919
we just we just won't place it right

809
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,759
so if it's valid we keep going if it's

810
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,919
not i guess we break

811
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,079
so we say like look if that's okay and

812
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,278
then in here we just say

813
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:24,960
don't place the tile um

814
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:27,440
unless uh you know

815
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,079
if it's if it's already overlapping

816
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,320
right

817
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,519
now we have a problem here which is we

818
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,240
would loop forever

819
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,278
if we kept picking if there's only one

820
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,640
tile

821
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:43,839
um but it happens to be you know in

822
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,840
in the place of um

823
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,799
it happens to be somewhere that's open

824
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,480
but we can't place a tile because we

825
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:56,639
already placed the tile there

826
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,200
so we may want to do something more

827
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,200
like

828
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,000
you know let's do something more like

829
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,839
this

830
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,798
let's just try random placement and it's

831
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,038
probably true that this is a little bit

832
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,839
weak sauce but i just don't want to ever

833
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,519
have a case

834
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,918
where we can end up looping forever

835
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,519
trying to place things we can't place

836
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:30,480
so maybe what we do instead is say

837
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,440
look we're gonna go and we're gonna loop

838
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,960
for as long

839
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,240
as we can and we didn't

840
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,200
find the placement we needed so we just

841
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,880
give up

842
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,519
right at that point so then we go like

843
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,000
okay

844
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,038
you know find a random open tile if the

845
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,359
tile is valid

846
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:52,879
then we append it if it's not then we

847
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:56,240
don't and we can also say here like and

848
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,360
uh tile uh exists already or whatever

849
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,480
this function was uh tile

850
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:05,599
already exists so we can call that

851
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,639
to to verify that you know the it's

852
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:13,358
in this particular pattern um

853
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,358
doesn't already have that tile in it

854
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:21,838
right

855
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,960
all right so i'm not sure uh that this

856
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,159
is great

857
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,679
there may be some other issues with it

858
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,000
but we're just going to start with this

859
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,918
so i'm going to say that you know

860
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,918
the tiles um

861
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,960
are going to get tested here uh if we

862
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,519
get a tile

863
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,320
that actually works we're going to place

864
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,878
the

865
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,320
you know the tile in there uh and we're

866
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:53,598
gonna go from there

867
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,440
at the moment we're not gonna do

868
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,000
anything else interesting

869
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,880
we're just gonna leave it at that um we

870
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,400
don't have

871
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,720
that uh particular oh what is tile index

872
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,519
oh it's the number of the tile so in

873
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,639
this case

874
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,000
uh it's the tile count would be uh what

875
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,118
goes in there

876
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,119
and so we would do something like this

877
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,079
right and well you know when actually we

878
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,200
could even do

879
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,320
something more like this this is

880
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,358
probably a little bit

881
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,680
uh more sensible just so we can have

882
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:30,239
like a clean idea of when you added a

883
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:33,279
tile what index did it actually get

884
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:36,399
so that that's not so wishy-washy

885
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,519
right so if we say okay we take the tile

886
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,960
pattern in

887
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:44,079
we take in what the

888
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,240
gen v3 index is of it

889
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,359
then in here we just want to assert that

890
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,959
no one is trying to

891
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:54,559
pack in more tiles than than we allow

892
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,079
right um in fact we may even just do max

893
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,440
counts we may say look

894
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,000
uh you should not ever have uh

895
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,760
more than that as well so we'll say has

896
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,920
to be less than max count

897
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,920
has to be less than uh

898
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:16,079
the at i

899
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:19,039
and then we just do an insertion so

900
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,359
we'll literally just plop it in there

901
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:21,759
and

902
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:22,880
and that'll just you know allow us to to

903
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,960
quickly

904
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,838
sort of figure that out uh the result

905
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,838
index

906
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,560
uh is just whatever the place in the

907
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,760
array is

908
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,119
you know so that's that's easy for us to

909
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,839
provide

910
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,440
um and so now we're quote unquote

911
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,480
placing these in

912
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,760
uh and in theory uh

913
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,920
we should be able to have longer numbers

914
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,200
now uh maybe although the fact that now

915
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,720
i don't see anything means that that

916
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:56,399
failed spectacularly

917
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,759
um okay so let's go ahead and step

918
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,440
through this now and figure out

919
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,359
uh oh that's why

920
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,599
um so we want to check if it doesn't

921
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,960
exist not if it does

922
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,920
there we go um all right so now let's

923
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,480
take a look

924
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,440
uh and see what's up um it looks like

925
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,639
we're still only getting

926
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,240
one tile there so that seems broken

927
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,960
um oh and that's because this didn't get

928
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:24,239
fixed

929
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,760
random unilateral series

930
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:36,399
random unilateral series uh and so now

931
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:38,640
we should just get scattered tiles um

932
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,920
uh that are sort of placed throughout

933
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,000
the room

934
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,960
and and there's an example although i'm

935
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,719
not sure why

936
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,320
there's only one again still a little

937
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,679
bit weird uh

938
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,559
so that doesn't seem quite right uh

939
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,239
it should give us randomization between

940
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:57,599
one and four

941
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,959
when we set the max count up so when we

942
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,519
insert these

943
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,838
when we find a random open tile at a

944
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,960
random location

945
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:06,960
here we should

946
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,599
this may be a case where this doesn't

947
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,519
actually

948
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:19,838
work for all i know um so we can

949
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,838
double check that but um

950
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,119
this seems fine like though like this

951
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,039
should do it it looks like this will

952
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,320
search it just fine right so it uses the

953
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,559
the

954
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,559
uv to to kind of like um

955
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,560
figure out the distance and then it just

956
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,160
you know loops over the tiles and tries

957
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,078
to find them so i feel like we can

958
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,920
verify that that's actually returning

959
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,079
different stuff but i don't actually

960
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,079
know

961
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,440
as i spill water all over myself i like

962
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,880
this water bottle but it's it's very

963
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,280
wide-mouthed

964
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,039
and when you if you're not careful when

965
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,839
you take a big sip

966
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,039
you definitely get it um you definitely

967
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,400
get it all over you

968
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:18,800
uh so not not the best

969
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,960
not the best uh but you know what you

970
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,839
gonna do

971
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,838
okay uh so let me just see what's going

972
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:27,519
on here because this doesn't

973
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,279
this doesn't seem good it could be that

974
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,159
this is failing so the tile already

975
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,839
exists

976
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,440
could be failing um as well so let me

977
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,639
just let me just because we just

978
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,079
slapped that in there let me just make

979
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,519
sure that there's not an obvious problem

980
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,359
with that before we

981
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:44,159
go any further uh but so you take a look

982
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,920
here you say okay loop through

983
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,799
i'm gonna rename this to tiles to just

984
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,800
be consistent

985
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,760
again not a good day for programming

986
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,280
um just being sloppy today

987
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:10,480
it's supposed to be not or equal to

988
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:13,440
um so this should be

989
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,440
let's just do it this way

990
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,159
so if we find a tile then we say look

991
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,039
there's already a tile there

992
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,318
and we break that's what that probably

993
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,440
should have looked like

994
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,960
um but anyway so for some reason we're

995
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,720
only placing one tile

996
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,400
and we should force it to place multiple

997
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,639
tiles so we know that it's not

998
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,000
a random number generation thing but you

999
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,039
know the random number generator should

1000
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,358
not be able to generate

1001
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,599
one like an infinite number of times

1002
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,920
right so it seems pretty clear that it's

1003
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,760
not

1004
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,000
actually working it is picking one

1005
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,280
random tile but somehow it's never

1006
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,199
picking any more

1007
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,760
than one right so something's busted

1008
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:56,799
there

1009
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,359
uh and oh although that

1010
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,920
was a room with multiple tiles all right

1011
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:04,159
maybe i spoke too soon hold on a second

1012
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,838
so let's also do this where we just say

1013
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,039
let's set max count equal to four so we

1014
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,199
know there should always be four

1015
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:11,838
and let's just see what it does because

1016
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,838
i have no idea

1017
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,719
um

1018
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,480
so in this particular case it looks like

1019
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:23,118
it actually generated four tiles

1020
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,559
there's one down here which we can't the

1021
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,599
camera doesn't work when you hop out of

1022
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,199
the room like that we should probably

1023
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,119
fix the stairs

1024
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:34,559
um one of these days

1025
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,720
um but all right so no

1026
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,159
the random number generator was just

1027
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:42,799
constantly picking

1028
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:45,199
one somehow

1029
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,880
super confused right now i don't know

1030
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:50,559
how that's possible

1031
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:54,960
but that seems to be the case

1032
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:57,679
um so that's weird uh

1033
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,400
let's go ahead and and find out what is

1034
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,480
going on

1035
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,400
with that um

1036
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:17,519
is our random number generator just

1037
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:21,599
super crappy

1038
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,599
so this is like an xor shift

1039
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,838
right

1040
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,358
all right um

1041
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,759
let's just do this uh cause cause that

1042
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,440
that makes me a grumpy puppy

1043
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:55,040
um and i don't wanna be a grumpy puppy

1044
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,720
so here's a question let's suppose that

1045
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,480
right in the middle of this for no

1046
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,959
apparent reason

1047
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,920
uh i'm gonna go ahead and say let's

1048
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,119
switch to

1049
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,559
debug build like so

1050
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:12,318
um and i'm gonna ask for a histogram

1051
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:14,078
of these sizes and i want to know

1052
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,079
like what the random number generator

1053
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,519
piece of crap that's in there right now

1054
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,760
is doing

1055
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,679
uh because i don't like it so what we're

1056
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,960
going to do is we're just going to say

1057
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:27,679
4 hist

1058
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,159
test equals zero his test is less than

1059
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,358
some

1060
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:31,358
number his test

1061
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,199
uh and then what i'm going to do is say

1062
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,720
okay there's a

1063
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:39,679
histogram um the histogram is going to

1064
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:41,118
have

1065
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,879
four things in it because that's what we

1066
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,400
did before they're gonna be initialized

1067
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,280
to zero

1068
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,760
and i'm gonna do a random between zero

1069
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,760
and three

1070
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,838
uh

1071
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,759
which should give us exactly those

1072
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,960
things right

1073
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,680
so then we can say histogram um

1074
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,119
plus plus so so essentially what i'm

1075
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:07,519
doing is i'm just saying look i'm gonna

1076
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,920
make

1077
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,119
four buckets i'm gonna ask the random

1078
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,159
random

1079
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,880
number generator if it is

1080
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,799
in fact a random number generator to

1081
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,240
give me a random number between zero and

1082
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,800
three i'm going to count how

1083
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,399
lo how often it lands in each of the

1084
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,640
four buckets i'm gonna let

1085
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,920
run that a bunch of times and then we're

1086
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:31,039
just gonna look and see

1087
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,760
like what the heck uh it actually

1088
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,559
was and to make it a little easier on

1089
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,319
myself

1090
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:41,838
um i'll also just really quickly

1091
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,650
do a thing here where i

1092
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,708
loop over

1093
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,709
[Music]

1094
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:55,040
each of the

1095
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:59,838
each of the histogram values

1096
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,838
and just divide by the total so like uh

1097
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,119
so i'm going to grab this total count

1098
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,480
here

1099
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,680
i'm just going to say like do that many

1100
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,240
and the hiss percent for each one of

1101
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,919
these

1102
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:19,199
buckets i just want that to be equal

1103
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,440
to a percentage value

1104
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,719
that i can read so like a hundred

1105
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,159
percent

1106
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:31,279
times uh a floating point

1107
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:35,759
version of the thing

1108
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,560
uh in that bucket so the histogram

1109
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,319
at that bucket i just want to make it

1110
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,078
into a percentage

1111
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,358
and there's no reason for that other

1112
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,440
than than me

1113
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:49,838
just wanting to be able to um

1114
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,519
read it easily so i can just look at a

1115
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:52,880
percentage and say what percentage went

1116
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:54,880
into each bucket

1117
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,800
and i don't want these percentages to be

1118
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,358
like widely

1119
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,318
different right so i really don't want

1120
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:02,318
to see

1121
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,400
them all go into one bucket and none go

1122
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:04,719
into the other and that is just a way of

1123
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,559
me

1124
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,239
trying to convince myself that the

1125
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,480
random number generator works at all

1126
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:13,439
which at this point who knows if it does

1127
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,480
we didn't really write one on stream

1128
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,880
ever

1129
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,880
um so like you know

1130
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,318
all right i mean

1131
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,838
hard to argue with that right

1132
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,559
not to be taken for a con job here

1133
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:40,480
though

1134
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,119
let's just find out what happens in a

1135
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,960
small number of cases

1136
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,800
um just to make sure there aren't like

1137
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,800
weird like period problems

1138
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,640
where it just like gets into states

1139
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,640
where i'll often pick the same thing

1140
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:57,838
but

1141
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,000
i mean i guess what i would say about

1142
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,640
that

1143
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,599
is there's nothing particularly bad

1144
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,318
about that

1145
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,160
necessarily because you know it's random

1146
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:17,440
it's not supposed to be uniform

1147
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,879
distribution

1148
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,440
over a very small series of numbers

1149
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,039
so i don't know that i would consider

1150
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,358
that an issue

1151
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:27,358
right

1152
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,838
it's really hard to say what you want to

1153
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,838
have happen there

1154
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,239
so i'm going to do i'm going to do

1155
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,679
something here that's

1156
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:59,679
a little bit um funky uh

1157
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:01,358
but i just again i'm just not sure

1158
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:02,960
i wanna make sure i'm like comfortable

1159
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:06,400
with what's going on

1160
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,240
i'm not 100 sure i am uh so what i might

1161
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,160
do here is just say

1162
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:14,799
look why don't you give me um

1163
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:15,440
like a a random series here that i'm

1164
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,039
just gonna

1165
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,720
try doing some munging on

1166
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:25,199
um and yeah you know like

1167
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,199
i don't know

1168
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,039
maybe maybe that um

1169
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:49,679
i'm not sure um

1170
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,720
so i'm just gonna go ahead and dump some

1171
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,318
random uh

1172
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:57,519
pseudo assembly-ish code in here and see

1173
00:48:54,318 --> 00:49:00,880
what i think about when i actually

1174
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:05,679
um get some random numbers so

1175
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,680
let's do like um

1176
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:13,358
like a test series here uh

1177
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:15,119
and we'll just go ahead and and do a few

1178
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:19,039
rounds of aes on it

1179
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,039
and just see what happens right

1180
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,440
so um

1181
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,318
how do you set zero on an on an si 128

1182
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,838
or can you

1183
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:36,800
can you yeah i never know i never

1184
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,519
remember what the heck

1185
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,039
things are all right so let's suppose

1186
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:44,480
that we just like

1187
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:46,159
mix up a uh

1188
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,599
you know assembly register a bunch of

1189
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,239
times

1190
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,318
and then what we do is instead of doing

1191
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,598
random between like we were here so

1192
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,679
like here's the way we were picking the

1193
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,400
index before

1194
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:58,960
you know um and we're not gonna do that

1195
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,318
this time

1196
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,800
instead what we're gonna do is we're

1197
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:03,920
gonna mix this guy let's say we run

1198
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,359
three rounds

1199
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,680
of this how how expensive

1200
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:12,880
is the one that's in there right now so

1201
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:15,919
the one that's in there right now is

1202
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,880
a bunch of dependent shift xors

1203
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,880
so this is like

1204
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:28,960
six cycles so

1205
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,640
this would be significantly more

1206
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,838
expensive than cis cycles

1207
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:37,279
this would be eight cycles so

1208
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:39,679
so let's see what happens if we just do

1209
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,800
eight cycles

1210
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:46,078
with an asni mix let's just

1211
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,880
just do that um and then we'll

1212
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,880
try extracting one of these i don't know

1213
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,440
what the easiest way to extract these is

1214
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:58,400
at the moment

1215
00:50:53,440 --> 00:51:02,318
but uh is it like maybe

1216
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:05,039
uh maybe one of these

1217
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:06,639
the the intel intrinsic naming is always

1218
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:10,079
just

1219
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:13,679
i never have any the heck idea

1220
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,680
what the stuff is um

1221
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:22,559
all right hold on a second

1222
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:24,720
let's look it up as we always do

1223
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,839
because i never remember what the

1224
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:28,879
intrinsics are

1225
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:32,480
they always boggle my mind uh

1226
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,760
so convert uh

1227
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,079
like is it is it an epi

1228
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,079
um

1229
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,960
is it like a is it this

1230
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,760
okay so this is why i always get it

1231
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,800
wrong so

1232
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,319
so the thing you're converting from goes

1233
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,880
next to the cvt

1234
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:53,920
i gotta like get that into my head right

1235
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,000
so it's

1236
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,349
cvt si 128 underscore si32

1237
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,440
so

1238
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:01,440
[Music]

1239
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,760
so it's that and also it's converting

1240
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:07,679
the

1241
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,880
yeah i mean well it doesn't matter point

1242
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,000
being i

1243
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,280
i probably am never going to remember

1244
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,280
these let's just be honest i'm going to

1245
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,640
be looking them up in that thing forever

1246
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,280
all right so that would get us out and

1247
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,318
index

1248
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,040
and then we need to mod it for at the

1249
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:22,800
moment i mean

1250
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,239
for right now we can just end it with

1251
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,359
what we were doing so that's not that

1252
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,519
big a deal but

1253
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:30,400
so in here we know that we we just want

1254
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,440
a number between zero and four

1255
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,880
um well i'll just do this for now but

1256
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,720
you know we could just do an and right

1257
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,960
so that's pretty easy but point being

1258
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,598
i'm just doing a check to see what the

1259
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,519
histogram

1260
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,880
says on something that's a different way

1261
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:46,079
of generating

1262
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,119
uh these numbers so if i do that uh what

1263
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,960
do i get

1264
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,838
so that looks like a similar

1265
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,880
distribution to me

1266
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:57,920
on 100 i mean on a thousand

1267
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,480
right to the other one um i'm gonna also

1268
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,599
try slightly more mixing and just see

1269
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:07,119
what happens

1270
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:11,440
uh but that may be okay

1271
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:13,519
um trying to get it right at the end

1272
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,639
there there we go

1273
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:18,159
um so

1274
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:20,000
you know it doesn't it doesn't seem

1275
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:22,960
better right uh

1276
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,760
and we can try it on a 100 but again it

1277
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,119
doesn't seem

1278
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,559
like there's really anything

1279
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:32,800
particularly great about it

1280
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:35,599
so we're just gonna assume

1281
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,480
so it seems like the distribution is not

1282
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,720
particularly

1283
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:43,838
different um to me

1284
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:44,959
so so that all seems fine and if we went

1285
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:46,960
back up to the

1286
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,280
number before i assumed this would also

1287
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,880
give i i could have like

1288
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,640
not done a very good job with that part

1289
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,280
of it but no so it's so it's

1290
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:56,960
nice and distributed so i don't know

1291
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,480
seems okay

1292
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:04,079
um not

1293
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:08,240
not a real issue so i guess it's just

1294
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:12,400
it was picking one a lot of the time

1295
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:14,799
for some reason right

1296
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,800
um

1297
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,400
i don't have an explanation for that but

1298
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,199
i guess that's just the way the random

1299
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,200
cookie crumbled

1300
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,358
right i mean that's just that's just

1301
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:39,839
what happened

1302
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:39,838
so uh

1303
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:53,838
okay back to our story

1304
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:53,838
um

1305
00:54:54,079 --> 00:55:00,079
so now i want to try making some

1306
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,199
you know differences in how these things

1307
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,798
are picked so

1308
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,118
for example in here where we uh i said

1309
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:08,880
like

1310
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:11,838
let's make um a couple of these

1311
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,200
right so in here what i want to do is is

1312
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:16,159
maybe just do a switch

1313
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,159
on the the type

1314
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,000
so uh in the tile set um

1315
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,720
maybe instead of lying this would be

1316
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,720
like horizontal and vertical

1317
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,440
you know what i'm saying bro

1318
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,000
um

1319
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:52,239
i don't know why there's a semicolon

1320
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,239
there don't need that

1321
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,200
i will say c did not do a great job uh

1322
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,798
with the whole semicolon versus not

1323
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:02,159
semicolon thing

1324
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,400
you can understand when looking at the

1325
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,960
parser like why it is the way it is but

1326
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,358
it's

1327
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,559
it's just not it's not particularly

1328
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,679
great

1329
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:15,119
um anyway so if we take a look

1330
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:16,798
at uh each of these it should be pretty

1331
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:21,599
easy for us to

1332
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:24,639
determine how to extend the pattern

1333
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,690
uh in either case right

1334
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:27,920
so if if we're going to do

1335
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:32,798
[Music]

1336
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,798
in in any of these cases uh

1337
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:39,760
you know regardless of

1338
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,199
of which ones we do and there's some

1339
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,680
cool stuff we can do here but

1340
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:46,639
in any of these cases we can start with

1341
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:50,318
a random open tile

1342
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:59,759
on the first tile so

1343
00:56:50,318 --> 00:57:04,960
so this right um

1344
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:08,640
this happens uh any time

1345
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:12,559
we don't have any tiles yet if

1346
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:15,759
the tiles count is zero

1347
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,559
then we do that if the tiles count is

1348
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,200
non-zero

1349
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:25,440
we find a tile based on some rules about

1350
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:28,798
uh how we want this to work

1351
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:33,679
now i would also argue that

1352
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:35,920
like there's probably two of these

1353
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:35,919
uh

1354
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,000
as well so like a snake would never

1355
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:45,358
branch it would just be sequential tiles

1356
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,199
but that go in any direction

1357
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,440
a branching one is one where like you

1358
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:54,000
can go from anywhere to anywhere

1359
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:57,519
right um

1360
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,280
yeah i'm kind of cold

1361
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,798
can i be real with you right now i am

1362
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,559
i'm cold right now like

1363
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:08,159
i don't quite understand

1364
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:12,160
my it seems like my

1365
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:17,118
master plan for

1366
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:21,118
lighting the studio worked better than

1367
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:23,358
i had originally anticipated

1368
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,400
because one of my main goals for doing

1369
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:26,719
the lighting here

1370
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,079
was for it to take up no space and not

1371
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:30,239
generate any heat

1372
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,359
and it seems like i was able to do both

1373
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,639
of those things

1374
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:39,519
uh however the downside is that

1375
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:39,519
i am now cold so

1376
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:43,279
so that happened in the summer we'll be

1377
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:47,280
happy in the in the winter

1378
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:52,000
we are sad um

1379
00:58:47,280 --> 00:59:04,160
okay so moving on

1380
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:07,440
um moving on and on

1381
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:09,838
chris flatt so

1382
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,039
here's the thing about the webcam i

1383
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,039
asked people

1384
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,679
i was like should i mirror it or not and

1385
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,558
i try and i showed both on stream people

1386
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:19,598
didn't want

1387
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:22,880
it mirrored

1388
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,960
people didn't want it mirrored so

1389
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,720
so you're gonna have to like you guys

1390
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,480
need to have some arguments

1391
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:29,919
you know you need to have some arguments

1392
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,119
amongst yourselves

1393
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:36,318
and figure out uh

1394
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,920
you know because i was thinking mirrored

1395
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:40,000
as well i was like shouldn't i be facing

1396
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,760
the code but like people didn't want

1397
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
that

1398
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,319
and so i feel like there needs to be

1399
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,760
some kind of like internal

1400
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:51,679
war for dominance where um

1401
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,280
you know there's lots of casualties and

1402
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,000
everyone dies and it's a bloodbath but

1403
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,359
in the end

1404
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,239
we know whether it should be mirrored or

1405
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,239
not right

1406
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:01,838
um and so

1407
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,719
i don't know if it's local to me but i'm

1408
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,838
getting a lot of pixel flickering on the

1409
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:15,838
four coder capture

1410
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:15,838
um

1411
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:24,449
interesting so

1412
01:00:21,309 --> 01:00:24,449
[Music]

1413
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,760
so i don't know what that's from

1414
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:42,400
i i can pretty much

1415
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:46,880
say that at least looking at the raw

1416
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,838
capture there's no flickering on the raw

1417
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,480
capture

1418
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:55,759
now what goes out the wire i don't know

1419
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:59,440
um but like the raw capture there

1420
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:11,839
doesn't seem to be pixel flickers so

1421
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:11,838
it may be for the compression

1422
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:24,318
uh are the people who are noticing

1423
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:27,439
flickr are they

1424
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:29,199
on source stream quality or are they on

1425
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,400
some other stream quality would be my

1426
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:31,838
other question

1427
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,000
because it could also be twitch

1428
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:37,119
introducing it i don't know

1429
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,440
so so think about that you i'm gonna go

1430
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,640
back

1431
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:44,400
to programming this um but

1432
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:47,118
but you guys should figure it out

1433
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,240
on source it's very subtle so my guess

1434
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,280
would be that it's

1435
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:56,279
probably obs when it it's

1436
01:01:51,280 --> 01:02:00,960
it's lipstick x64 right libec64

1437
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:04,559
probably has problems with it maybe

1438
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:08,880
um you know what i'm saying to you

1439
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:12,720
uh libx 64 may be

1440
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,280
sucking um and and we may be able to fix

1441
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:16,399
that

1442
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:21,359
uh by changing the settings for

1443
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:26,079
libx 264.

1444
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:27,679
actually wait a second

1445
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,359
we can't fix this now because the stream

1446
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:35,838
is live but actually

1447
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:35,838
are is this still using the amd encoder

1448
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:46,239
no so it's it's set at the moment it is

1449
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:49,358
set to use

1450
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:52,798
x 264

1451
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:55,519
uh as the encoder so

1452
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:56,000
we aren't getting the weird amd bugs

1453
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:58,239
which

1454
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,760
which were causing really bad stuff not

1455
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:00,159
flicker they were causing like weird

1456
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,079
wave

1457
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:06,078
patterns and it was nuts um

1458
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,318
so those are fixed but we may be able to

1459
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:09,119
just change some of the settings on x264

1460
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:10,880
so

1461
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,720
when maybe when we're done we'll take a

1462
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,920
look at that nothing i can do about it

1463
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,959
now because you'd have to change

1464
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:20,240
you have to shut the stream down but

1465
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:25,280
uh but that could be i'm not sure

1466
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:25,279
um but but yeah

1467
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:34,558
all right um so moving on uh

1468
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:36,400
if we if we want to here

1469
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,240
the first time if we don't have any

1470
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,039
tiles then we need to pick

1471
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:43,598
one randomly if we do have tiles we want

1472
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:47,119
to pick one based on a rule

1473
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,119
where the rule uh

1474
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:59,838
allows us to like look around so so

1475
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:59,838
if i do find random open tile um

1476
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,798
it looks like this function is all i

1477
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:10,159
would really need

1478
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:14,480
so so i should be able to like move

1479
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:17,759
um around uh if we if we take a look at

1480
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:22,159
edit tile here for example

1481
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:23,200
um in there we should just be able to

1482
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:26,639
adjust this

1483
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:31,199
however we wish right

1484
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:34,318
so if i say um

1485
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:37,279
we come in here we would say

1486
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:38,798
like let's just do each of these in turn

1487
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,839
so if we were to do tile

1488
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:42,318
paddle pattern horizontal then what we

1489
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:45,838
would do

1490
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:48,000
is take like the largest tile

1491
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:49,358
pro i'm just guessing right but we would

1492
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,519
say like okay

1493
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:54,400
so we'd take the largest one and we'd

1494
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:57,838
say like tile at also this tile at

1495
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:01,680
um uh here

1496
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:01,679
should probably be like a

1497
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:08,960
grid and

1498
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:12,160
we probably would seed it

1499
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:14,400
with so like

1500
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:16,719
even we might even go so far as to do

1501
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,720
this

1502
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:24,318
you know i'm saying so we'd start with

1503
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,119
the largest tile

1504
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:28,880
by default at tile at and then we would

1505
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:32,000
do something

1506
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:35,200
um like

1507
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:38,639
is valid and traversable

1508
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:43,439
is open

1509
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:43,440
and it doesn't already exist right

1510
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:52,400
so right i mean maybe i don't know

1511
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,838
um so in here we would just say look

1512
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,160
we're gonna start with one

1513
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:58,318
and if it's horizontal we're just gonna

1514
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,358
try

1515
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:03,599
looking in a horizontal direction

1516
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:05,199
uh we can make this better but for now

1517
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,760
i'm literally just gonna say

1518
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,038
like okay so it's you know it's going

1519
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,160
that way

1520
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:15,520
um and so you know here's

1521
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:18,318
us searching in in various directions um

1522
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:19,759
for snake we would just randomly pick a

1523
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:22,960
direction

1524
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:27,200
and when we randomly pick a direction

1525
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:29,679
um so

1526
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,118
so the the problem that we're gonna have

1527
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:34,078
is we just want to

1528
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:35,119
only have one or the other so we would

1529
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,160
probably do

1530
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,160
something like

1531
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,400
i don't know

1532
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,798
i mean something like this

1533
01:06:55,199 --> 01:07:00,719
you know so it'd just be like all right

1534
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:05,599
you know the rel index

1535
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:05,598
plus equals some random direction

1536
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:15,838
uh i

1537
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,838
what the heck no

1538
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:23,039
so i i'm assuming we have like a

1539
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:26,960
random in array kind of thing

1540
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:30,559
no random unilateral

1541
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:32,880
um random between

1542
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:35,920
random next do we don't we don't just

1543
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,920
have a random count

1544
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:43,598
random choice that's it

1545
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:46,479
random choice

1546
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:48,079
that's all i really wanted um so we'll

1547
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,119
just do a random choice of direction

1548
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,119
there

1549
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,480
um and the same would be true in the

1550
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,280
branching case

1551
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,000
um in fact i'll pop that out so that

1552
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,798
anyone can use

1553
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
it and the only difference here would be

1554
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:02,798
i would say that like

1555
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,798
the tile that we start from would change

1556
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:07,679
so in the branching case

1557
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:07,679
i will pick

1558
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:16,399
um first i i do still want this

1559
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:19,679
i will pick a random choice of tile

1560
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:24,879
as well so random choice

1561
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:28,798
series tile count right so like that

1562
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:32,210
so yeah whatevs

1563
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:36,729
um for scatter i don't know

1564
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:36,729
[Music]

1565
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:39,838
um

1566
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,279
is there no plus equals

1567
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:53,838
tile pattern

1568
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,640
i agree with you uh what did we call

1569
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,838
this

1570
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:07,119
oh we didn't so let's just say there's a

1571
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:11,679
type

1572
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:11,679
like so and

1573
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,358
what is the problem

1574
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:23,919
missing i agree

1575
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,920
is that better

1576
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:31,198
all right so our gen v3

1577
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:35,839
looks like it doesn't have an operator

1578
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:35,838
plus equals

1579
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:52,718
i not oh so it's just a v3s

1580
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:54,158
oh why did we call it i guess we just

1581
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,719
like

1582
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:57,920
didn't remove that type i was wondering

1583
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:03,840
about that

1584
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:03,840
um all right so our v3s

1585
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,439
we can't search for operator either yeah

1586
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,279
oh well

1587
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,279
yep um

1588
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:19,198
that's too bad anyway we don't have an

1589
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,080
operator plus equals so let's just put

1590
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:24,319
one in

1591
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:28,158
um and you know that seems fine

1592
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:30,559
so operator plus v3s

1593
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:31,759
uh you know there just needs to be a

1594
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,520
plus equals

1595
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:38,800
so i'm just gonna say like okay

1596
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,800
here's the plus equals

1597
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:45,599
um i guess

1598
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:45,599
the way you write these and see

1599
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:49,119
would be this

1600
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:56,719
right um so

1601
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:59,519
we would add these two together and

1602
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:02,239
it should call this right uh operator

1603
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:05,360
plus is ambiguous

1604
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:05,359
how is it ambiguous

1605
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,840
what is ambiguous about that

1606
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:26,559
oh just forgot the equals

1607
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,079
um so anyway that should allow us to do

1608
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,560
plus equals which we want to be able to

1609
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:31,600
do

1610
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,640
no reason not to um and now we've got

1611
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,840
different patterns

1612
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,480
um the pattern is not being selected

1613
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,480
right now

1614
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:39,759
so it should always be horizontal which

1615
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,079
in this case it was

1616
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,719
so we should just see like lines

1617
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:47,760
randomly in the world

1618
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:49,520
um of these patterns uh where it just

1619
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,880
randomly picks a number and they're as

1620
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,840
long as the number is

1621
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,840
really no one hopped on that yet all

1622
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,119
right uh so if i go ahead and

1623
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,679
head out through the world i should just

1624
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:03,279
see only lines and that is what i see

1625
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:07,679
um and and everyone's happy

1626
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:11,198
um and and no one cares

1627
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:13,679
so now let's try some other stuff uh oh

1628
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:14,799
we didn't implement scatter case so in

1629
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,679
scatter case

1630
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,320
i don't think you know no one cares what

1631
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:22,719
that does

1632
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:27,679
but uh basically that would just be

1633
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:27,679
you know um

1634
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,840
i don't know what the range would be

1635
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,198
so if it's negative five and the random

1636
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:51,840
choice would give you up to ten so

1637
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:51,839
oh i've ran in between

1638
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:59,839
so let's just say you know it's

1639
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,199
there's some kind of radius i don't even

1640
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,199
know i don't care

1641
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:05,279
at the moment but we'll just do

1642
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:08,719
something where we randomly pick

1643
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:11,359
a scattering amount um

1644
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:11,920
and so it can scatter and then from

1645
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:15,198
there

1646
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:18,560
we can now try some of these out so

1647
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:20,559
let me like um hardcode this for now

1648
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,280
let's say i want eight things and i want

1649
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,280
them in

1650
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:32,399
in like the vertical pattern

1651
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:35,279
uh it might be hard to

1652
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:37,359
pick that though a lot of them won't

1653
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:38,639
work we should probably do some retries

1654
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:40,639
because you wouldn't be able to fit

1655
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,440
eight vertically so yeah that won't work

1656
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,760
um so we can we can put in some lower

1657
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:46,000
number

1658
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,600
we should do some retries uh so so

1659
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,479
here's another thing let's do that let's

1660
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,480
do retries too

1661
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:05,198
let's let's do a double retry um

1662
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:06,799
pattern here uh this is just gonna be

1663
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:11,039
we're just sucking down the cpu

1664
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:14,000
like it's nobody's business um

1665
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:14,719
so let's just move this out so what we

1666
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,640
can do

1667
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,640
is when we create this tile pattern

1668
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,039
right we can just create it without ever

1669
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:24,079
actually creating the tiles

1670
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:25,519
um so then we can come out out here uh

1671
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,279
that was very canadian we can come out

1672
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:32,560
out here buddy

1673
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:32,559
and uh we can

1674
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:39,440
create the actual tiles after the fact

1675
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:39,439
right

1676
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:48,960
and if i look at the get tile function

1677
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:51,360
um it looks

1678
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,359
like

1679
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:56,399
it looks like i can just pipe that

1680
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:59,520
directly in so i

1681
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:03,599
think and let's see if this is true

1682
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:07,679
i think i can just do like look grid

1683
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:10,960
um with with whatever the

1684
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:15,119
the tiles at i like

1685
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:19,520
things are i should be able to just

1686
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:22,960
do this you know what i'm saying

1687
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,480
uh so i i think that would work

1688
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,760
oh i can't even pass the gen v3 okay

1689
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:27,439
it's even easier than that it's

1690
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,600
literally just that

1691
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,119
um so i just do like okay you know get

1692
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,800
that tile out and create

1693
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:34,319
things so now it should be able to

1694
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,320
create stuff

1695
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:37,759
after it's already got the whole pattern

1696
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:42,079
that it wanted to place

1697
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:45,199
you know what i mean um and off it goes

1698
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:48,079
i gotta actually hop on it there we go

1699
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:49,119
get out of here we gotta add combat

1700
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:51,920
because

1701
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:54,960
that skeleton is getting annoying and i

1702
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,960
want to be able to punch it

1703
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:59,599
um oh thank you mr skeleton

1704
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:07,198
i don't know how we're going to fix the

1705
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,719
fact that if a snake winds itself into a

1706
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:11,359
corner it's unable to hop

1707
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,399
out right because the rule for snakes is

1708
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:14,639
the body has to hop

1709
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:16,158
in the same pattern as the head so if

1710
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,079
the head winds itself into a corner it

1711
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:20,000
literally can't get out which

1712
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:21,198
i don't know what we should do about

1713
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,198
that maybe the

1714
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:29,119
allow the head to hop over

1715
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:31,279
itself you got me

1716
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:33,359
like i said i ain't no game designer bro

1717
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:34,960
that's a game design question

1718
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:36,799
and i don't know this will get fixed by

1719
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:39,279
me just be able to punch this dude but

1720
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,880
you know i don't know i don't know what

1721
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:42,479
you should what what's the game design

1722
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,520
answer there

1723
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:47,119
so uh if we do it this way uh now we can

1724
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,480
just do the tile pens

1725
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:51,039
pretty pretty trivially and that's all

1726
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:53,359
fine

1727
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,560
so let's try some of the other ones now

1728
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:59,759
uh

1729
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:59,760
tile pattern snake

1730
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,119
and this should just create a contiguous

1731
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,719
line but the line

1732
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:08,880
shouldn't uh or won't necessarily go

1733
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,239
in any particular direction right so it

1734
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,520
can create

1735
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:16,799
uh any any connected region

1736
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:20,080
that doesn't ever split so

1737
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,719
so you know so far so good um those are

1738
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:23,149
all

1739
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,399
what you would expect um

1740
01:17:23,149 --> 01:17:28,719
[Music]

1741
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:32,319
and come on get out of my way

1742
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:35,920
uh yep and let me let me

1743
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:39,039
make that be a longer pattern so that we

1744
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,039
can just kind of verify

1745
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:45,600
um what's going on here

1746
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,840
uh oh that's cool it even goes

1747
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,440
downstairs we gotta fix that camera so

1748
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,239
that it's going outside the room is a

1749
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:53,678
problem

1750
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:53,678
we just need one that doesn't create

1751
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,520
stairs

1752
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:02,319
so i i don't actually know what what is

1753
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,480
the answer

1754
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:05,920
to that why why is that happening you

1755
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:09,839
know what

1756
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:11,119
we've pretty much this is basically done

1757
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,960
let me test it and then we're gonna go

1758
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,559
fix the stupid stairs like i don't even

1759
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,719
know why the stairs are doing that like

1760
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,159
i have no idea why we're creating stairs

1761
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,920
down to nowhere

1762
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:21,839
um so somebody should probably do

1763
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,679
something about that

1764
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,400
and that somebody is gonna have to be me

1765
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:28,800
because i'm the only one here um

1766
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:30,238
but it looks like the snake one is

1767
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:34,640
working fine

1768
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:37,198
um so that's so that's fine

1769
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,199
and uh

1770
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,880
and no one cares so uh let's try

1771
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:44,880
branching

1772
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,800
um well you know what let's let's just

1773
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,400
make this pattern larger so

1774
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,079
let's let's make a really large pattern

1775
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:51,679
and verify that the snake still looks

1776
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:53,600
snakey

1777
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,359
um and then we'll see if the branching

1778
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,640
looks branchy

1779
01:18:55,359 --> 01:19:01,279
right oh

1780
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,320
um what's the maximum count of tile

1781
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:09,840
patterns

1782
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:09,840
i don't even know

1783
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:28,319
um so it's like only 12

1784
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,840
uh which is not great like we probably

1785
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:33,359
want more than that

1786
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:36,480
um so i'm gonna say like

1787
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:37,359
buckle up friends brains are big you

1788
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:40,319
know

1789
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,039
um they are large and you're gonna have

1790
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:45,519
to

1791
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:48,640
like get with the program

1792
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:51,840
um so

1793
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:53,440
uh again hard to say like but it

1794
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,279
you know that's definitely a legal

1795
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:56,158
pattern we don't know for sure that it

1796
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,439
didn't branch

1797
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:02,238
but we we know that that's valid

1798
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:02,799
what i will say is i don't love the look

1799
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:05,759
of it

1800
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,039
so i might say that snake should maybe

1801
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,159
check to make sure

1802
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:13,519
that in general it doesn't place it

1803
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:17,359
next to more than one so like

1804
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:21,040
if i look at how the snake

1805
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:25,119
thing worked

1806
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:33,840
um so

1807
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:33,840
so this code

1808
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,140
[Music]

1809
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,840
um

1810
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:04,000
ugh

1811
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,920
i think what i would want to do is say

1812
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,920
when we place a tile

1813
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,800
if you're going to if you were about to

1814
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,800
place a tile

1815
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,560
that would be next to a tile other than

1816
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:19,760
the previous tile

1817
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,360
don't place the tile i think that's more

1818
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,800
what i would consider

1819
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:29,839
a snake pattern

1820
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,840
you know um

1821
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,079
i don't i don't know like i just think

1822
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:42,800
that

1823
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:46,158
might be a thing um

1824
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:51,279
and and you could see why you would

1825
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:51,279
want that in either case so like

1826
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,840
i'm just gonna i'm just literally making

1827
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,279
this up

1828
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:05,600
but let's suppose in here

1829
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:05,599
there's a thing that's like

1830
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:14,080
um max neighbor

1831
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:16,880
count or something uh

1832
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:18,800
and so in here we'd say like the max

1833
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,920
neighbor count

1834
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:24,000
um is like four which is the highest it

1835
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:27,199
could possibly be

1836
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,238
but then other people

1837
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:32,479
would say um

1838
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:34,238
oh oh and we could do zeros installation

1839
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:38,000
here i could instead say

1840
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:41,039
required empty

1841
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,079
neighbor account right

1842
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:45,359
so we could say like look normally it

1843
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:48,719
doesn't require their

1844
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:51,839
empty neighbors it doesn't matter

1845
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:52,399
um but in here we would just say like oh

1846
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,719
okay

1847
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:56,079
if we change it to the snake tile

1848
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:58,319
pattern

1849
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:59,679
then we may want to set the required

1850
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:02,799
empty neighbor count to

1851
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:05,039
three meaning every time we place one

1852
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,239
you're not allowed to place it somewhere

1853
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:08,000
that has

1854
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:11,599
more than just one neighbor which is

1855
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:14,399
whichever the last one was

1856
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:16,480
uh that you placed and so then in here

1857
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,079
we would count the neighbors so we'd do

1858
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:21,599
something like this

1859
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:24,079
um in fact mr uh direction

1860
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,679
here uh would actually help us out

1861
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:29,039
tremendously

1862
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:32,560
so we could do something uh like this

1863
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:34,158
where we said you know test for empty

1864
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:37,679
neighbors here

1865
01:23:34,158 --> 01:23:39,839
so we have like empty neighbor count

1866
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,279
uh equals zero we'll count the empty

1867
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,840
neighbors and then we'll say

1868
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:45,519
if the empty neighbor count is less than

1869
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,159
the required

1870
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:51,360
empty neighbor count i'm sorry uh

1871
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:51,359
greater than or equal to

1872
01:23:52,560 --> 01:24:00,000
um then we go ahead and imp append

1873
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,000
uh the tile um

1874
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:07,679
and

1875
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:10,079
and off we go right

1876
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,840
so so that seems good and what we'll do

1877
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:12,880
here is we'll just say like dur index

1878
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:16,000
equals zero during

1879
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:19,440
less than array count der plus plus

1880
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,238
der index um and then what we can say

1881
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:23,279
is that thing we were doing before where

1882
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:27,279
we say

1883
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:30,880
uh uh tile already exists

1884
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:33,119
so we'll just do tile already exists

1885
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,119
uh

1886
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,400
for whatever that direction is so we'll

1887
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:45,760
just say

1888
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:47,359
if a tile already exists um well

1889
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,800
more specifically i guess i'll say if a

1890
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:51,599
tile doesn't already exist then the

1891
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:55,360
neighbor count goes up

1892
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:59,120
right all right

1893
01:24:55,359 --> 01:25:02,479
um so maybe that works maybe it doesn't

1894
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:04,719
who's to say um that looks great

1895
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:05,519
and so now that produces patterns that

1896
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,719
are more like

1897
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:12,000
game e to me right it's it's not

1898
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:15,359
placing patterns in locations that

1899
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,119
oh i i don't know every time we hop

1900
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:19,759
below the floor level the camera

1901
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:21,679
doesn't know where to go you notice that

1902
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,639
it's this is what's above us

1903
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:26,880
right the camera like that you know it's

1904
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,359
if we had a if we're at the point we're

1905
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,880
actually

1906
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:32,719
in ship mode we would start to write

1907
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,719
these down but pretty far from there

1908
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,440
um all right so that is a much better

1909
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,440
pattern place or

1910
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:41,039
in my opinion and now you can really see

1911
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:44,238
the snake-like nature

1912
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:47,039
of these particular uh patterns

1913
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:47,678
um and that's great uh and everyone

1914
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:49,920
loves it

1915
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:52,158
and the game sold millions of copies on

1916
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,600
the epic steam store

1917
01:25:52,158 --> 01:26:00,158
so now if we just you know hop around

1918
01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:03,280
and such uh you know it's good

1919
01:26:00,158 --> 01:26:06,839
um that all looks good so let's try

1920
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:11,279
some other things now let's try

1921
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:13,360
um branching

1922
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,279
and branching can still keep that

1923
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:18,479
constraint but we may also want to

1924
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:18,479
reduce that constraint

1925
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,279
depending on how we want things to go

1926
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,320
but now you can see we're creating some

1927
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:27,198
nice paths

1928
01:26:24,319 --> 01:26:28,319
that like have branches in them which is

1929
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:30,319
another thing we want

1930
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:31,599
from a gameplay perspective and we may

1931
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:33,599
want to improve

1932
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,159
the like quality of those choices but

1933
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,639
you know gives a

1934
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:39,359
who cares is what i meant to say that's

1935
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,520
like the

1936
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:44,399
fourth swear on handmade hero we're

1937
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,400
going so well

1938
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:51,759
i should have just marked the stream as

1939
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:56,000
adult at the beginning

1940
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:56,000
we need us so we need a thing um

1941
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:02,559
on the episode guide so we can actually

1942
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:04,880
get a definitive

1943
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,080
number of times that there was a cuss

1944
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:09,279
word it's been

1945
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:14,000
very few uh but

1946
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:16,880
but i i do not know how many um

1947
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,719
but it's been very few i i just don't

1948
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,039
actually know

1949
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:21,039
um

1950
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:25,119
is it four

1951
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:32,638
i feel like miblo probably knows

1952
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:34,560
um they're because they're probably

1953
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:36,960
marked but

1954
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,960
i don't know

1955
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:43,439
um all right so anyway uh if we want to

1956
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,199
now check the scatter pattern

1957
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:46,719
which is the only other one that we

1958
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:48,399
haven't actually tested although i

1959
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,760
didn't test the horizontal and vertical

1960
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:51,039
with the required empty neighbor count

1961
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,159
but i don't see why those would be

1962
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:54,479
affected so we're probably

1963
01:27:52,158 --> 01:27:56,319
we don't really need to do much there um

1964
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:59,599
so let's try the scatter pattern

1965
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:59,599
here's the scatter pattern

1966
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:04,560
that looks pretty good um and the other

1967
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:06,319
cool thing about that is now that we

1968
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,679
have this we could also require the

1969
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:12,479
empty neighbor count to be four

1970
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:15,840
and that would put uh only disconnected

1971
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:16,479
um pieces right so that that's pretty

1972
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,119
cool too

1973
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:21,678
so so even with just that small bit of

1974
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:24,079
code we've got a lot of options now

1975
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:24,960
so i'm happy with that i think that's

1976
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:27,760
great

1977
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,800
um that gives me uh everything i need i

1978
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,039
think

1979
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,039
um

1980
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:43,840
does anyone know no one knows

1981
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:58,399
anyway uh so now

1982
01:28:56,079 --> 01:28:59,198
i think let's fix the uh why are there

1983
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:02,399
stairs

1984
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:03,519
down to nowhere problem um

1985
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:05,039
because that should be pretty

1986
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,719
straightforward we should fix that we

1987
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:10,960
can also fix the pressure plates

1988
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:15,198
but we're in good shape here uh

1989
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:19,198
and i also don't know

1990
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:25,839
um so so do we have

1991
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:25,839
lights that light up

1992
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:31,279
i i don't i don't know that we do

1993
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:33,359
so so the the other thing that's a

1994
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:36,639
little annoying

1995
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:39,198
is like

1996
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:40,480
when i generate one of these tiles it

1997
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:43,439
doesn't actually

1998
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:45,039
put so so if you look at what happens

1999
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:46,079
here right if there's a thing that just

2000
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:48,880
changes the color

2001
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:50,000
of the tile but i feel like we also want

2002
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:53,520
a thing that's like

2003
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,560
pieces one

2004
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,840
um or just you add a piece like i feel

2005
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:01,760
like we want to add

2006
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:05,039
a light you know so so i

2007
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,000
like this thing here where we we take

2008
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:09,279
the entity

2009
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,560
i i feel like it wants to add um

2010
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:16,960
a light that's placed over

2011
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,960
these patterns um

2012
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:21,840
and so

2013
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:31,840
like i don't know

2014
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:31,840
how this should work um

2015
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,560
because we haven't really thought this

2016
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,560
through but

2017
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:48,319
so so i'm not sure uh about that

2018
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:51,600
but argument three yep

2019
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:53,679
too used to using v3s is here um because

2020
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,320
i kind of wanted lights on top of the

2021
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:58,000
tiles

2022
01:30:54,319 --> 01:31:01,840
as well um and

2023
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:04,479
so i'm not sure uh

2024
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,119
if i draw lights i just want to see if i

2025
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:08,879
can get

2026
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:10,880
lights added on top of each of

2027
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,480
the tiles in some way that we can

2028
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,920
readily identify

2029
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:17,919
so if i go into the entity code uh

2030
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,520
where it draws that there's like a thing

2031
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,920
that'll draw like lights

2032
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,040
to the extent that there are any lights

2033
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:25,440
um

2034
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:27,519
and so i was wondering if i could just

2035
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:28,000
just put that in there so so like this

2036
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,760
code

2037
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:34,158
you know um if i turn that on

2038
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,280
we should see like lights and there they

2039
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:36,638
are right so

2040
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:38,639
unfortunately they're like embedded in

2041
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:40,480
the thing which is kind of dumb so i

2042
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:41,920
probably needed to fix that so

2043
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:45,839
you know let's suppose that it was more

2044
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,840
like that um

2045
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:51,520
and now if we run

2046
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,560
this i'm just wondering if we can get

2047
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:56,880
lights

2048
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,880
above our things yeah

2049
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:02,560
so that works a little bit better and so

2050
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:04,158
if if those lights are there

2051
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,560
then what i was wondering is like could

2052
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:11,119
the lights kind of follow

2053
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:13,360
the pattern like of being lit or not

2054
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:14,399
meaning that in here if i have these

2055
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:18,399
lights and i just

2056
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:18,399
say well uh

2057
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:31,360
maybe there's no immission color

2058
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:35,600
for the thing uh at first

2059
01:32:31,359 --> 01:32:35,599
right and and this thing

2060
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,079
again i really don't know because this

2061
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:42,399
isn't my

2062
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:43,279
area of expertise right but like i'm

2063
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:47,359
just thinking like

2064
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:49,359
if the lights um lit up

2065
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:50,639
when you stepped on them you know what

2066
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:54,960
i'm saying uh

2067
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:58,159
so so in here when we have the switches

2068
01:32:54,960 --> 01:33:02,719
there's like a thing where

2069
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:02,719
it sets the color so so that's

2070
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:06,079
that's like how the color gets set you

2071
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:09,840
could imagine

2072
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:09,840
like this happening

2073
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:21,519
so it's color emissions so basically

2074
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:21,519
it's like you know

2075
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:40,719
if if it i don't know

2076
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:44,400
um so like in this case right

2077
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:46,639
we're just hopping around and

2078
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:48,559
and the lighting is just you know

2079
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:51,199
whatever

2080
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,800
and then i hop on one of those well that

2081
01:33:51,198 --> 01:34:05,359
didn't look like it actually turned on

2082
01:33:52,800 --> 01:34:09,679
that light at all

2083
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:10,479
also the fact that i'm not seeing any

2084
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:13,600
lights right now

2085
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:19,839
is a little disquieting where have all

2086
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:19,840
the lights gone

2087
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,960
that's super creepy

2088
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:34,880
did you notice that

2089
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,800
we have to take a look at what's going

2090
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:40,079
on there because i don't really know

2091
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,079
um but it's pretty weird

2092
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:51,439
so like this room has lights in it

2093
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:53,440
um and the other room doesn't

2094
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:55,919
like the lighting it just didn't place

2095
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:59,198
any lights in that room

2096
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:00,960
i guess so that's pretty creepy

2097
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:02,638
this room has lights but it doesn't look

2098
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:06,319
like there are any lights

2099
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:09,520
in in our actual where we just

2100
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:11,920
said that i wanted to place them so

2101
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,920
that's

2102
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:17,920
weird as well um

2103
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,880
i don't have an explanation for that so

2104
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,280
in here we're

2105
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,279
doing an ad piece light call and you can

2106
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:31,198
see it adding the piece

2107
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:31,198
that's occurring right i mean

2108
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:43,839
uh in entity gen

2109
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:53,039
i mean that that seems all right let me

2110
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:55,359
just

2111
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:56,319
double check that that i'm doing what i

2112
01:35:55,359 --> 01:35:59,279
think i'm doing

2113
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,079
so there's the entity there's the radius

2114
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:03,519
the offset

2115
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:05,359
the emission and the color the color and

2116
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:09,440
the emission just get

2117
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:12,719
bundled together right um

2118
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:16,079
which is not particularly interesting

2119
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:18,639
the the

2120
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:20,559
ad piece call that's getting called here

2121
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,279
it's just an asset tag which we don't

2122
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,800
care about

2123
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:27,039
at all um so we're just

2124
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,840
spamming the radius three times placing

2125
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:30,238
an offset

2126
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,960
and the color that should just work

2127
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:38,238
right so

2128
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:42,880
i don't

2129
01:36:38,238 --> 01:36:42,879
oh wait but

2130
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:48,719
no that i mean that should just work

2131
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:51,599
right so i'm not sure

2132
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:52,639
what's the problem why are we not

2133
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:56,719
getting

2134
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:59,840
why are we not able to see this

2135
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:03,439
um i i don't quite

2136
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:04,480
follow because i feel like i should be

2137
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:06,719
able to see that

2138
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:07,599
and something's off right the fact that

2139
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:09,118
i can't that

2140
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,280
i i don't think there's anything weird

2141
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:14,000
going on and and in here

2142
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:15,198
what was weird even weirder is when i

2143
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,920
had this set

2144
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:17,919
to something

2145
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:24,480
um

2146
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:27,039
it actually worked so so when i did an

2147
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:30,238
ad piece light from before

2148
01:37:27,039 --> 01:37:30,880
um it actually worked meaning we saw

2149
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:33,039
them so

2150
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,480
it's really strange that i can't change

2151
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:37,439
it after the fact

2152
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:38,559
or something uh i don't know what's

2153
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:42,638
going on there

2154
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:49,840
right you see all of the things and then

2155
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:49,840
somehow like like this wasn't changing

2156
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:02,000
so why is that not the only place that

2157
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,920
that

2158
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
would need to change is there something

2159
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:08,319
more to it than that

2160
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,319
um

2161
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:17,839
it's still like kind of impossible to

2162
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,840
use this to find anything

2163
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:24,800
i'm hoping we can get this fixed because

2164
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,840
this takes forever

2165
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:31,039
it's take would be faster for me to just

2166
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:36,560
go to the file myself right um

2167
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:38,210
okay so in here uh for those pieces

2168
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,600
is there some other thing

2169
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:45,840
[Music]

2170
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:45,840
that like

2171
01:38:46,079 --> 01:39:00,559
what what else would need to happen

2172
01:38:58,158 --> 01:39:02,799
is this just a case of like passing this

2173
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:07,920
down

2174
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:07,920
oh so you know here's a question for you

2175
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,719
is this just a case of like the

2176
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:16,559
brightness here

2177
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:18,239
is too bright uh and like you can't

2178
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,320
actually set numbers up that high i

2179
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:22,959
thought you could

2180
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:24,158
but i don't know now that i think about

2181
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,079
it i don't know

2182
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:27,279
how we have set up the lighting stuff

2183
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:30,319
yet in that way

2184
01:39:27,279 --> 01:39:32,479
right so let's take a quick pause and

2185
01:39:30,319 --> 01:39:35,519
see if maybe that's

2186
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:35,519
actually what's happening there

2187
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,840
because that could be all it is

2188
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:53,920
yeah okay so it's just a case of like

2189
01:39:51,039 --> 01:39:54,238
that being too hot now so i don't know

2190
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:56,639
is

2191
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:57,839
is one the brightest thing like what's

2192
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:00,000
the brightest thing

2193
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,039
when we're actually adding lights like

2194
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,920
here

2195
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:05,118
what we're passing like 10 and crap

2196
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,399
right

2197
01:40:05,118 --> 01:40:11,198
so i don't understand why that

2198
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,000
you know wouldn't work that should make

2199
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:15,678
a light

2200
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:19,279
bright green light

2201
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:24,239
at that location yeah i mean

2202
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:24,238
am i wrong about that um

2203
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:32,559
that'd be my guess um

2204
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,118
but it it definitely doesn't do that

2205
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,440
right

2206
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:36,880
like it's like that code never got

2207
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:39,198
called

2208
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,199
um

2209
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:44,319
so i'm i'm clearly wrong

2210
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:49,759
about that i i'm like just not

2211
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:52,960
understanding something about the way

2212
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:52,960
these lights are working

2213
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:07,439
right because they don't seem to be

2214
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:07,439
doing anything

2215
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:13,039
like you don't see even any bounce on

2216
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:15,359
the wall

2217
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:15,359
there

2218
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:22,239
and so if i were to add that as a

2219
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:23,678
standard piece of lighting

2220
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:24,799
and this could just be bugs in our

2221
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:27,118
lighting code right because the lighting

2222
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:30,320
code's kind of crappy

2223
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:31,839
um but but something's up and so

2224
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:33,439
if we take a look at what happens with

2225
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:38,480
the tiles there

2226
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:41,118
um if i was to do add piece light

2227
01:41:38,479 --> 01:41:44,799
oh are there maybe multiple pieces

2228
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:44,799
already in the thing somehow

2229
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:48,639
could that be why

2230
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,679
like like is it possible that this is

2231
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,719
actually

2232
01:41:55,679 --> 01:42:01,840
uh uh not

2233
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:01,840
piece zero

2234
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:11,679
we should check that out that could be

2235
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:14,719
it could be that this is the wrong one

2236
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:16,239
right so like you know

2237
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:18,639
if it turned out there was actually

2238
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:21,839
secretly another piece on there

2239
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:24,960
and we had to set piece two or something

2240
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:29,440
then that might make more sense

2241
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:30,960
i'm not optimistic about that right

2242
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:32,638
um yeah that doesn't seem to have

2243
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:36,239
changed anything

2244
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:39,359
but so i don't know

2245
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:42,319
um that's a really confusing

2246
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:43,920
but let's step in in the debugger and

2247
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:45,439
just see what the heck is going on

2248
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:49,039
because i have no

2249
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:52,638
idea right um

2250
01:42:49,039 --> 01:42:55,198
none whatsoever so i'm gonna go ahead

2251
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:56,000
and build this in debug mode and i'm

2252
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:59,039
gonna look to

2253
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,198
see like if there's some

2254
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:02,719
magical nonsense happening there the

2255
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:04,479
first i'm gonna do

2256
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:05,760
is just look at this code to see what it

2257
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:08,399
actually adds

2258
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:10,719
just so i make sure that that's not

2259
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:14,079
something strange

2260
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:17,920
so i'm gonna inside entitygen

2261
01:43:14,079 --> 01:43:21,359
um i'm gonna just stop right here

2262
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:24,480
and just see what's going on so if we

2263
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:27,198
take a look at the tile um

2264
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:28,638
and i look at the pieces i just want to

2265
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:31,599
know how many pieces there are

2266
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:31,600
and what the count is

2267
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:35,759
okay so so it does look like that's the

2268
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:40,719
case so it

2269
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,719
it's there are three pieces

2270
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:53,839
why are there three pieces who is adding

2271
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,840
three pieces to this thing

2272
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:07,840
um

2273
01:44:27,279 --> 01:44:31,679
so i have no idea why that would be

2274
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:35,039
happening

2275
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:36,480
why would there be three pieces added to

2276
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:40,000
this

2277
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:41,678
thing like

2278
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,039
when we place down the structural

2279
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:46,399
entities you don't

2280
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:49,359
place like we don't place pieces on them

2281
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:52,559
do we or do we

2282
01:44:49,359 --> 01:44:52,559
so in the room gen

2283
01:44:52,960 --> 01:45:00,319
code uh you can see us

2284
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:03,359
placing a piece right here right

2285
01:45:00,319 --> 01:45:06,079
um but then

2286
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:06,079
does anyone

2287
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,198
oh

2288
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:21,279
oh

2289
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:26,079
my well well well

2290
01:45:21,279 --> 01:45:29,679
so actually as it turns out

2291
01:45:26,079 --> 01:45:33,198
i'm totally wrong about that

2292
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:37,359
so these are occluder pieces

2293
01:45:33,198 --> 01:45:41,439
that are placed in the environment

2294
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:41,439
that we use to create sort of like a

2295
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:45,840
ceiling

2296
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:56,000
very interesting and if i look at place

2297
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:59,520
tree

2298
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:03,359
the tree why would we place an occluder

2299
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:05,360
on the envy this is just stupid

2300
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:06,799
like this is the thing that places the

2301
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:08,960
tree

2302
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,480
the ad tree thing should place the

2303
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:14,079
occludor

2304
01:46:10,479 --> 01:46:17,198
right so i don't know what the heck

2305
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:21,519
this is supposed to do that is just

2306
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:24,719
dumb right um

2307
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:27,840
because this is actually the code

2308
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:27,840
that you would want

2309
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:35,279
it goes on the tree it doesn't go

2310
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:38,639
in the square so that's nonsense

2311
01:46:35,279 --> 01:46:40,880
right total nonsense um

2312
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:43,440
so then the question is just what kind

2313
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:46,400
of nonsense is this

2314
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:47,279
so it looks like there's an occluder the

2315
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:50,879
occluder

2316
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:52,840
is uh placed

2317
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,199
overlapping and then there's a ceiling

2318
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:58,880
one

2319
01:46:55,198 --> 01:47:01,839
right um

2320
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:02,319
so it does actually look like i was

2321
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:05,679
right

2322
01:47:02,319 --> 01:47:09,599
there are more in there um so all right

2323
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:13,039
so it's it's this right

2324
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:17,280
um where we would want to to change uh

2325
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:17,279
which light it is so like you know

2326
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:23,440
and this is not particularly good we

2327
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:27,439
should probably do something other than

2328
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:27,439
this but for right now i'm okay with it

2329
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:41,600
and i don't really remember exactly how

2330
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:41,599
we test to see if something is a light

2331
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:56,800
also i have no idea why there's nothing

2332
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:59,359
right here but okay

2333
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,840
uh i also don't know is entity piece

2334
01:47:59,359 --> 01:48:05,839
asset

2335
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:05,840
actually being used still

2336
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:10,880
no it's not so goodbye to you as well

2337
01:48:11,439 --> 01:48:15,678
all right um so what we want to do here

2338
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,399
is say like if this is a light

2339
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:20,239
we're going to change the light that was

2340
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:22,879
all that i was going to say

2341
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:25,279
so in here it would it would literally

2342
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:25,279
just be

2343
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:30,238
that i think

2344
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:38,799
and then we'll see uh what happens

2345
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:43,118
so so all right that seems fine

2346
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:46,159
and uh you know we should probably do

2347
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:48,479
we should oh god no

2348
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:49,839
no no what is happening don't run the

2349
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:53,118
game

2350
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:54,400
um so we should probably do some cleanup

2351
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:55,920
on like debug switches

2352
01:48:54,399 --> 01:48:57,679
at some point so that we can quickly

2353
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,520
check light locations and stuff like

2354
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:02,560
that without having to actually do any

2355
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:04,320
kinds of like just on hot keys you know

2356
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,080
um because it's something we're gonna

2357
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:08,479
want puss

2358
01:49:06,079 --> 01:49:08,479
hello

2359
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:18,319
do you wanna say hello here say hello

2360
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:21,199
come on come up and say hello okay

2361
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:22,799
do you want to say hello here come on

2362
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:25,598
come on

2363
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,880
there you go there you go no it's over

2364
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:30,079
baby it's over there

2365
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:33,440
it's over there sweetie here here

2366
01:49:30,079 --> 01:49:36,479
there you go can you see

2367
01:49:33,439 --> 01:49:39,279
can you see do you want to say anything

2368
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:39,279
to the audience

2369
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:43,840
do you want to say anything

2370
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:49,759
are you are you happy puss are you happy

2371
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:51,519
what is going on

2372
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:54,719
you're probably on unhappy about your

2373
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,719
flea medicine still huh

2374
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:59,360
it's only once every few months but it's

2375
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:59,359
important

2376
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:08,079
what do you think what do you think

2377
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:10,158
hm i got to finish the stream but then

2378
01:50:08,079 --> 01:50:13,679
we can play after

2379
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:18,399
okay you want to do that

2380
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:18,399
okay let's go down let's go down

2381
01:50:18,479 --> 01:50:22,000
you just had your lunch huh no actually

2382
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:25,198
you had a lunch

2383
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,960
quite some time ago i don't know

2384
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:32,319
all right um just finishing up

2385
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:33,359
uh let's see so that should create like

2386
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:36,319
green lights

2387
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:37,439
where we hop on switches which it does

2388
01:50:36,319 --> 01:50:41,920
right

2389
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:41,919
um so that's fine

2390
01:50:44,079 --> 01:50:48,800
i don't know that we want quite that but

2391
01:50:47,039 --> 01:50:52,079
i just wanted to see if i could do it

2392
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:54,159
right and it does seem

2393
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:56,079
it does seem all right so let me check

2394
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:57,118
out the stairs thing real quick just as

2395
01:50:56,079 --> 01:51:02,109
one last thing

2396
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:04,839
before we we uh before we stop

2397
01:51:02,109 --> 01:51:07,839
[Music]

2398
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,840
um

2399
01:51:10,158 --> 01:51:13,039
welcome to way too much light uh so the

2400
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,079
other thing i was wondering is what

2401
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:15,679
happens if we just turned off the

2402
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:21,840
standard lighting pattern

2403
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:21,840
so in the like world gen

2404
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:28,400
what if i just like turn that off like

2405
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:28,400
it's not gonna happen

2406
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:35,839
no puss no i gotta finish the stream

2407
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:35,840
puss

2408
01:51:37,118 --> 01:51:40,799
you don't want a program right now do

2409
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:42,079
you can you sit on my lap

2410
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:45,199
can you be a good girl instead of my lap

2411
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:48,719
while i finish the stream how about that

2412
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:51,759
what do you think of that no

2413
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:54,480
all right well we're gonna try we're

2414
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,480
gonna try okay

2415
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:03,840
so

2416
01:52:05,198 --> 01:52:12,719
i'm not sure exactly

2417
01:52:10,079 --> 01:52:12,719
entity gen

2418
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:21,119
i'm not sure exactly what happens

2419
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:21,598
in the entity generator here right now

2420
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:23,279
did i

2421
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:25,520
still leave those other lights on

2422
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:29,519
because i think i might have

2423
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:32,960
um which i didn't want to

2424
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:36,400
no see i didn't so so

2425
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:39,359
these should not be generating any light

2426
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:41,839
right so so shouldn't these rooms just

2427
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:44,960
be dark

2428
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:46,800
but they're not which is a little odd

2429
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:49,039
um i guess you can get some light from

2430
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,719
above but it shouldn't really be that

2431
01:52:49,039 --> 01:52:52,399
much right

2432
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:53,840
so like why is there so much light

2433
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:57,039
coming in here um

2434
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:59,440
i do feel like that's a little bit weird

2435
01:52:57,039 --> 01:53:02,800
but i don't know when we go to do a

2436
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:02,799
final pass on lighting it'll be

2437
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:13,840
interesting

2438
01:53:14,319 --> 01:53:27,840
all right

2439
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:41,760
so i think that um

2440
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:43,839
i think that that's all fine i'm gonna

2441
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:44,480
take a really quick look at the stairs

2442
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:46,400
thing

2443
01:53:44,479 --> 01:53:49,678
just so i can see uh if there's

2444
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:49,679
something obvious going on there

2445
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:55,840
um

2446
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,840
um

2447
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:18,079
so there's some kind of stairwell

2448
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:22,479
nonsense here right

2449
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:24,880
um and if we look at what that's doing

2450
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:37,839
um you can kind of see that we're like

2451
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:37,840
offsetting the stairs

2452
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:45,599
so really what that's saying is it's

2453
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:51,199
like hey

2454
01:54:45,599 --> 01:54:57,119
are we on a stairwell up or down

2455
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:57,118
which is not what we want i don't think

2456
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:07,840
um

2457
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:10,399
so when we loop through these

2458
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:10,400
connections

2459
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:20,960
if there's a stairwell up we don't care

2460
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:20,959
so i think it's maybe just that

2461
01:55:21,439 --> 01:55:23,759
maybe

2462
01:55:29,279 --> 01:55:34,399
um so i think that's more what we want

2463
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:36,079
now there's other stuff we want to do

2464
01:55:34,399 --> 01:55:38,158
because we probably don't want to put

2465
01:55:36,079 --> 01:55:39,679
like like we shouldn't be able to hop in

2466
01:55:38,158 --> 01:55:42,638
there right

2467
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:45,118
so we don't want um on the stairwell

2468
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:48,560
down we probably want to remove

2469
01:55:45,118 --> 01:55:54,158
those tiles so so we may

2470
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:54,159
want to do something like this

2471
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:01,840
um

2472
01:56:05,039 --> 01:56:08,719
like we want to say that we're on a wall

2473
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:12,840
we want a wall

2474
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:15,760
here i think so we probably want

2475
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:18,239
like

2476
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:18,239
this

2477
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:22,319
uh now might be a good time to start

2478
01:56:21,039 --> 01:56:23,679
cleaning this code up too because we're

2479
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:24,719
going to actually care about our rooms

2480
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:27,199
more now

2481
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:28,480
but anyway um we might say is like all

2482
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:31,759
right we're on a wall

2483
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:32,089
if you're here you know what i'm saying

2484
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:34,800
um

2485
01:56:32,090 --> 01:56:37,279
[Music]

2486
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:39,599
although we we don't really want a wall

2487
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:43,439
we just don't want

2488
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:47,199
you to be able to walk there so

2489
01:56:43,439 --> 01:56:49,519
more specifically like uh

2490
01:56:47,198 --> 01:56:49,519
you know

2491
01:56:50,479 --> 01:56:59,519
i don't know

2492
01:56:56,479 --> 01:57:02,959
something like that um

2493
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:04,159
so so i'm not sure i'm not sure exactly

2494
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,920
how i want that to be

2495
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:07,759
but but we'll see but it would be

2496
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:09,440
something like that

2497
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:10,960
um where like if there was an up

2498
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:12,238
connection you're not supposed to be

2499
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:15,520
able to stand there

2500
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:18,000
you know what i'm saying um

2501
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:18,719
uh and only if there wasn't also one

2502
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,158
down

2503
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:22,079
so if there's one up and down in the

2504
01:57:20,158 --> 01:57:23,198
same room that's a fine but like you

2505
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:25,439
know

2506
01:57:23,198 --> 01:57:26,559
so what i would want to do so here it is

2507
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:29,519
it's traversable

2508
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:31,199
right so that's what we actually want so

2509
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:34,400
traversible

2510
01:57:31,198 --> 01:57:36,158
uh would be here and the problem that

2511
01:57:34,399 --> 01:57:39,279
we're going to have is traversable gets

2512
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:42,399
set somehow in here to true right

2513
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:44,079
when you're not on a wall and maybe what

2514
01:57:42,399 --> 01:57:44,638
i want to do is do it the other way

2515
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:48,079
around

2516
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:48,079
so it's false here

2517
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:52,000
and that way i can say look assume that

2518
01:57:51,039 --> 01:57:56,479
it's traversable

2519
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,479
and that way in here i can say it's not

2520
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:01,039
so if you're on a wall or you're

2521
01:57:59,359 --> 01:58:03,039
underneath the place

2522
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:04,158
uh the connection or whatever on wall

2523
01:58:03,039 --> 01:58:07,519
can can be moved

2524
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:10,638
back down to to here right

2525
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:13,280
um it doesn't need to be looked at above

2526
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:14,000
and uh puss is so sweet right now she's

2527
01:58:13,279 --> 01:58:16,158
sitting right

2528
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,840
on my lap you can't see it but she's

2529
01:58:16,158 --> 01:58:21,679
behaving so well on the stream

2530
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:24,719
um what a good puss you are

2531
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:28,319
what a good puss you are uh

2532
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:31,760
so now we just can't go there right

2533
01:58:28,319 --> 01:58:34,399
um we can't go under the stairs

2534
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:36,159
so that seems good and you know we'll

2535
01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:37,118
want to probably make that look a little

2536
01:58:36,158 --> 01:58:39,598
different

2537
01:58:37,118 --> 01:58:40,559
but at least now it's like sane and it

2538
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:43,599
won't put the

2539
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:46,320
the uh the floor tile

2540
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:47,679
like the the stompable tiles won't go on

2541
01:58:46,319 --> 01:59:03,840
there

2542
01:58:47,679 --> 01:59:03,840
so that seems good as well right

2543
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:18,238
all right i'm going to call that a day

2544
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,719
we will do a brief q a and then that

2545
01:59:18,238 --> 01:59:31,839
will be

2546
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:31,840
the end of that uh all right

2547
02:00:19,039 --> 02:00:23,519
no questions if there are no questions

2548
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:23,520
then we are done

2549
02:00:25,279 --> 02:00:29,840
i'm glad that the audio seems to have

2550
02:00:27,279 --> 02:00:41,840
worked today

2551
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:41,840
so hey you know that's pretty good

2552
02:00:44,399 --> 02:00:47,359
how you doing miss thing

2553
02:00:48,238 --> 02:00:55,839
you doing okay all right

2554
02:01:10,238 --> 02:01:13,359
any ideas how to stop the snakes from

2555
02:01:12,079 --> 02:01:16,399
getting stuck

2556
02:01:13,359 --> 02:01:17,679
no i don't really um so

2557
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:20,158
you know there's a lot of things we

2558
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:20,880
could do we could make the snakes

2559
02:01:20,158 --> 02:01:23,839
smarter

2560
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:25,279
so they tried to avoid getting stuck

2561
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:29,440
that's one thing

2562
02:01:25,279 --> 02:01:29,439
but that wouldn't necessarily

2563
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:35,599
so i guess what i would say about that

2564
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:37,440
is that wouldn't necessarily stop

2565
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:38,880
the snakes from getting stuck what that

2566
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:40,638
would do is

2567
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,920
decrease the likelihood that the snake's

2568
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:42,880
getting stuck so if the snakes were

2569
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:45,920
somewhat smart

2570
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:47,440
and intentionally tried not to do that

2571
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,800
then they would do it less often but the

2572
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:50,479
player could probably still force them

2573
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,560
to do it or circumstances could force

2574
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:54,319
them to do it

2575
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:56,159
now again that's why i say this is more

2576
02:01:54,319 --> 02:01:57,039
of a game design question because i feel

2577
02:01:56,158 --> 02:01:59,359
like

2578
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:01,118
you really would want to know you you

2579
02:01:59,359 --> 02:02:02,799
want to have a game design opinion about

2580
02:02:01,118 --> 02:02:05,679
which one of those it should be

2581
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:09,119
and i don't know which it should be so

2582
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:09,118
so that's what i would say about that

2583
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:15,599
the other things we can do if the idea

2584
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,760
is snakes should never get stuck

2585
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:20,719
is we can just make it that if a snake

2586
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:22,800
looks and can't find anywhere to hop

2587
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:24,239
it's allowed to just randomly pick

2588
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:27,679
another place

2589
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:28,718
right um and that's again it's a

2590
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:30,319
gameplay decision

2591
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:32,399
and maybe that's cool like the whole

2592
02:02:30,319 --> 02:02:34,639
snake will sn hop over to somewhere

2593
02:02:32,399 --> 02:02:35,519
else maybe we don't even want snakes in

2594
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:39,440
the game

2595
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:41,360
right so so i don't know um

2596
02:02:39,439 --> 02:02:42,479
that's that's what i would say is it's

2597
02:02:41,359 --> 02:02:45,679
it's really

2598
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:47,839
programming it is not super hard so

2599
02:02:45,679 --> 02:02:48,719
us writing code to do whatever it is we

2600
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:51,440
want it to do

2601
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:52,399
is not super difficult it's a game

2602
02:02:51,439 --> 02:02:55,839
design question

2603
02:02:52,399 --> 02:02:56,158
it's what should it do like what what do

2604
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:58,079
we

2605
02:02:56,158 --> 02:02:59,279
want to do and that's inherently a game

2606
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:01,519
sign question

2607
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:02,880
for this kind of game i think you

2608
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:06,080
probably don't want

2609
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:07,760
smart ai you know this is a game about

2610
02:03:06,079 --> 02:03:10,880
you know it's supposed to feel like

2611
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:13,920
zelda-like or binding of isaac

2612
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:14,719
those games don't want really smart ais

2613
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:18,639
what they want

2614
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:21,520
is like predictable enemy behavior

2615
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:23,199
that the player goes oh i know this

2616
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:26,239
enemy does this pattern

2617
02:03:23,198 --> 02:03:28,319
right so i would say that game design

2618
02:03:26,238 --> 02:03:30,559
wise in order to remain on theme

2619
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:32,238
we probably don't want the ai doing

2620
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:34,639
anything super smart

2621
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:36,479
so the ais shouldn't think very much

2622
02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:37,599
they should do things that a player can

2623
02:03:36,479 --> 02:03:40,799
immediately know

2624
02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:57,840
that this is the pattern it will do

2625
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:57,840
but beyond that i i just don't know

2626
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:06,399
following up on the question i asked you

2627
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:08,840
before i thought about what you said and

2628
02:04:06,399 --> 02:04:12,319
i'm not sure i understand

2629
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:13,039
uh okay well i would need more

2630
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:16,639
information

2631
02:04:13,039 --> 02:04:20,960
on what you didn't understand

2632
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:20,960
though in order to answer more

2633
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:26,480
um this is from a question from the

2634
02:04:25,198 --> 02:04:30,078
pre-stream so it's

2635
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:30,078
it's it's quite a bit back

2636
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:38,399
oh auroboros is a great idea have the

2637
02:04:36,158 --> 02:04:41,039
snake eat its own tail ah

2638
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:43,359
that's that might be cool gameplay-wise

2639
02:04:41,039 --> 02:04:45,039
because then if the player traps a snake

2640
02:04:43,359 --> 02:04:47,039
into a place where the snake can't get

2641
02:04:45,039 --> 02:04:49,699
out it would

2642
02:04:47,039 --> 02:04:51,118
uh the player

2643
02:04:49,699 --> 02:04:52,639
[Music]

2644
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:54,799
will then have caused the snake to kill

2645
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:57,039
one of its own pieces that could be cool

2646
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:57,039
right

2647
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:06,158
i've seen things about having a fixed

2648
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,279
update clock for the game but rendering

2649
02:05:06,158 --> 02:05:09,118
at a higher frame rate

2650
02:05:07,279 --> 02:05:10,559
requires you to interpolate between

2651
02:05:09,118 --> 02:05:12,960
states to do this

2652
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:13,679
would you just duplicate your game state

2653
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:15,198
each time

2654
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:17,039
and interpolate between the current and

2655
02:05:15,198 --> 02:05:21,039
previous for every entity

2656
02:05:17,039 --> 02:05:23,118
that seems quite expensive so

2657
02:05:21,039 --> 02:05:25,679
i mean that is what people generally do

2658
02:05:23,118 --> 02:05:27,439
but it's actually not as expensive as

2659
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:29,359
you might think if you want to keep the

2660
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:31,519
cost down it's not that bad because the

2661
02:05:29,359 --> 02:05:32,399
renderer doesn't care about the entire

2662
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,320
game state

2663
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:36,158
it only needs to know like positions and

2664
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:38,639
orientations usually

2665
02:05:36,158 --> 02:05:40,238
um and maybe a few other things that are

2666
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:42,800
dependent on those things

2667
02:05:40,238 --> 02:05:44,479
so typically i think what you do is you

2668
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:47,360
you're only talking about

2669
02:05:44,479 --> 02:05:48,718
storing a previous like interpolation

2670
02:05:47,359 --> 02:05:50,479
position

2671
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:51,840
but you don't have to like duplicate

2672
02:05:50,479 --> 02:05:54,959
everything

2673
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:56,800
you could if you wanted to um but you

2674
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:58,158
know

2675
02:05:56,800 --> 02:06:03,840
it's not as bad as you might think i

2676
02:05:58,158 --> 02:06:03,839
guess is what i'd say

2677
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:09,279
i'm looking for a lightweight way to

2678
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:11,359
traverse 3d voxels along array and

2679
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:13,679
accumulate a color in opengl

2680
02:06:11,359 --> 02:06:16,078
any suggestions about algorithms that

2681
02:06:13,679 --> 02:06:18,078
are mostly branchless

2682
02:06:16,078 --> 02:06:19,840
i'm probably the wrong one to ask i just

2683
02:06:18,078 --> 02:06:20,559
don't do a lot of gpu programming these

2684
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:24,560
days

2685
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:26,800
so i'm really the wrong one to ask

2686
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:28,000
stepping along a voxel is not that hard

2687
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:31,360
obviously

2688
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,920
um but the question of what's the most

2689
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:34,319
efficient

2690
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:35,520
way to like organize that kind of thing

2691
02:06:34,319 --> 02:06:38,880
on a graphics card

2692
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:40,719
is you know i mean i'd pr what i'd

2693
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:46,400
probably do if i were you is i'd go

2694
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:50,239
look at the sparse voxel uh octree paper

2695
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:52,638
and i which was a while ago and i would

2696
02:06:50,238 --> 02:06:54,479
go look on like google scholar or

2697
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:56,480
sightseer or something

2698
02:06:54,479 --> 02:06:58,000
and look at all the people who reference

2699
02:06:56,479 --> 02:07:00,638
that paper that are more

2700
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,158
modern so i'd like reverse crawl from

2701
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:04,400
that paper forward

2702
02:07:02,158 --> 02:07:05,519
because there's going to be a ton of

2703
02:07:04,399 --> 02:07:08,479
papers on

2704
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:09,760
voxel walking on gpus and people have

2705
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:11,839
studied this problem

2706
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:12,800
so so you don't have to come up with the

2707
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:14,960
answer yourself

2708
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:27,840
there's a lot of research on that you

2709
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:27,840
know what i mean

2710
02:07:47,118 --> 02:07:50,639
i want to get deeper into c assembly but

2711
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,880
i already have three projects ongoing in

2712
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:53,118
c

2713
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:54,639
sharp and running my business how do did

2714
02:07:53,118 --> 02:07:57,759
you manage learning new topics

2715
02:07:54,639 --> 02:08:01,039
while inundated with other work um

2716
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:02,560
so i guess what i would say is you know

2717
02:08:01,039 --> 02:08:04,000
obviously you have to assess how

2718
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:05,520
important it is for you to learn

2719
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,599
whatever it is that you want to learn

2720
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:09,440
if you're stressed and you don't have

2721
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:11,440
time

2722
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:13,039
it's not usually going to be a great

2723
02:08:11,439 --> 02:08:15,519
environment for learning so

2724
02:08:13,039 --> 02:08:17,198
you know you have to ask yourself is

2725
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:19,520
this the right time in my life

2726
02:08:17,198 --> 02:08:20,638
to make time for this thing and if you

2727
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:22,159
really want to learn it

2728
02:08:20,639 --> 02:08:24,880
then it's always the right time to try

2729
02:08:22,158 --> 02:08:26,559
and make time but you may be like nah

2730
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:28,159
i'll wait and i'll do it you know when

2731
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:30,000
i'm a little older and maybe some of

2732
02:08:28,158 --> 02:08:31,679
this settles down or you know or i don't

2733
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,599
care whatever but so

2734
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:34,960
so make sure it's the right time and

2735
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:36,319
that you want to actually make time for

2736
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:38,078
this thing first don't

2737
02:08:36,319 --> 02:08:40,399
pile too much stuff on yourself and

2738
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:44,078
stress yourself out

2739
02:08:40,399 --> 02:08:45,839
too much but if you've decided that now

2740
02:08:44,078 --> 02:08:48,479
is the time and you want to set aside

2741
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:49,119
some time for learning something what i

2742
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:50,879
would say

2743
02:08:49,118 --> 02:08:53,279
is if you're running a business and you

2744
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:55,359
have a bunch of c sharp projects

2745
02:08:53,279 --> 02:08:57,359
i guess one thing i would ask is can you

2746
02:08:55,359 --> 02:09:00,559
actually just integrate it in

2747
02:08:57,359 --> 02:09:01,839
like c sharp can call out to see your

2748
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:03,360
assembly libraries

2749
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:06,078
do you have some stuff you're doing in

2750
02:09:03,359 --> 02:09:07,839
your c sharp code right now that's slow

2751
02:09:06,078 --> 02:09:09,279
like do you have any performance

2752
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:10,400
critical stuff that you wish would run

2753
02:09:09,279 --> 02:09:13,118
faster

2754
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:14,559
what you could do is say let me make a

2755
02:09:13,118 --> 02:09:18,719
little c library

2756
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:20,560
dll that i can call from c sharp um

2757
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:22,880
and and let me start trying to optimize

2758
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:23,599
that in assembly or with intrinsics or

2759
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:27,039
something

2760
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:28,159
or multi-threading right so you could

2761
02:09:27,039 --> 02:09:29,760
try to just take

2762
02:09:28,158 --> 02:09:31,679
little pieces of what you're doing now

2763
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:35,440
and say can i make one of these

2764
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:37,279
be like a learning uh

2765
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:38,879
a learning environment so i just do my

2766
02:09:37,279 --> 02:09:39,359
spare time so don't make it business

2767
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:41,760
critical

2768
02:09:39,359 --> 02:09:42,799
you don't want something that you're

2769
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:44,639
learning to be

2770
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:45,760
in your critical path but just like you

2771
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:47,599
know i'm gonna spend a few hours a week

2772
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:49,280
tinkering with this

2773
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:51,440
let me see if i can if i can make

2774
02:09:49,279 --> 02:09:53,519
something um

2775
02:09:51,439 --> 02:09:55,279
that that i can actually use as part of

2776
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:57,920
of what i do so it's not totally

2777
02:09:55,279 --> 02:09:57,920
separate right

2778
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:01,840
so

2779
02:10:08,319 --> 02:10:12,158
one thing that always gets me how do you

2780
02:10:10,399 --> 02:10:14,158
stop yourself from over competing things

2781
02:10:12,158 --> 02:10:16,238
i always seem to try to be clever and it

2782
02:10:14,158 --> 02:10:19,439
almost always seems to be a bad idea

2783
02:10:16,238 --> 02:10:21,039
um so i there's there's no real way to

2784
02:10:19,439 --> 02:10:22,399
stop yourself from over complicating

2785
02:10:21,039 --> 02:10:24,078
things

2786
02:10:22,399 --> 02:10:26,960
because your brain won't pick the

2787
02:10:24,078 --> 02:10:30,319
simplest way every time when you start

2788
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:32,880
so i don't think it's worthwhile to to

2789
02:10:30,319 --> 02:10:35,118
try to hold yourself to a standard of

2790
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:36,719
always write the simplest code first

2791
02:10:35,118 --> 02:10:38,799
you should be trying to write simple

2792
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:41,920
code but you won't always succeed

2793
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:44,320
and even people like me or john blow who

2794
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:45,359
say all the time you can even hear me

2795
02:10:44,319 --> 02:10:46,719
say on the stream like i'm just gonna

2796
02:10:45,359 --> 02:10:47,598
write the simplest possible thing we'll

2797
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:50,158
say that

2798
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:51,599
he'll say that i'll say that we still

2799
02:10:50,158 --> 02:10:52,479
end up with over complicated code all

2800
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:55,360
the time

2801
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:57,198
right the thing that keeps us from

2802
02:10:55,359 --> 02:10:59,198
spiraling out of control on it

2803
02:10:57,198 --> 02:11:00,879
is that eventually we go this is getting

2804
02:10:59,198 --> 02:11:01,198
too complicated let's figure out a way

2805
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:04,319
to

2806
02:11:01,198 --> 02:11:05,598
simplify it right um and so it's really

2807
02:11:04,319 --> 02:11:07,679
more about putting

2808
02:11:05,599 --> 02:11:09,520
in a mental process that you do

2809
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:13,199
periodically where you're like

2810
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:14,480
is there an opportunity to simplify this

2811
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:16,479
is there an opportunity to like just

2812
02:11:14,479 --> 02:11:17,839
always thinking about that how can i

2813
02:11:16,479 --> 02:11:19,919
reduce the amount of code that's

2814
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:23,279
involved here right

2815
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:26,960
um and so i feel like mostly that

2816
02:11:23,279 --> 02:11:28,719
is what you have to learn because

2817
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:30,800
always try to write the simplest code

2818
02:11:28,719 --> 02:11:32,560
first but you won't know

2819
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:33,840
like when i sit down to write code i

2820
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:35,119
don't know what

2821
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:36,480
for something that's a complicated

2822
02:11:35,118 --> 02:11:38,238
problem i don't know what is the

2823
02:11:36,479 --> 02:11:40,000
simplest way to handle it

2824
02:11:38,238 --> 02:11:42,158
i may never have thought of the right

2825
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,319
techniques that make that code simple

2826
02:11:42,158 --> 02:11:46,000
and they may only emerge after i've

2827
02:11:44,319 --> 02:11:48,000
written a thousand lines of the wrong

2828
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:49,760
code and be like oh wait i could have

2829
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,238
simplified all this down to 20 lines of

2830
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:52,719
code

2831
02:11:50,238 --> 02:11:54,479
if i just done this other thing so it's

2832
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:55,520
really more about keeping that mental

2833
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:59,598
process of

2834
02:11:55,520 --> 02:12:01,679
focusing on simplicity when you

2835
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:03,199
go back to things looking at the code

2836
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:04,480
i'm going to add a new feature could i

2837
02:12:03,198 --> 02:12:06,078
have simplified this is it too

2838
02:12:04,479 --> 02:12:07,279
complicated am i actually getting any

2839
02:12:06,078 --> 02:12:08,880
benefit out of this and we've done that

2840
02:12:07,279 --> 02:12:09,759
many times we do that with the asset

2841
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:12,319
system

2842
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,520
we've done that with the entity stuff

2843
02:12:12,319 --> 02:12:15,679
the generation code

2844
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:17,119
right and we'll be doing it more as we

2845
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:18,560
get closer to shipping handmade hero

2846
02:12:17,118 --> 02:12:19,439
there's always opportunities for

2847
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:20,800
simplicity there's

2848
02:12:19,439 --> 02:12:23,039
way too much code in handmade error

2849
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:24,639
right now if we did an audit

2850
02:12:23,039 --> 02:12:26,319
and went through and thought about each

2851
02:12:24,639 --> 02:12:27,679
section we could simplify each and every

2852
02:12:26,319 --> 02:12:29,039
one of them and so it's really just

2853
02:12:27,679 --> 02:12:30,960
about making that time

2854
02:12:29,039 --> 02:12:32,800
and doing that mental exercise of going

2855
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:35,198
how can i simplify this

2856
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:37,039
you won't always have time i mean i

2857
02:12:35,198 --> 02:12:38,799
remember the witness code base there's

2858
02:12:37,039 --> 02:12:40,639
tons of stuff in there that's massively

2859
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:42,639
over complicated you won't always have

2860
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:44,719
time to simplify everything

2861
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:46,800
but the way that you keep it from

2862
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:49,279
spiraling out of control

2863
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:50,960
is just by doing that periodic cleanup

2864
02:12:49,279 --> 02:12:53,279
and there's no way around that

2865
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:55,039
as you get better at programming and

2866
02:12:53,279 --> 02:12:58,639
focus more on simplicity

2867
02:12:55,039 --> 02:13:00,960
it's true that you'll create less messes

2868
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:02,960
but it will only be less messes there

2869
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:04,560
will still always be a mess

2870
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:06,078
so you always have to think about how do

2871
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:07,760
i clean up my messes because you're

2872
02:13:06,078 --> 02:13:08,960
never going to get out of it completely

2873
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:10,320
unless you're literally writing the

2874
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:12,000
exact same thing you've written many

2875
02:13:10,319 --> 02:13:14,719
times before you're not going to pick

2876
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,319
the perfectly mess-free way to do it the

2877
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:19,039
first time so it's just about that

2878
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:19,039
mental process

2879
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,960
would it be possible to have two switch

2880
02:13:27,359 --> 02:13:30,799
tiles in very different rooms that you

2881
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:34,560
have to hop on to

2882
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:37,520
open a door or unlock something um

2883
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:38,880
with the current way that handmade hero

2884
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,800
is architected

2885
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:42,800
you would have to do a little a little

2886
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:43,599
bit of extra work to do that you'd have

2887
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:46,880
to add a

2888
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:50,159
field to the entities to do that um

2889
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:52,480
because right now long distance stuff it

2890
02:13:50,158 --> 02:13:54,158
doesn't handmade hero thinks in terms

2891
02:13:52,479 --> 02:13:56,238
mostly of regions

2892
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:57,279
so if you're talking about two totally

2893
02:13:56,238 --> 02:13:59,678
separate switches

2894
02:13:57,279 --> 02:14:00,800
what you would need to do is have some

2895
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:04,480
thing that that

2896
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:06,159
tracks like here are some global state

2897
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:09,519
things that are true

2898
02:14:06,158 --> 02:14:11,679
through the whole game i don't

2899
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:13,280
want anything like that in the game like

2900
02:14:11,679 --> 02:14:15,039
i don't really want the player to have

2901
02:14:13,279 --> 02:14:16,479
to go

2902
02:14:15,039 --> 02:14:18,479
if the player was supposed to get

2903
02:14:16,479 --> 02:14:19,919
something that

2904
02:14:18,479 --> 02:14:21,359
has an effect somewhere else i would

2905
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:22,960
want it to be something they carry like

2906
02:14:21,359 --> 02:14:24,479
a key or something

2907
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:26,000
i don't really want there to be like

2908
02:14:24,479 --> 02:14:28,078
really distant switches that you

2909
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,359
switch on and off that are like nowhere

2910
02:14:28,078 --> 02:14:31,359
near each other

2911
02:14:29,359 --> 02:14:33,198
so i probably won't be adding anything

2912
02:14:31,359 --> 02:14:36,078
like that but if you wanted to

2913
02:14:33,198 --> 02:14:36,960
you might want to consider having the

2914
02:14:36,078 --> 02:14:39,359
brains be

2915
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:40,880
more permanent so there's the first n

2916
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:41,679
brains are permanent brains that can

2917
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:43,440
just track

2918
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:45,679
infinitely large things if you want it'd

2919
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:48,638
be pretty easy architectural change

2920
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:50,319
um but you know it would just mean that

2921
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:52,480
the entity cache would never

2922
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:54,399
page those out they're just permanently

2923
02:14:52,479 --> 02:14:57,198
in so that way they can be

2924
02:14:54,399 --> 02:14:58,638
as far effecting as possible right but i

2925
02:14:57,198 --> 02:15:00,638
would still want to keep all the current

2926
02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:02,239
stuff because i don't want most entities

2927
02:15:00,639 --> 02:15:04,000
to have that i don't want most entities

2928
02:15:02,238 --> 02:15:04,799
to have to be in memory all the time or

2929
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:09,840
in

2930
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:09,840
in play all the time right

2931
02:15:19,359 --> 02:15:22,479
thank you for the compliment it is it's

2932
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:37,840
not me unfortunately it's the

2933
02:15:22,479 --> 02:15:37,839
it's the camera lighting

2934
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:47,198
yeah oh there is so much cat hair

2935
02:15:46,158 --> 02:15:50,399
floating around

2936
02:15:47,198 --> 02:15:54,399
in in this household um i keep

2937
02:15:50,399 --> 02:15:57,679
the puss very uh brushed i brush

2938
02:15:54,399 --> 02:16:05,839
her all the time but i mean she's still

2939
02:15:57,679 --> 02:16:05,840
always shedding

2940
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:19,840
all right um

2941
02:16:24,238 --> 02:16:27,198
ah okay so from what i understand you

2942
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:28,480
started handmade hero because you

2943
02:16:27,198 --> 02:16:30,078
thought people didn't know what it took

2944
02:16:28,479 --> 02:16:30,718
to make a real game and it would be good

2945
02:16:30,078 --> 02:16:32,558
if they did

2946
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:34,318
so it seems like you do that do care

2947
02:16:32,558 --> 02:16:38,318
about instrument um so no

2948
02:16:34,318 --> 02:16:38,318
i guess what i would say is um

2949
02:16:38,558 --> 02:16:42,159
it was more to make a record of how this

2950
02:16:40,799 --> 02:16:43,920
kind of programming works

2951
02:16:42,159 --> 02:16:45,200
right so it was it was to have like a

2952
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:49,120
preserved

2953
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:50,319
sort of version of it but for people who

2954
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:54,000
want that

2955
02:16:50,318 --> 02:16:57,119
so so the idea is is not to convince

2956
02:16:54,000 --> 02:17:00,318
people to do what i do

2957
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:03,760
it's to provide

2958
02:17:00,318 --> 02:17:07,039
a a series for the people who

2959
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:10,159
want to do it right

2960
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:11,359
that they can come and watch it or know

2961
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:14,638
how it happened

2962
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:17,719
right so um it's

2963
02:17:14,638 --> 02:17:20,638
it's not really supposed to be

2964
02:17:17,718 --> 02:17:22,000
evangelical right um not religiously

2965
02:17:20,638 --> 02:17:22,318
evangelical but you know what i mean

2966
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,478
like

2967
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:26,558
evangelical the literal definition of

2968
02:17:24,478 --> 02:17:27,199
that word meaning it's not supposed to

2969
02:17:26,558 --> 02:17:30,398
be

2970
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:31,920
pushing people like you need to do this

2971
02:17:30,398 --> 02:17:34,000
it's supposed to be if this is something

2972
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:36,239
that interests you here is a series

2973
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,239
right

2974
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:45,439
uh so so yeah i and and i actually one

2975
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,679
of the things that's true

2976
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:48,479
and and this is a a definitely a

2977
02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:50,638
conflict

2978
02:17:48,478 --> 02:17:52,239
between me and i guess what i would say

2979
02:17:50,638 --> 02:17:54,239
is like the way that people behave

2980
02:17:52,239 --> 02:17:56,959
online these days

2981
02:17:54,239 --> 02:17:58,318
is i don't like telling other people

2982
02:17:56,959 --> 02:18:01,839
what to do

2983
02:17:58,318 --> 02:18:03,840
right um so like so like nowadays

2984
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:05,679
the general culture online is that

2985
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:07,120
everyone thinks that they get the right

2986
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:08,159
to tell you what to do like that's

2987
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:11,519
that's the

2988
02:18:08,159 --> 02:18:12,799
attitude online um to the point where if

2989
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:14,639
they don't like what you do

2990
02:18:12,799 --> 02:18:16,638
they actually literally don't want you

2991
02:18:14,638 --> 02:18:18,638
to like exist right they want

2992
02:18:16,638 --> 02:18:20,159
you to not have a channel on twitch

2993
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:21,279
because they don't like what you show on

2994
02:18:20,159 --> 02:18:23,439
the channel on twitch

2995
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:25,439
or you shouldn't have a twitter account

2996
02:18:23,439 --> 02:18:26,159
because they don't like what you post on

2997
02:18:25,439 --> 02:18:30,000
twitter

2998
02:18:26,159 --> 02:18:33,200
so i am 100 like that is

2999
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:35,280
so terrible to me like i find that not

3000
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:38,240
only to be abhorrent and horrible

3001
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:39,599
as a way of thinking but also i feel

3002
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:41,920
like it's the antithesis

3003
02:18:39,599 --> 02:18:43,840
of what the computer revolution was so

3004
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:46,079
the computer evolution to me

3005
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:47,439
was that everyone gets to use a computer

3006
02:18:46,079 --> 02:18:49,439
right

3007
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:50,880
and you you can do what you want with

3008
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:54,960
your computer

3009
02:18:50,879 --> 02:18:57,839
that that was what it means to me right

3010
02:18:54,959 --> 02:18:58,558
and this was a really great thing in my

3011
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:00,799
opinion

3012
02:18:58,558 --> 02:19:02,558
because it allowed you to each

3013
02:19:00,799 --> 02:19:04,398
individual could do what they wanted to

3014
02:19:02,558 --> 02:19:06,478
do with their computer

3015
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:09,599
um this is what the personal computer

3016
02:19:06,478 --> 02:19:09,599
revolution was about

3017
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:15,599
and so i want everyone to be able to do

3018
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,359
what they want to do with their computer

3019
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:19,920
you know that's what i would prefer

3020
02:19:17,359 --> 02:19:20,880
and i and i don't this is why i don't go

3021
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:22,719
to like people

3022
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:24,638
like you've never seen me go to

3023
02:19:22,718 --> 02:19:25,919
someone's stream

3024
02:19:24,638 --> 02:19:27,839
and complain about the programming

3025
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:29,920
language they were using because

3026
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:31,120
i don't understand why someone would

3027
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,359
ever do that it's it's

3028
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:34,800
absolutely nuts to me if you want to

3029
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:36,079
complain on your stream about the

3030
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:36,558
programming language that someone's

3031
02:19:36,079 --> 02:19:38,000
using

3032
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:39,920
that makes perfect sense because the

3033
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,558
people came to your stream to hear your

3034
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:42,719
opinions

3035
02:19:40,558 --> 02:19:44,079
or to hear what you were doing so if i

3036
02:19:42,718 --> 02:19:46,478
say that i think it's stupid

3037
02:19:44,079 --> 02:19:48,159
to program in modern c plus on my stream

3038
02:19:46,478 --> 02:19:48,799
that makes a lot of sense everyone came

3039
02:19:48,159 --> 02:19:52,239
here

3040
02:19:48,799 --> 02:19:54,000
to to listen to what i have to say but

3041
02:19:52,239 --> 02:19:55,920
the idea online that you should go to

3042
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,200
someone else's feed or someone else's

3043
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:58,478
stream or someone else's thing and

3044
02:19:57,200 --> 02:20:01,920
complain about what

3045
02:19:58,478 --> 02:20:03,039
they do or tell them that they have to

3046
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:06,879
change what they do is

3047
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:10,160
is so to me that's horrible

3048
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:12,239
i don't understand why people do it

3049
02:20:10,159 --> 02:20:13,439
it's a weird thing that i can't

3050
02:20:12,239 --> 02:20:14,959
understand right

3051
02:20:13,439 --> 02:20:16,479
and obviously it makes perfect sense to

3052
02:20:14,959 --> 02:20:19,759
them

3053
02:20:16,478 --> 02:20:22,719
but to me i can't i can't imagine it

3054
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:23,359
so on my stuff you will never see me do

3055
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:26,639
that

3056
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:28,079
i i'm never going to go to like someone

3057
02:20:26,639 --> 02:20:29,840
else's thing

3058
02:20:28,079 --> 02:20:32,159
and tell them not to do something

3059
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:36,478
because i don't like it right

3060
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:38,959
um and i've tried to really never do

3061
02:20:36,478 --> 02:20:42,079
that on twitter anymore at all either

3062
02:20:38,959 --> 02:20:44,079
right um so if i complain about

3063
02:20:42,079 --> 02:20:47,200
something on twitter i try pretty hard

3064
02:20:44,079 --> 02:20:50,000
to complain on like my i just it posts

3065
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:50,319
just to my thing i i try not to go to

3066
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:54,000
like

3067
02:20:50,318 --> 02:20:55,439
other people's you know conversations

3068
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:58,959
they're having

3069
02:20:55,439 --> 02:21:02,159
and say something um

3070
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:04,239
to the extent that i can and uh or i

3071
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:07,920
just don't use the service anymore right

3072
02:21:04,239 --> 02:21:10,879
and so so i didn't want and don't want

3073
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:12,159
handmade hero to be that like i don't

3074
02:21:10,879 --> 02:21:15,519
want

3075
02:21:12,159 --> 02:21:19,200
people to interpret handmade hero as

3076
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:22,560
me trying to go to where they

3077
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:22,880
are in their computing space and telling

3078
02:21:22,559 --> 02:21:26,079
them

3079
02:21:22,879 --> 02:21:27,920
not to or to do something

3080
02:21:26,079 --> 02:21:29,439
i only want it to be something for

3081
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:32,879
people who who

3082
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:36,559
want to do this right like i want

3083
02:21:32,879 --> 02:21:37,920
them to be coming to the stream i do not

3084
02:21:36,559 --> 02:21:41,519
want to be going to them

3085
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:43,200
and trying to

3086
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:45,200
convince them in any way whether it's

3087
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:48,800
browbeating or

3088
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:49,439
or like or being very nice about it

3089
02:21:48,799 --> 02:21:52,159
doesn't

3090
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:54,800
it's not the tone so much as i just

3091
02:21:52,159 --> 02:21:58,478
don't want that behavior right

3092
02:21:54,799 --> 02:22:01,438
um so that's

3093
02:21:58,478 --> 02:22:03,358
just my mindset of it and so i really

3094
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:06,639
don't want handmade hero to be

3095
02:22:03,359 --> 02:22:09,600
about proselytizing or

3096
02:22:06,639 --> 02:22:10,639
putting on a hard sell or trying to

3097
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:14,000
appear

3098
02:22:10,639 --> 02:22:16,799
in some way as a way of

3099
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:18,318
signaling to people that they should

3100
02:22:16,799 --> 02:22:20,398
listen to me

3101
02:22:18,318 --> 02:22:22,398
i don't want that like i don't want any

3102
02:22:20,398 --> 02:22:24,079
of that to be happening

3103
02:22:22,398 --> 02:22:26,559
i just want to say what i think and if

3104
02:22:24,079 --> 02:22:28,959
people want to hear that they can

3105
02:22:26,559 --> 02:22:30,398
and if they don't they should be able to

3106
02:22:28,959 --> 02:22:33,519
not have to listen to it

3107
02:22:30,398 --> 02:22:35,599
right um and i don't want to put any

3108
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:37,120
subterfuge in there where i'm trying to

3109
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:40,239
slyly sneak

3110
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:40,720
messages i want people to hear into

3111
02:22:40,239 --> 02:22:42,879
things

3112
02:22:40,719 --> 02:22:44,639
in a way that is more palatable than it

3113
02:22:42,879 --> 02:22:48,159
should be because i know

3114
02:22:44,639 --> 02:22:48,159
that that will like help or something

3115
02:22:48,840 --> 02:23:05,840
right

3116
02:22:51,439 --> 02:23:05,840
so hopefully that makes more sense right

3117
02:23:18,239 --> 02:23:21,840
yeah and i and rants are great like i

3118
02:23:20,398 --> 02:23:25,279
have no problem with rants just

3119
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:26,318
just don't do them like on in someone

3120
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:29,520
else's turf

3121
02:23:26,318 --> 02:23:30,879
right like if if i want to rant on

3122
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:33,920
handmade hero about things

3123
02:23:30,879 --> 02:23:35,438
i don't like that seems fine but but

3124
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:37,760
you know there's people who will go on

3125
02:23:35,439 --> 02:23:40,479
to other people's twitch streams

3126
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:43,200
and start like ranting to them about

3127
02:23:40,478 --> 02:23:45,199
what they're doing and like i just don't

3128
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:47,520
want that like i don't want that to be

3129
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:48,720
happening right

3130
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:50,560
if you don't like what someone's doing

3131
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:54,159
on their twitch stream just don't watch

3132
02:23:50,559 --> 02:23:56,559
right don't watch that twitch stream

3133
02:23:54,159 --> 02:23:58,079
um and and you know if you don't like

3134
02:23:56,559 --> 02:23:59,600
what someone posts on twitter just don't

3135
02:23:58,079 --> 02:24:01,840
follow that twitter

3136
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:05,680
you know it's not that hard so to me

3137
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:07,840
like i try to do that as much as i can

3138
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:07,840
so

3139
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:16,960
do you find value in checking out other

3140
02:24:15,439 --> 02:24:18,559
parts of the computing space

3141
02:24:16,959 --> 02:24:20,239
even those you disagree with without

3142
02:24:18,559 --> 02:24:23,840
interfering of course

3143
02:24:20,239 --> 02:24:24,639
um yeah i i guess i would say there's

3144
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:26,159
some

3145
02:24:24,639 --> 02:24:27,439
there's some parts of computing like

3146
02:24:26,159 --> 02:24:28,879
object-oriented programming where i've

3147
02:24:27,439 --> 02:24:30,960
just set the bozo bit

3148
02:24:28,879 --> 02:24:33,279
on it where it's like i know that

3149
02:24:30,959 --> 02:24:35,599
nothing interesting happens there

3150
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:36,880
but uh there's plenty of other spheres

3151
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:41,120
of programming

3152
02:24:36,879 --> 02:24:41,119
that you know i don't necessarily think

3153
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:45,760
are good ideas as a whole but they have

3154
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:47,680
good ideas

3155
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:49,439
in them one that came out the other day

3156
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:50,880
was like pure functional programming

3157
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:54,398
like i don't think pure functional

3158
02:24:50,879 --> 02:24:57,679
programming is a very good idea

3159
02:24:54,398 --> 02:25:01,519
but there are interesting things about

3160
02:24:57,680 --> 02:25:03,359
functional programming and people who do

3161
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:07,359
pure functional programming

3162
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:07,760
are forced to do the maximum amount of

3163
02:25:07,359 --> 02:25:11,280
stuff

3164
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:14,318
that way so you can look at what they do

3165
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:16,159
and see what all the possibilities are

3166
02:25:14,318 --> 02:25:18,159
because unlike procedural programming

3167
02:25:16,159 --> 02:25:20,239
where you had other options they had no

3168
02:25:18,159 --> 02:25:21,840
options they had to do it that way

3169
02:25:20,239 --> 02:25:24,159
they had to do it with purely

3170
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:26,079
functional stuff

3171
02:25:24,159 --> 02:25:27,680
and so it can be interesting to look at

3172
02:25:26,079 --> 02:25:28,000
what they come up with because you're

3173
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:30,479
like

3174
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,398
okay if someone is spending all their

3175
02:25:30,478 --> 02:25:35,119
time in this constrained environment

3176
02:25:32,398 --> 02:25:35,599
having to follow these rules they will

3177
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:37,680
come up

3178
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:39,920
with things that you may never have come

3179
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:42,239
up with because you wouldn't have to

3180
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:44,159
and looking at that gives you

3181
02:25:42,239 --> 02:25:44,959
information that you will therefore

3182
02:25:44,159 --> 02:25:46,639
never have

3183
02:25:44,959 --> 02:25:48,398
because you will never have been forced

3184
02:25:46,639 --> 02:25:51,840
to push in those directions

3185
02:25:48,398 --> 02:25:53,358
right and so i do think there are other

3186
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:55,280
things you can learn

3187
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:56,640
about programming by looking at styles

3188
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:57,359
of programming that you yourself don't

3189
02:25:56,639 --> 02:25:59,519
do

3190
02:25:57,359 --> 02:26:00,960
because if they involve specific kinds

3191
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:03,280
of constraints that you don't subject

3192
02:26:00,959 --> 02:26:04,719
yourself to

3193
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:07,200
you will not have necessarily been

3194
02:26:04,719 --> 02:26:08,719
pushed as far in certain directions so

3195
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:21,840
that can be very educational

3196
02:26:08,719 --> 02:26:21,840
i think

3197
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:49,200
one last question if tomorrow everyone

3198
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:50,239
started using javascript for everything

3199
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:52,319
you wouldn't care at

3200
02:26:50,239 --> 02:26:53,520
all like you will probably always use

3201
02:26:52,318 --> 02:26:54,879
software written by other people

3202
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:56,399
wouldn't it be better that software was

3203
02:26:54,879 --> 02:26:56,959
of good quality and if you agree with

3204
02:26:56,398 --> 02:26:58,159
that

3205
02:26:56,959 --> 02:27:03,839
should you try to influence people to

3206
02:26:58,159 --> 02:27:03,840
care about software being high quality

3207
02:27:04,879 --> 02:27:09,039
i mean i guess what i would say is all

3208
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:10,719
the software is

3209
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:13,200
written in javascript for everything

3210
02:27:10,719 --> 02:27:15,199
already so i'm not sure

3211
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:17,040
that's a tomorrow question that's a

3212
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:19,359
today question

3213
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:19,359
um

3214
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:25,920
so i don't really know how to answer

3215
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:29,200
that question

3216
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:32,719
exactly it's not that i don't care

3217
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:32,720
it's that i don't really

3218
02:27:33,439 --> 02:27:40,079
i just don't really like evangelism

3219
02:27:36,639 --> 02:27:41,279
right people you know there are certain

3220
02:27:40,079 --> 02:27:42,318
things i'm willing to do and other

3221
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:44,319
things i'm not willing to do and

3222
02:27:42,318 --> 02:27:46,398
evangelism just isn't one of them

3223
02:27:44,318 --> 02:27:47,519
so i'm willing to say how much i think

3224
02:27:46,398 --> 02:27:50,478
javascript is

3225
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:50,960
not great on this stream i'm not gonna

3226
02:27:50,478 --> 02:27:54,239
go

3227
02:27:50,959 --> 02:27:55,679
i'm not gonna go around

3228
02:27:54,239 --> 02:27:57,280
poking into other people's business

3229
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:58,398
telling them not to use javascript right

3230
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:59,439
i mean i'm just that's just not

3231
02:27:58,398 --> 02:28:02,959
something i'm going to do

3232
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:02,960
it doesn't necessarily mean

3233
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:06,079
that i don't think there are negative

3234
02:28:04,318 --> 02:28:08,318
consequences to it it's just that you

3235
02:28:06,079 --> 02:28:08,318
know

3236
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:12,240
i i think that to the extent that i'm

3237
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:14,309
going to be

3238
02:28:12,239 --> 02:28:16,000
loud and um

3239
02:28:14,309 --> 02:28:18,239
[Music]

3240
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,719
proselytized about something it's going

3241
02:28:18,239 --> 02:28:22,318
to be more about programmer freedom

3242
02:28:20,719 --> 02:28:24,079
to ensure that i never get into a

3243
02:28:22,318 --> 02:28:25,600
situation where i am forced to only

3244
02:28:24,079 --> 02:28:28,159
write javascript all day

3245
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:29,600
right i want people to have the freedom

3246
02:28:28,159 --> 02:28:30,478
to do the kind of programming they want

3247
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:34,159
to do

3248
02:28:30,478 --> 02:28:35,599
i i don't want to be going around

3249
02:28:34,159 --> 02:28:36,959
putting my nose into other people's

3250
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:38,840
business telling them how to do what

3251
02:28:36,959 --> 02:28:42,478
they want to do

3252
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:45,120
right um

3253
02:28:42,478 --> 02:28:45,679
so like yeah javascript sucks i know i

3254
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:47,920
have

3255
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,120
written a couple thousand lines of code

3256
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:51,200
in it just recently

3257
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:52,800
for the star code galaxy player which is

3258
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:53,680
supposed to be web compatible right and

3259
02:28:52,799 --> 02:28:57,679
it sucks

3260
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:57,680
javascript is terrible um

3261
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:05,279
but you know like it's i don't know

3262
02:29:02,159 --> 02:29:05,280
it's it's not like

3263
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:10,880
i i don't know

3264
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:15,680
that a the fact that a bad programming

3265
02:29:14,398 --> 02:29:18,559
language is common

3266
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:19,840
is enough reason for me to go around

3267
02:29:18,559 --> 02:29:23,199
being pushy

3268
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:24,478
you know so so i'm just gonna have

3269
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:26,000
streams where i tell people that i think

3270
02:29:24,478 --> 02:29:27,840
this sucks and here's why and here's

3271
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:29,600
alternatives and hopefully people come

3272
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:31,359
to them as they seem to like

3273
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:32,640
i get a lot of people who come watch my

3274
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:35,520
stuff

3275
02:29:32,639 --> 02:29:36,159
and that seems like enough i don't think

3276
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:38,720
i need

3277
02:29:36,159 --> 02:29:40,239
to go around being pushy about it or

3278
02:29:38,719 --> 02:29:43,039
being sly

3279
02:29:40,239 --> 02:29:44,719
and trying to convince people because at

3280
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:48,080
the end of the day i think if you don't

3281
02:29:44,719 --> 02:29:48,079
know that javascript sucks

3282
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:52,559
i i don't know that there's that much

3283
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:54,399
i'm going to say i mean it's kind of

3284
02:29:52,559 --> 02:29:57,680
obvious that it sucks

3285
02:29:54,398 --> 02:30:00,639
and by the time someone's learned

3286
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:03,200
a little bit of programming you're kind

3287
02:30:00,639 --> 02:30:04,959
of going to know that javascript sucks

3288
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:06,399
even the people who program javascript

3289
02:30:04,959 --> 02:30:08,398
know it sucks i mean they created

3290
02:30:06,398 --> 02:30:09,840
typescript

3291
02:30:08,398 --> 02:30:11,519
so that they wouldn't have to deal with

3292
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:14,639
javascript you know

3293
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:15,439
so i don't know that that these things

3294
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:18,719
are really

3295
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:20,960
all that

3296
02:30:18,719 --> 02:30:23,438
much of a problem with proselytization

3297
02:30:20,959 --> 02:30:24,079
anyway does anyone think javascript is

3298
02:30:23,439 --> 02:30:27,439
good

3299
02:30:24,079 --> 02:30:29,120
most people who even use it as their

3300
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:30,800
primary output language don't want a

3301
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:31,680
program in it they use typescript now

3302
02:30:30,799 --> 02:30:33,840
right

3303
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:33,840
so

3304
02:30:58,639 --> 02:31:02,000
javascript sucks so in so many ways i

3305
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:03,600
mean

3306
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,840
you can't even really make threads in

3307
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:08,479
javascript for example

3308
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:11,439
right like try to write a multi-threaded

3309
02:31:08,478 --> 02:31:15,840
piece of code in javascript

3310
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:15,840
you know good luck

3311
02:31:54,398 --> 02:31:57,920
um but yeah i mean we could go on for a

3312
02:31:56,799 --> 02:32:00,079
long time about what javascript

3313
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:01,520
the lack of typing so you can't really

3314
02:32:00,079 --> 02:32:04,719
get static type analysis

3315
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:07,840
this is why typescript is useful right

3316
02:32:04,719 --> 02:32:09,840
um but there's so many reasons i mean

3317
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:11,280
it's it's got a lot of really bad

3318
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:14,398
[Music]

3319
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:15,359
aspects to it um it's just not a good

3320
02:32:14,398 --> 02:32:19,199
language

3321
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:20,800
in general um but like i said i really

3322
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:22,640
don't think that many people think it's

3323
02:32:20,799 --> 02:32:25,519
a good language

3324
02:32:22,639 --> 02:32:27,119
which is which is why you have things

3325
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:29,040
that people try to put on top of

3326
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:33,680
javascript to make it work

3327
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:39,840
okay you know but anyway

3328
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:39,840
should probably wrap it up

3329
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:50,000
all right

3330
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:54,799
let's switch back thank you everyone for

3331
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:56,000
joining me for the episode handmade here

3332
02:32:54,799 --> 02:32:56,559
it's gonna put your coding with you as

3333
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,879
always if

3334
02:32:56,559 --> 02:33:00,318
you would like to follow along the

3335
02:32:58,879 --> 02:33:02,159
series at home you can always period the

3336
02:33:00,318 --> 02:33:03,359
game on handmadehero.org and it comes

3337
02:33:02,159 --> 02:33:04,398
with source code so that you can play

3338
02:33:03,359 --> 02:33:06,800
around with it

3339
02:33:04,398 --> 02:33:08,639
uh i will be back here next week at

3340
02:33:06,799 --> 02:33:10,879
which point

3341
02:33:08,639 --> 02:33:12,239
honestly maybe it's time to put combat

3342
02:33:10,879 --> 02:33:14,000
in there um

3343
02:33:12,239 --> 02:33:15,920
so we'll probably just we'll do some

3344
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:19,040
stuff where we can fight some enemies

3345
02:33:15,920 --> 02:33:20,719
and just try to get that working um and

3346
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:22,800
then i don't know

3347
02:33:20,719 --> 02:33:25,199
like probably then after that it's items

3348
02:33:22,799 --> 02:33:26,799
right and then we'll sort of have like a

3349
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:28,399
yeah i mean i don't know like i said not

3350
02:33:26,799 --> 02:33:29,840
a game designer but we're just gonna

3351
02:33:28,398 --> 02:33:31,920
go through things that i think should be

3352
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:33,359
in there and we'll kind of hope that we

3353
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:34,559
get a reasonable enough playing thing

3354
02:33:33,359 --> 02:33:37,040
out of it

3355
02:33:34,559 --> 02:33:38,478
at the end of the day so that's it uh

3356
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:40,160
see you back here for that until then

3357
02:33:38,478 --> 02:33:42,239
have fun programming everyone

3358
02:33:40,159 --> 02:33:49,200
and i will see you on the internet take

3359
02:33:42,239 --> 02:33:49,199
it easy everybody
