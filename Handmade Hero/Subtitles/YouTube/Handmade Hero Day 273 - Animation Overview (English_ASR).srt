00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,349
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:07,080
here are the show we code a complete

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:09,678
game live on stream we are doing some

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,080
character movement code right now and

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,048
you know I'll be honest with you I think

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,560
we pretty much finished up our simple

7
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:21,239
little example of how to make a hopping

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,129
character yesterday and so what we've

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,778
got to do today is start talking a

10
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:27,329
little bit more broadly about animation

11
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:30,089
because what we want to do now is we

12
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:33,089
want to start to tune this animation so

13
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:35,909
that it looks a lot more satisfying

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,859
right and I'll show you just real

15
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,058
briefly where we're at just so you can

16
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:41,670
understand what I'm saying if you don't

17
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:44,189
remember from yesterday or even if you

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:52,800
do just to sort of refresh your memory a

19
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:55,649
little bit here is where we are at on on

20
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,448
handmade heroes little dude we got if we

21
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,859
got to do some opengl fix it in one of

22
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:01,320
these days so we don't have that texture

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,640
down that problem so you can kind of see

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,430
what we did is we made the little body

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,079
hop along and what I said yesterday is

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,490
well now we have to do some stuff you

27
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,200
know we want the head to always be

28
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:13,349
connected to the body we want it to kind

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,719
of stretch to meet where the head is and

30
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:21,179
we want to add more like that's a very

31
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:23,400
in my opinion very what's dry animations

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,710
very mechanical right it's just yeah it

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,530
hops in a little parabola but you know

34
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:30,118
it's not it's not very satisfying it's

35
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,969
just like I'm just literally moving the

36
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,099
thing over and so you know remember that

37
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:40,259
like keep that in mind what that looks

38
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:41,819
like because that's you know you'll want

39
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,250
to sort of appreciate how we get from

40
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,139
where we are there to where we are going

41
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,719
to be after we sort of work on the

42
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,728
animation a little bit more so before I

43
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,590
go any further down there it's probably

44
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:53,909
a good time to do some black boarding so

45
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,618
the people who don't know very much

46
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,969
about animation will understand the

47
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,069
sorts of stuff that we're trying to do

48
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:04,408
here and have some reasonable

49
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:06,179
perspective on what is you know what is

50
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,920
really the way to think through these

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,229
sorts of problems and

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,640
animation in general in a game context

53
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,170
so I don't know how much programming

54
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,669
will do today it depends on how long it

55
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:16,889
takes me to get through these concepts

56
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,179
and how much detail I go into and then

57
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm not sure how much is appropriate

58
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,140
given what we've already done but I feel

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,379
like we haven't really talked about it

60
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,539
too much so let's start by just taking

61
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,269
the sort of category a little bit

62
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:33,150
broadly and talk about animation in

63
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,980
general so what do we actually mean when

64
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,870
we're talking about animation well

65
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,030
obviously we're starting from a very

66
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,730
basic premise when wherever we're

67
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,709
talking about computer animation and

68
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:45,419
computer animation for games which is

69
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,400
that we know we sort of have this like

70
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,219
imaginary kind of film strip

71
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,930
you know that's kind of playing here

72
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:55,080
where we've got frame 0 frame 1 Frame 2

73
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,489
frame 3 right and here I'll draw in the

74
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,910
little perforations down the side to

75
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,799
make a good film strip and so obviously

76
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:04,169
you know we can't really display

77
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,909
anything quote-unquote animated we're

78
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,729
just displaying still frames and those

79
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:10,919
still frames are meant to appear to the

80
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,929
user as if there was motion happening

81
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,969
right and oftentimes we try to make it

82
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,469
appear sort of like what would happen if

83
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,729
you actually had a camera and we're

84
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:18,900
actually filming something and the

85
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,009
reason for that of course because that's

86
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,859
what people are used to seeing you're

87
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:28,199
used to watching a movie or a television

88
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:30,150
program on a monitor like the one that

89
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,639
we use for games and so what we expect

90
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,030
to see is that now what we're trying to

91
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:39,839
do when we produce these series of

92
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,659
frames is we're trying to capture the

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,180
effect of having something having moved

94
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:48,659
and what generally happens right if you

95
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,709
imagine what's going on in terms of the

96
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,009
sort of the process we're simulating

97
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,780
right there's a camera and inside the

98
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:57,090
camera this this film you know this

99
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,829
negative here the negative that we're

100
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,359
actually talking about is flowing

101
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,560
through this camera right it's it's you

102
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:03,209
know it's going through and it's going

103
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,318
into like a real right so it's kind of

104
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,109
like coming out here and going out of

105
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,929
this real and it's capturing something

106
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:12,359
on these frames and what it's actually

107
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,340
capturing depends quite a bit on how the

108
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,840
camera is set up right inside the camera

109
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,009
there's a little thing called a shutter

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,629
or an app

111
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,280
and you've all seen it right it's the

112
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:24,699
thing that like kind of looks like this

113
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,279
sort of a thing and it kind of spirals

114
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,930
in to be a small shape and then it's and

115
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,258
then it widens out again right it like

116
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,610
what it's like right it's like it can

117
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:35,020
close all the way to nothing and it

118
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,900
could open up to a certain state and

119
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:40,478
it's like based on how big this shutter

120
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:43,359
is more or less like it through bla bla

121
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,829
bla bla bla right now we're not going to

122
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,150
talk about depth of field or all those

123
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:47,168
other rendering things worth we might

124
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:48,459
care about with the aperture because

125
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:49,778
we're talking about animation right now

126
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:52,688
so we don't care about any of this other

127
00:04:49,778 --> 00:04:56,228
than the concept of a you know exposure

128
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:59,949
time and what exposure time is is inside

129
00:04:56,228 --> 00:05:02,438
a camera right you open up that aperture

130
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:04,060
to like take light into the front of the

131
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,849
camera and expose the film on the other

132
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:11,319
hand on the other end and for the entire

133
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:12,848
duration of that open period photons are

134
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,218
coming in through the camera and hitting

135
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:17,579
the film exposing it and what that means

136
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:21,189
is that a single frame of animation

137
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:23,800
right is not technically an instant in

138
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:26,319
time right it's not it's not

139
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,699
instantaneous what it actually is is

140
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:33,908
it's a interval of time okay and that

141
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:37,389
interval is specifically it is exactly

142
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:41,288
however long that aperture was open for

143
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:43,900
okay when the aperture closes the film

144
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:45,759
stops being exposed and advances when

145
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,468
the apertures open the film is getting

146
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,900
exposed and it's that amount of time

147
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:52,389
that we're capturing so if for example I

148
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:55,028
was using camera and I shut the set the

149
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:58,870
shutter speed to one sixtieth of a

150
00:05:55,028 --> 00:06:00,639
second then I know that I've got a 16.6

151
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,500
repeating millisecond exposure time

152
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,930
which means that there is essentially

153
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,949
that much worth of photons coming in

154
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,110
okay so what that means in terms of

155
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:14,800
actually if we're really talking about

156
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,598
animation in its broadest sense right if

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,038
we're talking about you know animation

158
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:22,120
inside the computer in its broadest

159
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:24,870
sense what we actually want is to be

160
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,838
able to capture an interval of time

161
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,610
right so we actually aren't trying to

162
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:32,740
find out say we

163
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,900
and object is and only it's

164
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,389
instantaneous position at some point in

165
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,459
time we're actually talking about where

166
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,918
did the object if we're trying to draw

167
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:44,888
that object where did it move right

168
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:48,430
during a particular interval if that

169
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:51,038
makes sense so in the you know in the

170
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,810
farthest forward part of the future when

171
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,279
we have infinite computing power and

172
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,079
infinite technology and I don't know

173
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,269
where that you know we're in Star Trek

174
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,649
and everyone's got weird stuff on their

175
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,810
forehead because they're an alien and

176
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:03,459
you go into the holodeck because the

177
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,069
writers ran out of any ideas for the

178
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:07,538
actual stuff to take care take place on

179
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,400
the spaceship so they're gonna use

180
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:12,339
virtual reality to simulate like

181
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,778
Sherlock Holmes or something and before

182
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:15,788
that writer gets fired and I hope to god

183
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:17,800
they get fired basically we're talking

184
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:19,778
about their what we would actually be

185
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,939
doing when we're rendering imagery is

186
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:23,589
we're talking about capturing what

187
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:26,020
happens in that interval and the reason

188
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:29,258
why that's important is because if you

189
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:30,459
look at pictures you know and we talk

190
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,020
about two frames here's frame zero

191
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:34,089
here's frame one and I've got like a

192
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:36,968
ball it's here and then on another frame

193
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:39,338
it's over here right well if I go to see

194
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:41,680
a movie that's only happening at 24

195
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:44,829
frames a second but it still looks great

196
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,569
right and if the game runs at 24 frames

197
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:48,609
a second well maybe that doesn't look so

198
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,039
great depending on the game right looks

199
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,569
very staccato and part of the reason for

200
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,838
that is because when you're shooting a

201
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:57,189
film you get motion blur right and that

202
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:58,180
motion blur is specifically because of

203
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:00,158
what we're talking about it's cuz it's

204
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,319
capturing an interval so if this thing

205
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:04,990
is coming across the screen you actually

206
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,900
have this big long beautiful blur that's

207
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,120
you know showing up there and that blur

208
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:13,388
is conveying all of this motion to your

209
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,028
eye that makes it look a lot more rich

210
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,050
and so again at the limit what we're

211
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:20,379
talking about when we're talking about

212
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,360
animation in computer graphics we're not

213
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:26,050
actually talking about figuring out how

214
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,588
to draw a single frame you know and then

215
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,509
another single frame of time we're

216
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:33,429
talking about drawing an interval of

217
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,408
time and then another interval of time

218
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,509
and that interval is proportional to

219
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:38,870
what kind of a camera effect we were

220
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:41,778
trying to

221
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:44,269
simulate now we're not that fortunate

222
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:46,669
these days in computers so a lot of

223
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:48,350
times we can't really do that and so

224
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:49,849
sometimes we have approximate ways of

225
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,470
approximating motion blur but they're

226
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,939
not really correct and there's a bunch

227
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,709
of corners we cut and a lot of times we

228
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:56,480
don't try to do motion blur at all we

229
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,039
just try to get a high frame rate like

230
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,778
60 frames a second and hope that things

231
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,958
aren't moving so fast if they look ugly

232
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:04,578
at that rate but it certainly does lend

233
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,419
a certain crispness to the images you

234
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:10,188
will see in CG that's not that doesn't

235
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:11,958
have motion blur it definitely looks

236
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:13,219
different right even that's in every one

237
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,138
second there would be motion blur on

238
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,610
fast-moving things especially the kind

239
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:19,308
of things you see in games fast cars

240
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,649
moving around and bullets whizzing by

241
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:23,899
and all these sorts of things so that's

242
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:27,139
important to understand but assuming you

243
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,519
understand that now we get to what we're

244
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:30,649
actually gonna try to achieve in

245
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,688
handmade hero which is the simpler

246
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,009
problem which is just instantaneous so

247
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:35,058
if we assume that our frame rate is high

248
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,818
enough that we don't care too much about

249
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:39,438
motion blur or that the certain things

250
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:42,250
we might want motion blurred we will

251
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:44,419
hack right we're gonna hack those in

252
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,610
because you know look maybe I swing my

253
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:49,278
sword and it has this little blur trail

254
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,750
on it well ok we'll we'll hack that in

255
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,879
but we're not going to try to have

256
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,379
necessarily a robust solution for that

257
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,438
where everything is always motion

258
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:58,879
blurred correctly all the time then we

259
00:09:57,438 --> 00:10:00,469
get down to the sort of thing that we're

260
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,389
actually doing right now and that's what

261
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,059
we will mostly be doing for handmade

262
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:07,250
hero which is the instantaneous problem

263
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:09,558
but it's important to understand that

264
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,350
this is a hack right doing thing

265
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:13,730
instantaneous is as if you had an

266
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,680
infinitely fast shutter so that it

267
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:19,039
opened and closed in just a you know

268
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,479
split-second of time and of course in

269
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,669
the real world you can't even do that

270
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,528
because there aren't enough photons in

271
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:26,958
an instant no you know photons have a

272
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:28,610
speed if something open and closing in a

273
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,928
literally instant of time the film

274
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,360
wouldn't get exposed because no photons

275
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:34,669
would go through the aperture right so

276
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,600
inherently there is no there isn't even

277
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:40,428
a real world analog to what this is the

278
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,399
closest thing I guess you could say is

279
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:45,620
imagine you had a strobe light and and

280
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,600
you could somehow only get the first

281
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,519
bounce of the strobe light and you like

282
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,360
shot it and like capture just those

283
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,159
photons I mean I don't

284
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,509
even know if you could strobe all the

285
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,189
lights in the world and get them to

286
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:57,110
arrive at yeah I don't I don't think

287
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,839
there's any way I can't even make up a

288
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,610
situation in the real world that would

289
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,410
actually produce a reasonable like a

290
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,778
real-world image like I'm looking out at

291
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:07,639
the world and that actually obeyed what

292
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:09,110
we're talking about here so this is

293
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,159
definitely a hack but it's a hack that's

294
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,528
totally fine

295
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,480
you know things often don't move so fast

296
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:16,669
they need much motion blur and like I

297
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,110
said you can always hack in some motion

298
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:19,519
blur over the top of things for things

299
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,149
where you find that it's important and

300
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,149
that's not so bad

301
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:28,669
there's also ways of using the velocity

302
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,589
of objects to do a post pass motion blur

303
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:32,778
for example where you can motion blur

304
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,670
everything and it's just not accurate it

305
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:36,110
doesn't handle like curved motion stuff

306
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:37,219
like that right things always appear to

307
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,389
be moving somewhat literally but again

308
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,160
if the frame rates high enough not so

309
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:41,569
bad so we have plenty of techniques at

310
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,319
our disposal we can use later if we're

311
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,910
too worried about that

312
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,610
so it's you know I don't want you to

313
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:49,219
think it's a super bad limitation that

314
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,450
we don't get to do this in games we have

315
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,950
plenty of techniques our suppose that

316
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:56,509
can compensate for some of this stuff

317
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:58,490
but on the whole is it a hack to do the

318
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:00,828
instantaneous thing absolutely and so

319
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:03,769
it's worth understanding that because

320
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:05,149
later on in your graphics career or

321
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,990
whatever you're doing it's important

322
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:07,220
always have that finger to mind cuz

323
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,720
you're morning like why can't I capture

324
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,190
this effect or what do I need to make

325
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,660
this look better and you want to

326
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,370
understand that that fact that in the

327
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:15,980
real world you're getting motion over

328
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,039
time is accumulating onto the film and

329
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,959
that's what you're actually gonna see

330
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:23,569
you know if you go to see a movie or

331
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,049
anything like that so instantaneous

332
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,778
animation is about being able to take

333
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:32,958
some sort of a function sample it at a

334
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:37,990
time right and we want to produce like

335
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,989
it's essentially a state of the world

336
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:42,139
right so we want to be able to render

337
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,539
the world we want to be able to render

338
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:45,740
it at a time and the way that we you

339
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:47,958
know you could imagine and we have some

340
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,789
function we pass in here's the time that

341
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,689
we want to take a look at everything it

342
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:52,879
tells us where everything in the world

343
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,230
is and then we're just gonna add you

344
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,539
know the next time around you know this

345
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:01,339
is T 0 T 1 is going to be equal to t0

346
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:03,198
plus you know our time step which is one

347
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,889
sixtieth of a second we move it forwards

348
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:06,349
and we

349
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:09,739
we keep going right and then we take it

350
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,119
at time t1 okay so that's essentially

351
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:13,730
what we're trying to do with animation

352
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:16,129
and the important thing to know here is

353
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,980
that usually in games we want the

354
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:22,789
flexibility to sample these functions at

355
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:25,308
arbitrary T meaning we don't just want

356
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:28,129
something that's like f of 0 is

357
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:30,588
something and F of 1 is something and F

358
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:32,869
of 2 like we don't want to have a

359
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:34,040
discrete step that was how old games

360
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:35,540
work in the old days when you had an

361
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:38,389
arcade game were something that it was

362
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:39,198
locked to 60 Hertz on the gun the CRT or

363
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:41,298
something like this

364
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,469
and it would literally just update one

365
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:44,989
sixtieth of a second everything was

366
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,730
hard-coded in what happened in that 60th

367
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:48,350
of a second and you got that you were

368
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,609
talking about literally a discrete thing

369
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,168
here and that makes sense when you don't

370
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,369
have floating-point when you don't have

371
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:54,980
a lot of compute power you know

372
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:57,319
computing power we have that now and so

373
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,438
what we'd rather do is have the ability

374
00:13:57,318 --> 00:14:02,389
to adapt a little bit and the reason for

375
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:05,719
that is we run on multiple you know

376
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:08,028
multiple types of hardware okay we don't

377
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,069
know that our frame rate is 160 it might

378
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:12,110
be 150th in a second it might be pal

379
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:13,729
right or something it might be 130 in a

380
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,438
second because the users machine is too

381
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,730
slow it can't handle 60 frames a second

382
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,078
but we still want to run because it's

383
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,749
okay the game can be playable at 30

384
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:24,708
right maybe the users super crazy about

385
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:27,798
frame 8 they wanted it one 121-125 a

386
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:29,208
second right they 120 frames a second so

387
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:31,039
typically again we want to be able to

388
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:33,109
sample it as a tea and we want to be

389
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,178
able to plug in anything here so we want

390
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,668
to be able to advance our time step in

391
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:40,488
any kind of floating point increment we

392
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:42,110
might want okay and alternative to that

393
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:43,160
you might struck do it you could do an

394
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,769
alternative structure of your system

395
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:47,238
where you had some fundamental quantity

396
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:48,589
that you never went below like let's say

397
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:50,720
one thirtieth of a second is your

398
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,549
fundamental quantity you could then do

399
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,470
it in a discrete way like this and you

400
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:57,379
just say well if I want 120 frames a

401
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,499
second I just do four of these right so

402
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:03,168
you can there there are other ways I'm

403
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:05,778
sorry other other way around if I if I

404
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,249
pick 125 a second and I want one

405
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:10,038
thirtieth of a second I do four of these

406
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:13,369
right and then I could do something this

407
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:15,860
way but in general you know the trend in

408
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:17,509
games most of the time is to have that

409
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,340
system be flexible so you can

410
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:20,779
call it with whatever you want and you

411
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,820
you want to keep it within a certain

412
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,639
boundary so you don't call it with six

413
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:29,060
hours between frames and you don't call

414
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,289
it with 0.000000 one nanoseconds in

415
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:31,879
between frames because it'll fall apart

416
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:34,399
in the floating-point accuracy will just

417
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:36,289
you know explode at that point but

418
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,409
assuming you're within a reasonable

419
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:41,329
range 115th of a second to one six

420
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:44,000
hundredths of a second let's say you're

421
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,879
okay so that's really what we're talking

422
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,919
about here and so what that means is you

423
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,210
know do we have a single function that

424
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,979
produced this say the world well in a

425
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,840
sense we sort of do right we have like

426
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,420
game update and render but really the

427
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,860
actual math functional part of this the

428
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:01,039
things we're actually talking about now

429
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:04,039
what we really have is that giant you

430
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,019
know world function that says what's the

431
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,689
world look like at this point in time is

432
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:11,090
really typically composed of lots of

433
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,760
tiny functions right like maybe I've got

434
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,440
the function here that moves the hero

435
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,529
right and and maybe I've got the

436
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,780
function here that that does the head

437
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,759
Bob right and maybe I've got this much

438
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,709
so you know you've seen this in the code

439
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,049
when we're going to update the world we

440
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,720
have lots and lots of ways of creating

441
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:33,469
these functions over time some of them

442
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,540
are explicit like that hopping spline we

443
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,820
had right remember that one that was an

444
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:42,919
explicit function we actually have in

445
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:46,700
the code in fact if I go here to world

446
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:48,169
mode right here is that actual explicit

447
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,330
function right there's that there's a

448
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:53,000
function just written out exactly that

449
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:57,290
takes an T whatever that T value is 0 to

450
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,389
1 and produces out that that value that

451
00:16:57,289 --> 00:17:04,699
is the location right sum over that way

452
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:06,410
other ones like move entity right they

453
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,570
don't have a way of producing an

454
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,209
absolute position what they actually do

455
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,698
is take one position and a delta and can

456
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:16,009
update right so they are essentially

457
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,860
computing only the first derivative of

458
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:20,359
the function at that time okay and so

459
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:22,009
it's important to understand there's

460
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,569
kind of two ways of doing there's

461
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:25,250
there's two types of functions that we

462
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:27,319
already have and this is very common

463
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,160
right we have functions that allow you

464
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,710
to do a function at time

465
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,779
and an output the exact position at that

466
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,759
time and you can plug in anything you

467
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,589
want here that's like our jump and then

468
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,319
we have other ones that require you to

469
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:42,779
tell it what was the previous position

470
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,509
so this is an input I need to know where

471
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:48,779
I was okay and then what they will

472
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:51,390
compute is not this this is not possible

473
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:53,849
what they will compute instead is what's

474
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,730
the first derivative of the function at

475
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:59,699
that point they will multiply it by the

476
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:02,940
time step and that will produce the new

477
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,319
P okay and this by the way we were

478
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,259
talking about Euler in the pre stream

479
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,599
this is a forward Euler step this is

480
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:12,089
basically saying I have a place I'm at I

481
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,319
have a derivative and I want to multiply

482
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:16,559
the derivative by the time step to get

483
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:19,740
to my new location okay this is

484
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,319
numerical integration it's really really

485
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,059
crappy numerical integration and for

486
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,740
most things in games it's actually fine

487
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,450
because if you don't have any kind of

488
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,000
weird physics going on you don't care

489
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,410
right but that's we have to do and the

490
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,029
reason that we have to do that is again

491
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,769
like I said that function there is no

492
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,359
function for the position of the guy

493
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:38,819
we're moving the stick around changing

494
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,889
is acceleration all the time he's

495
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,839
bumping into things so they're all these

496
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,700
discrete things that are changing so

497
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,539
there's no way to write this whereas

498
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,430
with that hop

499
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,109
well the hop we know when the hop starts

500
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,360
to when the hop ends it's that exact

501
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:53,159
curve we don't have to do any kind of

502
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,439
that updating we can evaluate directly

503
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,210
these are always these nice super

504
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,490
accurate beautiful things when you can

505
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,799
get away with writing an explicit thing

506
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,200
for an animation you're loving life it's

507
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,940
great but just a lot of things we want

508
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,580
to do in games just realistically aren't

509
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,890
that and even these like you saw it's

510
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:13,079
not like it's the whole guys trajectory

511
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,790
that's that way it's only like for one

512
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:16,439
hop and then we've got to do other

513
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:19,559
discrete business to sort of line them

514
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,480
up right and that brings me to the other

515
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,879
thing that I wanted to say which is that

516
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,289
the F of T notation right like this is

517
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,420
the F of T and this produces the world

518
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,730
for us well this is not really true

519
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,039
either typically what happens is this T

520
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,170
there's lots of little T's that actually

521
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,819
are in here there's the there's a T of

522
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,400
the bobbing of the head there's the T of

523
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:42,428
the hopping right and all of these are

524
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,470
sort of these sub little time values

525
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:46,600
we create to do these little parts of

526
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,339
animation which all get evaluated

527
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:50,980
separately and in our code and then they

528
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:52,959
sort of all put out some position that

529
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,960
gets fed up eventually into the state of

530
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,369
the world right so this would be you

531
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,808
know it'd be great if we magically had

532
00:19:57,368 --> 00:20:00,459
some function for the whole world and it

533
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:02,079
was just putting the T and out pops

534
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:06,399
everything and it's all analytical and

535
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,898
direct great but that's not the reality

536
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:09,308
of it so typically what ends up

537
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:13,298
happening when we talk about animation

538
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:17,200
is we talk about lots of functions you

539
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:19,240
know of lots of T's right lots of

540
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,740
different T values and those T values

541
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,460
have very different ranges and all sorts

542
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:27,159
of stuff and so what we do is everything

543
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:30,100
tends to be driven off that state that's

544
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,450
that big delta T like this this F of T

545
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:33,730
like I said it doesn't really exist

546
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,490
instead what happens is we typically

547
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,019
take okay we know what was the time last

548
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,429
frame we know what the time is this

549
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,980
frame right we know how much time has

550
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:43,840
elapsed it's the delta T so what we do

551
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,210
is we feed that delta T down to

552
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,009
everybody and then all these little time

553
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,069
values all throughout the program are

554
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:52,450
all getting updated by that T and all

555
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:54,819
outputting the positions that they need

556
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,288
to some of them are like I said

557
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:59,168
literally doing that they're literally

558
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:00,878
taking T hop and adding delta T to it to

559
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:03,610
produce the new location of the guy they

560
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:07,449
feed that T into a an equation of it

561
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:09,729
right F hop of T hop right and that out

562
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,440
comes the position of the hop right so

563
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,210
that's happening but then other times

564
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,830
that delta T is used in a sort of an

565
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,690
Euler step where we don't know we save

566
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:18,788
the old location of the guy we know his

567
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,320
velocity or we try to compute it we move

568
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:22,720
him by that amount and that's his new

569
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,499
location again an Euler step there it's

570
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,909
not analytic it's not directly computed

571
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:29,909
okay and so typically

572
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:36,699
even though they're all the same kind of

573
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:46,439
unified concept at a high enough level

574
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:50,350
we typically call this physics and this

575
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,240
animation that's just what they

576
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:54,369
typically end up getting called when you

577
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,099
have a function of time that evaluates

578
00:21:54,369 --> 00:22:00,939
the state of something and you can just

579
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:03,038
put in the T and outcomes the state we

580
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,649
typically call that animation we call

581
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:09,460
that animating a character or that's the

582
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:13,209
animation of this character right when

583
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:15,399
we put in just a delta T and we try to

584
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,990
solve for where this thing might have

585
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:19,329
ended up with a bunch of stuff that

586
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:22,569
happened that is what we call physics

587
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:24,638
they are both actually just animation or

588
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:26,648
they are both actually just physics

589
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:29,319
depending on what you want to call them

590
00:22:26,648 --> 00:22:32,408
right they both move a physical thing in

591
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:35,648
a way in some way right according to

592
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:38,769
some rules but we tend to use those two

593
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:42,009
terms in that way in code bases and so

594
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:43,690
you know it's it's intuitive it makes

595
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:45,908
sense right because this is a thing that

596
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,220
seems to be doing movement kind of like

597
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:49,510
physically based or whatever and this is

598
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,298
the kind of thing that's like oh I had

599
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:56,888
the artist like made some key frames and

600
00:22:52,298 --> 00:22:58,629
I'm moving between them right okay so

601
00:22:56,888 --> 00:23:00,459
what we're talking about now when I say

602
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:03,179
animation then at that point is we're

603
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,470
talking about the F of T kind of thing

604
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:07,330
and we're sort of talking about well if

605
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,808
I want to do one of these F of T kinds

606
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:13,388
of things you know what are sort of the

607
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:15,490
techniques that are involved for for

608
00:23:13,388 --> 00:23:16,869
doing these F of T's where I get gets

609
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,620
first to that you saw one of them which

610
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:23,500
was that parabolic arc right B splines

611
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:25,089
are very common one of these right a B

612
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,669
spline like you've seen many times for

613
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:30,209
our what like animation packages use for

614
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:33,399
example if I want to do an F of T equals

615
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:35,380
some like animation curve right like I

616
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:37,538
you know I want like a curve in space

617
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,460
somewhere right and I author these

618
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:41,740
little B spline handles that kind of go

619
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,210
through here you know what I mean and

620
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,399
then I just say as my T

621
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,750
goes upwards it moves along the path of

622
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:49,119
the b-splines right and that's how I

623
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,099
animate a dude similarly you might even

624
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,139
see Euler angles in their four joints

625
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:55,089
right because I want to be able to say

626
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,679
like oh I don't know I've got sort of

627
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:58,928
this this joint here and I've got this

628
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,460
this you know maybe it's let's draw the

629
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:02,740
shoulder of a guy let's say here's his

630
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,840
shoulder coming out here here's his head

631
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,058
up here and whatever and I just want to

632
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,379
talk about like the animating occur for

633
00:24:07,058 --> 00:24:10,178
the rotation of this thing right so

634
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,130
maybe I make a beast line but the B

635
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:15,130
spline is talking about the angle of

636
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:17,260
this joint right blah blah blah blah

637
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:19,000
blah so B splines are kind of the

638
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:20,859
workhorse of animation very typically

639
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,919
and we almost did something like that

640
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:26,168
before with our with our parabola

641
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:30,399
because a parabola obviously a

642
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:32,649
second-order beasts line is a parabola

643
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:34,389
right first order is a line second order

644
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:36,879
you know this is a first order B splines

645
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:40,210
a line second orders a parabola third

646
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,950
order is a cubic right yeah so you're

647
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:47,110
talking about in fact let me draw these

648
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:48,370
for you okay so zeroth order just talk

649
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:50,048
about B splines for just one quick

650
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:51,639
second these are the things seen on the

651
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:54,668
you know all your animation packages

652
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,370
just put this little lower here's the

653
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:58,179
order of my B spline zeroth order is a

654
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:01,418
step function

655
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:04,028
it's basically teleportation right so

656
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:06,220
I'm here and then I'm instantly here I'm

657
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:08,648
here at zero I'm here at one right I'm

658
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,538
here also at point four I'm here also at

659
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:12,009
port four nine nine nine nine nine and

660
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:15,220
then when I'm at point five I'm over

661
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:17,740
here or something right depending on how

662
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,730
I want to sample it obviously but in

663
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,730
general I

664
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:25,298
Italy teleport from one to the other and

665
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:27,548
a zeroth-order base plan a first order B

666
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:29,349
spline is a line a first order B spline

667
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:31,269
is something that does a standard lerp

668
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:32,619
from one to the other at zero I'm here

669
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:33,788
at point five I'm here at one I'm here

670
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:37,178
at point two five I'm here point seven

671
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:42,429
five I'm here right second order B

672
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:48,009
spline is a parabola you know I've got

673
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:49,240
one more point to specify like so in

674
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:51,220
fact you know what the way if I'm

675
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,138
sampling these the same way you would

676
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,920
actually be here all the way up to point

677
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:55,479
nine nine nine

678
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,430
if I'm sampling them the same way I'm

679
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,319
sampling here it would only be once you

680
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,900
get to one that you go to the next

681
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:04,000
b-spline key which is here right this is

682
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,250
actually another key that's kind of

683
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,349
important to mention these are stacked

684
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,390
on top of each other right you know you

685
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:12,009
make these in an art package right you

686
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,759
kind of put one down I'll put my third

687
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:17,349
here you know they make these in our

688
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,569
package right you put one here you got

689
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:25,509
two handles and it kind of does this

690
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:28,299
sort of thing right and here's point

691
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:31,960
zero one two here's three here's you

692
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:33,700
know then here's four five six right and

693
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,840
so these are like the key frames and

694
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,960
these are the tangent handles

695
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:39,129
quote-unquote you know I'm saying so if

696
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,630
I was to do that these are the key

697
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,260
frames here's key frame one here's key

698
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,940
frame

699
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:45,339
I'm sorry here's key frame 0 hears key

700
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,269
frame one here's key frame - well here's

701
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:51,189
keyframes 0

702
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:53,559
and here's key frame 1 over here the

703
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,210
actual endpoint of the spline is going

704
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,559
to be over here as well right so this

705
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,960
guy is actually taking this as the

706
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,190
sample point now so in a parabola the

707
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,509
big difference now when we get the

708
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,240
second order which is why it's the first

709
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:07,269
one you tend to see in much in animation

710
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,279
at all is because now there's actually a

711
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:11,200
point that is not at either keyframe

712
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,329
right we have where we're starting and

713
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,120
where we're going from but we also have

714
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:17,980
an in-between point right and so what we

715
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:20,169
end up drawing doesn't ever touch that

716
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,890
point it's kind of like this sort of a

717
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,840
thing right and then finally for third

718
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,730
order we have cubics which means we can

719
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:31,599
specify two points which means we can

720
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:35,230
actually have a wiggle in there right so

721
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:40,349
we can have this sort of a thing it can

722
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:40,349
actually change direction twice

723
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:45,338
so anyway we'll talk about beasts lions

724
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,479
a little bit more completely later but I

725
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:48,940
just wanted to kind of get that out

726
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:50,440
there the different and well it well it

727
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,778
was kind of something that was coming up

728
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,249
so beef lines are very common one of

729
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:55,749
these right because they're very

730
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:57,278
versatile and you can kind of make

731
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:59,288
anything you want with some kind of a

732
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,358
b-spline and these to generate nice li

733
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:03,038
you can always evaluate a cubic if you

734
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:05,048
want everything your whole program could

735
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,759
evaluate cubics if you want to and just

736
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:09,298
by what's called not doubling which is

737
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:12,009
just repeating values multiple times

738
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:14,459
inside the same cubic you can drop it

739
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:16,628
down to any one of these so a single

740
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,818
animation system built strictly on

741
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:21,608
cubics can actually do parabolas lines

742
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:23,648
and step functions without any without

743
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:26,038
actually doing anything else it'll just

744
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:28,658
automatically work which is kind of nice

745
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,888
so that's kind of a navigator there so

746
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:32,139
anyway that's one of those very

747
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:33,519
versatile functions but just because

748
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:34,748
this is what all animation programs are

749
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,368
always using that's because it's a nice

750
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:38,199
general tool they can give animators and

751
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:39,458
then they can make all sorts of stuff by

752
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:41,288
tuning what the curves are and they're

753
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:42,399
fairly intuitive because people grabbing

754
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:43,449
these handles and moving the curve

755
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,158
around so they seem to be able to do a

756
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:46,269
reasonable job with that so great good

757
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,099
job everyone b-splines

758
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:50,469
but there is nothing special about

759
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:52,689
b-splines animation is literally just

760
00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:54,038
that f of T it's the F of T that

761
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,169
produces the states that we want and

762
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:58,538
that could be formulated as a b-spline

763
00:28:56,169 --> 00:29:01,299
it could be formulated as any function

764
00:28:58,538 --> 00:29:02,739
we want any function at all and you saw

765
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:04,358
me do that yesterday instead of starting

766
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:06,578
with a b-spline I just said I want a

767
00:29:04,358 --> 00:29:08,618
parabola here's their constraints on my

768
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,038
parabola let me solve for what it what

769
00:29:08,618 --> 00:29:11,048
it's gonna be

770
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,788
and out it popped I didn't have to start

771
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:14,888
with the B spline formulation I can get

772
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:16,868
a second-order equation a different way

773
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:19,328
if I want to write so the important

774
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:21,668
thing to remember our animation Sall

775
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:23,709
stuff is just we are trying to make

776
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:25,839
functions of T we can make them any way

777
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:27,249
that we want if we don't know what to do

778
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:28,898
or were confused or we just want

779
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:30,699
something artistic yes we can just throw

780
00:29:28,898 --> 00:29:32,018
a b-spline in there and that you tuned

781
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:34,479
it you know tune those handles do

782
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:36,338
whatever that will work but we can also

783
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:38,469
be more experimental we can be more

784
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:40,448
invested and we can generate any sorts

785
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:42,190
of other functions that we want as long

786
00:29:40,449 --> 00:29:44,259
as they are you know feeding the T and

787
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,509
out comes the state that is the nature

788
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:48,659
of animation and that's where we're at

789
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:48,659
right

790
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:56,369
so let's talk about what we mean by the

791
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:57,329
state part of this now that we know what

792
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:59,219
we're kind of talking about with the F

793
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:01,319
of T because same beast slime is saying

794
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,299
whatever well that's just like arbitrary

795
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,559
scalar values in space or something like

796
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,509
that you know it doesn't really mean

797
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,099
anything until we actually talk about

798
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:09,990
what the kinds of state are that we're

799
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:11,279
trying to generate now obviously we can

800
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,539
generate any kind of state that we want

801
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,279
so we're free to every month there but

802
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,440
the question is in games

803
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,329
what kind of states are we usually

804
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,980
concerned with how do we tend to model

805
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:23,039
the things that we're going to be

806
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,620
animating and usually the way that we do

807
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,420
this is we have some kind of

808
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:28,859
preconceived notion like oh you people

809
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,960
ask me on a stream of time like we kind

810
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:32,429
of have like a you know a skeletal

811
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,490
animation system or stuff like this it's

812
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:39,000
like that is all just sort of like a

813
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:40,650
buzz word nonsense thing don't think

814
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,660
about that do not think about those

815
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:44,970
things at all though those are just like

816
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,710
specific instances of how things get

817
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,870
animated what you want to think of

818
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:52,049
instead is you want to think of just

819
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:53,939
parameter spaces and all of the other

820
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:56,879
ways that you might actually end up

821
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,430
doing something are all just a way of

822
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,560
sort of saying we're just gonna use a

823
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,730
parameter space that looks like this if

824
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,799
I say I'm going to do a skeletal

825
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,569
animation system it means I pre decided

826
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,019
that the kinds of state spaces I was

827
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:13,220
gonna handle look like this right so

828
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:16,379
let's talk about those let's talk about

829
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:23,279
you know the parameters of the state

830
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:24,750
right or the state vector I could also

831
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,750
throw in a physics term here for you

832
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:32,759
which is generalized coordinates Wow

833
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:38,819
handwriting not my strong suit on the

834
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:41,549
Wacom tablet okay so what we want to

835
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:44,579
think about is this F of T produces a

836
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:48,629
state and that state is something it's

837
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:52,609
anything right that we want to represent

838
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:56,400
the world in a way we can render okay

839
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:59,129
now what that means is we are free to

840
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,880
pick the set of parameters that make

841
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,220
sense to us

842
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,770
and it could be anything right now

843
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:09,850
you've sort of seen me do that to a

844
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:12,369
certain extent before right I already

845
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:16,179
have a situation where I talk about the

846
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:22,359
ground point of a guy and the head

847
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:25,029
height right and when I go and compute

848
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:28,359
what this is the head height of the guy

849
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:31,210
is a function of T it was f of T that

850
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,879
Bob value right produces the height of

851
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:37,750
the guy the ground point on the other

852
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:41,370
hand was f of T 0 plus delta T times F

853
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:46,539
of I'm sorry derivative of F at T 0

854
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:52,439
right the ground point was physically

855
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:52,440
simulated the head height was animated

856
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:58,569
and there's my guy right well actually I

857
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:59,950
think I think he didn't have that body

858
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:05,259
right he's just a head floating there

859
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:06,700
right what is this system that I've

860
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:10,150
created is it a skeletal animation

861
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:12,970
system no there's no skeleton there's no

862
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:15,160
bones there's no nothing related to

863
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,259
skeletal animation and if you wanted to

864
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,300
create this in a skeletal animation

865
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:20,829
actually you couldn't the reason that

866
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:23,950
you couldn't is because there's no such

867
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:25,809
thing as head height in a skeletal

868
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,450
animation system what you would have to

869
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:30,970
do instead right is you would have to

870
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:34,480
create a bone which actually has three

871
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:38,019
degrees of freedom XY and Z right or

872
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,089
however many it very least two and then

873
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:45,490
you would have to go ahead and animate

874
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:49,209
that Y position of the bone as if it was

875
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:51,490
the head height right now like I've said

876
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:53,470
you could certainly construct the same

877
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:57,269
effect in a stealth animation system can

878
00:33:53,470 --> 00:34:03,700
you create this no because this bakes in

879
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:07,119
knowledge of the system the code knows

880
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,789
it does not need to simulate a bone for

881
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,069
the displacement of the head off of the

882
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:14,039
ground point and the reason it knows

883
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:17,130
that is because it knows it can only be

884
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:21,750
displaced upwards so it only has to

885
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:23,579
compute one scalar value right so if we

886
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:26,460
were to talk about the state vector of

887
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:31,289
this system the state vector of this

888
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:35,220
system is a four vector right it's the

889
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:39,840
ground point X the ground point Y the

890
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:44,809
ground point Z and the head height okay

891
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,809
so this is the state of the familiar

892
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:52,019
it's a state vector it has four

893
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:55,800
components and that's what they are our

894
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:59,940
job when we simulate the familiar right

895
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:03,630
is to take an F of T zero that's this

896
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:05,550
and produce the F of T one you know the

897
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:08,340
new one that's a new one of these and

898
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:10,800
the way that we chose to do that is by

899
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,450
simulating this part with forward Euler

900
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,670
that's how it moved around and

901
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:17,129
simulating this part with a sine

902
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:21,480
function right it was sine of T Bob or

903
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:25,769
something like that right and that is

904
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:28,190
the nature of animation code you have a

905
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:31,230
state vector the state vector is

906
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:34,519
describing the minimum potentially or it

907
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:38,039
could be it could be fatty but atom at

908
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:41,489
least it must describe the minimum

909
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:47,610
number of state variables necessary to

910
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:50,729
go from nothing to the placement of all

911
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:52,019
of the renderable objects right and

912
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,150
that's what this does

913
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:59,210
once I know these I can produce the

914
00:35:54,150 --> 00:36:02,579
rendering output for this this guy okay

915
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:06,300
so that's what we really need and to be

916
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:08,340
honest we could talk about this you know

917
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,539
let me let me be more explicit with my

918
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,230
anomic later because I'm being a little

919
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:16,409
sloppy here that's not really what that

920
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:20,429
is this is actually the position vector

921
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:23,759
right you could say okay this is

922
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:26,250
actually the vector of that I need to

923
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,380
reproduce my drawing you could argue

924
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,889
that the state

925
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:34,070
if we're really being sort of pedantic

926
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:36,769
here he's actually the gxg yzz yes but

927
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,750
then t-bob that's the actual state that

928
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:40,190
I'm retaining right so you could say

929
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,440
I've got this is the state vector I

930
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:46,610
simulate this vector forwards then I

931
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,679
produce this from it right which is just

932
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:51,140
a copy in the case of these but it's

933
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:54,019
actually a sine function evaluation in

934
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:56,449
case of this right so I update my state

935
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:58,369
vector forward using my Delta time

936
00:36:56,449 --> 00:37:00,319
that's a sine function I'm sorry that's

937
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:03,279
a justice an addition here it's a

938
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,930
simulation step here I then produce this

939
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,519
position vector which is a sine

940
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:09,980
evaluation here and a copy for these

941
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:15,829
guys and then I have the information I

942
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:18,710
need to do my render okay so I don't

943
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:22,069
really know like like how we want to

944
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,480
name these I'd have to look at the

945
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:25,250
robotics literature to de fresh my

946
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,740
memory but those are the in two

947
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,750
important concepts to have I feel like

948
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:35,839
we would probably call this our state

949
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:37,579
vector but you know we could we could

950
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:41,140
call this our generalized coordinate

951
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:43,130
vector because that's what these are

952
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:46,670
they're the coordinates that describe

953
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:48,769
this guy and then we could call this our

954
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:52,579
state you know our state vector I don't

955
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:54,530
know but I feel like I it's been 20

956
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:56,630
years since I read the robotics

957
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:59,480
literature so I don't remember I don't

958
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:01,039
remember well enough the point being

959
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,159
these are the two things that you need

960
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:07,279
to be concerned about in the system and

961
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,299
so if I was to draw it out how this

962
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,690
works

963
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:14,300
we have the stuff that is stored okay

964
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:17,090
and that is for example like I said it's

965
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:20,570
the GX Gy GZ of the ground point and the

966
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:24,980
t-bob we have the stuff that's stored we

967
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:28,280
have then the sort of like render we

968
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:32,030
have the like render input here and

969
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:36,940
that's again the GX Gy GZ and the T

970
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:39,560
that's re and the height head height

971
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,539
each head maybe I don't know what we

972
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:46,130
want to call it I probably it's probably

973
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:48,230
more like H H and mate here we have the

974
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:50,539
render input and then the render input

975
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:52,670
finally goes through one more process to

976
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:58,550
produce that our list of sparse bright

977
00:38:52,670 --> 00:39:00,289
lists right and these we have one thing

978
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,060
which is just the head you know we just

979
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:05,779
have the head record and what actually

980
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:08,119
happens is we take these and we add this

981
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:11,030
so we take that G vector and we actually

982
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,589
add the head height times up basically a

983
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:15,230
fixed vector that we know which is like

984
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:20,860
0 0 1 which is like Z value upwards

985
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:24,619
right does that make sense so this is

986
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,090
this is how animation works you decide

987
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:28,759
what your parameters are that you're

988
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:32,000
storing that drive the animation you

989
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,810
have a way of generating some set of

990
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,289
values from them which are then used to

991
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:41,179
compute this the sort of whole state of

992
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:45,289
whatever the thing is that you're trying

993
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:49,940
to create and render so it's typically

994
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:53,829
this this multi-step process now if I

995
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:59,200
say I want a skeletal animation system

996
00:39:53,829 --> 00:40:04,880
all I'm talking about is essentially

997
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:08,960
regularizing like like I'm talking about

998
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:12,230
essentially putting this this part on or

999
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,480
you know I guess maybe not this part we

1000
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,090
could say this part really at a minimum

1001
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,369
we're talking about basically taking you

1002
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,890
know a pro Krusty's approach to this

1003
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:24,199
we're basically saying from now on the

1004
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:27,589
vendor in you know the actual state that

1005
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:30,199
we're going to create is not gonna be

1006
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:32,870
some arbitrary thing and then have a

1007
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:35,539
function that we wrote that can produce

1008
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:37,460
result you know the the final rendered

1009
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:39,650
position of the sprites instead what

1010
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:43,670
we're going to do is say that everything

1011
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:45,289
always is the exact same right we're

1012
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,420
going to say that we have a concept of a

1013
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:49,759
bone and a bone has particular

1014
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,570
information on it right it's got a

1015
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,170
displaced

1016
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:56,630
like it's got a TX @ ey mtz right it's

1017
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,639
got a rotation in 2d that's just gonna

1018
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,740
be you know a rotation theta it's just

1019
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:05,420
gonna be one one value rotation around

1020
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:07,399
the z axis you might say and then it's

1021
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,680
going to have potentially a scale right

1022
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,530
and we're just gonna say that everything

1023
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,269
has these values and if you needed more

1024
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:17,330
than these values you have to stick more

1025
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:19,250
than one bone on there and if you needed

1026
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:20,509
less than these values well tough we're

1027
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:23,860
just gonna keep storing them anyway

1028
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:26,300
right and that's a totally fine decision

1029
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:29,660
right it's if you want to try and make

1030
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:32,450
that system worse more sort of

1031
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:35,149
streamlined and simple then that's

1032
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:36,889
something you can do but I often find to

1033
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,630
be overly limiting especially in 2d

1034
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:40,519
because usually I want to do stuff like

1035
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,230
use crazy functions that operate on

1036
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:44,780
certain parts of this and I don't really

1037
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,940
want to have to deal with getting at it

1038
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,800
some backwards way like I have the way I

1039
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,440
want this sprite can create it and I

1040
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,940
don't want to have to worry about

1041
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,639
fitting that into this preconceived

1042
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,500
notion of a bone but again a bone is

1043
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:59,239
just saying that well whatever this is

1044
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,699
it's just gonna be an array of these

1045
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:03,349
that's it that's all you get so you did

1046
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:08,929
it better be that because that's what

1047
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:14,329
it's actually gonna be right okay so

1048
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:18,349
yeah so at this point I guess we've got

1049
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:19,150
about 10-15 minutes later or something

1050
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:22,509
so like that

1051
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,510
I'm not sure

1052
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:33,279
hmm at this point hopefully that all

1053
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,480
makes reasonable a sense to you and

1054
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,890
we're already doing it so hopefully you

1055
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,079
should kind of be familiar with how

1056
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:40,659
that's going at this point we now have

1057
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,920
to kind of talk about that that step

1058
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,909
where we actually do the rendering

1059
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,869
because there's some stuff that we need

1060
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:46,029
to do there so if we talk about our

1061
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:49,150
actual handmade hero and how that's

1062
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,500
working and how I want to work we can

1063
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,660
sort of start to talk about how we can

1064
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,670
improve things so for example let's say

1065
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:58,420
that I've got you know that that

1066
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:59,530
parabolic arc here okay and we've got

1067
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,869
that parabolic arc

1068
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:03,760
and the guy is jumping along it so here

1069
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:07,089
he is he's got like a torso here and

1070
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:11,740
he's got a you know he's got like a cape

1071
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:13,059
and that's just moving like this so and

1072
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:14,289
you know what I guess let's not come

1073
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:15,489
with ring will talk about the rendering

1074
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:16,599
whatever the running tomorrow let's

1075
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:17,619
since I've talked all about the

1076
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:18,940
functions in the breakdown of the

1077
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:20,380
functions we'll talk about the running

1078
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,519
tomorrow and maybe I'll actually go do a

1079
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,869
little bit of code in the last 10

1080
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,960
minutes just to sort of show how this

1081
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:27,369
sort of stuff works so what I did right

1082
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,380
is I showed you guys how to write a

1083
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,359
function that was f of T that produces

1084
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:35,410
this parabola right so we did this kind

1085
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:38,079
of a thing and it looks okay right it's

1086
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:39,429
not awful certainly I have played a lot

1087
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,940
of indie games with animation that's

1088
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:44,319
about that quality but we want to do a

1089
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,300
lot better than that right we want to

1090
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,680
look good you know we want to have we

1091
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,940
want this to look professional quality

1092
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,460
we don't want it just like okay it's

1093
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:53,019
sort of moved in whatever and so if we

1094
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,760
look at what's happening here I would

1095
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:56,530
like there to be you know the

1096
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,770
traditional principles of animation are

1097
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:03,940
they have anticipation and

1098
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:05,980
follow-through by the way I should say

1099
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,050
it you know this is separate but every

1100
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,469
programmer who works on it animation

1101
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,470
should have

1102
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:21,788
if you haven't read this book don't work

1103
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,380
on animation like you should read this

1104
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:25,359
book cover-to-cover before you do any

1105
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,220
animation work whatsoever there's no

1106
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,900
question about that so just like that

1107
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:30,219
goes without saying because otherwise

1108
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,289
you just won't understand what your even

1109
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:34,568
your goals are I'm not gonna try and

1110
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:36,760
cover the concepts behind how to

1111
00:44:34,568 --> 00:44:39,099
conceptualize actual animation because

1112
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,869
like I said that's like this huge topic

1113
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:42,760
that's about art and all that stuff but

1114
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:43,809
you should at least take some time from

1115
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,460
yourself with that if you're gonna work

1116
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:47,920
on animation as a programmer to say the

1117
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,690
least I'm just gonna say the terms and

1118
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,068
then show how I'm going to do them I'm

1119
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,740
not gonna try and motivate them by

1120
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:55,739
saying well in 1945 they decided to do

1121
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:57,548
blah and whatever or something and

1122
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,558
that's how they figured out that this

1123
00:44:57,548 --> 00:45:01,210
was important animation and

1124
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:02,619
follow-through are what I was going to

1125
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,429
talk about I sort anticipation and

1126
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:04,900
follow-through as well go time right

1127
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:06,788
here which is that right now what

1128
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,440
happens is there's no ease in or ease

1129
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:11,619
out we just immediately go on this

1130
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,269
parabolic arc right and when we land we

1131
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:15,849
stop immediately so it's just a

1132
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:19,869
perfectly like continuous linear motion

1133
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:22,420
and a little bit of that is correct once

1134
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:24,670
a body enters a ballistic phase it

1135
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,710
doesn't speed up or slow down

1136
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:29,559
other than the gravitational part right

1137
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:31,949
so that's actually somewhat correct once

1138
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:33,819
I jump in the air there's not a lot of

1139
00:45:31,949 --> 00:45:35,528
deceleration or acceleration that's

1140
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:37,778
happening other than my gravitational

1141
00:45:35,528 --> 00:45:40,809
arcs but that's okay what's not okay is

1142
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:42,338
how did I get this upward velocity right

1143
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:44,319
well if you've ever seen someone jump

1144
00:45:42,338 --> 00:45:46,210
again there's the anticipation part of

1145
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:47,889
the of the animation of a jump it's what

1146
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,440
happens in real life I have to kind of

1147
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:53,650
come down and compress my body like a

1148
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,260
spring and then I leap up into the air

1149
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,750
and I use that upward momentum to lift

1150
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:00,309
me off of the ground and so if you look

1151
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:03,760
at what our animation is doing right now

1152
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:05,859
it doesn't look like that right it just

1153
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,329
kind of moves in that arc and it doesn't

1154
00:46:05,858 --> 00:46:13,269
feel it doesn't it doesn't have any feel

1155
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:15,460
of that sort of anticipation so how do

1156
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:18,009
we take an F of T that produces a

1157
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,230
parabola and produce something that has

1158
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:22,809
a little bit of anticipation in it right

1159
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:25,210
how would I do that

1160
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:26,609
well what I want to first talk about is

1161
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:30,329
how to produce

1162
00:46:26,608 --> 00:46:32,818
a subsection of my time step because

1163
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:35,970
this is or my time window because this

1164
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:39,119
is a crucial part of how you code custom

1165
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:40,709
sort of animations stuff like this we

1166
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,579
know that the F of T for our parabola

1167
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:46,380
goes from T equals 0 to T equals 1 what

1168
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:48,509
that means is during my jump it will

1169
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,539
start here at T equals 0 and end here at

1170
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:54,929
T equals 1 and that's all so if I want

1171
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:57,210
to have more time at the beginning of

1172
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:59,460
the parabolic arc to do some anticipate

1173
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:02,338
or e animation of coming down and coming

1174
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,920
back up right well I've got to do

1175
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:06,869
something about this problem I've got to

1176
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,239
do something about the fact that well at

1177
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:11,039
T equals 0 I'm here at T equals anything

1178
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:13,920
other than 0 I've already started my arc

1179
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:16,410
I want to peg the guy at T equals 0 for

1180
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,099
at least you know 0.1 seconds or

1181
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:21,920
something or point one of the of T right

1182
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:25,289
from 0 to 0.1 or something like that I

1183
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,880
need a little bit of room there so if

1184
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:30,569
I'm going to do that what I want to do

1185
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:33,568
is I want to partition my my window of T

1186
00:47:30,568 --> 00:47:38,369
and how do I do that ok well what I do

1187
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:39,960
is I do a map into range we've done this

1188
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:41,220
before we've seen this before actually

1189
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,650
and we've we actually have had that can

1190
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:46,159
even have a function for it right and we

1191
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:49,079
want to do a map into range normalized

1192
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:52,078
ok because what we want to do is say

1193
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,809
well we've got an entire T the T goes

1194
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,269
from 0 to 1 and we want to start

1195
00:47:54,809 --> 00:48:05,269
breaking it up into discrete pieces we

1196
00:47:57,268 --> 00:48:05,268
want to do anticipation ballistic

1197
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:13,369
and and follow-through

1198
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:17,739
colloquially you know this is like this

1199
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:20,659
is the launch and this is the land right

1200
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:23,959
so what I need to do is have some key

1201
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:26,029
values here this is T like jump and this

1202
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,130
is T you know land or something like

1203
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:32,930
that and what I want to do is now

1204
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:35,150
produce three separate T values I want a

1205
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:35,539
T value in here that ranges from zero to

1206
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,670
one

1207
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:39,679
I want a T value in here that ranges

1208
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:41,659
from zero to one and I want to see value

1209
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:45,829
in here that link ranges from zero to

1210
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:50,359
one right and so what I need to do is

1211
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:53,269
take a T that's on my large T timeline

1212
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:56,240
right and maybe a you know in here this

1213
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:58,579
is 0.3 and what I want to do is to go

1214
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:00,889
from there to producing what's this

1215
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:04,130
value right here which is actually

1216
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:07,759
inside this T range is point you know

1217
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:09,260
1/5 or something right and by the way I

1218
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,550
want to know which of these days as I'm

1219
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,620
in I want to know if I'm in phase zero

1220
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:15,230
phase one or phase two right I want to

1221
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:16,880
know which of these ones I'm in so I

1222
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:20,230
want to partition my range and I want to

1223
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,490
get out a value inside that range right

1224
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,920
and so let's take a look at how I might

1225
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:26,079
do that oh well that was good

1226
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,789
accidentally shut off my monitor

1227
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,469
shutting off my monitor is probably not

1228
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:32,059
the best thing to do if I want to do

1229
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:36,279
that because I need to be able to see my

1230
00:49:32,059 --> 00:49:36,279
code in order to actually make it work

1231
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:48,920
all right so let's open up for read and

1232
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:52,280
that's not what I wanted there we go and

1233
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:55,820
I'm gonna open up world mode and I'm

1234
00:49:52,280 --> 00:50:02,150
gonna go ahead and and jump forward to

1235
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:04,700
that part parabolic arc part so here you

1236
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:11,079
can see it and if we go to our math

1237
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:11,079
routines you can see that we've got a

1238
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:19,088
a clamp version of this and it does the

1239
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:20,739
normalization as well so like I said we

1240
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:21,909
already did this we basically here's the

1241
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:24,338
minimum value here's the maximum value

1242
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:28,899
here's the t produce a new thing in that

1243
00:50:24,338 --> 00:50:38,048
range and clamp it for me right so

1244
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:39,759
that's that's what we're doing I'm just

1245
00:50:38,048 --> 00:50:40,929
gonna coat it explicitly in the future

1246
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:42,998
we may want to make an actual system

1247
00:50:40,929 --> 00:50:44,078
that facilitates this sort of thing but

1248
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:47,618
for the moment I'm just gonna write it

1249
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:50,829
out so if we are hopping I guess if I

1250
00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:52,869
want to do my movement T at the at the

1251
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:54,849
beginning here it depends where when we

1252
00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:56,650
want to update this movement I may want

1253
00:50:54,849 --> 00:51:14,199
to update after the fact in fact I think

1254
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:19,150
I probably do go ahead and clamp that

1255
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:21,579
out as well so what I want to do now is

1256
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:24,430
I want to test my T value as I come

1257
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:27,130
through it and I want to see okay if my

1258
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:29,078
T value is less than whatever my you

1259
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:30,670
know mighty jump variable is which is

1260
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:34,329
when I want to leave then I'm in my jump

1261
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:35,920
phase okay if it's less than my teal and

1262
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:40,390
then I'm in my ballistic phase and

1263
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:43,959
otherwise then I'm in my my landing

1264
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:46,778
phase right so we know what we're doing

1265
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:48,429
in our perp in our parabola case we know

1266
00:51:46,778 --> 00:51:50,949
that we're just doing this I guess we

1267
00:51:48,429 --> 00:51:52,058
know we're also always setting the DP to

1268
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:54,430
zero because we don't care about that

1269
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:55,809
either but I know what I'm in my

1270
00:51:54,429 --> 00:51:57,429
ballistic phase that I'm doing this and

1271
00:51:55,809 --> 00:51:59,859
so the only thing I have to do in this

1272
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:01,629
case is I have to modify my T value so I

1273
00:51:59,858 --> 00:52:07,028
can just say well give me my clamped T

1274
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:12,249
value I want you to to map it between T

1275
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:15,579
jump and T land and then I can set T

1276
00:52:12,248 --> 00:52:18,429
jump equal to like that and I can set T

1277
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:20,589
land equal to you know that basically

1278
00:52:18,429 --> 00:52:23,500
point to on either side or something and

1279
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:27,710
now I've done my

1280
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:32,170
my windowing so now if I go and look at

1281
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:32,170
the the jump off it goes

1282
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:38,839
that's pretty funny although I think

1283
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:40,460
that's wrong because it looks like we're

1284
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:45,680
not actually that doesn't seem like it's

1285
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:47,090
properly finishing the arc there which I

1286
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:49,609
guess actually now I think about it is

1287
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:53,360
actually correct because given the small

1288
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:55,250
given how fast the person is jumping if

1289
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,230
we're less than you know in here since

1290
00:52:55,250 --> 00:53:00,019
I'm not setting it when we get to here I

1291
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:03,639
do have to make sure that we we actually

1292
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:07,400
put ourselves down on the the final

1293
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:09,859
location if that makes sense because you

1294
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:12,320
know remember we're not ever evaluating

1295
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,849
it actually peel and we skip over T land

1296
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,160
and get into that range as we're

1297
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:19,610
incrementing so we actually do need to

1298
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:22,190
still I don't know why I restarted this

1299
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:24,170
but so there we go right and now it's

1300
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:27,400
just that windowing is happening but I'm

1301
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:30,170
not doing anything inside those other

1302
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,420
inside those other windows however if I

1303
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:34,519
want to I certainly can write I can

1304
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:37,039
certainly do some more interesting stuff

1305
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:40,759
here and let's think about for a second

1306
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:43,969
what that would be now we don't at the

1307
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:50,090
moment have any concept of the the

1308
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:55,969
height of the what's right I'm looking

1309
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:57,920
for that that Cape there we go we don't

1310
00:53:55,969 --> 00:54:00,589
have any concept of how high the Cape is

1311
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,019
off of the body right we don't actually

1312
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:04,430
know what that is and so what I kind of

1313
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:07,880
want to do is say well okay I'll just

1314
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:09,889
use maybe the t-bob value here to

1315
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,650
control that so what I want to do is I

1316
00:54:09,889 --> 00:54:18,980
want to do a clamp map to range on this

1317
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:21,920
you know this initial jump phase I want

1318
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:26,630
to take it there and I'm gonna say that

1319
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:28,309
the t-bob is gonna kind of go I want it

1320
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,740
to kind of come down and then back up

1321
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:33,409
again right so what I want it to do is I

1322
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:35,509
want it to sort of do almost a sine

1323
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:37,149
pattern right I want to do like back

1324
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:40,090
kind of it

1325
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:41,530
and I don't really know exactly what I

1326
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:43,390
want that to look like because I haven't

1327
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:44,530
thought about it yet but we can sort of

1328
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:46,739
play with that a little bit more so I'm

1329
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:50,110
gonna say that will set the entity t-bob

1330
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:54,189
and you know what I normally I guess we

1331
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:55,660
want the entity t-bob in any case we'll

1332
00:54:54,190 --> 00:55:02,349
just cold set it up here to something

1333
00:54:55,659 --> 00:55:04,269
like zero and then I want that NDT Bob

1334
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:07,179
to be some parameter that I can use to

1335
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:08,980
drive that displacement so the T Bob in

1336
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:11,109
this case I'll just say that well you

1337
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:19,440
know sine if you think about what sine

1338
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:27,420
does right here's our unit circle right

1339
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:32,980
so cosine of 0 is 1 and sine of 0 is 0

1340
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:34,720
and it goes up to 1 over this arc so if

1341
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:38,650
I wanted to capture this arc of going

1342
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:41,739
from 0 back to 0 as a sign right I would

1343
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:48,130
just say sine of my T value but this is

1344
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:51,099
PI radians right or 1/2 tau depending on

1345
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:54,640
how you want to do it right so T times

1346
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:56,739
pi is actually going to mean from if T

1347
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:59,529
ranges from 0 to 1 that will give me

1348
00:55:56,739 --> 00:56:02,679
that that sort of a bob it will go from

1349
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:04,720
0 to 1 to sit back to 0 so I'm gonna I'm

1350
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:08,889
gonna use that I'm gonna use the fact

1351
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:12,480
that we have that ability to go ahead

1352
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:17,230
and set the the T Bob value to be T

1353
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,880
times pi and then I've got that that

1354
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:20,710
jump that I was looking for right that

1355
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,510
sort of that sort of springiness so all

1356
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:26,590
I have to do now is when I actually draw

1357
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:31,090
this this hero body all I have to do is

1358
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:32,620
actually use that T Bob now and I guess

1359
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:34,120
I don't really know exactly we probably

1360
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:36,909
want to go upwards so I should probably

1361
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:38,829
say like oh okay you know this is

1362
00:56:36,909 --> 00:56:42,690
actually going to be you know entity T

1363
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:44,799
Bob and it's I don't want to move it

1364
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:47,380
well we'll just let that be in regular

1365
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,380
coordinates I suppose and so when I come

1366
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:52,278
up here and

1367
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:56,329
I'm gonna adjust this guy we can say

1368
00:56:52,278 --> 00:56:57,588
that I'm moving him down right and I

1369
00:56:56,329 --> 00:57:01,180
probably don't want to move them down

1370
00:56:57,588 --> 00:57:05,328
too much we'll see how that goes

1371
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:13,338
did I set the right thing I set the

1372
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:14,329
wrong thing I wanted Cape yeah and the

1373
00:57:13,338 --> 00:57:15,828
other thing that we should probably do

1374
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:17,630
is as we start to work on this I'm gonna

1375
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:19,160
slow it down quite a bit so that I can

1376
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,960
see what's happening because that'll

1377
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:22,250
make it easier for us to debug it's

1378
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,900
going so fast right now I can't even

1379
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:29,420
really see what's going on which you

1380
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:31,930
know mm-hmm doesn't help so here when we

1381
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:40,068
do our update I'm gonna go ahead and

1382
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:42,078
slow it down 6x from where it was so you

1383
00:57:40,068 --> 00:57:43,818
can you can already kind of see that we

1384
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,259
got a sorted so we want the Cape on top

1385
00:57:43,818 --> 00:57:46,730
by the way and I should make sure that

1386
00:57:45,259 --> 00:57:53,179
that's happening as well so you can kind

1387
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:58,250
of see it I'm almost out of time so so

1388
00:57:53,179 --> 00:58:02,179
here's our t-bob of this dude and yeah

1389
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:05,000
at the moment do we get to pass a sort

1390
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:09,440
bias into this thing I don't really

1391
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,268
remember we shouldn't have had to the

1392
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,838
most of the problem with this is just

1393
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:16,518
that our art assets are stacked on top

1394
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:18,768
of each other unfortunately and I wish

1395
00:58:16,518 --> 00:58:21,828
they weren't because I would rather it

1396
00:58:18,768 --> 00:58:23,479
be displaced upward I'll just put this

1397
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:27,369
in here for now but that will come back

1398
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,369
to bite us in a second unfortunately

1399
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:33,380
so do you see how that sort of adds this

1400
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:35,440
little bit of of niceness to it already

1401
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:38,720
even though we haven't done anything

1402
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:41,318
much at all just having that little bit

1403
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,959
makes it look more like it's jumping now

1404
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:47,739
unfortunately it's not quite what I

1405
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,329
would want because there should be some

1406
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:52,909
continuation of that motion so when I'm

1407
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:56,000
in the t jump range actually what I want

1408
00:58:52,909 --> 00:59:02,318
to do is set this t-bob to be a little

1409
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:05,719
bit I want this to be a little bit more

1410
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:08,838
traffic of what I'm what I'm trying to

1411
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:10,548
say here I want it to carry through so I

1412
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:12,440
kind of want all of these things to sort

1413
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:14,420
of be active at the same time in some

1414
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:20,358
sense so what I really want to say here

1415
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:27,289
is I kind of want to say if T is is you

1416
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:32,630
know less than T mid or something like

1417
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:34,519
this and I'm not sure what I want to

1418
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:36,769
Matt to be but I really want to say is

1419
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:44,210
if T is less than T made then I'm gonna

1420
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:48,199
do this thing right and I want it to be

1421
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:49,730
able to overlap and what I'm gonna do is

1422
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:52,039
I'm gonna let it I'm gonna let it come

1423
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:54,858
down come back up and then come back

1424
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:56,808
down again so it has a full range so I'm

1425
00:59:54,858 --> 01:00:01,960
gonna actually let it go for all of tau

1426
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:01,960
and I'm gonna let that that jump happen

1427
01:00:02,588 --> 01:00:06,489
but you know what I'm not going to do

1428
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:20,800
I am got to make sure this to you I came

1429
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:23,860
after a tea jump and teal and so that

1430
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:28,170
should clamp properly to zero which

1431
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:28,170
means we should stay at movement from I

1432
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:40,600
feel like that should have been right

1433
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:45,329
actually I'm not sure why it wasn't a my

1434
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:45,329
mapping this wrong T jump to teal and ah

1435
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:55,480
right I forgot I can't overwrite my tea

1436
01:00:51,219 --> 01:01:03,219
like that right so this actually has to

1437
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:06,400
be this sort of thing I was taking

1438
01:01:03,219 --> 01:01:07,989
advantage of the else miss of it all but

1439
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,519
you can't do that right if I'm gonna

1440
01:01:07,989 --> 01:01:11,529
clamp these values and if I'm gonna let

1441
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:13,800
them overlap I'm not allowed to do that

1442
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,800
anymore

1443
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,869
and so do you see how that kind of looks

1444
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,700
a lot more like a jump now already even

1445
01:01:27,869 --> 01:01:35,429
though we haven't really done much to it

1446
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:38,609
just having that having that happen is

1447
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:40,859
just much nicer right and so similarly

1448
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:43,470
what I can do now on the landing is do

1449
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:46,320
exactly the same thing I can sort of

1450
01:01:43,469 --> 01:01:49,039
carry that through where I take the same

1451
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:52,559
procedure we did here and this time

1452
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:56,690
we're just going to play it from that

1453
01:01:52,559 --> 01:02:01,139
teal and all the way out till the end

1454
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:01,860
like so and so again really really

1455
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:04,379
straightforward

1456
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:06,510
nothing nothing particularly crazy there

1457
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,150
but now it just gives us like a little a

1458
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:11,640
little kind of bump oh and I don't want

1459
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:15,110
I only want half I don't want a full

1460
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:15,109
oscillation on that one

1461
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:27,070
so the other thing that we probably

1462
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:29,420
would want to do is we would want to

1463
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:32,150
allied this jump

1464
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:34,280
so the t-bob part will probably want to

1465
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:35,510
make if if you happen to be landing and

1466
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,850
you're gonna do an immediate jump

1467
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:39,470
afterwards you'd get double oscillation

1468
01:02:37,849 --> 01:02:41,119
in here so what we want to do is

1469
01:02:39,469 --> 01:02:42,199
actually alive that as well if you're

1470
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,889
going to be doing another jump

1471
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:44,359
afterwards

1472
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:46,609
I'm out of time so we won't try to do

1473
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,890
that now but that's basically you know

1474
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:50,180
what we would would want to do so I'm

1475
01:02:48,889 --> 01:02:57,170
gonna see what happens if we speed this

1476
01:02:50,179 --> 01:03:02,569
back up again to a faster jump over I

1477
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:05,059
gotta put an F in there I don't know why

1478
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,890
I got to figure out why we are able to

1479
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:09,289
jump outside of there I'm not really

1480
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:13,039
sure why we haven't looked at that stuff

1481
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:15,949
not yet but we're getting much closer to

1482
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,860
a real sort of jump the speed at which

1483
01:03:15,949 --> 01:03:21,379
the jump has to happen is a little bit

1484
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,820
is a little bit much and so what I mate

1485
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,140
what I'll probably do too is I'll

1486
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:27,740
probably move some of that animation

1487
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:30,139
into the actual pre movement code so

1488
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:34,159
that as you move the head it squishes

1489
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:36,980
down right so like as I gets ready to

1490
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:39,980
jump as I as I kind of move away and

1491
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,929
then it jumps so I may actually not need

1492
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:43,280
to do as much windowing there I may

1493
01:03:41,929 --> 01:03:45,829
actually move those out into the other

1494
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:49,910
state but I just kind of wanted to show

1495
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:53,829
you how to do that to start with right

1496
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:53,829
so I'm gonna go ahead and go to the QA

1497
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,780
now we should also do

1498
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:55,920
the Cizek what's the difference between

1499
01:04:47,489 --> 01:05:02,699
B splines and Bezier curves so I will I

1500
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:04,470
will draw it here so to start with the

1501
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:08,549
difference in terms of the curves they

1502
01:05:04,469 --> 01:05:13,500
produce is there is no difference so a

1503
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:16,410
Bezier curve and a b-spline curve are

1504
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:19,949
actually the exact same curve it's just

1505
01:05:16,409 --> 01:05:26,159
how the knots are phrased and I'll sort

1506
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:27,929
of a not in a control point you might

1507
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:29,099
hear me use kind of interchangeably and

1508
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:32,460
that's because they are interchangeable

1509
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:33,630
when you're talking about a b-spline but

1510
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,150
they're not as interchangeable we're

1511
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:39,300
talking about bezzie a a knot or like

1512
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:41,070
the t values at which your control

1513
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:44,160
points occur and control points are the

1514
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:46,800
positions along the curve so for example

1515
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:54,929
I don't know why I drew these under

1516
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:56,610
Bezier probably not so smart so if you

1517
01:05:54,929 --> 01:06:00,230
imagine let's say I was going to do a

1518
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:00,230
curve kind of like the one I had before

1519
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:10,170
so here are the points that I've

1520
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:17,070
specified and here's the curve that I'm

1521
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:24,090
drawing okay so what happens here is

1522
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:24,900
these are control points and maybe I

1523
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:27,000
shouldn't

1524
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:30,000
I'll save displaying not still after I

1525
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,400
say the b-spline thing so if I'm talking

1526
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,460
about a Bezier curve then the number of

1527
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:38,579
Bezier curves in this in this example is

1528
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:43,440
actually two and the number of b-spline

1529
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:44,429
curves is only one and as I can't get

1530
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,220
this sir

1531
01:06:44,429 --> 01:06:48,779
and so what we're talking about when we

1532
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:50,909
talk about bezier curve versus b-spline

1533
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:54,060
curve is the fact that a Bezier curve is

1534
01:06:50,909 --> 01:06:57,750
a fixed curve with a number of points

1535
01:06:54,059 --> 01:07:00,960
equal to its order plus one so if I have

1536
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:03,119
a third order bezzie a which is the kind

1537
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,480
you normally have I'll put this in the

1538
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:09,750
middle I guess if I have a third order

1539
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:12,869
bezzie a then the number of points it

1540
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:15,210
has control points is for this one this

1541
01:07:12,869 --> 01:07:17,460
one this one and this one are the

1542
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:22,619
control points of the first Bezier curve

1543
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:24,690
okay and this is it's its arc then

1544
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:26,940
there's another bezier curve which is

1545
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:30,139
this one this one this one and this one

1546
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:33,750
right which is another four points and

1547
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:35,339
this is its arc what you do with busy

1548
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:39,119
occurs if you want them to chain

1549
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:41,910
together is you set the control point

1550
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,079
that's one before that like essentially

1551
01:07:41,909 --> 01:07:44,969
the tant the one they would call the

1552
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:47,819
tangent handle the control point that's

1553
01:07:44,969 --> 01:07:50,879
one before the point that you end on you

1554
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:54,840
set that to be exactly opposite and the

1555
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:57,059
same length away as the first tangent

1556
01:07:54,840 --> 01:08:00,090
handle in the next Bezier curve you're

1557
01:07:57,059 --> 01:08:02,909
trying to line up and you set the final

1558
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:06,510
point and the first point of the two

1559
01:08:02,909 --> 01:08:10,108
curves to be coincident right so this is

1560
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:13,770
zero one two three of this first curve

1561
01:08:10,108 --> 01:08:15,840
and it's also zero one two three of the

1562
01:08:13,769 --> 01:08:17,100
second curve three and zero are the same

1563
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:20,270
point here and further

1564
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:24,600
in order to make this continuous curve

1565
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:27,780
two and one in these cases here have to

1566
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:34,800
be exactly opposed right so to state it

1567
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:36,449
mathematically if this is a b c then

1568
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:42,210
what i'm talking about is the fact that

1569
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:46,939
a minus b which is that vector there has

1570
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:52,109
to be exactly equal to c minus the B

1571
01:08:46,939 --> 01:08:56,009
right and then a you know another way to

1572
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:58,710
state that would obviously be if I

1573
01:08:56,010 --> 01:09:05,940
wanted to know what this value was here

1574
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:10,380
the C value it's a weight did I do that

1575
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:14,309
right I did that wrong negative C minus

1576
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:17,100
B right so it's a minus B equals

1577
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:18,270
negative C minus B right because they

1578
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:21,539
have to be pointing the opposite

1579
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:25,950
directions of each other and so a minus

1580
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:27,840
B equals negative C plus B right or if I

1581
01:09:25,949 --> 01:09:29,880
want to consolidate and I'm like I have

1582
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,650
my a and I want and my B and I want to

1583
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,739
know what that C value is right then

1584
01:09:31,649 --> 01:09:42,359
I've got a minus 2 B equals negative C

1585
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:43,769
or C equals 2 B minus a okay so that's

1586
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:45,509
Bezier curves and so what you're doing

1587
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:47,490
with Bezier curves if you want to make a

1588
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:49,110
long curve you have to keep stacking

1589
01:09:47,489 --> 01:09:50,909
them on top of each other stack stack

1590
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:53,639
stack stack stack and if you wanted to

1591
01:09:50,909 --> 01:09:55,319
be continuous which you normally do you

1592
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,940
have to always obey this and so these

1593
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:58,019
handles are locked now in a drawing

1594
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:00,059
program you've seen this it's called

1595
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:02,520
lock tangent handles and you can unlock

1596
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:05,130
them to make a bend a crease in the

1597
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,240
curve right and so what happens when you

1598
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,670
make a crease in the curve is when you

1599
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:10,109
stop obeying that thing because at that

1600
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:12,659
point because these are two totally

1601
01:10:10,109 --> 01:10:14,309
separate curves they will the second one

1602
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:15,479
will start out in a directions totally

1603
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:18,560
different from the one that the first

1604
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:18,559
one ended in right

1605
01:10:20,908 --> 01:10:25,979
and with a third-order curve you can

1606
01:10:24,448 --> 01:10:28,049
actually have the directions be the same

1607
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:29,759
but the accelerations are different

1608
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:32,550
right and that's what would happen if I

1609
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:35,130
kept these as in line but I made like

1610
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:36,630
this one longer right so this one would

1611
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,250
would you would still see a sort of

1612
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:40,380
second order it wouldn't be a perfectly

1613
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:42,869
true curve it would still it wouldn't

1614
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:44,219
like bet it wouldn't kink but it would

1615
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:48,149
like you could see that there was a

1616
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:50,908
second order change all right so what's

1617
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:54,210
a b-spline that's a bezier a b-spline

1618
01:10:50,908 --> 01:10:57,359
curve is if you pre solve for this stuff

1619
01:10:54,210 --> 01:11:00,989
right if you just say I'm always going

1620
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:03,630
to be continuous so I'm just gonna say

1621
01:11:00,988 --> 01:11:08,519
hey you know what I'm gonna specify this

1622
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:10,800
this this this and this right and I'm

1623
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:13,440
gonna keep going and I just want my

1624
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,940
curves to kind of come all through

1625
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:17,519
together I just want them all to be

1626
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:23,029
control points right so what you do

1627
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:27,360
instead of at you you in the Bezier case

1628
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:29,488
you end on the on one of your control

1629
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:30,899
points right you start on one control

1630
01:11:29,488 --> 01:11:33,750
point you end on another control point

1631
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:36,869
in a b-spline curve you only that's

1632
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:39,539
still true for the very end but all the

1633
01:11:36,869 --> 01:11:41,670
the rest of the way through you actually

1634
01:11:39,539 --> 01:11:43,229
don't ever do that so you you would

1635
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,940
place your control points and the curve

1636
01:11:43,229 --> 01:11:46,738
would never quite hit it so if I

1637
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:51,149
actually had the exact same control

1638
01:11:46,738 --> 01:11:52,709
points I didn't modify them right if I

1639
01:11:51,149 --> 01:11:54,689
actually fed the exact same control

1640
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:57,029
points in and didn't double this one

1641
01:11:54,689 --> 01:11:59,549
anymore so I isn't two anymore it's just

1642
01:11:57,029 --> 01:12:02,219
one control point I started out here and

1643
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:06,060
I kind of like pass through these guys

1644
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:09,329
you know like that kind of a thing right

1645
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:15,170
if I doubled this guy again then I would

1646
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:15,170
hit him but you don't want to do that

1647
01:12:15,469 --> 01:12:20,250
actually is that true I'm sorry no you

1648
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:21,929
would not hit him you'd have to triple

1649
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:25,079
him if you actually wanted to hit him I

1650
01:12:21,929 --> 01:12:26,760
believe because it would be a yeah I

1651
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:29,369
think you definitely a triple him that's

1652
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,199
neither here nor there so what a

1653
01:12:29,369 --> 01:12:33,929
b-spline does is it basically solves for

1654
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:34,379
this a priori and says I'm gonna write

1655
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:37,109
the

1656
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:39,659
of a curve that just continues to flow

1657
01:12:37,109 --> 01:12:42,059
through its control points without ever

1658
01:12:39,658 --> 01:12:44,670
touching any of them until the very last

1659
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:46,980
one right so it's as if you had a

1660
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:49,289
b-spline as if you had a bezier curve

1661
01:12:46,979 --> 01:12:53,689
that lasted for many many many many many

1662
01:12:49,289 --> 01:12:56,429
many many many many control points and

1663
01:12:53,689 --> 01:12:59,129
the way that they do that is just by pre

1664
01:12:56,429 --> 01:13:02,368
solving these equations to essentially

1665
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:04,770
turn around the the phrasing of the of

1666
01:13:02,368 --> 01:13:07,348
the curve so that you're sort of saying

1667
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:11,250
well when I'm between this curve when

1668
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:13,980
I'm evaluating T between here and here

1669
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:17,578
right what I'm actually going to do is

1670
01:13:13,979 --> 01:13:19,919
evaluate this Bezier effectively when

1671
01:13:17,578 --> 01:13:22,979
I'm between here and here I'm going to

1672
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,960
evaluate this Bezier so I switched up

1673
01:13:22,979 --> 01:13:27,779
which points I was doing before I

1674
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,250
finished actually even tracing out what

1675
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:31,349
the first busy would have been I'm

1676
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:33,359
shifting to the next Bezier and then the

1677
01:13:31,349 --> 01:13:35,699
next one and the next one right so a

1678
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:38,549
b-spline constantly moves the frame

1679
01:13:35,698 --> 01:13:40,529
forward through time to avoid you ever

1680
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:43,949
getting to the end until you get to the

1681
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:46,170
last knot they are exactly the same

1682
01:13:43,948 --> 01:13:48,839
curve equations though so the kinds of

1683
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:50,699
curves you produced with either-or are

1684
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,860
exactly the same and you can take a

1685
01:13:50,698 --> 01:13:54,448
bezzie a and fit it to a b-spline and

1686
01:13:52,859 --> 01:13:57,469
fit up these fine to busy and they will

1687
01:13:54,448 --> 01:14:00,210
be exact so it's there isn't any

1688
01:13:57,469 --> 01:14:03,029
difference in the actual curve the only

1689
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:05,069
difference is how you are actually like

1690
01:14:03,029 --> 01:14:06,658
controlling that curve how you actually

1691
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:08,729
what the control points actually mean

1692
01:14:06,658 --> 01:14:10,920
and which ones you specify is what

1693
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:12,629
changes so if I have a base my looks

1694
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:16,590
like this I've a Bezier looks like this

1695
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:18,118
they you know the same control points

1696
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:19,739
set into both of them won't produce the

1697
01:14:18,118 --> 01:14:21,179
same curves but there is a set of

1698
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:22,649
control points that I could feed into

1699
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:24,000
one that would produce the same curve as

1700
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:27,319
some other set of control points in

1701
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,319
another that makes sense

1702
01:14:42,429 --> 01:14:45,949
beginners perspective it seems that in

1703
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:47,300
software rendering keeping milliseconds

1704
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:48,559
per frame in a certain controlled

1705
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,789
boundary as someone in the program was

1706
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,110
controlled depending on the code quality

1707
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:52,340
and orientation to her performance does

1708
01:14:51,109 --> 01:14:53,479
that become more difficult when going to

1709
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:54,940
Hardware rendering with drivers

1710
01:14:53,479 --> 01:14:58,129
territory or is it the other way around

1711
01:14:54,939 --> 01:15:00,138
I would say it's actually hard in both

1712
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:01,730
because in one case you don't know what

1713
01:15:00,139 --> 01:15:03,949
CPU you're running on and that's kind of

1714
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:05,059
a little bit difficult but in the other

1715
01:15:03,948 --> 01:15:06,019
case you don't know what GP you're

1716
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:08,150
running on and so it's the same

1717
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:10,190
difficulty in both cases you're just

1718
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:13,670
it's really hard on a PC that's why

1719
01:15:10,189 --> 01:15:16,009
people oftentimes enjoy program consoles

1720
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:17,810
is because it's one piece of hardware so

1721
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:19,460
you know you do have a lot of control

1722
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:21,679
you're like we know that if we do these

1723
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:23,300
things it will work right we don't have

1724
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,840
to wonder about what will happen on this

1725
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:28,190
GPU or that GPU or this CPU or that CPU

1726
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,539
duty basement one are we going to do any

1727
01:15:28,189 --> 01:15:32,149
compression on the image or only

1728
01:15:29,539 --> 01:15:36,618
movement of the torso will we're going

1729
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:39,079
to have to stretch the Cape to two to

1730
01:15:36,618 --> 01:15:41,408
reach the head so that that's gonna have

1731
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:41,408
to happen

1732
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:51,720
f SJS I'm I don't really discuss game

1733
01:15:49,229 --> 01:15:54,079
design stuff on the stream so I'm gonna

1734
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,079
skip that one

1735
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:09,020
is it possible to create animations like

1736
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:10,789
Looney Tunes we're looking at still

1737
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,989
frames you could see multiple heads and

1738
01:16:10,789 --> 01:16:14,060
limbs or features that are extremely

1739
01:16:11,988 --> 01:16:16,639
exaggerated distorted somehow it still

1740
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:18,410
looks fine in motion smear animation is

1741
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:23,719
a term I could find in 30 seconds of

1742
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:25,909
googling I'm not sure exactly what

1743
01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:30,590
you're asking about you're talking about

1744
01:16:25,909 --> 01:16:33,819
just like multiple static frames and the

1745
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:33,819
answer is yes you can totally do that

1746
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:58,429
looks like we're out of cues

1747
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:21,199
yes we're out of cues except for let's

1748
01:17:18,328 --> 01:17:21,198
see here

1749
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:34,340
why not use Java instead of C I feel

1750
01:17:33,109 --> 01:17:36,049
like I've covered this lots and lots of

1751
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:39,679
times

1752
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:46,520
so I guess my my sort of base question

1753
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:50,630
would be named the professional 3d game

1754
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:54,170
engines or really named any professional

1755
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:58,219
engine written in Java and the answer is

1756
01:17:54,170 --> 01:18:03,399
there aren't any right Frostbite not

1757
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:08,929
Java unreal not Java unity not Java

1758
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:10,460
destinies engine not Java and so if you

1759
01:18:08,929 --> 01:18:11,599
want to program in games and you're

1760
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,920
trying to get a job programming games

1761
01:18:11,599 --> 01:18:16,099
and the only thing you know how to

1762
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:18,199
program is Java you're not gonna get a

1763
01:18:16,099 --> 01:18:19,909
job on an engine team if you want to

1764
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:21,819
program little toy games or whatever and

1765
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:25,448
that's you know you're happy doing that

1766
01:18:21,819 --> 01:18:28,219
or you just you know don't care about

1767
01:18:25,448 --> 01:18:30,769
you know sort of advanced game engine

1768
01:18:28,219 --> 01:18:32,719
programming then that's fine you can use

1769
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:36,349
any language you want right because it

1770
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:43,279
doesn't matter you could use Python you

1771
01:18:36,349 --> 01:18:45,619
could use PHP if you wanted to right but

1772
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:47,269
the answer is high end game engine

1773
01:18:45,618 --> 01:18:49,639
programming is never done in Java ever

1774
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:51,469
under any circumstances most games

1775
01:18:49,639 --> 01:18:53,270
aren't written in Java either even if

1776
01:18:51,469 --> 01:18:55,670
they're not high end so you know there's

1777
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:57,050
there's a minecraft witch whose

1778
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:58,639
performance is abhorrent even though

1779
01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:02,090
they're not even doing anything in the

1780
01:18:58,639 --> 01:19:05,389
game hmm is written in Java but at least

1781
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:06,770
I guess it works but that's like one of

1782
01:19:05,389 --> 01:19:08,239
the only games you can even think of

1783
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:09,619
it's written in it so even most time

1784
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:12,439
people don't like if a lot of games are

1785
01:19:09,618 --> 01:19:14,149
written in c-sharp nowadays because like

1786
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:15,738
there's the XNA framework and unity

1787
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:17,779
obviously is also kind of like has

1788
01:19:15,738 --> 01:19:19,879
c-sharp on top of it so that's kind of

1789
01:19:17,779 --> 01:19:22,368
more of if you were going to program in

1790
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,809
Java I don't know why you would ever

1791
01:19:22,368 --> 01:19:26,769
actually program a game in Java because

1792
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:30,349
it seems like c-sharp is more the the

1793
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:32,090
picking kind of supported platform for

1794
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:33,949
gaming you have a lot of choices for

1795
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:36,840
engine stuff in whatever where's Java

1796
01:19:33,948 --> 01:19:40,169
you've you've really got nothing

1797
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,699
that I know of unless you know maybe

1798
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:43,380
it's like a mobile game on Android or

1799
01:19:41,699 --> 01:19:46,920
something since that's kind of a Java II

1800
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:48,569
platform but so the you know all of that

1801
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:51,090
is whatever you know do whatever you

1802
01:19:48,569 --> 01:19:52,109
want to do but as far as like why we

1803
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,340
don't use Java in the stream it's

1804
01:19:52,109 --> 01:19:55,409
because this stream is for people to

1805
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:58,020
learn how to be game engine programmers

1806
01:19:55,409 --> 01:20:00,210
and there are no gaming engine

1807
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:05,190
programmers who like there are no game

1808
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:06,869
engines that get written in Java so you

1809
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:09,269
know it would be useless for me to teach

1810
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:09,809
nobody wants that no one's gonna hire

1811
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:12,350
you

1812
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:12,350
right

1813
01:20:21,418 --> 01:20:27,010
Jay monkey and LW j GL are professional

1814
01:20:25,269 --> 01:20:29,889
open square stars are in Java just named

1815
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:32,769
a couple no engines meaning game engines

1816
01:20:29,889 --> 01:20:35,288
those aren't game engines that anyone

1817
01:20:32,769 --> 01:20:38,498
actually uses like go but what game can

1818
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:41,378
you buy name any game on the seat like

1819
01:20:38,498 --> 01:20:48,248
that's in been in the steam top 50 right

1820
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:50,050
its engine is not Java right where will

1821
01:20:48,248 --> 01:20:52,738
you go to work at which game company

1822
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:55,329
do you believe you would be working on

1823
01:20:52,738 --> 01:20:59,859
an engine that's written in Java there

1824
01:20:55,328 --> 01:21:01,719
aren't any it just doesn't happen you

1825
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:03,069
know it's like it'd be like Zynga or

1826
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:04,689
something would be where you would be

1827
01:21:03,069 --> 01:21:05,948
working if you're talking about Java

1828
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:11,289
game engines they're like these little

1829
01:21:05,948 --> 01:21:12,549
toy things they're not the serious you

1830
01:21:11,288 --> 01:21:15,668
know they're just not the serious engine

1831
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:21,010
and and you know maybe you could you

1832
01:21:15,668 --> 01:21:23,679
know you know again c-sharp is kind of

1833
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:25,119
one of those things that's that's a

1834
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:32,800
little more relevant because a lot of

1835
01:21:25,118 --> 01:21:36,238
those work but in them

1836
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:38,529
a lot of those work in like in the Unity

1837
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:41,828
pipeline or some people write games and

1838
01:21:38,529 --> 01:21:48,569
XNA like I think like Bastion was

1839
01:21:41,828 --> 01:21:48,569
written in XNA and Fez

1840
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:07,670
hoopla probably time to just take

1841
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,789
questions from the handmade Network IRC

1842
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:15,220
uh yeah I don't actually know how to get

1843
01:22:10,789 --> 01:22:15,220
on that RC yet I should

1844
01:22:56,050 --> 01:23:01,729
in order strips the body to the head

1845
01:22:58,908 --> 01:23:07,399
will be the infant shearing probably not

1846
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:11,409
shearing I don't know we could but I

1847
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:11,408
think sharing would be would be rough

1848
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,110
what would your ideal game programming

1849
01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:24,130
languages like it be very meta

1850
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:24,130
programming oriented

1851
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:45,760
have you seen this video on ooby's

1852
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:51,479
Rayman 2d animation editor hmm hmm no I

1853
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:51,480
haven't but I would like to

1854
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:03,539
oh my god there is a wall of buttons

1855
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:06,439
I'll have to look at that later it looks

1856
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:06,439
pretty involved

1857
01:24:24,519 --> 01:24:27,679
so says the kid well the animation

1858
01:24:26,689 --> 01:24:30,459
function eventually we have that so

1859
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:33,590
other entities can use them yeah

1860
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:36,248
Gaston vive is it recommendable to mix

1861
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:38,599
vector and raster graphics for a game I

1862
01:24:36,248 --> 01:24:40,130
would say that you know it depends on

1863
01:24:38,599 --> 01:24:43,340
the circumstances there's certainly no

1864
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:44,569
reason you can't do it but you know

1865
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:47,479
whether it's appropriate for your

1866
01:24:44,569 --> 01:24:49,248
situation is going to depend David Rosen

1867
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:50,599
it will fire had a GDC talk on page or

1868
01:24:49,248 --> 01:24:52,609
animation have you seen it if so

1869
01:24:50,599 --> 01:24:57,679
thoughts yes I have seen it I thought it

1870
01:24:52,609 --> 01:25:01,429
was pretty good the animation in that

1871
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:05,538
get in overgrowth though has some issues

1872
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:07,699
to it so I'm wondering like I felt like

1873
01:25:05,538 --> 01:25:11,349
it should look better than it did given

1874
01:25:07,698 --> 01:25:14,899
sort of the way he was talking about it

1875
01:25:11,349 --> 01:25:18,099
I feel like there may be some weirdness

1876
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:28,549
like I feel like he's maybe not using

1877
01:25:18,099 --> 01:25:30,110
like enough what's the word I'm looking

1878
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:32,989
for I feel like he's maybe not using

1879
01:25:30,109 --> 01:25:40,248
enough animation for it if that makes

1880
01:25:32,988 --> 01:25:43,578
sense like hmm like he's not using

1881
01:25:40,248 --> 01:25:44,688
enough sampling would probably be my my

1882
01:25:43,578 --> 01:25:48,679
guess so

1883
01:25:44,689 --> 01:25:51,170
what he should probably do is like is is

1884
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:54,050
work more with the velocities I think is

1885
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:55,840
the problem because I don't know I feel

1886
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:57,739
like the techniques he was describing I

1887
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,939
feel like they would work really well

1888
01:25:57,738 --> 01:26:02,299
but when I looked at the animation

1889
01:25:58,939 --> 01:26:07,340
there's a lot of like discontinuity in

1890
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:10,340
the second derivative to it so I just I

1891
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:12,229
just feel like I feel like there's some

1892
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:13,429
implementation problems because I feel

1893
01:26:12,229 --> 01:26:15,289
like the Technic techniques should have

1894
01:26:13,429 --> 01:26:17,989
worked better than then what they end up

1895
01:26:15,288 --> 01:26:20,149
looking like that's that's I don't know

1896
01:26:17,988 --> 01:26:22,038
so I'm not sure but that said it's not

1897
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:23,299
shipped the game's not out so I don't

1898
01:26:22,038 --> 01:26:24,438
you know maybe they know all about that

1899
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:29,349
and they're like yeah we haven't

1900
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:29,349
finished you know this sort of thing

1901
01:26:54,069 --> 01:26:58,189
closest humanity to programming effects

1902
01:26:56,449 --> 01:26:59,229
in the lead of our universe how should I

1903
01:26:58,189 --> 01:27:05,359
know

1904
01:26:59,229 --> 01:27:06,739
like what do you have to say about the

1905
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:09,979
researchers that claim that Java can be

1906
01:27:06,739 --> 01:27:11,269
faster than C++ at times I have looked

1907
01:27:09,979 --> 01:27:13,279
at every single time people have claimed

1908
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:14,420
that and I was like yep they're wrong

1909
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:16,279
like I went and looked and I was like

1910
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:19,670
here's how they did it as like nope that

1911
01:27:16,279 --> 01:27:21,949
was just stupid cuz it can't be I mean

1912
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:24,380
it's just that's it's kind of ludicrous

1913
01:27:21,949 --> 01:27:28,489
to even think that it can be because it

1914
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:29,930
doesn't really make any sense and you

1915
01:27:28,489 --> 01:27:33,019
know you go to see these researchers and

1916
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:34,880
they're hilarious like how bad the the

1917
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:36,770
paper is and usually they don't actually

1918
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,680
mean that it's faster than C++ what they

1919
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:41,360
mean is that oh you know if you were to

1920
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:44,570
create a certain program this specific

1921
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:46,549
way and you use the java's construct for

1922
01:27:44,569 --> 01:27:48,949
it versus the c++ is construct for this

1923
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:52,789
specific thing then it's faster and I'm

1924
01:27:48,949 --> 01:27:54,229
like okay I don't understand why that's

1925
01:27:52,789 --> 01:27:56,329
relevant because I could have done

1926
01:27:54,229 --> 01:28:01,339
exactly that thing in actual z/os us

1927
01:27:56,329 --> 01:28:03,769
myself if I'd wanted to so it's like not

1928
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:07,270
particularly relevant now there might be

1929
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:09,620
some things too where you know a Java's

1930
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:16,520
maybe compiler got optimized for

1931
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:19,010
something and you know you can't maybe

1932
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:22,220
there's like some bad part of LLVM you

1933
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:25,030
know that you can say well okay this is

1934
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:25,030
slow or something like that

1935
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:41,610
and Shawn no I have not seen I have I

1936
01:28:38,949 --> 01:28:41,609
have not seen

1937
01:28:47,649 --> 01:28:53,979
Oh our fellow Java aficionado here has

1938
01:28:51,699 --> 01:28:56,319
said that runescape which I don't think

1939
01:28:53,979 --> 01:29:07,479
I've ever seen is written in Java

1940
01:28:56,319 --> 01:29:14,409
what is runescape it's some kind of an

1941
01:29:07,479 --> 01:29:17,069
RPG I guess I I don't actually know

1942
01:29:14,409 --> 01:29:17,069
runescape

1943
01:29:20,698 --> 01:29:27,748
is a graphical browser game from the

1944
01:29:24,809 --> 01:29:29,550
client-side in Java okay that sounds

1945
01:29:27,748 --> 01:29:33,929
fantastic well if that's what's the kind

1946
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:38,639
of thing you want to work on you know go

1947
01:29:33,929 --> 01:29:47,219
nuts man again not really a serious game

1948
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:50,328
but okay they released the C++ client

1949
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:54,420
last week oh that's great

1950
01:29:50,328 --> 01:29:55,889
sorry yoloswag the game you cited

1951
01:29:54,420 --> 01:30:00,059
actually had to replace their crappy

1952
01:29:55,889 --> 01:30:01,440
Java thing so bummer man I guess you

1953
01:30:00,059 --> 01:30:04,469
can't work there but don't worry they'll

1954
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:08,998
still be a job for you it I don't know

1955
01:30:04,469 --> 01:30:12,559
at IBM integrating parking ticket

1956
01:30:08,998 --> 01:30:15,559
software for this city of you know

1957
01:30:12,559 --> 01:30:15,559
Pawnee

1958
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:45,260
and I don't think that that minecraft

1959
01:30:43,369 --> 01:30:47,210
has been ported to C++ yet has it

1960
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:50,869
some was suggesting that it has but I

1961
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:55,369
doubted it my baby Microsoft did I don't

1962
01:30:50,869 --> 01:30:58,479
know but I you think that would have

1963
01:30:55,369 --> 01:30:58,479
been announced at some point

1964
01:31:09,319 --> 01:31:13,558
the wind - in addition - okay so

1965
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:15,419
basically all that all the games that

1966
01:31:13,559 --> 01:31:17,279
we're in Java have been rewritten in C++

1967
01:31:15,418 --> 01:31:20,099
is that basically we're saying minecraft

1968
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:23,029
got re-released in C++ and runescape got

1969
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:23,029
really loose in C++

1970
01:31:44,439 --> 01:31:49,839
all right so I am going to wrap it up

1971
01:31:47,738 --> 01:31:56,829
since there are no more queues that look

1972
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:58,810
relevant yeah I don't really understand

1973
01:31:56,829 --> 01:32:00,189
why people ever even talk about Java for

1974
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:01,989
programming games because almost no

1975
01:32:00,189 --> 01:32:03,460
games are written in it and certainly

1976
01:32:01,988 --> 01:32:05,639
none that are like technically

1977
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:11,469
impressive right that never has happened

1978
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:13,150
pretty much ever and and it seems like

1979
01:32:11,469 --> 01:32:15,670
if you wanted that kind of a managed

1980
01:32:13,149 --> 01:32:17,829
language that's like kind of high level

1981
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:23,619
it does seem kind of like you would end

1982
01:32:17,829 --> 01:32:24,880
up you know you'd end up doing a c-sharp

1983
01:32:23,619 --> 01:32:27,039
these days because you know you're

1984
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:28,600
writing a Unity game or you're you know

1985
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:30,430
you're using XNA or who knows what

1986
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,039
you're using some of those things seems

1987
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:34,719
like where like I've seen a lot more I

1988
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:37,090
can think of a lot more games that are

1989
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:39,550
that than than our Java like there's

1990
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:43,449
almost none it's really really really

1991
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:44,710
really rare all right thank you everyone

1992
01:32:43,448 --> 01:32:47,289
