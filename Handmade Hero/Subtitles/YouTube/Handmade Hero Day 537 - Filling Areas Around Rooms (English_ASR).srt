00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:06,359
hello everyone and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,388
here oh sure we could complete game live

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,669
on stream if I remember correctly and

4
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:19,079
it's been about three weeks so we took a

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:22,170
break there I was away I want to start

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,448
something new I'm pretty sure we left

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,449
ourselves in a reasonable position for

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:32,039
starting something new and we have a

9
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:35,609
number of things we can do however I

10
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:38,189
think there's a pretty clear order in

11
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:42,420
which we should do them so I'm going to

12
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:45,089
say that order now out of the things

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,670
that I want to do is one I want the tag

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,530
system to get cleaned up now that we've

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,149
got all this art assets in there I want

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,480
to simplify how we're doing tag clear

17
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,039
querying and make it clear how things

18
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:59,128
are selected from the our task stream in

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,969
like a clean efficient manner so that's

20
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:05,908
one thing that I'd like to do I would

21
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,579
like to make it so that we can have

22
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,640
ground cover and stuff now so like when

23
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:14,849
we like in fact we sort of did a crappy

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,180
example of this in the renderer sand

25
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,188
alone renderer test that we have we you

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,500
know splattered some grass on things I'd

27
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:25,469
like to make a good version of that so

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,239
that when we're outdoors we can get the

29
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:30,868
like some ground cover there and

30
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:33,810
possibly also indoors we may want sort

31
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:35,819
of a relatively generic scattering thing

32
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,368
that's just like Scout of this crap

33
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,709
around at this density and then we can

34
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:43,200
just use low density scattering for

35
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,719
interiors to put things like rocks on

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,850
dungeon floors or like debris

37
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,289
you know stuff where the placement of it

38
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:52,739
doesn't really matter it's just there

39
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,770
for a visual effect so it's not really

40
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,849
necessarily there for gameplay where you

41
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,670
know you don't interact with these

42
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,658
things they're just kind of giving you a

43
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,269
little bit more texture of the

44
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,600
environment so we want to be able do

45
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:08,939
that we want to finish up our lighting

46
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,659
so our lighting is still not really

47
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,870
finished it's kind of a bit of zygote I

48
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,329
think I pretty much

49
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,430
how I want to finish it up now so that

50
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,519
it'll be fast enough to be shippable

51
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:27,209
quality and also broad enough to be good

52
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:30,129
you know and usable everywhere and

53
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,979
finally I want to get our world Jen

54
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:36,899
generating something reasonable for the

55
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:40,060
actual layout of the game currently

56
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,469
which is to say that if you load the

57
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:47,259
game at the moment and I can sort of

58
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:54,159
show you what I mean by this if we go

59
00:02:47,259 --> 00:03:02,709
ahead and do a quick builds here and a

60
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:04,810
launch remedy with our game so if you

61
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:08,199
take a look at what it looks like at the

62
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:11,799
moment right we end up in a situation

63
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:15,119
where it's generating sort of the rooms

64
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:19,060
like our test rooms are generating there

65
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:24,639
but what we don't get is filler for

66
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:27,098
areas like outside of the rooms and we

67
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,489
would like that to occur so in other

68
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:32,348
words when I like even right here where

69
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,959
we're at the boundary here I would like

70
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:37,959
there to be outdoor tiles around here

71
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,310
right so just you know I want it just I

72
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,659
don't want there to ever be like dead

73
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:48,400
space like that unless we're underground

74
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:50,530
and then like over here for example you

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,289
know when we're in like a forest area or

76
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,019
something like that I want I don't want

77
00:03:53,289 --> 00:04:00,098
you to be able to see dead space like so

78
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:03,969
there should just be like trees out here

79
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:05,979
or just arbitrary forest fill to go far

80
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:09,729
enough out such that like if the player

81
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:13,750
stands as far away as they can from the

82
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:16,449
center of the area whatever the region

83
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,589
is they could plausibly have seen to is

84
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:23,379
filled with stuff right so it's sort of

85
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:26,259
just creating an apron of entities

86
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:27,259
anywhere we like didn't put something

87
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:32,509
normally

88
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:34,759
and you know that's sort of just a way

89
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:36,560
of solidifying the world little bits

90
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,779
that you're not so it doesn't look like

91
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,860
it's just part of getting things to the

92
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,500
point where they don't look like a

93
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,120
development build anymore it's like

94
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
we've got to like solidify a bunch of

95
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,250
stuff and that's like one of them right

96
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,589
so that those are the things that we

97
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,569
would like to do and I think the one

98
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:56,750
that makes the most sense at first is

99
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:58,459
the last one I said meaning we should go

100
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,680
in and get the generator generating

101
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:02,810
something that's a plausible actual

102
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,639
world here meaning like this is kind of

103
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,420
the number of entities that we expect to

104
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,919
have and we can also maybe force some

105
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,100
more furniture in here I don't know

106
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,600
we'll see how we want to do that but we

107
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:19,340
can sort of play around with that stuff

108
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,070
a little bit more as we go anyway so I

109
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:22,789
would like to do that and what we'll do

110
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:26,060
down here

111
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:29,210
I'm not like 100% sure to be completely

112
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,610
honest with you in other words I don't

113
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:33,979
know what we what is the right thing to

114
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,650
show when you're when you're down in a

115
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,480
dungeon area so there's not there isn't

116
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:40,789
a world outside it would just be like

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,060
rock you know underground like the earth

118
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,250
you know so most of the time it doesn't

119
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,290
really matter because as you can see

120
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:52,129
we've set the camera properly so that

121
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:55,640
you only really see the room that you're

122
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:57,560
currently in but like yeah on these

123
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,849
scrolling ones when you can scroll the

124
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,889
side I don't know one thing we could do

125
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,050
is stop the scrolling so that it doesn't

126
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:04,759
you know lie to go further but it's

127
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,280
still you know no matter what we do

128
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,730
they're still gonna be this kind of

129
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,349
thing happening at some point probably

130
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,780
and so the question is just what do we

131
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,460
want to do there and I don't know it may

132
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:19,989
be that we just want that to just be

133
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:24,019
black so in other words we will clear

134
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:29,090
any of the undrawn region will will

135
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:31,939
clear that to black and that is what it

136
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:34,939
will look like right so that's what I'd

137
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:37,639
like to do and I just want that because

138
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,730
in the upstairs areas where you're sort

139
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,968
of want to feel like it's outdoors

140
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,619
that's

141
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:46,218
kind of thing where I don't really want

142
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:48,709
I don't want black in the exterior there

143
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:50,298
because it makes it feel like it's not

144
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:53,179
really the outdoors because you know the

145
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:55,548
outdoors wouldn't that you know we all

146
00:06:53,178 --> 00:07:00,788
know their stuff here so I'd like to

147
00:06:55,548 --> 00:07:03,138
have you know that working correctly so

148
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:04,699
I think that's the first thing I'd like

149
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,559
to start with is just getting like

150
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,478
aprons generated for everything so that

151
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:16,969
anywhere that we don't end up placing

152
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:20,688
like actual world stuff on the you know

153
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:23,418
the sort of Earth's crust layer for lack

154
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:27,709
of a better term any anywhere on that

155
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:30,488
layer I would like it so that we have a

156
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:33,619
sufficient apron of entities to prevent

157
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:36,828
you from seeing sort of the edge of the

158
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:39,709
world and at first here I don't care if

159
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,278
there's anything particularly nice about

160
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,668
them

161
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:46,338
I just want squares there and when we

162
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:49,399
can work later on as we you know improve

163
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:51,139
our world gencode to put you know more

164
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,610
intelligent layouts of trees and things

165
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,739
I mean obviously right now we're not

166
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,038
even doing like this trees that are in

167
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:59,868
the apron right here that's right that

168
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:01,848
are in the boundary right here

169
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:03,559
are just we just randomly we were

170
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,759
testing to see all the different kinds

171
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:06,559
of trees that were in our pack so

172
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,848
obviously like at some point we have to

173
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:10,039
make a thing that's intelligent about

174
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:11,438
tree placement because obviously these

175
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,088
trees should not be occurring together

176
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,799
the trees should be sort of logically

177
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:18,019
grouped so you know if this is a snowy

178
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:20,028
area we have mostly snowy trees and if

179
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:21,528
this is a fall sort of season area we

180
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:22,639
get most of the fall trees or things

181
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:30,889
like that

182
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:32,120
so that's all fine and dandy and and at

183
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:33,558
the moment I don't really care about

184
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,818
that part for the apron I just want to

185
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:37,759
make sure that we're generating stuff in

186
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:40,639
that apron so when we look at how the

187
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:44,808
world Jen works what we end up with is

188
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:46,879
essentially you know we end up in the

189
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:48,289
room gencode which is just kind of a

190
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,389
placeholder right now cuz we don't

191
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:52,250
really generate any gameplay rooms but

192
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:54,080
this is where the action will happen

193
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,240
eventually for creating

194
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,670
what for lack of better term would be

195
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,100
like one gameplay experience for the

196
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:02,778
player right cuz each room would have

197
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,850
something like a monster you have to

198
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:07,519
fight or something you want to see or a

199
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,100
shop that you engage with so pretty much

200
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,769
anything gameplay related right is this

201
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,240
eventual is gonna be a pretty complex

202
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:17,389
set of things we're going to do in here

203
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,028
to put down various gameplay things that

204
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:22,338
we want the player to experience and so

205
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:25,578
this generate room function is where

206
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:27,800
we're going to do that work for

207
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:31,429
generating the apron I don't think we

208
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,559
really want to confuse or conflate the

209
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:35,028
two so I think we kind of want a

210
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,969
separate kind of function that's gonna

211
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:39,740
you know generate apron areas and it

212
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,379
will just kind of like splat down things

213
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,089
that's necessary to fill those areas so

214
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:45,649
the first thing I think we need to do is

215
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:51,170
figure out when to call that function

216
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:54,110
and with what amount of room right so if

217
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:55,669
we go to our world gin code base what we

218
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,779
can see our code base that's good are

219
00:09:55,669 --> 00:10:02,879
it's not like code base her from Jen

220
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:06,159
structures our room 10 infrastructure

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,250
what we could see is we create sort of

222
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,169
this intermediate representation where

223
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,360
we have things like rooms and the rooms

224
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:16,629
are connected together and we do stuff

225
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,330
like place the rooms down and then we

226
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:21,850
when we know where they all go we then

227
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,070
fill them in with stuff and that's sort

228
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,800
of the how the passes of room generation

229
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:29,590
goes so what I want to be able to do is

230
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:33,069
I would like anytime we place a room

231
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:36,360
down to essentially say in addition to

232
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:39,100
this room I need like an apron area

233
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,009
that's going to fill all of the

234
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,389
surrounding area of the room and here's

235
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:46,960
some information about like what that

236
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:49,539
apron should be right but I don't want

237
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,450
that to create any placement constraints

238
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:56,679
right because that apron is just filler

239
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:59,320
it's not required to be where it is it's

240
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,939
just saying if nothing else needed to go

241
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,520
here then we want to fill it in with

242
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:07,270
trees or rocks or who cares what

243
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,220
cliffside you know whatever it is so

244
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:12,069
what we want to do there is we want to

245
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,899
be able to create these aprons as sort

246
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:17,050
of a secondary thing that's like here's

247
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:20,069
where all the aprons would go and then

248
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:22,990
after the entire world has been like

249
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,600
constructed and we know where everything

250
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:29,049
goes then we can sort of do a separate

251
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,960
pass if you will to see where these

252
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:33,669
aprons should fill in and we just look

253
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,530
and say is there anything there if

254
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:37,479
there's not something there then we

255
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:43,600
place it but if there was we don't touch

256
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:45,460
it so that's what I want to do now since

257
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,440
we know that the only things that can

258
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,769
really occur exist at the moment our

259
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,589
rooms it seems like what we could

260
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:56,649
probably do is say well there's a gem

261
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:58,839
volume here for the room that says this

262
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,579
is where the room is it seems pretty

263
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,990
straightforward that we could also just

264
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:07,720
create a gen volume for the apron right

265
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:11,019
so what we could do is say well you know

266
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,490
maybe there's a gen apron and the apron

267
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:16,480
is just like sort of

268
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:19,930
anything that's around the play area

269
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,909
that the player doesn't go into but

270
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:23,799
that's there for visual effect and it

271
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:25,689
needs to be filled with something and

272
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:29,620
off we go right

273
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:34,030
and so the Jen apron would say for this

274
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:37,330
volume you know I want to fill it up

275
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:41,860
with something and we can have some kind

276
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:44,410
of a specification for what that is we

277
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,240
can probably follow what we were doing

278
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:49,269
here where we've got sort of general

279
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,930
spec we can probably say hey maybe we've

280
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:56,199
got a gen apron spec as well and that

281
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:57,489
just has who knows what in it and so

282
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,340
we're basically gonna do the same thing

283
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:03,789
here then what we can do is say okay

284
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:09,370
these aprons just kind of stack up like

285
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:12,969
everything else does the spec I don't

286
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,409
know which we're just gonna throw

287
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,720
something in there that has nothing to

288
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:18,339
do right and this is similar to do it's

289
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,700
like we don't really spec stuff at the

290
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,899
moment it's just placeholder but what we

291
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,700
want to do is have a list of these

292
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:27,579
aprons so that afterwards we can go

293
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,170
through and just load them up see if

294
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,240
there's any need to fill them with

295
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:35,049
something and if there is fill them if

296
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,570
there isn't don't so there's a couple

297
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:40,990
different you know ways in which we're

298
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,520
probably gonna have to make this more

299
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,580
robust than the first thing I'm going to

300
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:49,809
do but we'll we'll kind of do a basic

301
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:53,920
pass on it first all right so if we take

302
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:55,189
a look at the general which should be

303
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,689
here somewhere

304
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:03,470
no where's the worst the stuff that

305
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:06,920
actually holds this stuff where did we

306
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:12,980
put it right there's a because there's a

307
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:13,969
there's a little generator but I don't

308
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,259
know where that ended up

309
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:22,430
oh it was in here okay interesting it's

310
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:23,949
at the top well I put it at the top for

311
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,719
some reason why did I put at the top

312
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:32,359
nobody knows so let's go ahead and

313
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:34,189
create the Jen apron sort of list here

314
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,470
that's effectively gonna be exactly the

315
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:40,909
same as our rims and we'll just keep a

316
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,480
separate list of these and we know we

317
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:47,809
sort of go sort of fill these out as a

318
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,810
separate as a separate pass right and

319
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:54,948
then inside here you know we've got sort

320
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:56,719
of our our code - well no that's not

321
00:14:54,948 --> 00:14:59,269
what I wanted I want to look for our

322
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:05,810
room code where we actually put one of

323
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:08,929
these on here so I think no that's not

324
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:12,619
it where is our function it's been a

325
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:15,409
while where is our function for doing

326
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:19,909
this that's the room stack that we use

327
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:22,789
for processing also not the same surely

328
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:33,068
there's a way that generates a room into

329
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:33,068
the system and who knows where that is

330
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,759
am I just not seeing it am I being am i

331
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,550
being daft here I mean right there

332
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:46,159
should have been there should be I would

333
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:52,490
think a function that gives you one of

334
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:58,219
these right a Jen room and I have no

335
00:15:52,490 --> 00:16:02,269
idea why I don't see it here I guess

336
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:05,300
what I'll do is I'm gonna look for where

337
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:07,139
we add room connections here I wanted to

338
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:11,548
see where that

339
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:14,879
actually exists just so I can figure out

340
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:17,369
how on earth Kufa we were doing there to

341
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,459
make these things I could also look at

342
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:21,989
the place where we create the orphanage

343
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,088
and just see what we're calling but

344
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:28,790
that's just weird

345
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:28,790
so here's a recruit aspects Jen room ah

346
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:42,089
I see so we sort of defined this as a

347
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:43,708
macro so that we could produce labeling

348
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:47,609
for it right you can see that happening

349
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:49,378
here so that we could see what our room

350
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:52,230
layouts work so that's why I didn't see

351
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:54,569
it interesting all right

352
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,459
anyway because yeah you can see my

353
00:16:54,568 --> 00:16:58,378
little sort of crappy parser that tries

354
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:02,368
to find all the functions it doesn't

355
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:05,610
work I don't think through like the if

356
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:08,610
there's like macros you know wrapping it

357
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:10,769
so it wouldn't find Jen you know it

358
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:14,788
would find this but it wouldn't find

359
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:17,338
that yeah I'm saying anyway

360
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:18,898
so in here we've got our general call

361
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:22,078
and you can see that it's you know

362
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:24,958
effectively just pushing on a struct

363
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,369
onto this linked list of structs that's

364
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,889
what we want to do with the apron as

365
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:31,500
well so we just want to have a Jen apron

366
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:34,138
call here where we're basically pushing

367
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,548
on and you know we maybe want to do the

368
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:37,048
same thing where we push a label on

369
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:38,308
there to see who's creating it but you

370
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:41,250
know I don't know I'm gonna wait till I

371
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:43,888
actually need that before I go full pull

372
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,538
on that but anyway we're gonna say all

373
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:47,879
right you're gonna give us the world

374
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:49,619
generator and we're gonna push one of

375
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,610
these guys on here so it's a sack same

376
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:55,979
code really only were you know not gonna

377
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:58,979
set we're gonna put it on a different

378
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,349
list that's about it so here's the apron

379
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:07,200
we push one on to the memory for the

380
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:08,449
generator we say that the spec you gave

381
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,850
us is the spec we will use

382
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,950
unsurprisingly we set the global next to

383
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:16,109
be whatever the first apron was in the

384
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,669
list and then we say that the first

385
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:20,500
apron in the list is ourselves right

386
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:23,440
it's a standard thing that we do for

387
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,470
linked lists nothing special and so now

388
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,950
we have a way of putting these aprons on

389
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:31,839
don't ask me why but spelled that um

390
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:34,000
that's what we want so we can do a

391
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,789
generic call and that puts one into the

392
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,160
generator for future use and what we

393
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:42,700
need now is anytime we're actually

394
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:47,080
making rooms we want some way of making

395
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:48,610
those aprons occur with them and I'm not

396
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,619
sure exactly how we want to do that

397
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,269
because if we look back at the code so

398
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:54,489
let's look at the orphanage code since

399
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:56,829
that's the thing that we actually have

400
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,960
the most experience with here so if you

401
00:18:56,829 --> 00:19:02,139
look at what's happening here when we're

402
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,900
generating rooms what you can see is

403
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:08,080
that you know there's really not a lot

404
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:10,690
of code that that really thinks about

405
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:14,769
the rooms location after that but you

406
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:18,279
know we do like connection calls like so

407
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:20,319
and the problem we're gonna have hers

408
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,789
you know we don't really want to make we

409
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:26,409
don't want to force ourselves to have to

410
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:29,259
keep saying like hey generate the apron

411
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,290
for this or the apron for that and so I

412
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:36,160
think maybe what we would want to do

413
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:44,349
just looking at this is say hey maybe we

414
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:48,390
want to talk about the you know the act

415
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:52,329
of generating the room itself could

416
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:56,470
generate the apron based off of the spec

417
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:59,619
right so for example what we could do is

418
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:03,839
say alright when you generate a room

419
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:03,839
here and yeah maybe this is nice

420
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:14,060
I kind of like this idea maybe do it a

421
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,490
little bit differently so instead of

422
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:20,960
Jenny generating the aprons right away

423
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:24,200
maybe what we do instead is say okay the

424
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,110
Jen room spec has an apron spec off of

425
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,600
it so when you generate the room you

426
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:33,979
will push the apron on with that volume

427
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:36,019
right and so in other words rather than

428
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:40,009
calling this sort of thing manually

429
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:43,339
maybe what we actually do is we say well

430
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:45,259
we've got the apron and we know that

431
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:49,069
when we're generating rooms what we

432
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:51,799
should do is the room spec which says

433
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:55,279
what kind of room this is can also tell

434
00:20:51,799 --> 00:21:02,750
us if there is an apron right so we

435
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:05,450
could just say alright you know if you

436
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,640
set this value to something then when we

437
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,340
generate the room we know that we have

438
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:14,030
to generate an apron that corresponds to

439
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:16,699
that room right I like that idea because

440
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:20,960
now we can sort of turn the process

441
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:26,000
around a little bit and say back in the

442
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:29,120
code where we have the room Jen where we

443
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,630
call this generate room call what we

444
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,699
could say is at that point so you know

445
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,620
we go through all of this stuff to

446
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,230
create you know everything that's in the

447
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:42,549
room at that point when we're at the

448
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:45,620
very end and we finished everything up

449
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:49,519
maybe that is the time when we then say

450
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:51,679
hey whatever the room spec is so because

451
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,029
you know we've gotten the room spec here

452
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,970
that we use to generate the room

453
00:21:53,029 --> 00:22:00,399
whatever the room spec is we could say

454
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:03,079
if this spec has an apron requirement

455
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,320
then let's go ahead and use that apron

456
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:12,559
requirement so here's where we'll call

457
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:17,240
Jen apron and we'll say give me one of

458
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:20,730
these and the apron itself we can set

459
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,500
the volume now and maybe we'll set the

460
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:25,470
the no I guess we wouldn't have to

461
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,750
because everything else is set so this

462
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,308
this Jen apron that we get back we know

463
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,169
that the spec contains the information

464
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:33,230
necessary and that was sort of part of

465
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:35,970
what whatever the room specification was

466
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,798
and then in this vault in this part here

467
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,130
where we do the apron volume we know

468
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:43,139
what the room volume is and so all we

469
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:49,200
have to do is look and see whether we

470
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:51,390
think that that volume should get

471
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,669
applied to the apron and the reason I

472
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,970
say that is because we may want to not

473
00:22:53,669 --> 00:23:00,090
apply the apron to anything other than

474
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:04,940
just the zi area that one z plane that

475
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:04,939
we know we're using for aprons right um

476
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,839
I'm just not sure exactly how we want to

477
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:14,099
do that so for now I'm gonna ignore just

478
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:16,250
that that part and we'll kind of come

479
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:19,798
back to that a little bit later but

480
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,750
here's the room volume so if I say that

481
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,129
I want the apron volume to be this well

482
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,289
it wouldn't really do anything because

483
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,540
that's just only the area that contains

484
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:29,970
the room itself so what I need to do

485
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:33,139
here is grow that by however many tiles

486
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:40,350
I want aprons to be generally speaking

487
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:43,470
and I believe that we have a surgeon

488
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:47,519
math there it is I believe that we have

489
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:49,470
a thing in your yeah I do so we've got a

490
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,910
bunch of functions in here and it looks

491
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:54,240
like we already wrote the one we would

492
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:56,850
need this one allows us to take any

493
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,769
volume that we have and add some amount

494
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:00,769
of expansion to it right

495
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:09,310
so if I want to take one of these Jen

496
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:12,100
VIII's I can sort of say all right I

497
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:15,250
don't want to add any Z to it but I do

498
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:16,959
want to add some X&amp;Y I don't know how

499
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,309
many of those I want but let's say we do

500
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,740
an eight by eight apron around

501
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:26,919
everything and off we go okay so now in

502
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,920
theory anyway if I take care of any bugs

503
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:33,519
that we've got here what is the problem

504
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:50,590
world Jen it's that's what I actually

505
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:58,329
wanted and this is all probably and it's

506
00:24:50,589 --> 00:25:00,939
that knowledge Oh address and so that's

507
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:03,309
really all we're talking about here and

508
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,230
I believe that that should just leave

509
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:07,859
things exactly as they were and now we

510
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:11,319
should have in theory the ability to

511
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:14,849
create something that you know produces

512
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:17,529
aprons and we can make a call for that

513
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:21,309
so what I want essentially is a call

514
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:23,470
like generate apron and I want it to you

515
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:25,119
know do something pretty much the same

516
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,480
as this only you know it's going to be

517
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:31,329
given an apron rather than a room and

518
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,009
what I primarily need is the ability to

519
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:36,389
just make sure that there's nothing

520
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:43,680
there right there's nothing in the way

521
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:43,680
and so I think looking at this

522
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:52,819
I need ways of finding if there's any

523
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,769
entities in a particular location and I

524
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:57,528
don't really think we've done much of

525
00:25:54,769 --> 00:26:02,089
that yet obviously we can get

526
00:25:57,528 --> 00:26:04,849
traversable spy location but that's not

527
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:08,480
quite the same thing and so we do need

528
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:10,908
some way of you know getting entities

529
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,970
that are nearby and making sure that we

530
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:15,620
don't place anything in locations where

531
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,839
they would be so we might have to add a

532
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:21,798
little bit of that I think that's mostly

533
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:24,878
the only thing that we're going to need

534
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:30,138
other than what we already have right

535
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:32,089
and so yeah let's go ahead and start

536
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:34,248
with this because we are gonna iterate

537
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:35,778
over the stuff here so when we're

538
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:40,249
generating the apron here what we want

539
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:43,759
to do is say all right here's our apron

540
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:45,079
spec which we don't really know we're

541
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,839
gonna do with yet but someday we'll

542
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:49,368
probably do something with it and then

543
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,048
what we want to do is this same thing

544
00:26:49,368 --> 00:26:54,079
where we're taking the counts and we're

545
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:56,720
just going to loop over them again the

546
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,278
z-index we're not really going to use

547
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,319
because if you know an apron will

548
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:05,480
probably never use it because we're just

549
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:07,579
doing the bottom sort of level of it and

550
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:12,200
so what we want to do there is we want

551
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:15,470
to place onto these tile indices we want

552
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:20,720
to go ahead and create entities here

553
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:26,179
like so and we want to probably do just

554
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:32,509
very basic yeah we want like a sort of a

555
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:34,278
very basic cube for the wall here

556
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:36,079
basically the exact same stuff we were

557
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,950
doing living that way gonna dwell but

558
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:42,769
they're gonna be ground and that's

559
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:47,690
mostly it right so we really just want

560
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:49,929
something very simple here nothing too

561
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,929
fancy

562
00:27:52,788 --> 00:28:06,869
something like this right um I think

563
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,120
that's all we really need the wall

564
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:12,569
height can for the moment really not be

565
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,099
a thing I mean I don't know what we're

566
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:16,048
gonna put here I don't really care we'll

567
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:18,378
think about this a little bit later I

568
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:22,950
see what we're doing we were trying to

569
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:24,658
keep the placement consistent uh so just

570
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:28,830
think something like that seems fine we

571
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:31,740
put one of these blocks here we probably

572
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:33,118
should put some tags on it to control

573
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,298
what its gonna be like whether it's

574
00:28:33,118 --> 00:28:41,970
outdoors or not it would be this sort of

575
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:44,720
thing right and so I think we probably

576
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:49,048
just want to do something like this for

577
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:52,379
now and so that would place like cubes

578
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:54,839
out there and really the only thing that

579
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:56,939
we need is a way to make sure that we

580
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:59,638
don't place anything into areas that

581
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:04,710
already had something placed you know

582
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:08,538
I'm saying something that basically says

583
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:11,220
is there anything at this tile location

584
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:12,929
because if if the game had already

585
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,210
generated room information there I don't

586
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:19,528
want to place anything there like on top

587
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:21,090
of it right so looking at get Sims space

588
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:22,919
traversable which is the only career we

589
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:27,538
have the reason we don't really want to

590
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:29,220
do that right is because we don't we

591
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:34,169
don't only want to look for things that

592
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:37,679
are traversable right we want to well

593
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:39,179
actually and I guess we'll yeah I guess

594
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,038
even think about this this is just using

595
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,629
the grid so even that we don't have

596
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:46,589
right now we don't have the grid

597
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:48,689
available so really what we need here is

598
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:50,638
we need sort of a way of querying the

599
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,460
what entities are in this particular

600
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:55,138
location and we really don't have that

601
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:59,220
like you can see that there really isn't

602
00:29:55,138 --> 00:30:01,918
anything there really isn't anything of

603
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,659
that of that form and so that's

604
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,780
something that we need anyway I mean we

605
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,700
need to be able to gather the

606
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:08,319
these that are in an area and that's

607
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,410
something that the sim region wants to

608
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:18,759
be able to do so it's not really an

609
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:24,420
issue so we should be fine but we have

610
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:24,420
to actually do it uh so we'll do that

611
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:30,840
yeah I don't see we don't have anything

612
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,839
in here for that as far as I can tell I

613
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,890
mean here's the thing where we loop over

614
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:39,639
all the entities and look for something

615
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:41,110
right and that's already something that

616
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:47,470
we had it to do in there like hey we've

617
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:50,079
got to make this thing faster anyway and

618
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:52,000
here is like another example right so

619
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:54,970
all of this stuff is examples of things

620
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,789
that we needed we wanted spatial queries

621
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,980
for anyway and so we want to add those

622
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:01,960
in here and that's this is a fine reason

623
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,880
to do it because we need it for all

624
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,170
sorts of things and this is just one of

625
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,840
the things that we'll want to be able to

626
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:13,390
do faster spatial queries on alright so

627
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:15,819
I think that's mostly all we're talking

628
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:19,509
about right so if you imagined we had

629
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:25,509
the call here where we could say like

630
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:31,470
you know something like this like hey if

631
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:35,259
I get overlapping entities you know

632
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,940
whatever sort of the sort of size of the

633
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:39,009
thing is that we were going to make here

634
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:44,320
which is like this thing in fact we

635
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:47,289
could actually produce the we could

636
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:50,079
store these two up here and use them as

637
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:56,529
the actual query so I think this is like

638
00:31:50,079 --> 00:32:01,859
Center P and dim of the NV so we could

639
00:31:56,529 --> 00:32:01,859
basically say hey if this thing

640
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:15,409
if this thing would would intersect

641
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:16,788
another entity don't place it right so

642
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:19,999
we're only gonna place things that

643
00:32:16,788 --> 00:32:21,980
wouldn't intersect anything else and you

644
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:23,239
know maybe we would shrink that by a

645
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:27,499
little bit but we're basically asking

646
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:30,619
this and we need like an offset so this

647
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:34,879
is like the offset from this P here so

648
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:37,638
you know sort of this this p here that

649
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:41,928
we would be using to place it we would

650
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:48,079
be using this offset from it right uh so

651
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:50,929
I think I think that's mostly all we

652
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,878
would need to do now whether we want to

653
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:55,940
bake that in there or not I'm not sure

654
00:32:52,878 --> 00:32:59,868
and similarly we could just say we don't

655
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:09,019
really care about you know what this is

656
00:32:59,868 --> 00:33:10,368
backwards it's dimension and offset we

657
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:12,649
could also say we don't really care

658
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:19,548
about the displacement particularly much

659
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:23,118
either I'm not sure but it yeah it

660
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:25,398
depends on on how we want to do this so

661
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:27,798
we'll say that we want to do that for

662
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:29,808
now we'll see maybe that's line and we

663
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:32,118
might want to shrink this down because

664
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:33,678
we don't want to require to be super

665
00:33:32,118 --> 00:33:35,868
exact so we just want to say like we

666
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,369
have most of this tile is empty then we

667
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:41,749
want to splat the thing down here

668
00:33:37,368 --> 00:33:44,118
probably so this may want to be yeah I

669
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:48,108
think we call this add radius to this

670
00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:50,449
may want to be shrunk a little bit so

671
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:52,759
you know I don't know what the shrink

672
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,639
would actually be but you know maybe

673
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:59,200
it's something like you know we just

674
00:33:55,638 --> 00:34:03,678
want to sort of contract it a little bit

675
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,239
on top of what the you know the actual

676
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,030
size of things going to be just to make

677
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:09,470
sure that we don't pick up any sort of

678
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:14,449
errant thing thats hanging over from a

679
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:15,769
jacent tile so I'm guessing we want yes

680
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,109
something like this we're like get

681
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:20,360
overlapping entities where we can

682
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:22,130
you know return some kind of a list of

683
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,620
entities that are overlapping this

684
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:26,510
particular thing I'm not sure how we

685
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:30,139
want to do that right now but we

686
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:32,540
probably just send some temp memory down

687
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:40,190
and we'll actually maybe make that

688
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:42,500
function produce an actual list seems

689
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,570
reasonable I mean there's reasons to not

690
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:51,469
want to actually make a list out of it

691
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:53,330
not to waste their time you know so we

692
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:57,769
could make this thing be more of like an

693
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:59,329
iterator but you know what I'll leave

694
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:08,809
that decision for a little bit later and

695
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:10,460
what I could say is we could say we

696
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:12,349
could just make a call that says hey I

697
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:16,460
want to know if there's any overlapping

698
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:17,989
entities for this area and we'll figure

699
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:21,050
out how we implement that exactly later

700
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:22,609
but this is what I want to see I want to

701
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,190
see something where I can say here's

702
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,559
where I'm gonna place the thing let's

703
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,309
make sure that there's nothing there

704
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,309
then we'll go ahead and place it

705
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:33,380
assuming that there isn't right and

706
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:35,119
again this will just for now generate

707
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,160
effectively the same sort of stuff we're

708
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,829
generating inside rooms or or outside

709
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:43,489
rooms or whatever and we'll deal with

710
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:45,769
that part later so I think that's all we

711
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:47,539
really need to do and so the majority of

712
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:49,880
the work is going to be we need to sort

713
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:52,099
of add this stuff I'll add the crappy

714
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,140
version of that maybe first and then

715
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:56,389
we'll add a better version later for the

716
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:58,369
moment we want to focus on how this

717
00:35:56,389 --> 00:36:00,980
actually gets called because right now

718
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:03,170
it never would be and so if we go into

719
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,210
world Jen at the point where we actually

720
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:07,970
go and do stuff here I don't know what

721
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:10,909
this garbage is this is all old stuff we

722
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:16,369
don't need any of this really I don't

723
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:18,379
think yeah we don't delete it but in

724
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:20,929
here we call create world right this is

725
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,940
what's going to happen and what we want

726
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:25,369
to do is when we go to this generate

727
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:29,840
world call where we're we've sort of

728
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:32,358
built all the lists and stuff this

729
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,670
function or sorry this

730
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:38,058
for loop it's gonna call the generate

731
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:39,650
room operations that we have to do which

732
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:42,980
will create all the world entities and

733
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:44,989
then it will also create that list of

734
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,809
aprons that we need to be concerned with

735
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:52,190
so immediately after that we should be

736
00:36:47,809 --> 00:37:04,749
able to say hey let's go ahead and loop

737
00:36:52,190 --> 00:37:04,749
over all the aprons and generate those

738
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:13,309
and that should give us effectively the

739
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:13,730
entire behavior of the thing right all

740
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:17,059
right

741
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:20,980
so the generate apron called probably

742
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:23,239
needs to get hoisted up to here like so

743
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:26,778
and then we got a look at any bugs that

744
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:34,730
we've got room should this should just

745
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:37,699
be apron and floor tiles e is what

746
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:41,059
exactly I don't even know what that came

747
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:48,798
from or how we were creating that it's

748
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:55,940
just a min tile yeah so this is just

749
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:59,480
that and we have to figure out our wall

750
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:05,329
height we've got to put that up there

751
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:07,670
where it should have gone and we've got

752
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:10,730
two dims here so okay so there's that

753
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:14,059
dim so this is really the I guess we

754
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:17,150
should call this the cube P and the

755
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:19,970
cubed in might be a better way to say

756
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:25,670
that and then we've got the cubed in

757
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:28,098
there and the cube P here we've dim Q P

758
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:30,639
and that's just replacing the little

759
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:30,640
cube things

760
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:47,970
so what else our ad radius - is unhappy

761
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:53,400
I'm not sure why

762
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:55,859
ah I see

763
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,720
oh well but wait this is a cube dim this

764
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,450
isn't a rectangle so I'm not sure why I

765
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:01,949
said add radius - because that we should

766
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:07,439
just be really doing a rectangle there

767
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:10,889
so really this should just be wrecked

768
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,970
center half dim or something like this I

769
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:20,900
don't know if this is the cube dimension

770
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:24,949
or are our cubes point seven total I

771
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:27,960
guess not so this is the half dim right

772
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:32,929
so really this is rectangle Center half

773
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:36,210
dim and we want you know our cube dim

774
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:38,039
plus this v3 is what we're gonna

775
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,480
actually query on and that way we'll

776
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:42,090
just pass a rectangle three to this

777
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:50,460
thing and that'll be clear like what's

778
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:53,430
going on right okay so yeah if and this

779
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:56,099
would be like the query region maybe I'd

780
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:59,909
call this just so we can get this out

781
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:02,009
here and that's gonna be a rectangle

782
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:05,190
three which will you know just give us a

783
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:08,910
bounding area all right so then I can

784
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:10,320
say a query region we don't have this

785
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:19,440
function yet so that's going to be an

786
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:20,519
error obviously but otherwise hopefully

787
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,840
we should be good to go

788
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:27,980
stone floor here we don't really have so

789
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:33,800
I think we're just gonna go with like

790
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:38,869
yeah it's grass at the moment

791
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:42,390
honestly there only is outdoors so like

792
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:45,059
we don't really have anything to do with

793
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:45,929
any of this stuff in fact this isn't

794
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:48,019
even really

795
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:53,338
necessary you know maybe I'll just

796
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:57,000
doesn't have trees and so I think this

797
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:59,779
is really more what we're looking at

798
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,929
like that like there isn't really like

799
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:07,380
generate an apron of a floor of like

800
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:09,949
actual manmade area um so we need a way

801
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:13,250
of doing our overlapping entities exist

802
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:18,899
let's see here so when we do this at MD

803
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:20,369
we need here to pass down like the the

804
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:25,230
sim region that we're actually talking

805
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:28,440
about here and so in there I believe yes

806
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,960
so in generate room we do this world

807
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,838
change here which is sort of saying like

808
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,079
hey this is the area that we want to

809
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,289
actually edit as part of this and we're

810
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:42,510
going to want to do that for here too

811
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:44,579
so when we're ready we want to

812
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,859
effectively say let's do a begin world

813
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:48,390
change we have throughout where the

814
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:50,308
change center is and where the the

815
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:53,879
rectangle is but that's just going to be

816
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:54,960
like this volume and so if I look at how

817
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,869
we're completing that we should be able

818
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,670
just do it exactly the same and this

819
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:02,608
stuff probably should get pulled out

820
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:09,450
into a similar thing like into a into a

821
00:42:02,608 --> 00:42:12,289
single unified call we can use I don't

822
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:12,289
make it to do that effect

823
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,660
but for now I'll leave it be and so when

824
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:26,998
we actually you know begin the the world

825
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:30,239
change there the tile dim is oops it's

826
00:42:26,998 --> 00:42:32,219
just this you can just see there's too

827
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,748
much business here this stuff should we

828
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,669
should really kind of collapse down and

829
00:42:33,748 --> 00:42:38,879
it just should be no more

830
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:41,190
straightforward okay and we can also

831
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,440
pull out the random serious here because

832
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:46,369
we're gonna probably do some entropy

833
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,710
based stuff as well right

834
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:53,298
yeah you can see here we got our entity

835
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,298
sort of variance there

836
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:07,670
this probably wants to be here too right

837
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:17,159
curious about this well uh anyway um

838
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:20,909
let's see

839
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:22,618
so we placing the entity only happens if

840
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:24,739
we actually have an entity and there's

841
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:28,588
one too many of those that's why we've

842
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:29,728
edited the else Clause out there but

843
00:43:28,588 --> 00:43:32,759
then all I guess we need is just the

844
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:36,838
color here and the color for our current

845
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:41,429
purposes I don't know what we want to do

846
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:44,009
here probably nothing in particular so I

847
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:51,929
may just say like yeah the color is

848
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:53,699
going to be something fairly it's

849
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:55,739
interesting that we should probably not

850
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:58,469
be colorizing this stuff in weird ways

851
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:00,539
that we are right now so we should

852
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:02,880
probably just make the color of this

853
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:04,709
thing be something straightforward so

854
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,999
maybe the color of these things is just

855
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:16,858
that or whatever and we'll just pass

856
00:44:08,998 --> 00:44:19,288
that down just just pure gray so I think

857
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:22,259
that puts us in and let me just make

858
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:24,449
sure we sort of record the world change

859
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:26,818
here and say that we're done but I think

860
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:29,818
that's it and so all I really need to do

861
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:31,259
now is have some way of actually

862
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:33,989
figuring out whether there was entities

863
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:36,708
in that area and again that's this call

864
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:40,559
right here and we need some way of that

865
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:44,159
returning information to us if I go to

866
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:45,509
the sim region what I could do is just

867
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,699
loop over all the entities and see if

868
00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:50,248
any of them do and that's a good first

869
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:52,380
attempt so that's the slow crappy

870
00:44:50,248 --> 00:44:54,018
version but at least we can see whether

871
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,329
or not the rest of our stuff is working

872
00:44:54,018 --> 00:45:00,058
so what we would do for that is we just

873
00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:04,079
say you know hey the same code we were

874
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:08,910
using before we basically just need to

875
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:11,430
say yeah give us the sim region actually

876
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:13,289
and since we're in sim region land we

877
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:18,269
really just need a rectangle three which

878
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:20,699
is like tell us what the bounds of this

879
00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:26,579
thing are right and then what we can do

880
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:39,679
is loop over all of these and check if

881
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:42,630
they collide here we go so here's the

882
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:46,440
here's essentially the same call right

883
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:48,088
so what we can do is say here's the

884
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,159
collision volumes of these things or

885
00:45:48,088 --> 00:45:53,369
whatever is happening and off we go

886
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:55,618
right the only thing that I think is a

887
00:45:53,369 --> 00:46:01,710
little bit tricky about this is I don't

888
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:04,530
know if those collision volumes we're

889
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:07,050
probably gonna have to like solidify pun

890
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,940
intended our approach to collision fires

891
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:11,460
to make sure that everyone actually gets

892
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,289
one because I don't know that we

893
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,690
actually set up collision volumes for

894
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:17,308
everybody but we should we have a flag

895
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,230
that says whether things participating

896
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:20,640
collisions so there's no reason not to

897
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,260
have a collision volume on something

898
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:25,048
because we can use it for our own

899
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,790
queries like we're doing now so we don't

900
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,019
really want to ever have anyone who

901
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:30,509
doesn't have a collision volume

902
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:33,000
initialized like if you're 0 0 0 that's

903
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:38,309
not good we should bound whatever your

904
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,719
area is somehow right but anyway so this

905
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:41,400
is effectively all we would need

906
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:43,230
assuming that we start cleaning the rest

907
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,720
of this collision stuff up where we can

908
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:49,250
essentially say look if whatever the

909
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,250
entity is that we're looking at here

910
00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:04,009
I guess actually this just normally gets

911
00:46:59,298 --> 00:47:06,259
these calls it's weird because entity

912
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:10,190
overlaps rectangle it doesn't actually

913
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:13,579
get an entity passed so that's really

914
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:15,858
actually just doing the volume check to

915
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:20,390
see the if these intersections occur

916
00:47:15,858 --> 00:47:23,298
right so what I think that means is we

917
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:28,848
can just pass those down right so we can

918
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:30,619
just say look here's the the the

919
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:34,720
collision volume in the end of EP and

920
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:37,849
then here is the bounds and if if that

921
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:40,909
overlap happens then there was something

922
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:52,730
there so we would return true in this

923
00:47:40,909 --> 00:47:54,409
case okay so that's more or less all

924
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:56,778
we're talking about and again there's

925
00:47:54,409 --> 00:47:58,098
just there's sort of like the old

926
00:47:56,778 --> 00:47:59,268
collision stuff flying that now we

927
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:02,259
probably want to go in there and

928
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:04,998
actually get that collision stuff

929
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:06,230
whipped into shape and make sure we have

930
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:08,449
collision farms or anything we can draw

931
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:12,588
them today and make sure that they all

932
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:13,939
do stuff as well um so here what I want

933
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:15,920
to do is say well we've got this world

934
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:18,289
position we don't care about that we can

935
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,909
just do where that action we can

936
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:24,470
actually just create sort of the

937
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:26,929
location of that thing in the in the

938
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:28,278
space of the region itself I'll be

939
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:30,318
honest I don't actually even know why

940
00:48:28,278 --> 00:48:32,809
that's there if we look at place entity

941
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:34,730
I don't know why we're using world

942
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:36,710
positions because we don't actually need

943
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:39,108
it in fact you can see right here us

944
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:40,159
actually doing the subtraction in the

945
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:42,710
first place

946
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:47,440
so again a lot of stuff eligible for

947
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:47,440
cleanup here as we start to move down

948
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:54,528
and clean up how the entity stuff is

949
00:48:52,789 --> 00:48:55,910
working we should be able to kind of get

950
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:57,409
rid of a lot of this busy work because

951
00:48:55,909 --> 00:48:58,670
we don't actually need to be working in

952
00:48:57,409 --> 00:49:01,098
terms of world position where we kind of

953
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:04,400
inherited that from the fact that we

954
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:06,170
used to generate stuff that way but none

955
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,568
of this stuff is necessary all you would

956
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:11,539
need to know is

957
00:49:08,568 --> 00:49:13,099
where your corner world position was and

958
00:49:11,539 --> 00:49:15,589
then all of this stuff would just be

959
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:17,739
based off of that right so this is all

960
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:20,438
stupid and we don't really need to do it

961
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:23,659
it's just coming at everything

962
00:49:20,438 --> 00:49:26,538
completely backwards and so we probably

963
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:28,009
want to stop working with these I mean

964
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:32,719
right here we could probably just say to

965
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:36,759
do Casey now that we edit in similar

966
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:41,449
region space there is no reason for all

967
00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:45,918
this world position nonsense right

968
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:48,409
because world positions actually they're

969
00:49:45,918 --> 00:49:50,418
just a storage format and since we're

970
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:52,458
only creating like a local region at any

971
00:49:50,418 --> 00:49:54,469
given time we don't ever need to talk

972
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:56,899
about them they're really something that

973
00:49:54,469 --> 00:50:02,958
only has to occur when you go to like

974
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:05,599
pack the world back for storage so that

975
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:08,298
you can have huge worlds without

976
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,349
floating-point precision issues but we

977
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:12,829
don't need to talk about them here

978
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:14,798
they're just kind of a waste of time and

979
00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:18,289
we should probably just stop using them

980
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:20,329
but anyway that's fine this same code

981
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:25,189
would work just fine right so we can say

982
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:32,449
like look the location of this thing is

983
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:36,408
it's pretty straightforward anyway it

984
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:38,900
would just look like this and that would

985
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:40,999
allow us to say okay now we know what

986
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:44,150
the actual you know position of this

987
00:50:40,998 --> 00:50:46,399
thing is and so at that point if we know

988
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:48,979
this the query region part here and the

989
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,579
cube key thing here now we can make cube

990
00:50:48,978 --> 00:50:55,358
P and P kind of work together and say

991
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:58,849
all right the rectangle

992
00:50:55,358 --> 00:51:01,130
all right rather the query region here

993
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:02,179
just needs to be offset by this position

994
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,939
and we're good to go

995
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:07,099
so we can say like offset this thing by

996
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:11,538
this and that's you know gonna give us

997
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:13,909
the location that we actually need so I

998
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:18,169
think that properly produces everything

999
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:20,269
but yeah I'm not 100% sure let's start

1000
00:51:18,168 --> 00:51:22,670
by calling it and we'll sort of look

1001
00:51:20,268 --> 00:51:24,769
into how it's actually working

1002
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,789
my biggest thing that we probably want

1003
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:27,679
to focus on now

1004
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:30,110
although we could go ahead and fix this

1005
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:31,849
whole part about using world positions

1006
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,430
for no reason that's probably a good

1007
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:36,380
thing to do maybe we'll do that tomorrow

1008
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:37,609
but this call right here again is the

1009
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,110
biggest thing I think we'll start to

1010
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:42,650
focus on because we want to start making

1011
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:44,120
the sim region be more powerful and not

1012
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:46,309
have to loop over all these entities all

1013
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:47,869
the time to answer simple questions we

1014
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:49,099
want to have a good spatial query system

1015
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:51,589
in there so that's probably another

1016
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:55,670
thing we'll focus on so going into the

1017
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:58,820
sim region actually sorry going into the

1018
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,170
world Jen first we need to actually tell

1019
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,450
it to generate some of these aprons

1020
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:03,800
right now we've never requested any so

1021
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:09,769
you know if I go to like the orphanage

1022
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:13,580
for example um what we haven't done

1023
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:16,840
right now know what this is talking

1024
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:19,429
about I thought we already did that

1025
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:21,309
delete that because since I don't know

1026
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:24,049
what it means it can't really help us um

1027
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:25,880
in here right when we generate all these

1028
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,680
room specs what we want to do is say

1029
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,740
well let's go ahead and make sure that

1030
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:34,869
these specs actually have apron specs

1031
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:39,729
where they need to right so if I said

1032
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:39,730
Jen apron spec

1033
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:54,089
and I make one of these then what I can

1034
00:52:52,019 --> 00:53:07,500
do is say alright all of these things

1035
00:52:54,090 --> 00:53:08,309
that that we created here right maybe I

1036
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,860
want to do that

1037
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:12,090
now it could be that really I would like

1038
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,099
to be able to make it a little simpler

1039
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,900
so since that's something that we

1040
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:17,699
probably put on a lot of things maybe

1041
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,460
I'll just make that be part of the Jen's

1042
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:23,429
backhaul so when we make one of these

1043
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:25,909
you can optionally pass like hey I want

1044
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:30,389
this apron here

1045
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:33,029
no I'm saying and then that should

1046
00:53:30,389 --> 00:53:36,059
probably sufficient so if we go to the

1047
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:39,480
gemspec call when we create one of these

1048
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:44,900
things I should be able to do like a Jen

1049
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:48,119
aprons Beck call here right

1050
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:50,970
and so we here where we create one of

1051
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:53,519
these if you want to pass an apron spec

1052
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:56,069
to it it'll automatically put it in

1053
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:59,159
there for you but like you don't have to

1054
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:04,140
and then in here we would just say okay

1055
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:14,369
when you create one of these gets

1056
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:17,759
initialized to zero and off you go

1057
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:22,489
I think that would do it don't quote me

1058
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,490
on that though and I think

1059
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:41,030
I think that's it and that should just

1060
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,190
start calling the apron generator and

1061
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:45,050
the a breeze in our values won't work

1062
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:47,360
properly yet because I don't really

1063
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:49,400
think that that collude that overlap

1064
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:52,849
call is correct so I think we're

1065
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:55,519
probably like over generating stuff now

1066
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:56,750
but you can see like what I was trying

1067
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:58,550
to do already like you see how there's

1068
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:01,579
like now there's you know grass tiles

1069
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:05,480
out there that's what I want right I

1070
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:07,130
wanted grass tiles and hopefully you

1071
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,019
know now you can't really get to places

1072
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:11,000
and you know I don't know if eight was

1073
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:14,050
enough but hopefully now you you know

1074
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,750
you've always got these sort of grassy

1075
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:26,600
grassy bits there and that way you can

1076
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:28,699
kind of see yeah you can just you can

1077
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:34,029
just always see something outside the

1078
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:36,409
place where you are which is the goal so

1079
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,880
again I suspect probably what's

1080
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:39,319
happening though is we're generating way

1081
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,460
too many of them like I suspected even

1082
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,740
though you can't see it we're probably

1083
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:44,659
generating ones underneath like here

1084
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:46,339
maybe I don't really know maybe our

1085
00:55:44,659 --> 00:55:49,069
collision call is actually working I

1086
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,590
doubt it but that's all I wanted you can

1087
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:53,600
sort of see how now it looks like

1088
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:55,309
there's stuff outside of the world area

1089
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,219
which is what I wanted when we come down

1090
00:55:55,309 --> 00:56:00,349
here right the dungeon areas don't have

1091
00:55:58,219 --> 00:56:02,119
aprons associated with them so you can

1092
00:56:00,349 --> 00:56:04,599
see that they're not getting any which

1093
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:08,119
is exactly what I wanted so that's good

1094
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:12,980
so all of this looks fine that seems

1095
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:15,349
good and yeah like you can see that the

1096
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:17,990
apron is exactly what I wanted which is

1097
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:23,239
eight wide around everything that may be

1098
00:56:17,989 --> 00:56:26,329
overkill I'm not sure and I guess I'll

1099
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:30,679
be honest I I don't really see much over

1100
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:33,170
generation there although well there I

1101
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:38,449
do see some right so it's generating

1102
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:41,269
multiple things around that so basically

1103
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:46,179
the apron at the very least it's not

1104
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:46,179
picking up its own stuff right

1105
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:52,200
probably because these cube pieces don't

1106
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,740
have collision geometry associated with

1107
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:55,649
them right

1108
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:57,269
so there's actually lots of aprons tiles

1109
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:02,039
probably stacked on top of each other

1110
00:56:57,269 --> 00:57:06,150
here what I could do is draw the cubes

1111
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:10,920
as outlines to see that as well which I

1112
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:12,030
think we might want to do but let me

1113
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,630
just kind of play with this a little bit

1114
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:17,760
first

1115
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:22,950
so yeah let's suppose in fact maybe I

1116
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:26,640
don't look at this so in here right when

1117
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:28,409
we're doing place entity we're really

1118
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:31,289
not doing anything to give this thing a

1119
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:33,779
collision region and so if I did want to

1120
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:36,900
give it a collision region for the cube

1121
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:38,790
what I would want to do is yeah if we

1122
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:42,150
look at the way those entities have

1123
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:44,190
collision volumes set up what we could

1124
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:48,360
see in here is probably that there's

1125
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:51,030
just one collision volume rectangle yeah

1126
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:53,630
I and so you just set whatever the

1127
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:56,130
volume is this thing is supposed to

1128
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:59,460
occupy and that's what we're gonna be

1129
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:02,190
colliding it against for something like

1130
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:04,740
this it means that anytime in here that

1131
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:06,000
we add an entity we need to actually set

1132
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:09,750
whatever that collision volume is going

1133
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:13,559
to be if you look in here when we create

1134
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:15,389
sort of the entity we don't give it a

1135
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,079
collision volume anywhere for these

1136
00:58:15,389 --> 00:58:19,710
ground tiles

1137
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:21,529
I don't think let me take a quick look

1138
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:24,889
to make sure I'm not wrong about that

1139
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,890
but if I

1140
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:36,650
yeah I mean you can see that we don't we

1141
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:39,080
don't do anything with the collision

1142
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,940
volumes there right so I think what we

1143
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:44,750
want to do is just set a collision

1144
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:46,460
volume here that we can see and that

1145
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,960
would hopefully also give us the ability

1146
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,360
to verify if there weren't multiple

1147
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:55,849
things in one like on top of each other

1148
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:58,640
so let me first add them to try and

1149
00:58:55,849 --> 00:59:00,980
prevent aprons from being generated on

1150
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:04,339
top of themselves and then we'll add

1151
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:07,010
them for the main ones as well I think

1152
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,680
that's mostly what we want to do so when

1153
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:11,810
we have the entity here and we're gonna

1154
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,579
sort of place it down I think all I

1155
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:16,009
should have to do for the apron part of

1156
00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:19,639
things is just say well we just said

1157
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:23,600
what it's you know rectangle was it's

1158
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:29,139
this and so if that's all we need we

1159
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:33,440
should be able to just pass that down as

1160
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:34,759
the collision volume right and we can

1161
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:45,170
start to clean this up a little bit more

1162
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:46,640
as we go what's here so now these things

1163
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:49,519
each of these things should have

1164
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:51,710
collision volumes I'll be honest the

1165
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:58,670
fact that they're not being drawn

1166
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:59,960
doesn't fill me with confidence that may

1167
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:02,349
just because they don't participate in

1168
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,349
collision

1169
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:15,449
let's take a look so you can see here

1170
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:17,969
that we switch on whether or not the

1171
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:20,099
entity has a collision volume that has

1172
01:00:17,969 --> 01:00:21,929
any volume to it and then we just set

1173
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:24,059
the color based on whether or not it

1174
01:00:21,929 --> 01:00:29,789
collides but we should be pushing a

1175
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:46,349
volume outlined here based on the entity

1176
01:00:29,789 --> 01:00:50,630
location and the collision volume so you

1177
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:53,969
would assume that we would therefore see

1178
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:57,259
collision volumes for all of these apron

1179
01:00:53,969 --> 01:01:02,519
entities right

1180
01:00:57,259 --> 01:01:04,559
and yet I don't and I suppose you can

1181
01:01:02,518 --> 01:01:06,268
you can see that it's not working either

1182
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,400
because they're not yeah they're not

1183
01:01:06,268 --> 01:01:13,828
actually climbing sure so I'm not sure

1184
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:19,048
why this wouldn't be making them all

1185
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:22,380
show up that way I'm not just I'm have

1186
01:01:19,048 --> 01:01:25,920
to step into that and see because I

1187
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:27,568
don't have any idea why why that

1188
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,519
wouldn't give us right because the only

1189
01:01:27,568 --> 01:01:31,829
I don't see anything else here other

1190
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:34,198
than just checking if the collision

1191
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:36,890
volume has area which it would seem like

1192
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:36,889
it would have to

1193
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,579
although actually I guess there is one

1194
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:56,809
reason why it wouldn't which is this

1195
01:01:52,579 --> 01:02:00,858
makes it smaller than itself so let's

1196
01:01:56,809 --> 01:02:08,239
try this as unwise as this may be i'ma

1197
01:02:00,858 --> 01:02:14,630
turn off cube rendering entirely and see

1198
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:16,189
what I can see there right okay so

1199
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,269
that's all it was it's just that they're

1200
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,780
kind of you know you can't see them

1201
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:25,880
because they're inside right and so now

1202
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:28,519
if we look I think this is actually

1203
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:31,430
working just fine because what you can

1204
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:32,838
see is that when it goes to check the

1205
01:02:31,429 --> 01:02:35,358
volume to see if it should play

1206
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:37,719
something there it will stack more than

1207
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:42,380
one on top of itself if they can fit

1208
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:44,389
right so I think all we have to do there

1209
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:47,630
is just make sure that when we query

1210
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:50,420
that we shouldn't use the same query

1211
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,980
region as the collision region so I

1212
01:02:50,420 --> 01:03:03,909
think what we want to do here is say

1213
01:02:51,980 --> 01:03:07,639
like collision region equals this right

1214
01:03:03,909 --> 01:03:09,920
and so we use the collision region to

1215
01:03:07,639 --> 01:03:13,759
create the thing but then the query

1216
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:17,210
region should actually be like something

1217
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:19,250
that's taller and extends more like it

1218
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:24,369
has different Z bounds than this does

1219
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:36,949
right and so maybe it's something like

1220
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:38,960
yeah maybe it's something like weari

1221
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:44,750
region

1222
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:48,570
Maxie is like quite a bit larger or

1223
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:55,590
something just to make sure it can pick

1224
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:58,460
up anything in that area right I don't

1225
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:58,460
know if I did that correctly

1226
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:12,748
looks pretty good well does it actually

1227
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:12,748
no it doesn't

1228
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:24,549
No No maybe it does it's hard to read

1229
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:27,269
when you only see that part of it let's

1230
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,269
take a look here

1231
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:42,469
so there you can see that it still

1232
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:47,569
doesn't seem to be working properly

1233
01:04:42,469 --> 01:04:49,429
there right because it should never be

1234
01:04:47,568 --> 01:04:52,239
able to do that because the query region

1235
01:04:49,429 --> 01:04:52,239
should have been much taller

1236
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:25,210
hmm well temporarily show me what the

1237
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:25,209
query region actually is why don't you

1238
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,979
so that's not as high as I thought it

1239
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:34,078
was it still should have prevented any

1240
01:05:31,978 --> 01:05:45,328
of those double additions though I would

1241
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:47,640
think and I definitely saw yeah like I

1242
01:05:45,329 --> 01:05:50,028
thought worse I thought I saw a double

1243
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:50,028
audition

1244
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,700
let's move outward from here

1245
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:10,750
all right

1246
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,489
maybe I didn't I don't see any now which

1247
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,889
is weird

1248
01:06:15,489 --> 01:06:21,789
maybe I was hallucinating and that we

1249
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:23,228
did fix it always makes me a little bit

1250
01:06:21,789 --> 01:06:26,410
nervous though if I think I saw a bug

1251
01:06:23,228 --> 01:06:34,478
and I don't see a bug I think it's just

1252
01:06:26,409 --> 01:06:37,210
hiding so it may be that adding the

1253
01:06:34,478 --> 01:06:40,868
coalition volume as the query region and

1254
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:43,599
thus expanding it is what actually

1255
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:46,420
allows it to work properly so it could

1256
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,130
be that actually when you have one of

1257
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:52,599
the full regions and one of the other

1258
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:55,450
ones it can stack I guess that makes

1259
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:57,068
sense because if you yeah you could

1260
01:06:55,449 --> 01:07:00,968
stack on top of each other if you don't

1261
01:06:57,068 --> 01:07:08,048
provide that sort of extra collision so

1262
01:07:00,969 --> 01:07:09,759
I suppose that would make sense so I

1263
01:07:08,048 --> 01:07:12,130
don't know how I feel about that if that

1264
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:15,009
was the case you know yeah we would need

1265
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:17,588
something like this right we would need

1266
01:07:15,009 --> 01:07:18,309
to expand it more I don't know if that's

1267
01:07:17,588 --> 01:07:20,170
a good idea

1268
01:07:18,309 --> 01:07:25,420
I feel like there's reasons why it might

1269
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:26,559
not be but maybe that's the right maybe

1270
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:36,789
that's the right solution for now I'm

1271
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:45,640
not sure so I think that probably gives

1272
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:47,319
us mostly what we want and I think now

1273
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:49,768
we've gotten rid of most of those double

1274
01:07:47,318 --> 01:07:49,768
editions

1275
01:07:52,639 --> 01:08:05,150
I think so anyway alright so if I was to

1276
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,380
go ahead and turn off volume rendering

1277
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:08,360
for now we should we should put some

1278
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:09,920
debug switches in so we can just turn

1279
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:12,170
these on and off without recompiling

1280
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:17,840
because you know they're pretty common

1281
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:19,550
things that we do um so yeah like if we

1282
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,860
look now I think we've pretty much got

1283
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:23,779
in it under control like how we would

1284
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:26,449
add the stuff for the apron and that's

1285
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:31,039
really all I wanted with something along

1286
01:08:26,449 --> 01:08:32,869
those lines right and you know we should

1287
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:35,029
probably have them be we should probably

1288
01:08:32,869 --> 01:08:40,539
get the colors under control so that the

1289
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:47,599
apron colors match the colors otherwise

1290
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:49,430
for the most part so I'm kind of

1291
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,940
interested in that so you can see it

1292
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:57,170
looks like the query to test to see

1293
01:08:52,939 --> 01:09:01,819
whether or not there was any occupying

1294
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:04,789
people like the fact that there was

1295
01:09:01,819 --> 01:09:06,649
stuff under there made it so that it

1296
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:08,869
didn't fill and that was kind of what I

1297
01:09:06,649 --> 01:09:12,799
was worried about and so I think that

1298
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:14,180
means our query might be like wrong you

1299
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:17,239
know I'm saying it's it's picking up

1300
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:19,670
stuff from lower let's take a look at

1301
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:27,409
what those query regions actually look

1302
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:29,390
like well that won't help us but yeah

1303
01:09:27,409 --> 01:09:31,789
let's let's rerun it and see what those

1304
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:35,860
look like so that we can get a sense for

1305
01:09:31,789 --> 01:09:38,029
what it's actually picking up there ah

1306
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:41,960
you know what it is picking up it's

1307
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:45,319
picking up the room that's what it's

1308
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:47,810
picking up so we can probably get rid of

1309
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:50,840
that because it's not a real entity in

1310
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:53,690
that sense but you can see why this is

1311
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:56,270
kind of a delicate process right so we

1312
01:09:53,689 --> 01:10:00,349
want yet but but that's if when we do

1313
01:09:56,270 --> 01:10:02,000
that entity query here we can just say

1314
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:04,970
look if it's a room if it's the room

1315
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,579
you're talking about we don't really

1316
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:16,650
care about

1317
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:20,970
that why is that chump failing dump two

1318
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:22,829
overlapping entities exist why is it

1319
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:25,440
going there that's really weird

1320
01:10:22,829 --> 01:10:28,529
I mean I guess it's nearby to it but not

1321
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:40,379
really anyway so in here we want to do

1322
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:43,369
like if it's a not a room right we don't

1323
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:46,529
want to use like those kind of volume

1324
01:10:43,369 --> 01:10:48,210
queries what we could do is have a flag

1325
01:10:46,529 --> 01:10:51,899
for this as well we're we're just saying

1326
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:54,980
look is this a an entity that doesn't

1327
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:58,679
occupy space you know that isn't

1328
01:10:54,979 --> 01:11:02,549
relevant right and I'm not sure how we

1329
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:06,860
want to necessarily treat that but if we

1330
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,860
look at how we do room stuff in general

1331
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:15,600
you can see it's it's really just this

1332
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:18,409
special query here we may want to do

1333
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,410
something like this

1334
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:36,890
so we'll just make a way of testing that

1335
01:11:34,819 --> 01:11:38,750
here like this

1336
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:43,480
and then we can say like oh well if it's

1337
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:43,479
a room do this thing

1338
01:11:53,448 --> 01:11:57,919
and so then I think we'll start to get

1339
01:11:55,579 --> 01:12:00,738
into issues that we would have to

1340
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:04,039
address there in fact you can kind of

1341
01:12:00,738 --> 01:12:09,229
see exactly what our what our problem is

1342
01:12:04,039 --> 01:12:13,310
now so now we have the issue of the room

1343
01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:16,159
area doesn't prevent us from creating

1344
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:18,580
stuff inside there right so maybe this

1345
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,579
was a bad idea

1346
01:12:19,689 --> 01:12:24,889
and so we can fix that in one of two

1347
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:32,780
ways I'm just trying to side which way

1348
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:36,739
uh what's going on here maybe oh we may

1349
01:12:32,779 --> 01:12:39,109
have just overflowed our actual output

1350
01:12:36,738 --> 01:12:41,389
buffer there so looking at that I guess

1351
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:42,859
I'd uh you know I guess I really don't

1352
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:44,810
want that I do want the room be able to

1353
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:51,859
do it but the problem is I need to make

1354
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:54,170
sure that I don't look I don't look too

1355
01:12:51,859 --> 01:12:57,198
far down into where that other room

1356
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:59,300
would be and I'm not sure how to manage

1357
01:12:57,198 --> 01:13:01,549
those two concerns right but this gives

1358
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:02,989
us a really nice thing that keeping it

1359
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:04,250
out of the room was actually good

1360
01:13:02,988 --> 01:13:05,599
because not only did it prevent us from

1361
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,069
having to deal with any of the other

1362
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,510
minutiae but it means like stairwells

1363
01:13:07,069 --> 01:13:10,969
and stuff where there wouldn't be things

1364
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:14,510
the room boundary prevents you from from

1365
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:17,029
filling that in as well which I want and

1366
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:19,789
so I'm just not sure how to deal with

1367
01:13:17,029 --> 01:13:26,809
the query otherwise what is what is this

1368
01:13:19,789 --> 01:13:31,159
what is happening here we've got to wear

1369
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:34,699
it we're too many for one dispatch when

1370
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:38,000
we're doing our push quads here right so

1371
01:13:34,698 --> 01:13:39,799
it's like somehow this thing is not

1372
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,250
correctly anticipating how many of these

1373
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:46,789
things are going to come down to break

1374
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:49,429
the batch up because right like here's

1375
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:53,090
base index and well I guess I can't do

1376
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:54,500
it because we're in in release mode but

1377
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:56,449
you can see what this this is an

1378
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:59,149
assertion here that's saying I need to

1379
01:13:56,448 --> 01:14:01,969
be able to fit my vertex base into a

1380
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:05,149
16-bit value because if I can't we won't

1381
01:14:01,969 --> 01:14:07,100
be able to use just 16-bit virtus 16-bit

1382
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:09,469
vertex indices

1383
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:10,670
in order to do it which is all we're

1384
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:12,440
using right now so this is like

1385
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:24,859
overflowing the number of these that

1386
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:28,549
we're actually creating that's a bug

1387
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:31,189
because inside the renderer we were

1388
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:34,159
supposed to create new batches every

1389
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:36,589
time we overflowed that number and so

1390
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:39,559
that's a little bit weird and I'm not

1391
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:47,230
sure why we were getting that I want to

1392
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:51,320
say that we did that but maybe we didn't

1393
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:55,909
know it's right here so match max quads

1394
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:58,549
per batch is supposed to be checked here

1395
01:14:55,909 --> 01:15:03,529
where we say however many quads you were

1396
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:05,659
going to do had better not be greater

1397
01:15:03,529 --> 01:15:13,460
than the number maximum number that you

1398
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:17,569
can have right so the fact that that's

1399
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:19,579
not working is not reassuring let me go

1400
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:20,779
ahead and build a debug build so that we

1401
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:23,449
can take a look at why that's not

1402
01:15:20,779 --> 01:15:26,449
working because that's kind of important

1403
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:29,539
and we don't really want that to be a

1404
01:15:26,449 --> 01:15:37,159
lurking bug because you'll get render

1405
01:15:29,539 --> 01:15:39,079
artifacts if you if not right okay so I

1406
01:15:37,159 --> 01:15:41,750
guess all I did was kind of hop out

1407
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:49,430
towards the other part here right like

1408
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:51,590
somewhere and so looking at this you can

1409
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:54,500
see even do Zack what I said right we

1410
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:57,260
ended up in a place where are we just

1411
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:59,270
have pushed too many of these what I

1412
01:15:57,260 --> 01:16:03,800
don't understand is when we in this

1413
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:07,690
function looked at the number of quads

1414
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,690
we were pushing down I'm just wondering

1415
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:15,538
I guess we well you know the thing is

1416
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:17,760
we're not actually calling get current

1417
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:21,658
Claud so who who was responsible for

1418
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:25,940
that call

1419
01:16:21,658 --> 01:16:25,939
pushing line segments on here

1420
01:16:33,878 --> 01:16:41,559
well can't say it wasn't pretty

1421
01:16:38,498 --> 01:16:43,510
straightforward like it's basically

1422
01:16:41,559 --> 01:16:46,119
saying make sure we have room for six

1423
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:55,748
quads does that look like six squads to

1424
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:58,268
you no it does not case anyone was

1425
01:16:55,748 --> 01:17:03,578
wondering that is something we actually

1426
01:16:58,269 --> 01:17:07,449
call 12 which is related to six but it's

1427
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:09,549
not six so I think that's probably all

1428
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:12,219
we're dealing with there is failure to

1429
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:19,769
reserve a place to actually dump those

1430
01:17:12,219 --> 01:17:19,769
vertices not our finest hour

1431
01:17:23,789 --> 01:17:32,369
yeah all right and Sue back to the

1432
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:36,630
original problem I just don't know how I

1433
01:17:32,369 --> 01:17:40,470
want to make sure I get information

1434
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:43,140
about things occupying the bottom I

1435
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:45,869
here's here's the way I think I want to

1436
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:48,480
do it I think what I want to do is take

1437
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:51,899
a different approach let's suppose that

1438
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:57,000
what we actually want here is when we

1439
01:17:51,899 --> 01:17:59,759
produce this query region here what I

1440
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:05,159
want to do is not offset the query

1441
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:07,260
region Z wise pop probably at all so

1442
01:18:05,159 --> 01:18:11,099
what I want to do I think is something

1443
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:15,570
more along the lines of get rid of this

1444
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:18,380
stuff that's gone when we produce this

1445
01:18:15,569 --> 01:18:25,130
we want to make sure the Z is like flat

1446
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:30,449
so yeah this should be fine and this

1447
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:32,850
maybe is that something like this

1448
01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:41,010
probably makes a little bit more sense

1449
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:42,510
to me at the moment let's take a look at

1450
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:49,770
this and then we can play with this a

1451
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:55,079
little bit separately all right so if I

1452
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:59,130
run this you can see that everything's

1453
01:18:55,079 --> 01:19:02,220
flat now right and hopefully that means

1454
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:04,560
that now it will correctly avoid rooms

1455
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:07,860
where rooms are but not where rooms

1456
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:15,230
aren't maybe and we'll see whether

1457
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:15,229
that's true or not not quite

1458
01:19:16,729 --> 01:19:20,299
and you can see why that is so those are

1459
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,399
flat and there right so they need to be

1460
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:25,429
lifted up because these are to load down

1461
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:26,899
to you can actually see so yeah we just

1462
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:29,210
want to make sure we're careful about

1463
01:19:26,899 --> 01:19:31,839
our placement here I guess is how this

1464
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:31,840
wants to work

1465
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:44,130
so yeah

1466
01:19:48,139 --> 01:19:59,750
I guess we just want the world Peas

1467
01:19:53,800 --> 01:20:01,900
offset Z to be half the wall height to

1468
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:05,198
place it at the right location and

1469
01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:05,198
that's it

1470
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,619
is this correctly aligned now

1471
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:25,198
no it's still too low down you can see

1472
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:27,210
it cooks down into the bottom room so

1473
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,399
what is going on here how can we don't

1474
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:31,889
know like where our floor is and stuff

1475
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:33,149
like something's busted we should figure

1476
01:20:31,889 --> 01:20:35,340
out what's going on here because this

1477
01:20:33,149 --> 01:20:39,420
doesn't really make much sense to me

1478
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:41,610
like we know what the bottom part of the

1479
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:46,440
room is like somebody's creating this

1480
01:20:41,609 --> 01:20:50,460
room like here's the room volume in

1481
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:53,189
question right we've got the volume for

1482
01:20:50,460 --> 01:21:05,729
the room is the main room P max room P

1483
01:20:53,189 --> 01:21:07,018
which is created like this way and I

1484
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:10,380
feel like this stuff is just all kind of

1485
01:21:07,019 --> 01:21:12,979
sloppy but I mean we want these things

1486
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:15,538
to be lying directly on the floor area

1487
01:21:12,979 --> 01:21:17,010
so that they're contained within the

1488
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:19,228
room that they're supposed to be a

1489
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:21,659
pronoun not contained within the room

1490
01:21:19,229 --> 01:21:23,989
but at the same level as the room

1491
01:21:21,658 --> 01:21:27,509
they're supposed to be apron a right I

1492
01:21:23,988 --> 01:21:30,209
mean that's what we would expect and so

1493
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:33,269
that just seems kind of busted and weird

1494
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:39,899
and I don't like it so what I would

1495
01:21:33,269 --> 01:21:45,889
prefer here is yeah if this was just if

1496
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:49,170
this was just more sane the way this is

1497
01:21:45,889 --> 01:21:54,090
currently working looks like if you

1498
01:21:49,170 --> 01:22:01,979
place something for whatever reason at

1499
01:21:54,090 --> 01:22:06,210
the floor Z if you play something at a

1500
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:08,999
floor at a Z of zero it's still it's too

1501
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:12,269
low so it needs to be up like half a

1502
01:22:08,998 --> 01:22:14,698
tile dim or something I don't quite get

1503
01:22:12,269 --> 01:22:16,469
it I feel like I want to how much time

1504
01:22:14,698 --> 01:22:23,369
how much time do I have what am i got i

1505
01:22:16,469 --> 01:22:26,489
got 25 minutes let's say baby

1506
01:22:23,369 --> 01:22:28,859
uh I want to clean this up so that we

1507
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:31,050
have some idea of where everything's

1508
01:22:28,859 --> 01:22:32,819
going so I think I'm gonna make that be

1509
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:34,680
what our job is now cuz I think that's

1510
01:22:32,819 --> 01:22:36,840
the only thing that's actually standing

1511
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:40,350
in our way here and I don't like the way

1512
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:42,029
this looks so I think part as part of

1513
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:47,480
that too getting these world positions

1514
01:22:42,029 --> 01:22:50,069
out of here would be a good good start

1515
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:53,369
alright so let's think about this a

1516
01:22:50,069 --> 01:22:57,000
little bit differently what I want to do

1517
01:22:53,369 --> 01:23:00,720
is I want to I want to take a look at

1518
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,949
these room volumes right and so if we

1519
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:05,340
take a look at where these room volumes

1520
01:23:01,949 --> 01:23:07,979
are and I look at how things are

1521
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:09,690
arranged in the room volumes you can see

1522
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:11,609
there that we've got that offset I

1523
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:14,250
believe what that offset was designed to

1524
01:23:11,609 --> 01:23:17,159
do is to give us a safe region right so

1525
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:20,850
everything's like comes up off of the

1526
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:23,159
bottom of that room floor right and soo

1527
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:26,370
I'm guessing and I guess I don't know

1528
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:28,349
but I'm guessing that the best the best

1529
01:23:26,369 --> 01:23:32,460
way to or the best rule of thumb to

1530
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:36,300
follow here would be to when we create

1531
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:41,100
an edit region that a Z of 0 is the

1532
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:44,850
floor is not the floor is the the bottom

1533
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:51,240
the base the the lowest part of the room

1534
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:53,850
volume is 0 right and so yet you know if

1535
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:58,710
we were to do that and in here you know

1536
01:23:53,850 --> 01:24:00,420
we look at how we're doing this this

1537
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:03,960
stuff here with the change Center right

1538
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:08,149
all that stuff so if we wanted to make 0

1539
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:15,119
be the bottom when we get back this

1540
01:24:08,149 --> 01:24:18,619
right we would just save 0 lies along

1541
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:22,260
the bottom of the thing that means that

1542
01:24:18,619 --> 01:24:27,630
when we record the volume of the actual

1543
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:30,390
room which is here this would not we

1544
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:33,119
don't need these two things really right

1545
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:36,850
and what we want to do instead is talk

1546
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:38,619
about it like in here right

1547
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:46,270
fact we could just say look the min room

1548
01:24:38,619 --> 01:24:47,619
P Z is always zero right just to give

1549
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:50,170
you some example of what I'm talking

1550
01:24:47,619 --> 01:24:52,710
about there so let's suppose that we

1551
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:54,909
said something like that where is that

1552
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:57,939
actually lying right now

1553
01:24:54,909 --> 01:25:00,130
right and it looks like that's what

1554
01:24:57,939 --> 01:25:01,689
we're doing right because that looks

1555
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:04,779
like it's basically the same place that

1556
01:25:01,689 --> 01:25:05,919
it was so I think if we just always say

1557
01:25:04,779 --> 01:25:07,989
that zero and let's take a look out here

1558
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,960
where we've got multiple levels and make

1559
01:25:07,989 --> 01:25:12,219
sure that that still does make sense but

1560
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,109
I think it should because again this

1561
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:16,600
placement is all relative to a

1562
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:18,039
simulation region and so if I come out

1563
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,750
here and say you know where is

1564
01:25:18,039 --> 01:25:21,609
everything

1565
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:24,340
it still looks correct to me there right

1566
01:25:21,609 --> 01:25:27,509
we've got the room sort of stacked up

1567
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:31,329
and you know that that all looks

1568
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:34,300
plausible right so let's just work

1569
01:25:31,329 --> 01:25:36,699
backwards from there and like create the

1570
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:40,600
actual room area in like a more sensible

1571
01:25:36,699 --> 01:25:42,579
way so the first thing you wanna do is

1572
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:46,360
I'm gonna pull this stuff up to the top

1573
01:25:42,579 --> 01:25:48,189
right so I'm gonna take this and I'm

1574
01:25:46,359 --> 01:25:51,429
gonna pull this up here so we can work

1575
01:25:48,189 --> 01:25:52,809
with it all together so we've got this

1576
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:55,450
sort of thing that like cracks this

1577
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:58,630
stuff out and says hey here's the room

1578
01:25:55,449 --> 01:26:00,250
volume and all that garbage so let's

1579
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:02,829
take a look at stuff like the tile game

1580
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:06,539
and all that that stuff - right all

1581
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:12,189
right so here we go so if we know that

1582
01:26:06,539 --> 01:26:15,220
the if we know that the minimum Z is

1583
01:26:12,189 --> 01:26:18,309
zero then we also know that the maximum

1584
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:20,680
Z right we can work backwards here and

1585
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:23,680
say well that the maximum is just gonna

1586
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:30,130
be however high the thing was times the

1587
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:34,510
tile dim right I mean that's the height

1588
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:37,529
of the thing so we know that just going

1589
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:42,100
into it there's nothing particularly

1590
01:26:37,529 --> 01:26:44,679
tricky about that similarly if we wanted

1591
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:46,630
to get the bounds of the thing we should

1592
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:49,970
be able to do the same thing in Reverse

1593
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:51,949
for everything right so if we

1594
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:55,520
this was going to be the center of the

1595
01:26:51,949 --> 01:26:57,260
thing that we were working on then we

1596
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:03,200
should be able to figure out the bounds

1597
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:06,470
of everything else by just using you

1598
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:09,109
know the same math if we know that we're

1599
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:12,140
gonna start at the min tile X plus the X

1600
01:27:09,109 --> 01:27:15,829
count over 2 then we should be able to

1601
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:20,570
just say well however much the you know

1602
01:27:15,829 --> 01:27:23,720
however much the X count needs to be to

1603
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:28,099
get out to half way is what we would

1604
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:31,909
need right it'd be like 0.5 times the X

1605
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:35,860
count times the tiled M X right is how

1606
01:27:31,909 --> 01:27:39,439
wide the room should be and similarly

1607
01:27:35,859 --> 01:27:45,049
the same thing would be true in Y right

1608
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:49,129
and the max room P is just the same as

1609
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:52,340
the opposite of the min room P so

1610
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:57,710
there's really nothing we you know fancy

1611
01:27:52,340 --> 01:28:00,440
about that right and so these two things

1612
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:03,699
can actually just be created whole cloth

1613
01:28:00,439 --> 01:28:05,899
they don't really need to operate on

1614
01:28:03,699 --> 01:28:09,649
they don't need to be mapped into a

1615
01:28:05,899 --> 01:28:11,029
chunk space or any of that garbage and I

1616
01:28:09,649 --> 01:28:13,250
don't think we need any of this stuff

1617
01:28:11,029 --> 01:28:16,279
either because we can apply those

1618
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:20,449
directly so we wanted this 1/2 tile dim

1619
01:28:16,279 --> 01:28:23,840
here as an offset so we sort of wanted

1620
01:28:20,449 --> 01:28:28,250
to say it looks like anyway that we're

1621
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:30,319
like 1/2 tile over and I believe that

1622
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:33,050
that's probably that's probably for this

1623
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:35,659
garbage right which again we can now I

1624
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:38,119
think hopefully maybe sort of I'm not

1625
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:42,590
sure but let's pretend possibly that we

1626
01:28:38,119 --> 01:28:45,019
can if we just said let's do this

1627
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:47,569
correctly so this part here where we do

1628
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:49,660
like chunk position from tile position

1629
01:28:47,569 --> 01:28:53,960
and we're like let's get ourselves here

1630
01:28:49,659 --> 01:28:56,840
if this this part here whether this is

1631
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:58,220
an even division or an odd division is

1632
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:00,650
going to control like where we are

1633
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:03,060
alignment wise which is kind of annoying

1634
01:29:00,649 --> 01:29:05,309
right we have here this is

1635
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:07,230
dimensions and in fact we you know we're

1636
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:09,780
computing it you can see right here

1637
01:29:07,229 --> 01:29:12,899
we're computing exactly how big we want

1638
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:14,939
our region pretty exactly here we can

1639
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:18,179
just even get that from them from these

1640
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:19,619
two values eventually if you want to or

1641
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:25,650
we can even do this a little more you

1642
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:40,890
know what I mean we can just do this

1643
01:29:25,649 --> 01:29:44,099
right so we can just say look here's the

1644
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:48,360
room dimensions it's this so the min

1645
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:50,730
room P is just gonna be created off of

1646
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:52,679
the room dimensions or maybe we maybe

1647
01:29:50,729 --> 01:29:54,509
we've and just use that as the way we

1648
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:57,360
map things in in fact why wouldn't we

1649
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:59,369
that makes way more sense because then

1650
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:01,819
that essentially means all we have to do

1651
01:29:59,369 --> 01:30:01,819
is this

1652
01:30:15,849 --> 01:30:21,099
right if we just say instead of the

1653
01:30:19,179 --> 01:30:25,300
chain Center here what if we just said

1654
01:30:21,099 --> 01:30:29,578
look give us the world position of the

1655
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:32,230
min world P this is like the min corner

1656
01:30:29,578 --> 01:30:35,009
and then we would know what the min room

1657
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:37,509
P was here

1658
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:39,159
well I guess technically no we can't do

1659
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:48,340
that because we do want to offset it we

1660
01:30:39,158 --> 01:30:51,908
do want to get to you know we we do want

1661
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:55,360
to start in the middle of the room so I

1662
01:30:51,908 --> 01:31:01,689
suppose there is no real way to do what

1663
01:30:55,359 --> 01:31:03,908
I'm talking about yeah so we do kind of

1664
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:10,839
have to do something where we actually

1665
01:31:03,908 --> 01:31:13,750
find out what that is so oh well anyway

1666
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:15,699
um so if we assume again that we're

1667
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:17,800
gonna place this at the center so the

1668
01:31:15,698 --> 01:31:21,460
sim region is centered on the room and

1669
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:24,940
that's zero but not in Z Z it's at the

1670
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:27,779
actual floor so if we do something along

1671
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:33,939
those lines and then here we say okay

1672
01:31:27,779 --> 01:31:35,948
let's go ahead and take the oh but you

1673
01:31:33,939 --> 01:31:38,769
know what we don't have to Center it we

1674
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:41,019
could choose not to do that because

1675
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:43,690
since we can pass a change rectangle and

1676
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:47,829
that rectangle doesn't have to be zero

1677
01:31:43,689 --> 01:31:50,439
centered I guess we can just do what I

1678
01:31:47,828 --> 01:32:00,460
was going to say so actually you could

1679
01:31:50,439 --> 01:32:02,049
make this be just this right we say look

1680
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:07,210
that's what we're gonna base everything

1681
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:10,090
around here's the room dimension the min

1682
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:14,439
room P therefore is always just zero

1683
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:17,170
zero zero because that's where that part

1684
01:32:14,439 --> 01:32:19,809
of the chain Center is the max room P

1685
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:24,639
therefore is just the rim dimensions

1686
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:28,630
right because we go from zero to two the

1687
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:30,369
room dimensions done right

1688
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:33,550
then when we say what the change

1689
01:32:30,369 --> 01:32:39,250
rectangle is all we're saying is maybe

1690
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:43,360
rect min/max where we've got the min

1691
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:47,439
room P and the max room P and if we want

1692
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:49,569
to add some additional area to that we

1693
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:54,609
can just say all right well why don't

1694
01:32:49,569 --> 01:32:57,549
you just add to that something whatever

1695
01:32:54,609 --> 01:32:59,529
the you know amount is that we want

1696
01:32:57,550 --> 01:33:03,719
there right so maybe we want to say

1697
01:32:59,529 --> 01:33:09,250
let's add four tiles in any direction I

1698
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:10,810
don't know probably not just one tile in

1699
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,060
any direction should be sufficient right

1700
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:15,310
because we don't really do anything

1701
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:18,429
beyond that so maybe like one tile in

1702
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:20,350
any direction is fine not sure we can

1703
01:33:18,429 --> 01:33:23,170
think about that a little bit harder

1704
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:24,820
later but this is the change rectangle

1705
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:30,010
and then off we go so then we can just

1706
01:33:24,819 --> 01:33:40,750
say like change I'm going to call this

1707
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:44,429
change base P and change volume okay

1708
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:44,429
maybe not that's a function apparently

1709
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:57,350
so I think that all works pretty well

1710
01:33:54,140 --> 01:34:00,380
and I think probably that's all we

1711
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:04,820
really need there and I don't know what

1712
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:06,170
this dim Xyz nonsense is there oh it's

1713
01:34:04,819 --> 01:34:10,519
just thick it bit dim for this room

1714
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:12,079
that's fine all right so I think we're

1715
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:16,730
getting closer here to what I actually

1716
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:18,439
want and now we're we've got the min

1717
01:34:16,729 --> 01:34:20,750
room P and the maximum P let's see where

1718
01:34:18,439 --> 01:34:23,449
we're at compile error wise and I'm

1719
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:27,140
gonna start to clean this stuff up the

1720
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:31,670
change Center what is this Oh placing an

1721
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:33,650
entity so when we place the entity for

1722
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:37,909
the collision volume where we've got the

1723
01:34:33,649 --> 01:34:43,009
rect min max min rim P maximum P chain

1724
01:34:37,909 --> 01:34:48,289
Center I guess we can do that cuz I

1725
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:50,300
guess there's no reason not to it's a

1726
01:34:48,289 --> 01:34:52,519
little weird it means that that is not a

1727
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:56,600
centered collision volume but I guess we

1728
01:34:52,520 --> 01:35:02,090
don't care that that isn't a central

1729
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:06,410
collision volume don't know all right so

1730
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:10,360
anyway yeah and now we can see what the

1731
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:14,840
half rectangle issue was there right so

1732
01:35:10,359 --> 01:35:17,569
because those are centered the half rect

1733
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:22,190
bit slides it as an offset because we

1734
01:35:17,569 --> 01:35:25,340
want everything to be on the boundary

1735
01:35:22,189 --> 01:35:30,369
right so this half that's what the half

1736
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:32,960
tyldum displacement was before however

1737
01:35:30,369 --> 01:35:35,390
there's an open question in my mind as

1738
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:41,810
to whether or not we really want that to

1739
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:45,860
be the case like if we think about it do

1740
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:49,280
we really need those to be centered

1741
01:35:45,859 --> 01:35:52,670
positions anyway maybe we want them to

1742
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:54,949
be I don't know but anyway when we look

1743
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:56,989
at how we're doing this this this stuff

1744
01:35:54,949 --> 01:35:59,319
could go away right we don't use that

1745
01:35:56,989 --> 01:35:59,319
anymore

1746
01:36:00,619 --> 01:36:08,640
where that's getting used Oh what are we

1747
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:12,289
using world rooms for anything by the

1748
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:12,289
way I think we're using those for maps

1749
01:36:13,579 --> 01:36:18,119
but that's fine and so what we really

1750
01:36:15,539 --> 01:36:21,658
want here we we don't really need these

1751
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:29,698
for anything other than just like mapped

1752
01:36:21,658 --> 01:36:35,670
into chunk space and so what we want to

1753
01:36:29,698 --> 01:36:41,000
do is just be able to pass that yeah so

1754
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:49,230
we've got our world and our base pose

1755
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:59,520
and our offset but we don't really need

1756
01:36:49,229 --> 01:37:01,468
oh I guess we do so the min room and the

1757
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:04,350
max room values that we created here in

1758
01:37:01,469 --> 01:37:07,980
the minimum maximum peak we need those

1759
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:10,469
to be mapped into chunk space and those

1760
01:37:07,979 --> 01:37:14,759
would be based just off the sim region

1761
01:37:10,469 --> 01:37:20,219
Center so the world position would be

1762
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:27,300
the change base P like so I think that's

1763
01:37:20,219 --> 01:37:28,439
all we actually need there yeah so

1764
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:30,090
that's all fine we don't really use

1765
01:37:28,439 --> 01:37:31,710
those at the moment anyway so then we

1766
01:37:30,090 --> 01:37:36,239
really just have that offset to deal

1767
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:38,969
with and so when we create our our

1768
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:41,729
change base P here I guess what we want

1769
01:37:38,969 --> 01:37:42,210
to do is like the chunk position from

1770
01:37:41,729 --> 01:37:44,539
tabs

1771
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:44,539
oops

1772
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:52,110
the additional offset part we just need

1773
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:53,969
to pass the half tile dim down so I

1774
01:37:52,109 --> 01:37:56,238
think that's it and then I think we're

1775
01:37:53,969 --> 01:37:56,239
good to go

1776
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:07,960
so now all those rooms are tightly

1777
01:38:05,109 --> 01:38:12,309
bounded I believe and so hopefully

1778
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:19,119
that's lo good so moving along to phase

1779
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:22,630
two uh so you know the mint ilex part of

1780
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:27,340
things I want to look now and see does

1781
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:29,470
that actually yeah like like what's all

1782
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:41,619
this garbage and why are we doing all

1783
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:43,360
this stuff so it looks like mostly yeah

1784
01:38:41,619 --> 01:38:47,760
like what we're doing here is using this

1785
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:50,859
for a way of checking the gen grids

1786
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:57,610
which is honestly okay I mean it's not

1787
01:38:50,859 --> 01:39:00,960
horrible but I'm not sure we really want

1788
01:38:57,609 --> 01:39:00,960
to keep that stuff around

1789
01:39:15,069 --> 01:39:21,789
like it'd be nice if we could do this a

1790
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:21,789
little bit more structured here

1791
01:39:34,578 --> 01:39:38,899
yeah

1792
01:39:36,738 --> 01:39:43,488
I don't know I'm still not quite loving

1793
01:39:38,899 --> 01:39:47,119
it uh so floor tiles II what is that

1794
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:51,409
what are we doing with that it's just

1795
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:52,640
min tiles II so I'm not sure why we're

1796
01:39:51,409 --> 01:39:55,010
actually calling it that

1797
01:39:52,640 --> 01:40:02,150
I guess as if the floor could be

1798
01:39:55,010 --> 01:40:04,880
somewhere else yeah I don't know uh

1799
01:40:02,149 --> 01:40:11,210
let's I guess do some of the more basic

1800
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:13,489
stuff first so if we actually want this

1801
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:16,489
to just be normal stuff this jug

1802
01:40:13,488 --> 01:40:19,149
position from tile position stuff again

1803
01:40:16,488 --> 01:40:22,909
we shouldn't really need to do anything

1804
01:40:19,149 --> 01:40:24,469
with that really we should be able to do

1805
01:40:22,909 --> 01:40:27,738
something more like this we just say

1806
01:40:24,469 --> 01:40:30,649
look the position of this thing is

1807
01:40:27,738 --> 01:40:33,229
actually not related to any of that

1808
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:38,000
stuff instead we can just say like the

1809
01:40:33,229 --> 01:40:42,139
position of any one of these things is

1810
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:45,460
just the tile dim x times the X index

1811
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:57,710
plus the tyldum Y times the Y index

1812
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:59,840
right and that's all we really needed we

1813
01:40:57,710 --> 01:41:02,060
don't really need anything else about it

1814
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:04,670
that you know that just tells us where

1815
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:06,770
the thing is and then as we go through

1816
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:09,050
the rest of this code wherever we were

1817
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:12,050
doing stuff like setting the offset or

1818
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:16,210
nonsense like that we should be able to

1819
01:41:12,050 --> 01:41:21,710
now just just talk about this directly

1820
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:24,529
like so and when we place entities we

1821
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:29,329
shouldn't have to use world positions at

1822
01:41:24,529 --> 01:41:36,979
all then either right so when we

1823
01:41:29,329 --> 01:41:41,109
actually call a place entity called like

1824
01:41:36,979 --> 01:41:45,769
this we should be able to make that use

1825
01:41:41,109 --> 01:41:48,420
raw raw code now right

1826
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:50,430
yeah I don't know where are those other

1827
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:52,890
place entity calls what did those what

1828
01:41:50,430 --> 01:41:54,270
are those doing but those are those are

1829
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:57,300
ones that aren't actually working very

1830
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:59,400
fine is so you know this sort of stuff

1831
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:01,860
right in fact we could just say like

1832
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:03,659
that just goes away and so now instead

1833
01:42:01,859 --> 01:42:06,059
of calling place entity you just assign

1834
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:07,939
the position you actually want to the

1835
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:09,840
thing and that's all you had to do

1836
01:42:07,939 --> 01:42:11,039
because that's all you should really

1837
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,600
have to do right you shouldn't have to

1838
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:21,659
do anything more complicated than that

1839
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:25,050
so let's take a look here at here we go

1840
01:42:21,659 --> 01:42:31,769
so this PZ is just that and this place

1841
01:42:25,050 --> 01:42:33,510
entity is just any P equals right so

1842
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:35,550
that then that should be all you have to

1843
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:38,130
actually do and again just trying to get

1844
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:47,810
rid rid of some of this nonsense so it's

1845
01:42:38,130 --> 01:42:52,680
not all up in the way okay so this is

1846
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:54,630
this I don't know why I treated that

1847
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:57,810
like some kind of vector equation it's

1848
01:42:54,630 --> 01:43:07,529
not and I think that's all we need for

1849
01:42:57,810 --> 01:43:09,720
that one we should have gotten a error

1850
01:43:07,529 --> 01:43:14,939
on our other place anybody call yeah

1851
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:18,270
there it is so looking at place entity

1852
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:22,429
here there's also presumably on the

1853
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:24,390
enemy gen code there's a place under the

1854
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:27,770
definition somewhere I don't actually

1855
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:27,770
know if that's true let's take a look

1856
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:32,269
[Music]

1857
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:37,029
is so if I just remove that and so

1858
01:43:35,619 --> 01:43:38,800
people are not calling place entity

1859
01:43:37,029 --> 01:43:41,139
anymore

1860
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:44,619
we should get errors I mean place that's

1861
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:46,030
actually called so you can see in here

1862
01:43:44,619 --> 01:43:49,390
we've got this place in a teepee

1863
01:43:46,029 --> 01:43:52,029
nonsense I'm assuming that that's yeah

1864
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:54,520
it's doing a bunch of garbage like to

1865
01:43:52,029 --> 01:43:57,429
create that P in the first place so

1866
01:43:54,520 --> 01:44:00,550
rather than doing that now we should be

1867
01:43:57,430 --> 01:44:02,440
able to just say hey like where is that

1868
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:04,090
thing and we're done

1869
01:44:02,439 --> 01:44:06,849
right and again this is just trying to

1870
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:09,819
clean up all that old sort of vestigial

1871
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:14,860
remain nonsense and so now you can just

1872
01:44:09,819 --> 01:44:24,489
say alright the glove P is P the head P

1873
01:44:14,859 --> 01:44:25,239
is P and the body P is P right and we're

1874
01:44:24,489 --> 01:44:27,849
gonna have to do that for a couple

1875
01:44:25,239 --> 01:44:30,279
things right cuz that's just this was

1876
01:44:27,850 --> 01:44:33,579
again just sort of an overhang from when

1877
01:44:30,279 --> 01:44:38,649
this this was more annoying and

1878
01:44:33,579 --> 01:44:41,229
confusing so it's really just this stuff

1879
01:44:38,649 --> 01:44:43,269
we don't need you to pass a P to these

1880
01:44:41,229 --> 01:44:46,449
these aren't even called I don't know

1881
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:49,150
why I'm doing this but you know heck

1882
01:44:46,449 --> 01:44:51,779
it's so simple there's no reason not to

1883
01:44:49,149 --> 01:44:54,939
leave them in working order

1884
01:44:51,779 --> 01:44:56,829
okay so then we've got two more here you

1885
01:44:54,939 --> 01:44:58,239
can see this one using the change base P

1886
01:44:56,829 --> 01:45:01,840
we don't actually needed to do that

1887
01:44:58,239 --> 01:45:03,939
because we did them in room P max room P

1888
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:05,350
it means that this entity doesn't need

1889
01:45:03,939 --> 01:45:08,799
to be placed putting it at zero zero

1890
01:45:05,350 --> 01:45:12,490
zeros actually where it should go so

1891
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:15,730
technically you know but just to keep

1892
01:45:12,489 --> 01:45:17,800
the code like correctly semantically

1893
01:45:15,729 --> 01:45:20,139
doing what it should do I'm gonna assign

1894
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:22,270
min room P to it here it just happens to

1895
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:23,800
be zero zero zero that way if we change

1896
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:25,900
it in the future we weren't like setting

1897
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:28,659
a little landmine for ourselves it can't

1898
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:31,449
hurt so then coming through here we can

1899
01:45:28,659 --> 01:45:34,630
now get rid of this sort of part of the

1900
01:45:31,449 --> 01:45:37,449
process and we can probably make this

1901
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:40,119
stuff something that we we share as a

1902
01:45:37,449 --> 01:45:41,800
call but as you can see this is not

1903
01:45:40,119 --> 01:45:44,729
going to fly here now what I could do

1904
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:46,000
obviously just temporarily is to say

1905
01:45:44,729 --> 01:45:50,619
that the

1906
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:53,470
NEP equals you know this because we do

1907
01:45:50,619 --> 01:45:56,380
create an actual p-value so I can do

1908
01:45:53,470 --> 01:45:57,880
that and that should just still work but

1909
01:45:56,380 --> 01:46:00,489
again we want to continue the

1910
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:02,489
simplification process here and get it

1911
01:46:00,489 --> 01:46:07,449
down to something that you know is

1912
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:08,979
cleaner than that right all right

1913
01:46:07,449 --> 01:46:13,539
so looking at me it looks like we still

1914
01:46:08,979 --> 01:46:18,579
have that half offset there that which

1915
01:46:13,539 --> 01:46:20,409
means I must have accidentally yeah

1916
01:46:18,579 --> 01:46:24,699
shifted the placement of these over you

1917
01:46:20,409 --> 01:46:26,800
can actually see that these are still

1918
01:46:24,699 --> 01:46:30,579
placed properly because they're using

1919
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:33,400
the old code and this is not right

1920
01:46:30,579 --> 01:46:38,500
these are shifted relative to where they

1921
01:46:33,399 --> 01:46:39,879
should be which is kind of funny so we

1922
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:42,149
want these things to line up so let's

1923
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:47,590
just double check where I messed that up

1924
01:46:42,149 --> 01:46:51,879
and correct it so here in the generate

1925
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:53,770
room call where we get the base P this

1926
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:54,909
negative half tyldum should have

1927
01:46:53,770 --> 01:46:57,850
Alliance I thought it did when we

1928
01:46:54,909 --> 01:47:00,189
checked it so I wonder if I by assigning

1929
01:46:57,850 --> 01:47:06,370
the P values directly in here I wonder

1930
01:47:00,189 --> 01:47:10,779
if this is somehow off oh I guess that's

1931
01:47:06,369 --> 01:47:14,289
true so the fact that this is using the

1932
01:47:10,779 --> 01:47:15,550
half tile dim slid over it means that

1933
01:47:14,289 --> 01:47:19,960
where we placed the entities will be

1934
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:23,440
slid half dim over as well so I guess

1935
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:26,920
what you want to do is offset these guys

1936
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:28,569
by the half tile dim right so I don't

1937
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:30,940
know which one you want to do because

1938
01:47:28,569 --> 01:47:32,769
you can write it either way either you

1939
01:47:30,939 --> 01:47:35,139
can place these guys off on the half

1940
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:41,020
tile dim or you can place this off on a

1941
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:42,700
half tile dim and and I guess the back

1942
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:46,300
means you really just don't need this

1943
01:47:42,699 --> 01:47:48,189
right because you're gonna have to have

1944
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:52,810
this be staggered by a half damn

1945
01:47:48,189 --> 01:47:56,679
relative to where you're saying things

1946
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:58,550
are so I'm not really sure how what the

1947
01:47:56,680 --> 01:48:05,630
cleanest way to represent that

1948
01:47:58,550 --> 01:48:15,559
fact is right hmm that's kind of

1949
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:17,179
interesting one right I mean because

1950
01:48:15,559 --> 01:48:19,880
because effectively what we're doing

1951
01:48:17,179 --> 01:48:21,500
when we create the sim region is we're

1952
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:23,230
creating a local coordinate system that

1953
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:26,630
we're performing all of our edits in and

1954
01:48:23,229 --> 01:48:30,589
so if we shift the local coordinate

1955
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:34,309
system by if the local coordinate system

1956
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:36,380
and the room are both at zero zero then

1957
01:48:34,309 --> 01:48:41,329
that means in order to place the

1958
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:44,210
boundary or the entities when we place

1959
01:48:41,328 --> 01:48:47,299
those things they have to be offset from

1960
01:48:44,210 --> 01:48:49,010
each other by one half tile dim it

1961
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:50,960
doesn't matter who you offset you could

1962
01:48:49,010 --> 01:48:53,960
offset the room boundary by a half tile

1963
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:56,658
dim or you could offset the entities by

1964
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:59,029
half tile dim and just because it seems

1965
01:48:56,658 --> 01:49:02,629
like you place entities more right I

1966
01:48:59,029 --> 01:49:04,639
wonder if we want to do this and say

1967
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:07,489
that look we're just gonna place things

1968
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:11,059
at like min tile X Y Z whatever that's

1969
01:49:07,488 --> 01:49:14,178
our basis and then when we create them

1970
01:49:11,059 --> 01:49:17,900
in room P it's actually min room P we

1971
01:49:14,179 --> 01:49:27,020
will change that to be negative half

1972
01:49:17,899 --> 01:49:28,969
tile dim right and then you know go from

1973
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:33,230
min room P to the room Jim to create the

1974
01:49:28,969 --> 01:49:35,868
dimension of the actual room I don't

1975
01:49:33,229 --> 01:49:38,678
know what I think of that but that's

1976
01:49:35,868 --> 01:49:41,238
more what I want it looks like I'm still

1977
01:49:38,679 --> 01:49:45,158
though wait a minute

1978
01:49:41,238 --> 01:49:45,158
I'm still getting an error there

1979
01:49:54,260 --> 01:50:01,010
the changebase pee is still coming from

1980
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:10,760
here so that should be correct the half

1981
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:11,840
tile DIMM should be back that seems

1982
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:14,180
correct doesn't it

1983
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,199
so that was slightly nonsensical what

1984
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:21,880
was happening there let me just

1985
01:50:15,198 --> 01:50:24,439
double-check where I actually placed the

1986
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:26,600
collision volume here so it's a

1987
01:50:24,439 --> 01:50:30,649
recommend max of min room P to max room

1988
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:35,210
P that seems correct oh no it's not

1989
01:50:30,649 --> 01:50:36,889
correct so again this should just always

1990
01:50:35,210 --> 01:50:38,448
be at zero zero zero because the

1991
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:41,810
collision volume is taking this into

1992
01:50:38,448 --> 01:50:43,939
account so there's two ways we can do it

1993
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:47,210
right we can pass min room P max room P

1994
01:50:43,939 --> 01:50:49,519
here and zero zero zero here or we can

1995
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:53,239
pass min room P here and just actually

1996
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:56,120
pass the room dimension as the collision

1997
01:50:53,238 --> 01:50:58,698
volume routed at zero zero zero I don't

1998
01:50:56,119 --> 01:51:00,109
know again six of one half dozen of the

1999
01:50:58,698 --> 01:51:05,359
other don't know that there's a correct

2000
01:51:00,109 --> 01:51:07,630
answer but that all seems good now and I

2001
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:11,599
think I'll leave it at that for today

2002
01:51:07,630 --> 01:51:14,539
but well maybe I won't maybe this should

2003
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:17,180
be changed now to do it to sort of link

2004
01:51:14,539 --> 01:51:19,189
those two together so if you take a look

2005
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:21,800
at what's going on here right again

2006
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:24,439
I'm not sure I want to push a little

2007
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:27,739
further into this so maybe I will stop

2008
01:51:24,439 --> 01:51:29,509
and we'll pick this up tomorrow but just

2009
01:51:27,738 --> 01:51:32,209
looking at how this is working right I

2010
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:35,420
still don't love the fact that we asked

2011
01:51:32,210 --> 01:51:42,829
questions about the global tile x y&amp;z

2012
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:44,930
here I almost want to say this this

2013
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:46,519
stuff should be these volumes should be

2014
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:49,670
mapped into the local space and we

2015
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:55,400
should be doing the test there but you

2016
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:58,119
know I have mixed feelings about it

2017
01:51:55,399 --> 01:51:58,119
let's put it that way

2018
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:23,610
mm-hmm yeah I don't know so let's take a

2019
01:52:21,328 --> 01:52:30,809
look at where half table dim is used at

2020
01:52:23,609 --> 01:52:36,179
all so it's really only there so what I

2021
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:50,690
might want to do is something more like

2022
01:52:36,179 --> 01:52:50,690
this and just get rid of this

2023
01:52:55,679 --> 01:53:07,840
and then yeah like this stuff I feel

2024
01:53:05,618 --> 01:53:10,148
like we don't really need the X count by

2025
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,649
count Z count necessarily to like that

2026
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:14,860
can just come into here because I don't

2027
01:53:11,649 --> 01:53:16,869
think you know that's what the dim was

2028
01:53:14,859 --> 01:53:28,418
supposed to be so I mean I feel like we

2029
01:53:16,868 --> 01:53:31,918
should be able to do like right so maybe

2030
01:53:28,418 --> 01:53:31,918
we could do something more like this

2031
01:53:36,029 --> 01:53:40,948
just again to sort of simplify it down a

2032
01:53:38,618 --> 01:53:40,948
little bit

2033
01:53:48,779 --> 01:53:51,929
something like that

2034
01:53:57,929 --> 01:54:03,189
can't we just do get a look isn't there

2035
01:54:00,458 --> 01:54:07,238
just a get volume call like tell me how

2036
01:54:03,189 --> 01:54:09,399
how big this thing is volumetrically I

2037
01:54:07,238 --> 01:54:13,148
feel like there should be a way to to

2038
01:54:09,399 --> 01:54:15,479
just ask that of the gen math thing

2039
01:54:13,149 --> 01:54:15,479
itself

2040
01:54:25,489 --> 01:54:38,989
so yeah I don't see it but I'm gonna add

2041
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:40,610
it so in here we'll just say hey I want

2042
01:54:38,989 --> 01:54:46,010
to know what this total volume is

2043
01:54:40,609 --> 01:54:58,069
actually please and so we'll just do the

2044
01:54:46,010 --> 01:55:00,350
results is actually so get total volume

2045
01:54:58,069 --> 01:55:04,189
can just take a v3 actually should be

2046
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:10,880
able take a gen v3 right I would think

2047
01:55:04,189 --> 01:55:14,779
and then that that you could choose to

2048
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:17,569
call if you wanted to the get volume

2049
01:55:14,779 --> 01:55:21,500
first on it or not so it's more or less

2050
01:55:17,569 --> 01:55:25,130
just that so I think that in here we can

2051
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:27,829
just say yeah get the total volume for

2052
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:31,460
the tile count and that'll just return

2053
01:55:27,829 --> 01:55:32,989
that value which is what we want and

2054
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:36,079
then I can get rid of the rest of these

2055
01:55:32,989 --> 01:55:45,729
here so where is dim their grid dim

2056
01:55:36,079 --> 01:55:47,659
equals PI outs and that's tile count X Y

2057
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:50,199
just keep that a little bit closer

2058
01:55:47,659 --> 01:55:50,199
bundles

2059
01:55:57,979 --> 01:56:07,259
you're more of those you know this one I

2060
01:56:03,869 --> 01:56:09,449
feel like we should just be passing the

2061
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:14,640
dim there if we'd go to get camera

2062
01:56:09,449 --> 01:56:17,000
offset z4 dim in here I kind of feel

2063
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:23,970
like I want to do something more like

2064
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:26,460
you Passage env3 to this well although

2065
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:39,210
does this get used in other places now

2066
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:42,210
it does and I think that you'd want to

2067
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:44,899
know the Z here anyway and so that's

2068
01:56:42,210 --> 01:56:48,569
probably something that that wants to be

2069
01:56:44,899 --> 01:56:51,859
looked at anyway so I think we'll

2070
01:56:48,569 --> 01:56:51,859
probably want to pass that

2071
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:03,840
okay so again a little more cleaned up

2072
01:57:00,689 --> 01:57:09,599
still you know could could stand to use

2073
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:13,140
I could I could more one more time

2074
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:15,490
through probably looking at this so

2075
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:17,810
let's see

2076
01:57:15,489 --> 01:57:20,460
[Music]

2077
01:57:17,810 --> 01:57:22,050
and yeah the mint I'll stuff could

2078
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:29,819
probably be stand to be collapsed as

2079
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:36,690
well you know I'm not sure if the Jen

2080
01:57:29,819 --> 01:57:40,109
math code has a get min in it I mean

2081
01:57:36,689 --> 01:57:43,169
it's just dot min so not really

2082
01:57:40,109 --> 01:57:45,689
particularly exciting but right it's

2083
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:47,609
just this so I don't know I mean I could

2084
01:57:45,689 --> 01:57:52,979
yeah I could just do that right I could

2085
01:57:47,609 --> 01:57:54,779
just say like it's the room right

2086
01:57:52,979 --> 01:57:56,279
and then maybe that's a little bit

2087
01:57:54,779 --> 01:57:58,229
cleaner there too so that we're just

2088
01:57:56,279 --> 01:58:01,039
we're not like spamming out these local

2089
01:57:58,229 --> 01:58:05,279
variables for no particular reason

2090
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:09,949
furthermore this call for the base P I

2091
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:09,949
feel like that is a good candidate for

2092
01:58:10,729 --> 01:58:16,589
for taking a gen v3 as well because

2093
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:17,789
chunk position from tile position is

2094
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:20,100
really not something that should be

2095
01:58:17,789 --> 01:58:22,649
happening in the game it's strictly that

2096
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:24,690
the tiles the game doesn't care about

2097
01:58:22,649 --> 01:58:26,539
tiles at all the game's completely free

2098
01:58:24,689 --> 01:58:29,429
form so you don't have to be on a grid

2099
01:58:26,539 --> 01:58:32,250
for any particular reason so I feel like

2100
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:36,690
that's something that wants to be sort

2101
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:41,039
of in the world gen stuff anyway you can

2102
01:58:36,689 --> 01:58:43,679
see that it is right so I feel like that

2103
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:45,269
sort of wants to take a Gen V 3 because

2104
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:49,050
that's what you're normally gonna have

2105
01:58:45,270 --> 01:58:52,230
right I want to say and if you don't

2106
01:58:49,050 --> 01:58:54,449
have one you could just get one another

2107
01:58:52,229 --> 01:58:58,589
way to say it would be let's provide

2108
01:58:54,449 --> 01:59:03,199
both right I mean why not so then we

2109
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:03,199
could just say if you pass a Gen V 3

2110
01:59:04,729 --> 01:59:08,119
then we just

2111
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:27,020
give the call and that way we don't have

2112
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:29,329
to worry about passing these things

2113
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:35,929
separately so we can just say like mint

2114
01:59:29,329 --> 01:59:38,689
Isle and and go similarly change based P

2115
01:59:35,929 --> 01:59:45,230
now in theory really shouldn't probably

2116
01:59:38,689 --> 01:59:48,678
be getting used much at all we can

2117
01:59:45,229 --> 01:59:51,109
almost remove it if we have a if if this

2118
01:59:48,679 --> 01:59:53,690
this world room stuff is sort of for

2119
01:59:51,109 --> 01:59:55,939
adding Maps later right what's just

2120
01:59:53,689 --> 01:59:57,710
provisional but we probably do want to

2121
01:59:55,939 --> 02:00:00,738
keep it I think we probably will need it

2122
01:59:57,710 --> 02:00:04,640
so I'm not gonna eliminate the change

2123
02:00:00,738 --> 02:00:07,448
based P yet I'll leave it on there but

2124
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:11,329
otherwise yeah mint I'll can now be

2125
02:00:07,448 --> 02:00:18,500
represented as just a dot access or like

2126
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:20,329
so and that should be fine looking at

2127
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:22,399
this you could almost see like this

2128
02:00:20,329 --> 02:00:24,649
stuff could probably be treated as a

2129
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:26,839
vector now as a gender III as well so we

2130
02:00:24,649 --> 02:00:29,929
may want to do that too but you know off

2131
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:31,940
we go all right so I'm gonna kick cuz

2132
02:00:29,929 --> 02:00:33,980
they're that done for now

2133
02:00:31,939 --> 02:00:35,569
I took the extra 15 minutes that we

2134
02:00:33,979 --> 02:00:37,189
technically should have had because I

2135
02:00:35,569 --> 02:00:39,349
think the clock didn't actually I didn't

2136
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:42,589
actually start the clock on time I

2137
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:44,960
started early but I think we're all good

2138
02:00:42,590 --> 02:00:46,940
now and we've got the aprons in there

2139
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:50,029
the way I want so I'm pretty pleased

2140
02:00:46,939 --> 02:00:51,738
with that what I wanted you tomorrow is

2141
02:00:50,029 --> 02:00:53,359
like clean up the way that we're

2142
02:00:51,738 --> 02:00:54,468
generating those volumes so that this

2143
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:56,420
part works so I'm going to leave that

2144
02:00:54,469 --> 02:01:01,250
for tomorrow and also maybe tomorrow

2145
02:00:56,420 --> 02:01:04,579
we'll add the ability to like you know I

2146
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:06,590
want to fix that problem right I also

2147
02:01:04,579 --> 02:01:10,399
don't know why are those double stacked

2148
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:13,250
like that what's happening there oh

2149
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:15,519
that's just this room boundary drawing

2150
02:01:13,250 --> 02:01:15,520
across

2151
02:01:16,609 --> 02:01:20,880
and also maybe we'll go in and put some

2152
02:01:18,930 --> 02:01:23,039
trees into the apron just to finish that

2153
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:26,579
off and make sure all that kind of

2154
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:29,519
garbage works so I think we're all good

2155
02:01:26,579 --> 02:01:31,140
now we probably have to you know change

2156
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:34,200
from clearing to gray to clearing to

2157
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:35,970
black at least in release mode because

2158
02:01:34,199 --> 02:01:37,439
again I'm underneath we kind of want

2159
02:01:35,970 --> 02:01:39,659
that to be true

2160
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:41,460
so we'll sort of work on that stuff

2161
02:01:39,659 --> 02:01:43,199
we'll cross that bridge when we come to

2162
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:47,460
it but I'm really after that we'll go to

2163
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:49,939
a brief Q&amp;A for anybody who has

2164
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:49,939
questions

2165
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:07,710
why have a separate apron concept

2166
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:16,789
instead of just generating rooms on the

2167
02:02:07,710 --> 02:02:20,069
sides well so what I tend not to do and

2168
02:02:16,789 --> 02:02:21,630
you know I I don't feel strongly about

2169
02:02:20,069 --> 02:02:22,979
this so I'm not trying to say that it's

2170
02:02:21,630 --> 02:02:24,810
some kind of like a programming

2171
02:02:22,979 --> 02:02:28,049
guideline but just it's my personal

2172
02:02:24,810 --> 02:02:30,150
preference is if I'm mentally thinking

2173
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:31,980
about two things as being separate I

2174
02:02:30,149 --> 02:02:35,609
tend to write them separate in the code

2175
02:02:31,979 --> 02:02:37,619
at least at first and then if it becomes

2176
02:02:35,609 --> 02:02:38,339
overwhelmingly obvious to me later that

2177
02:02:37,619 --> 02:02:41,250
they're the same

2178
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:45,270
I will merge them but I don't usually

2179
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:47,819
start with them merged the reason for

2180
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:49,980
that is I feel like when code is written

2181
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:53,399
for a specific purpose it tends to end

2182
02:02:49,979 --> 02:02:57,299
up being more clean and so I usually

2183
02:02:53,399 --> 02:02:59,869
like to see if I like to look at what

2184
02:02:57,300 --> 02:03:02,760
the clean version looks like first and

2185
02:02:59,869 --> 02:03:06,300
then later decide to merge two things if

2186
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:10,020
I think it won't affect the complexity

2187
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:14,130
too much rather than a priori saying

2188
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:17,280
look the areas outside rooms and the

2189
02:03:14,130 --> 02:03:18,510
areas inside rooms are similar so let me

2190
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:21,840
just make one generator that generates

2191
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:23,400
both I'm sort of pre assuming that I

2192
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:25,230
know the answer to the question is that

2193
02:03:23,399 --> 02:03:26,639
they are sufficiently similar to not

2194
02:03:25,229 --> 02:03:29,939
make the code be unnecessarily

2195
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:33,840
complicated and hard to read for either

2196
02:03:29,939 --> 02:03:37,549
one right so really that that is the

2197
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:40,319
reason so we may end up collapsing

2198
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:46,590
aprons and rooms into the same thing in

2199
02:03:40,319 --> 02:03:48,659
the future but we will make that

2200
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:52,069
decision based on seeing if it really

2201
02:03:48,659 --> 02:03:52,069
makes sense right

2202
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:03,080
we'll a pristine underground and ground

2203
02:04:00,439 --> 02:04:05,329
level only or will you have sky aprons

2204
02:04:03,079 --> 02:04:07,340
for upper levels like in the case of a

2205
02:04:05,329 --> 02:04:09,979
tall tower you could have clouds or

2206
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:11,539
birch or something might look neat with

2207
02:04:09,979 --> 02:04:14,569
multiple layers thicker clouds as you

2208
02:04:11,539 --> 02:04:18,409
climb I had not thought about that but I

2209
02:04:14,569 --> 02:04:21,529
agree with you if we ever do make like a

2210
02:04:18,409 --> 02:04:23,059
tower area which seems kind of fun we

2211
02:04:21,529 --> 02:04:25,039
could make some clouds out there I don't

2212
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:29,270
know to what extent that would be based

2213
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:32,260
on a printing but it seems reasonable to

2214
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:32,260
do that as an apron sure

2215
02:04:50,849 --> 02:04:58,210
how to link a third-party library like

2216
02:04:54,158 --> 02:05:07,750
GL fw3 lib any suggestions on where to

2217
02:04:58,210 --> 02:05:10,149
read about it um I guess I I want to say

2218
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:13,779
we covered this in handmade hero

2219
02:05:10,149 --> 02:05:16,000
actually if you look for it using the

2220
02:05:13,779 --> 02:05:18,729
episode guide but I guess I don't know

2221
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,738
that that was the case since we don't

2222
02:05:18,729 --> 02:05:22,689
use libraries on the stream you know

2223
02:05:20,738 --> 02:05:26,308
it's possible that I never really talked

2224
02:05:22,689 --> 02:05:31,598
about it but I thought I did

2225
02:05:26,309 --> 02:05:39,929
at some point whoops I didn't want Hamid

2226
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:39,929
Khan so in here you know like

2227
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:49,088
[Music]

2228
02:05:59,899 --> 02:06:06,289
I don't know I thought we'd I did like a

2229
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:08,930
stream it wasn't a main stream it was

2230
02:06:06,289 --> 02:06:15,489
like a chat stream oh you know what

2231
02:06:08,930 --> 02:06:15,490
though image chat

2232
02:06:27,289 --> 02:06:32,659
I want to say that I covered it on this

2233
02:06:29,988 --> 02:06:38,139
stream here this is the one I was

2234
02:06:32,659 --> 02:06:38,139
thinking of on how library linking works

2235
02:06:38,199 --> 02:06:49,119
I'm not 100% sure because we were

2236
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:53,560
talking about some other things but I

2237
02:06:49,119 --> 02:06:53,559
think that's what I would say

2238
02:07:03,408 --> 02:07:06,929
environment is very sterile because all

2239
02:07:05,279 --> 02:07:08,789
place that are gonna be seen be snap to

2240
02:07:06,929 --> 02:07:11,039
grid maybe very the offset randomly from

2241
02:07:08,789 --> 02:07:12,448
the tile Center also the random height

2242
02:07:11,039 --> 02:07:14,488
difference between floor tile could be

2243
02:07:12,448 --> 02:07:17,879
severely reduced who made that flooring

2244
02:07:14,488 --> 02:07:19,019
if the hazard I'm not really super

2245
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:21,118
concerned with that stuff at the moment

2246
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:24,449
because that's gonna be more like polish

2247
02:07:21,118 --> 02:07:27,868
work as to how we want to make that

2248
02:07:24,448 --> 02:07:30,539
stuff up here but the world is supposed

2249
02:07:27,868 --> 02:07:32,130
to look a little bit grid like like

2250
02:07:30,539 --> 02:07:34,019
that's the style because you

2251
02:07:32,130 --> 02:07:35,550
specifically have to think about grid

2252
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:38,190
squares as you'll kind of see as we go

2253
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:46,650
further into the game so we really don't

2254
02:07:38,189 --> 02:07:49,769
want it to look like a continuum it's

2255
02:07:46,649 --> 02:07:55,259
supposed to look kind of gridded or at

2256
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:56,670
least QB right well you also replace X

2257
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:58,650
hand with DMX in the generate apron

2258
02:07:56,670 --> 02:08:00,329
function yes what I'd like to do is in

2259
02:07:58,649 --> 02:08:01,618
the generate apron function maybe and

2260
02:08:00,329 --> 02:08:04,829
like I said maybe we'll do this tomorrow

2261
02:08:01,618 --> 02:08:07,859
I'd like to make those two now share a

2262
02:08:04,829 --> 02:08:10,500
like creation call for making the region

2263
02:08:07,859 --> 02:08:14,849
and getting back the the values so we'll

2264
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:17,899
probably try to do that tomorrow so

2265
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:17,900
they'll work similarly

2266
02:08:22,619 --> 02:08:28,800
Oh have you ever used Sony SN Systems

2267
02:08:26,430 --> 02:08:30,600
debugger for PlayStation 3 someone on

2268
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:32,130
him a network called it the best of ever

2269
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:34,710
they'd ever used but didn't really go

2270
02:08:32,130 --> 02:08:41,460
into detail that what it did right um

2271
02:08:34,710 --> 02:08:43,970
yeah so I have used s n systems I don't

2272
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:51,329
remember if it was on the PlayStation 3

2273
02:08:43,970 --> 02:08:54,510
though probably wasn't on the

2274
02:08:51,329 --> 02:08:56,550
PlayStation 3 actually because I believe

2275
02:08:54,510 --> 02:09:01,460
SN system shipped debuggers for more

2276
02:08:56,550 --> 02:09:09,270
platforms than just that one I just

2277
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:12,989
fundamentally don't remember it III just

2278
02:09:09,270 --> 02:09:17,070
don't I'm sorry I mean there definitely

2279
02:09:12,989 --> 02:09:18,960
we definitely had those at rad we had a

2280
02:09:17,069 --> 02:09:24,179
couple SN systems things at rad I want

2281
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:27,000
to say over the years but I just I don't

2282
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:28,829
remember them at all let's it's been too

2283
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:31,050
long and it wasn't a primary thing that

2284
02:09:28,829 --> 02:09:34,590
I used I didn't do very much PlayStation

2285
02:09:31,050 --> 02:09:36,480
work pretty much ever it's never been a

2286
02:09:34,590 --> 02:09:38,840
primary thing that I've been working on

2287
02:09:36,479 --> 02:09:38,839
so

2288
02:09:46,899 --> 02:09:50,859
have you ever have you had any

2289
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,590
unpleasant experience with the debugging

2290
02:09:50,859 --> 02:09:55,329
on Linux yes all experiences debugging

2291
02:09:53,590 --> 02:09:58,179
on Linux are unpleasant it's it's an

2292
02:09:55,329 --> 02:10:03,399
unpleasant debugging environment it's

2293
02:09:58,179 --> 02:10:06,130
one of the reasons I don't use it was

2294
02:10:03,399 --> 02:10:12,269
the old dune 2 game may using GTI or

2295
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:12,270
OpenGL are you sure it was on Windows I

2296
02:10:12,988 --> 02:10:18,098
mean it would have been direct draw if

2297
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:22,840
it was on Windows so the answer is

2298
02:10:18,099 --> 02:10:26,679
neither of those two things but GDI more

2299
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:30,630
closely however I don't know

2300
02:10:26,679 --> 02:10:32,980
are you sure that dune 2 wasn't DOS I

2301
02:10:30,630 --> 02:10:36,489
don't know I never had do two so I have

2302
02:10:32,979 --> 02:10:44,019
no idea what it was yeah doom 2 is das

2303
02:10:36,488 --> 02:10:56,169
so it's it's using mode 13 probably take

2304
02:10:44,020 --> 02:10:59,949
a look yes thank you for the add Google

2305
02:10:56,170 --> 02:11:02,469
stadia I mean as do they play now I have

2306
02:10:59,948 --> 02:11:10,059
YouTube red on my actual machine so I

2307
02:11:02,469 --> 02:11:12,908
don't see this nonsense alright so here

2308
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:21,190
if this is if we assume this if this is

2309
02:11:12,908 --> 02:11:23,289
the if this is what we're talking about

2310
02:11:21,189 --> 02:11:27,879
like I said I never had this game so I

2311
02:11:23,289 --> 02:11:30,130
have no idea if this is the game we're

2312
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:32,529
talking about I mean just looking at it

2313
02:11:30,130 --> 02:11:36,150
I I'm gonna go out and women just say

2314
02:11:32,529 --> 02:11:36,149
it's probably DOS mode 13

2315
02:11:39,090 --> 02:11:46,739
so you know I don't really want to go

2316
02:11:45,059 --> 02:11:50,190
into a lot of detail about what this is

2317
02:11:46,738 --> 02:11:54,839
but effectively what happened was on old

2318
02:11:50,189 --> 02:11:57,419
pcs when you were in you know when you

2319
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:59,429
were just booting into ms-dos and the

2320
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:01,440
system bios was how you interface with

2321
02:11:59,429 --> 02:12:02,429
the graphics driver well for the well

2322
02:12:01,439 --> 02:12:06,388
there's no graph driver with the

2323
02:12:02,429 --> 02:12:09,389
graphics card effectively you could

2324
02:12:06,389 --> 02:12:11,190
create an interrupt and I don't remember

2325
02:12:09,389 --> 02:12:18,029
what the interrupt was let's see if

2326
02:12:11,189 --> 02:12:20,038
they've got yeah okay so it's in ten

2327
02:12:18,029 --> 02:12:21,719
which would be called this which is

2328
02:12:20,038 --> 02:12:23,340
sixteen right its hexadecimal so it's in

2329
02:12:21,719 --> 02:12:29,130
ten H which would be the sixteen

2330
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:30,989
interrupts sixteen when you execute that

2331
02:12:29,130 --> 02:12:33,389
interrupts the processor just looks to

2332
02:12:30,988 --> 02:12:37,019
see if you've set al to thirteen and a

2333
02:12:33,389 --> 02:12:41,480
hex and aged to zero and if you did it

2334
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:52,980
put you into I want to say 320 by 240 by

2335
02:12:41,479 --> 02:12:56,879
eight bits no 320 by 208 bits so it's

2336
02:12:52,979 --> 02:13:00,388
320 by 208 bits and the eight bits so

2337
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:03,270
each pixel is a byte and the bite was

2338
02:13:00,389 --> 02:13:07,170
just an index into a pallet so you had

2339
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:09,270
20 56 palette entries nobody used the

2340
02:13:07,170 --> 02:13:11,069
default so you would set them yourself

2341
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:15,329
to whatever the colors are that you

2342
02:13:11,069 --> 02:13:19,729
wanted and then you just wrote into the

2343
02:13:15,328 --> 02:13:25,079
graphics memory aperture which was I

2344
02:13:19,729 --> 02:13:28,219
want to say like oh X a thousand

2345
02:13:25,079 --> 02:13:28,220
[Music]

2346
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:41,560
that now that was probably monochrome oh

2347
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:51,220
no I'm right there it is it's a thousand

2348
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:54,210
and but it was double buffered right

2349
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:54,210
wasn't it

2350
02:14:05,198 --> 02:14:08,129
maybe it wasn't

2351
02:14:19,659 --> 02:14:25,829
surprised I remembered the a thousand

2352
02:14:21,699 --> 02:14:25,829
that turns out that's where it buzz

2353
02:14:49,590 --> 02:14:54,470
so I I can't remember if instead of

2354
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:58,590
offer tonight I'm guessing it's not

2355
02:14:54,470 --> 02:15:00,720
because if a thousand is the aperture

2356
02:14:58,590 --> 02:15:03,060
and it's not really talking about an

2357
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:04,470
offset aperture here then there would

2358
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:06,810
only have been one of them so I'm

2359
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:08,460
guessing that it's just single buffered

2360
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:12,960
and you're writing directly to the

2361
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:14,819
screen so you would have had to do an

2362
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:17,670
actual blit if you wanted a double

2363
02:15:14,819 --> 02:15:19,569
buffer I guess like I said I don't

2364
02:15:17,670 --> 02:15:22,640
really remember

2365
02:15:19,569 --> 02:15:22,639
[Music]

2366
02:15:51,670 --> 02:15:55,618
yeah I remember this chain stuff

2367
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:08,920
I'm sorry I just don't remember all this

2368
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:15,340
stuff but here it is so it was double

2369
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:23,039
buffered so you create two separate

2370
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:35,859
pages you render to one of them and then

2371
02:16:23,039 --> 02:16:42,340
you patch

2372
02:16:35,859 --> 02:16:44,769
I guess you patch an address so you wait

2373
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:49,260
till the V blank you switch where it's

2374
02:16:44,769 --> 02:16:49,260
reading from here I guess

2375
02:16:55,228 --> 02:16:59,638
I'm gonna have to reread this stuff too

2376
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:00,599
because I just I don't remember it's

2377
02:16:59,638 --> 02:17:03,109
been too long

2378
02:17:00,599 --> 02:17:03,110
sorry

2379
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:26,388
but it but it looks like that's

2380
02:17:19,549 --> 02:17:29,000
technically not mode 13 right so yeah I

2381
02:17:26,388 --> 02:17:32,978
mean I'm sorry I can't remember the

2382
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:45,349
exact details of how these things worked

2383
02:17:32,978 --> 02:17:48,319
I want to say in so how here's a

2384
02:17:45,349 --> 02:17:51,049
question for you if we just go load like

2385
02:17:48,319 --> 02:17:52,519
some code of mine from those days which

2386
02:17:51,049 --> 02:17:54,259
you know I didn't really do much

2387
02:17:52,519 --> 02:17:57,290
programming on the PC but like when I

2388
02:17:54,260 --> 02:18:01,040
was in high school I did like a little a

2389
02:17:57,290 --> 02:18:03,380
little bit of das PC programming so in

2390
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:05,689
the handmade fund bonus pack thing that

2391
02:18:03,379 --> 02:18:12,529
you get if you contribute to the bonus

2392
02:18:05,689 --> 02:18:15,280
fund do I do any of that kind of thing

2393
02:18:12,530 --> 02:18:15,280
here

2394
02:18:34,090 --> 02:18:44,090
so this is clearly just straight-up like

2395
02:18:40,929 --> 02:18:46,760
double buffering by writing to a back

2396
02:18:44,090 --> 02:18:49,250
buffer and putting forward so that's

2397
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:52,010
just eating the CPU time to do that so

2398
02:18:49,250 --> 02:18:59,029
the answer was no not in this code

2399
02:18:52,010 --> 02:19:00,978
anyway right whether or not I ever did

2400
02:18:59,029 --> 02:19:03,229
anything like that I just don't know on

2401
02:19:00,978 --> 02:19:06,228
the Amiga you didn't do any of this

2402
02:19:03,228 --> 02:19:20,750
stuff this way this was completely PC

2403
02:19:06,228 --> 02:19:23,349
only so you know all the particle

2404
02:19:20,750 --> 02:19:23,349
effects stuff

2405
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:55,780
just trying to look to see if any of

2406
02:19:50,290 --> 02:19:58,590
these other ones so what's all this

2407
02:19:55,780 --> 02:19:58,590
garbage

2408
02:20:09,909 --> 02:20:21,680
so it looks like maybe this was using

2409
02:20:12,799 --> 02:20:29,209
some kind of the library X Lib all but I

2410
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:34,090
don't know what X Lib all is probably

2411
02:20:29,209 --> 02:20:34,089
something that we could dig up again

2412
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,840
easier said than done huh

2413
02:20:49,459 --> 02:21:00,639
so this looks like a yeah like I was

2414
02:20:53,510 --> 02:21:06,130
using some mode X graphics library and

2415
02:21:00,639 --> 02:21:12,889
I'm guessing that the that would be in

2416
02:21:06,129 --> 02:21:16,219
some kind of a a route kind of file I'm

2417
02:21:12,889 --> 02:21:23,028
gonna say I don't know I'm not sure

2418
02:21:16,219 --> 02:21:24,438
exactly where that would be in here we

2419
02:21:23,029 --> 02:21:27,220
could just download all this stuff and

2420
02:21:24,439 --> 02:21:27,220
search for it

2421
02:21:37,970 --> 02:21:45,609
so you can see it's in that excellent

2422
02:21:40,790 --> 02:21:45,610
age is there a dot C for that anywhere

2423
02:21:55,030 --> 02:22:06,880
you know looks like maybe it's just a

2424
02:21:58,420 --> 02:22:08,200
lib it's just in the lib I mean we could

2425
02:22:06,879 --> 02:22:13,629
dump the live and then it probably

2426
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:15,310
wouldn't be too hard to look at the to

2427
02:22:13,629 --> 02:22:17,799
look at the actual code in there though

2428
02:22:15,309 --> 02:22:20,229
cuz you know we're talking about just

2429
02:22:17,799 --> 02:22:21,659
some basic calls to setup stuff you know

2430
02:22:20,229 --> 02:22:25,199
they're gonna look pretty

2431
02:22:21,659 --> 02:22:32,170
straightforward even in that assembly

2432
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:34,690
but yeah so I don't know like the other

2433
02:22:32,170 --> 02:22:36,100
thing I could try to do is find I'm kind

2434
02:22:34,690 --> 02:22:37,450
of interested to know like if I could

2435
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:40,020
find the original source code of this

2436
02:22:37,450 --> 02:22:40,020
library

2437
02:23:00,250 --> 02:23:05,590
like you know I don't know if it cludes

2438
02:23:03,170 --> 02:23:05,590
the source

2439
02:23:14,068 --> 02:23:20,728
it looks like it does there's a bunch of

2440
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:36,060
awesome files there assuming that that

2441
02:23:20,728 --> 02:23:43,139
was in Azzam right so yeah the basic X

2442
02:23:36,059 --> 02:23:48,629
Lib stuff I don't know where it gets

2443
02:23:43,139 --> 02:23:51,090
implemented but we could certainly try

2444
02:23:48,629 --> 02:23:53,358
to find out so if I like unpack this

2445
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:53,359
dude

2446
02:24:04,549 --> 02:24:09,609
then in here we should be able to like

2447
02:24:06,530 --> 02:24:14,479
open one of these things up and see I

2448
02:24:09,610 --> 02:24:17,810
don't know what these pink oh you know

2449
02:24:14,478 --> 02:24:18,920
that's just that that's just well oh but

2450
02:24:17,809 --> 02:24:22,000
it's got source I don't know why it's

2451
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:22,000
called an ink file then

2452
02:24:43,909 --> 02:24:54,379
can we search within the text here for

2453
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:54,380
double ah this looks good

2454
02:25:21,568 --> 02:25:25,588
so yeah

2455
02:25:47,379 --> 02:25:53,350
so it looks like what we're doing here

2456
02:25:50,418 --> 02:25:53,350
is we're sand

2457
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:08,130
if we're only doubled buffer we don't

2458
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:19,760
have to do this which is fine so

2459
02:26:08,129 --> 02:26:19,759
assuming that we end up in here we load

2460
02:26:23,540 --> 02:26:31,970
we load and we Swami we swap the hidden

2461
02:26:26,728 --> 02:26:31,969
page offset with the visible page offset

2462
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:44,149
and I guess I'm just not sure how that

2463
02:26:40,819 --> 02:26:46,069
helps us if that's some kind of an

2464
02:26:44,148 --> 02:26:47,869
actual register that the graphics card

2465
02:26:46,069 --> 02:26:54,379
was looking for it's not a register but

2466
02:26:47,870 --> 02:26:56,859
a memory location is that defined up

2467
02:26:54,379 --> 02:26:56,858
here somewhere

2468
02:27:08,739 --> 02:27:12,539
because you're set double buffer

2469
02:27:22,229 --> 02:27:26,010
yeah I mean it looks like all you had to

2470
02:27:24,299 --> 02:27:27,689
do for that part of double buffering is

2471
02:27:26,010 --> 02:27:29,640
you looks like you had to arrange them

2472
02:27:27,690 --> 02:27:31,351
properly so you had to make sure that

2473
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:33,239
they were you can see here they're

2474
02:27:31,351 --> 02:27:36,300
computing like an offset that is

2475
02:27:33,239 --> 02:27:42,899
designed to line these two things up in

2476
02:27:36,299 --> 02:27:43,979
a particular way right and of course

2477
02:27:42,899 --> 02:27:45,060
there's all because you know there's all

2478
02:27:43,979 --> 02:27:48,119
these restrictions about what the graphs

2479
02:27:45,060 --> 02:27:49,469
card isn't isn't isn't able to do in

2480
02:27:48,120 --> 02:27:51,750
those days right so you had to create

2481
02:27:49,469 --> 02:27:54,209
the correct sort of like resolution and

2482
02:27:51,750 --> 02:27:57,690
arrangement of these screens but it

2483
02:27:54,209 --> 02:28:00,479
seems like anyway that after that when

2484
02:27:57,690 --> 02:28:02,399
you wait for the vertical refresh you

2485
02:28:00,479 --> 02:28:05,010
literally just write to a new you just

2486
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:07,979
take a particular memory location that

2487
02:28:05,010 --> 02:28:10,560
the graphics card has mapped I guess and

2488
02:28:07,979 --> 02:28:17,219
you just write the offset of the page

2489
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:26,159
into that I guess cuz that's all I see

2490
02:28:17,219 --> 02:28:28,469
happening here like I don't see anything

2491
02:28:26,159 --> 02:28:37,190
else so it seems like that's all you

2492
02:28:28,469 --> 02:28:37,189
really needed to do maybe

2493
02:28:54,439 --> 02:28:57,219
let's

2494
02:29:22,649 --> 02:29:35,369
let's see here so I don't know there's

2495
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:37,799
any other questions I need to take at

2496
02:29:35,370 --> 02:29:42,030
the moment I really thank you for

2497
02:29:37,799 --> 02:29:44,159
confirming the dots PJ stuff yeah was

2498
02:29:42,030 --> 02:29:50,670
okay so was it mowed why what it was

2499
02:29:44,159 --> 02:29:52,500
called okay so maybe mode X is when you

2500
02:29:50,670 --> 02:29:56,310
do unchanged so you can you can get the

2501
02:29:52,500 --> 02:29:57,810
double buffering I I forget all these

2502
02:29:56,310 --> 02:30:01,319
terms it really wasn't something I did

2503
02:29:57,810 --> 02:30:03,119
much work with ever so it just wasn't my

2504
02:30:01,319 --> 02:30:06,750
it's not my area of expertise but it

2505
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:14,490
seems like I remember most of it just

2506
02:30:06,750 --> 02:30:17,180
not very well all right I'm gonna go

2507
02:30:14,489 --> 02:30:17,180
ahead and wrap it up

2508
02:30:21,450 --> 02:30:24,641
thank you everyone for joining me for an

2509
02:30:23,649 --> 02:30:26,409
episode of hand made here outside a

2510
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:27,729
pleasure coding with you as always if

2511
02:30:26,409 --> 02:30:29,110
you want to follow along series at home

2512
02:30:27,729 --> 02:30:31,539
you go here to the game on handmade here

2513
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:33,301
at work and it comes to the source code

2514
02:30:31,540 --> 02:30:36,160
so you can follow along with it at home

2515
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:39,010
we will be back tomorrow to play around

2516
02:30:36,159 --> 02:30:41,979
with the apron stuff and just make sure

2517
02:30:39,011 --> 02:30:46,239
the best stuff is solid and then we can

2518
02:30:41,979 --> 02:30:48,189
move on to whatever the next order of

2519
02:30:46,239 --> 02:30:49,899
business is on the list of things that I

2520
02:30:48,190 --> 02:30:54,460
talked about maybe we'll start to work

2521
02:30:49,899 --> 02:30:56,470
on the collision side of things because

2522
02:30:54,459 --> 02:30:59,109
I would like that to get a little bit

2523
02:30:56,470 --> 02:31:00,970
more straightforward and we also want to

2524
02:30:59,110 --> 02:31:02,500
make sure that the aprons work properly

2525
02:31:00,970 --> 02:31:04,479
over room so we just want to clean that

2526
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:06,280
stuff up we did most of stuff today but

2527
02:31:04,479 --> 02:31:09,279
we just want to sort of make that all

2528
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:10,480
brushed up and nice and then we can talk

2529
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:12,820
about starting whatever it is we want to

2530
02:31:10,479 --> 02:31:15,000
start about start on next in our list of

2531
02:31:12,819 --> 02:31:16,931
things probably don't want to quite do

2532
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,280
lighting yet because that's gonna be a

2533
02:31:16,931 --> 02:31:20,261
little bit more of a in-depth thing to

2534
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:21,521
finish that up but we may want to just

2535
02:31:20,261 --> 02:31:22,960
go ahead and start working on the ground

2536
02:31:21,521 --> 02:31:24,011
cover stuff would be another example so

2537
02:31:22,959 --> 02:31:26,250
close induction and ground cover are

2538
02:31:24,011 --> 02:31:28,060
probably two things we want to look at

2539
02:31:26,250 --> 02:31:30,431
and then maybe we'll move on the

2540
02:31:28,060 --> 02:31:31,449
lighting after that that's about it for

2541
02:31:30,431 --> 02:31:33,310
today hope see you back here tomorrow

2542
02:31:31,450 --> 02:31:35,200
till then have fun programming and I

2543
02:31:33,310 --> 02:31:37,500
will see everyone on the Internet take

2544
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:37,500
it easy everybody
