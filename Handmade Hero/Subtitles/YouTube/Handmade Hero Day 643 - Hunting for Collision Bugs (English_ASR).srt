00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,960
hero show where we code a complete game

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,160
live on stream before we get started i

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,240
don't know if you guys remember when we

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,960
did a kickstarter for our graphic novel

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
to do the print run last time well it's

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,359
time for book two

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,118
so if you were one of the people or even

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,279
i guess if you weren't who backed the

10
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,320
original kickstarter and want the second

11
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:23,759
book

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,000
or if you weren't and you want both

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,599
books this kickstarter has both of them

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,399
it is now live and it's already almost

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,600
funded so that's a pretty good thing um

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,200
but there's a bunch of stretch goals and

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,879
cool stuff so please check it out if you

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,120
get a chance uh i have the book one here

19
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,119
that everyone got uh who backed the

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,799
original kickstarter uh or i guess

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,799
people who backed for the the actual

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,359
book uh and it looks awesome the

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,198
printers were amazing uh

24
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,439
i really can't say

25
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,119
enough good things about the printers we

26
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,320
worked with they were actually a local

27
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,399
print shop

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,439
in seattle but you just look at it and

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,640
it looks so good uh it's one of the best

30
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,719
looking graphic novels i've seen

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,478
actually i i i feel like they have done

32
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,000
such an amazing job

33
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,478
uh it's a place called consolidated

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,879
press if you ever want to do

35
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,640
a graphic novel print run

36
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,359
i would use them

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,640
uh so that's up now and you can check it

38
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,319
out uh you can just type meow book 2

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
kickstarter into google you don't even

40
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,158
really need a link but

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,600
i'll put a link in the video description

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,840
and also if you're watching this live on

43
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,879
twitch i believe i put one

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,560
uh in the little twitch links

45
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,679
section thing that i don't even know

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,640
really where that shows up anymore but

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,360
it's point is easy to find

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,599
all right that's it for

49
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,680
businessy news uh i guess i'll mention

50
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,399
one other thing about that is that

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,960
uh we have had a lot of problems with

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,519
spam foldering of our newsletter

53
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,039
we send out the newsletter very rarely

54
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,478
and apparently this is a really big

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,600
problem

56
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,599
i

57
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,959
i don't actually know

58
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,919
what the

59
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,039
deal is i mean you would think that

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,360
email

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,680
would be a solved problem by now but you

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,560
know it's basically run by microsoft and

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,239
google for the most part um so that's

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,318
another way of saying it's a non-solved

65
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,640
problem because the last time google or

66
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,679
microsoft solved a problem it was like

67
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,719
the year 2002 or something

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,520
so you know i guess it makes sense that

69
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,159
email doesn't work but

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
uh until somebody actually comes along

71
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,560
and

72
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,840
figures out how to send text messages

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,199
between two people because apparently

74
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,439
that's a huge unsolved problem in

75
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,719
computer science

76
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,878
if you're a trillion dollar company

77
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,080
so if some poor little tiny company

78
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,359
comes along and actually sells email

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,719
then we'll be able to actually send

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,319
emails to the customers who signed up

81
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,318
for our mailing list until then

82
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,400
we apologize our mailingless mail if you

83
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,039
signed up probably went to your spam

84
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,800
folder you can go grab it there maybe or

85
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,318
if your mic you work if you're on

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,719
hotmail you can't even do that because

87
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,399
microsoft does it just flat out refuse

88
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,080
to accept delivery of our mailing list

89
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,680
as far as we could tell

90
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,800
so it's pretty awesome we will be

91
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,840
switching providers uh in it probably

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,680
and

93
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
changing a few things we might try to

94
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,680
start sending the email more often like

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
once a week or once every two weeks

96
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,000
instead of once every couple months um

97
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,840
you know our original goal was not to

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,919
spam people with a ton of messages but

99
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
apparently like either

100
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,199
and this is another thing that's just

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,719
amazing like google and microsoft are so

102
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,560
incompetent

103
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,239
that you're more likely to have your

104
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,158
mail delivered if you send regularly

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,840
than if you send irregularly like if you

106
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:44,318
send once every three months to try and

107
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,200
you know avoid spamming your legitimate

108
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,039
users with unnecessary news

109
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,359
you get penalized whereas if you send

110
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,598
things like every week or every day they

111
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
don't consider it spam

112
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,560
uh

113
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
this is the kind of thing that happens

114
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,840
when the infrastructure for the world is

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
written by people who got their cs

116
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
degree out of cracker jack box

117
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,400
and i don't know

118
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,598
what to say other than it's absolutely

119
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
ridiculous

120
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,238
we're going to try and fix it but what

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,919
it means more broadly is that when i

122
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,840
come here to tell you about something

123
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,319
like now the infinite kickstarter or the

124
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,720
star code galaxy stuff

125
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,800
um i really can't promise that our

126
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,240
emails will get through so i apologize

127
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
for people who signed up for the mailing

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,560
list i especially apologize for starco

129
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,039
galaxy people because there are

130
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
literally 5 000 people or something that

131
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,319
have signed up in the past

132
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,918
few months for a star code galaxy it's a

133
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,279
lot of people and most of those people

134
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,680
will probably not get the email that

135
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,119
lets them know that it's available you

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,959
know when it goes into early access or

137
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
whatever

138
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,279
so i don't know what to say about that

139
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,120
other than google and microsoft are just

140
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,679
absolutely abhorrent companies i hate

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,199
them and i've hated them for a long time

142
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
these are easy problems they have

143
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,478
trillions of dollars there's no reason i

144
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
shouldn't say trillions of dollars they

145
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,000
have billions of dollars they have a

146
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
trillion dollar market cap there is no

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,959
reason why they can't solve this problem

148
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,199
other than the fact that they are

149
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,000
absolutely incompetent

150
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,520
and

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,160
the notion

152
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,719
that in 2021

153
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,720
they do not have a solid system for

154
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,800
allowing people to sign up for a mailing

155
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,880
list that they wanted and receive it

156
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,720
is so embarrassing that i don't

157
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,478
understand how people who work on these

158
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,320
projects like

159
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,959
look themselves in the mirror i would

160
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,560
just quit programming if i was that bad

161
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,879
it's insane

162
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,879
it's absolutely insane and i have

163
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,800
nothing

164
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,038
i have no idea

165
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,360
what these people are doing all day it's

166
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,360
ridiculous it would take 10 seconds to

167
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,600
solve this problem just add a thing

168
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,400
called subscribe to mailing list to

169
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,360
gmail and hotmail it would take a

170
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:54,799
freaking day to do it then you point

171
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,879
that at an rss feed that's it

172
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,840
that's it that solves the problem

173
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,478
completely forever

174
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,599
this would literally take zero time to

175
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,159
implement

176
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,879
but they are so incredibly bad at their

177
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,439
job that they can't even conceive of how

178
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,519
they would go about solving the mo such

179
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,519
a

180
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:19,918
can you pull text from an external

181
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:23,279
source this was working in unix with dot

182
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,038
plan files in this what 70s 80s i don't

183
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,000
know when they added that feature it was

184
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:31,038
working with deck notes in the 70s it's

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,079
been here forever nobody had this

186
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,159
problem it is a trivial problem and they

187
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,199
can't even conceive of how they would

188
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
solve it

189
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,080
with billions of dollars

190
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,199
in r d budget

191
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,439
infinite time they've had 20 years

192
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,598
and they can't even solve

193
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,800
pull messaging they're like we don't

194
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:55,199
know how we would do that

195
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,240
it's absolutely nuts

196
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,360
it's a grotesque embarrassment and i

197
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,439
have no idea why it's still going on

198
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,000
that's the end of that rant but if

199
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,000
you're wondering why you didn't get our

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,519
our one mailing list mail that we sent

201
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,680
in six months

202
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,359
that's the reason because the people who

203
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,879
work on these projects have no idea what

204
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,840
they're doing and the companies who

205
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,079
employ them don't care

206
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,079
now

207
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,918
that we've got that out of the way

208
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,879
let's go finish our collision detector

209
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,879
so

210
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,399
uh where we left off last time is our

211
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,478
conclusion sector actually was working

212
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,799
uh fairly well i believe

213
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,279
but we made some changes to it where we

214
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,160
do sort of the voxel search version

215
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,638
of the problem because we wanted to

216
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,840
essentially you know improve the quality

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,720
of like corner roll and stuff like that

218
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,918
uh so what we wanted to do is we wanted

219
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,199
to go in here

220
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,959
and make it so that when we

221
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,199
actually uh

222
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,918
when something is embedded oops

223
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,439
start in the wrong directory

224
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:11,038
when something is embedded in like if

225
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,839
the gameplay code creates two objects

226
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,639
that are like embedded or whatever

227
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,478
uh

228
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,038
what i would like to do

229
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,918
is i would like to make sure

230
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,120
that

231
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,038
embedded objects can exit

232
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,199
so that you know if the gameplay code

233
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,639
does create that situation it's not a

234
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,280
problem i don't want the gameplay code

235
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:36,080
to have to worry about that

236
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:38,559
so if i go in here and i just open this

237
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,560
project

238
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,599
and we look at what's going on in here

239
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,200
right you can kind of see uh the voxel

240
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,519
diagramming that's happening there you

241
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,759
can see it uh hitting things and and

242
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,080
that sort of stuff uh and it works

243
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,439
pretty reliably now that we've changed

244
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,720
to this uh model where and i shouldn't

245
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,320
say reliable because it was reliable

246
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,040
before i guess but it couldn't do roll

247
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
off

248
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,240
uh whereas now you can see as i walk

249
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,079
through here it can kind of roll off

250
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
corners nicely and again that's just

251
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,399
because the search space is a little

252
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,120
wider

253
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,600
but we still get problems and we

254
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,919
specifically i believe and and you saw

255
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,759
it get stuck there uh for a second

256
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,519
specifically i believe the problem is we

257
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,519
don't handle the embedding case anymore

258
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,759
and the embedding case happens for

259
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,560
example in this scenario here you can

260
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,319
see

261
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,079
uh what i kind of mean

262
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,120
in this uh

263
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
we should probably have a way to turn

264
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,679
this diagramming off so you can actually

265
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
see the glove

266
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:36,479
in this situation what's gonna happen

267
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,200
here is the hero has an this this part

268
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,839
up here this head part here

269
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,240
the hero has an actual block that's

270
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,600
effectively immutable right it can't be

271
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,879
moved and so it's entirely possible to

272
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,040
have situations uh multiple

273
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,240
different ways where you would push

274
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,719
something into embedded surface using an

275
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,720
immutable object in this game immutable

276
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,639
objects can't be changed so if they push

277
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,800
something it will just get pushed

278
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,360
right and there's no way to solve that

279
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,159
problem other than handling and betting

280
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,879
um

281
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,319
because we want things that hop to be

282
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,600
immutable when they hop to something

283
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,040
they land in the middle of the square

284
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
always and if there's something floating

285
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,919
there it would get pushed out of the way

286
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,959
if the hop has been validated right

287
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:25,679
using the transactional movement

288
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,278
uh so we need to handle that and we also

289
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,879
don't know we might just have a bug like

290
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,720
getting stuck on exiting this corner

291
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,159
might have just been a bug but it could

292
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
also have just been the fact that when

293
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,360
you hop through with the immutable uh

294
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,799
square it forces the glove into an

295
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,879
interpenetrating state from which it

296
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,799
cannot emerge right

297
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:46,159
and we handled this in the previous

298
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,838
iteration of the routine but uh when we

299
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,159
switch to the the thing that does the

300
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,760
full voxel search we don't handle

301
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,039
embedding anymore so one thing that we

302
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,679
want to do is make sure that we do

303
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:59,039
handle that embedding so that we don't

304
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,958
end up with that problem right

305
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,838
all right uh so i think we're good to go

306
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,439
now

307
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,920
um

308
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,760
with with the with the goal here uh but

309
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,879
that's really yeah that's really all we

310
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,399
all we need

311
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,000
uh and

312
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,278
yeah like again i just not sure

313
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
i'm just not sure where that

314
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,000
intersection is coming from so the other

315
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,959
thing would be it would be nice if we

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,879
could re

317
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,599
produce that a little bit better so that

318
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,519
we can look in to see if it was a bug

319
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,800
but bug or no we need to fix the

320
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,240
embedding problem so we should probably

321
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,439
do that as well if i could reproduce

322
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,639
this that would be good i'd look for it

323
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
first

324
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:37,039
um because just in case it becomes hard

325
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,039
to reproduce uh there you go

326
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,039
yeah

327
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,440
uh so with that it's stuck in place

328
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,360
maybe we could just look and see

329
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,560
uh what's happening there

330
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,079
uh just so we know

331
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,799
you know

332
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,759
just that we have some idea uh i might

333
00:11:52,799 --> 00:12:00,319
go ahead and look at at that state uh of

334
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,319
the glove and just just see if i can

335
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,870
sort of suss out what it's doing

336
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,559
uh i'm gonna go into

337
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,959
[Music]

338
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,638
the build i'm going to switch the build

339
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,239
to debug and

340
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,240
you know i'm just going to rebuild in

341
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,759
place uh because i think that probably

342
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,039
just works

343
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,120
so i'm going to rebuild the game in

344
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,958
debug mode so i can debug it so

345
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,720
now it's running in debug mode same

346
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,359
state though

347
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,278
um and what i'm going to do is i'm going

348
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,320
to go set a breakpoint

349
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,320
in the move entity routine

350
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,440
and see if i can

351
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,120
it says

352
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,959
program is running because f5 was hit

353
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,959
why am i not able to set a break point

354
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,959
i thought i would

355
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,958
maybe i'm wrong

356
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,879
let me take a look at what happens if i

357
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,879
set it manually

358
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,559
all right well you know

359
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,560
um

360
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,000
that's unfortunate i don't know what

361
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,079
remedies is doing there am i on the

362
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,120
latest remedy i'm not

363
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,719
i probably

364
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,200
probably should update

365
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,200
i should probably update to a new remedy

366
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,639
uh so i guess i'll put that on the back

367
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,680
burner but

368
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,039
uh so if we step through here

369
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,799
and

370
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,719
take a look at what's going on first we

371
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,719
have to make sure that we're on the

372
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,600
correct entity id

373
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,120
so

374
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,879
we probably

375
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,639
although you know i don't know it might

376
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,799
be

377
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,159
it might be the case that we're oh it's

378
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:40,078
that one first always but let's take a

379
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:42,559
look so if i look at entityid.value

380
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,638
and i take a look at wait that's

381
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,439
probably not right the right one

382
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,720
um

383
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,480
let me step into uh diagram filter and

384
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,560
we'll just because we know which one

385
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,320
we're diagramming

386
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,919
we can just use this

387
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,720
as our determiner

388
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,120
so

389
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,360
in here we've got the global diagram

390
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,360
group filter

391
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,320
um

392
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,958
or not

393
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,198
how is it set to zero i thought it was

394
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
set to

395
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,680
i thought it was set to the

396
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,799
oh

397
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,479
right

398
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,000
because we reloaded the code and that's

399
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,079
global variable so it will get reset to

400
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,679
zero

401
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,519
all right that's not going to help us so

402
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,599
our problem is we don't know

403
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,399
uh which one is the glove

404
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,480
right

405
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,240
that's the problem that i have here

406
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,079
and it might be that this only gets

407
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,440
called once per frame let's find out

408
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,638
because if the glove is the only thing

409
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,040
undergoing collision in this region

410
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,360
it is okay so i guess we lucked out

411
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,919
there are no entities that are floating

412
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:00,159
that are currently in the active region

413
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,159
so we just we get it for free

414
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,839
so if i come down here and i just take a

415
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,838
look at what we're doing

416
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,920
let's let it

417
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,079
create the voxel region

418
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,319
and let's just take a look at what the

419
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,599
first uh corner

420
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,600
setup is

421
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
so if i delete all this stuff

422
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,199
uh and we look

423
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,198
we've got the cell here

424
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,838
uh

425
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,399
i can validate what the occupied

426
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,000
settings are for this cell

427
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,919
and just see

428
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,519
so if you look there's really nothing

429
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:47,519
wrong with that uh if you look at

430
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,879
at what that says

431
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,078
right

432
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,078
um

433
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,120
there's clearly there clearly are exits

434
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,519
right

435
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,879
because in order to exit you only need

436
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,879
one

437
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,320
there only needs to be a corner that's

438
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,958
not marked as occupied

439
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,040
so if you look the zeros

440
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,359
uh here and here tell you that you

441
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,719
should be able to move out of here but

442
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
it's entirely possible that the

443
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,199
direction you're trying to move doesn't

444
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,199
go

445
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:21,679
that way so i guess it's hard to say but

446
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,639
thinking about the order in which these

447
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:27,838
are i believe it's z y x if i'm not

448
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,320
mistaken um we can double check but uh

449
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,720
if you look at the

450
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,839
where is it

451
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,720
uh we've gotta check

452
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,199
corners call here here

453
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,160
um if you look at how these are packed

454
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,000
in

455
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,360
so z

456
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
y

457
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,000
x

458
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,278
right

459
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,278
um so z y x packing i guess

460
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,559
you can see that that's consistent

461
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,480
so if we look at how these are packed z

462
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,198
y x

463
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,000
it looks like the

464
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,240
yeah i mean it's an x

465
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,240
um

466
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:17,199
it's a negative direction for each one

467
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,119
uh and then positive z so it's basically

468
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,360
like i guess the

469
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,359
the

470
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:30,599
i guess the one thing i will say is that

471
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,600
is a little confusing

472
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,400
that is a little confusing

473
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,600
um

474
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,160
i'm not sure why that would be the case

475
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,399
because if you look at how this glove is

476
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,279
embedded you wouldn't expect it to be

477
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,280
able to move

478
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,279
backwards

479
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:01,839
better than it can move forwards

480
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,839
right um

481
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,119
so that's that's a little strange i will

482
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,600
say

483
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,599
um

484
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,798
like if you look at how that's embedded

485
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,400
i

486
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,240
you

487
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
you know why the reason i'm a little

488
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,640
weirded out there is y goes this way

489
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,120
positively it goes up

490
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,280
right the screen

491
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,879
uh not back

492
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:35,519
so if you were to take a guess

493
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,400
as to which direction

494
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,440
the

495
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,000
x

496
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,400
went it would be pop it would be

497
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,919
negative for x

498
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,640
but you wouldn't think it would be

499
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,640
negative for y

500
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,400
uh

501
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,280
you know what i'm saying

502
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,280
so when we compile this in

503
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,640
unless i'm just misreading that right

504
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,720
which i might be because it kind of is

505
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,520
just like looking at some raw data but

506
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,519
you know unless i'm misreading that

507
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,720
uh if you look

508
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,319
here

509
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,839
uh and you go

510
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,839
down to

511
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,079
that first check corners

512
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:30,959
oh um okay

513
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,960
that's not actually

514
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,519
well no it is so when we pull out the

515
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,400
current cell

516
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,558
right

517
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,480
that should be the cell that contains us

518
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,960
i guess i could check to make sure that

519
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,798
that's actually true like maybe we

520
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,519
messed up that setting

521
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,119
like maybe current cell i like coming

522
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,079
from the when we push the stack this

523
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,359
initial cell i if that was somehow

524
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,879
not

525
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:59,519
producing the correct value

526
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,360
maybe but assuming that it's you know

527
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,839
the stack should start

528
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:07,599
with where the actual uh glove

529
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:09,759
is and

530
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:13,279
if we assume that we start with where

531
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,279
the glove actually is

532
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,918
then i don't understand that layout of

533
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,880
corners

534
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,200
right i i don't understand

535
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,200
uh

536
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,639
i don't understand those values

537
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,640
because what that looks like is that x

538
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,640
negative

539
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,519
uh

540
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,240
oh but that's okay nope i think i did

541
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,639
just read it wrong this is y positive so

542
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,200
y positive x negative

543
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,640
all right now that's fine

544
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,720
so uh maybe i i got nervous for nothing

545
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,960
but that actually does look okay right

546
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,798
because this this value right here which

547
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,759
is where you could move to

548
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,759
is

549
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,759
downward

550
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,760
up like forward

551
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,720
and to the left

552
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,919
this is this one here

553
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,400
is

554
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,400
upward

555
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,079
forward

556
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,599
and to the left

557
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:24,000
and that is exactly what i would expect

558
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,319
so why can't the glove

559
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,679
go anywhere

560
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,359
um

561
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,038
let's take a look uh it obviously finds

562
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,199
the

563
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,000
distance squared for

564
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,759
uh the you know current location to be

565
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,640
the best but that's because there

566
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,839
currently has been no selection

567
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,840
uh of a location

568
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,038
we're gonna search

569
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,000
now

570
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,879
and

571
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,839
we're gonna add new corners so let's

572
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,120
take a look at side

573
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,119
x side y

574
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,759
and side z

575
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:06,158
um so this is saying

576
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,158
that

577
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,720
for reasons i don't necessarily know so

578
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,799
let's double check the delta p value

579
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,960
here so i'm not sure why it is searching

580
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,240
this direction first but we'll just take

581
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,200
a look here

582
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:27,839
so according to this it's x

583
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,840
it actually wants to go positive x

584
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:37,119
so i guess it might be going slightly

585
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,120
that direction

586
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,959
i mean that's fine

587
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,200
there's nothing wrong with that

588
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,480
uh so anyway okay we're going positive x

589
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,360
positive y

590
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,960
uh negative z although uh again it

591
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,639
didn't this doesn't really matter we can

592
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,000
go in either z direction and the

593
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,360
settings are basically the same

594
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,880
on the corners

595
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,639
uh so

596
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:04,400
what we look first for is is here

597
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,919
the side x it will never trigger uh this

598
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,400
one because

599
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,080
we know that only

600
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,480
the negative x

601
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,639
has something filled in

602
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,079
um so we wouldn't expect that to work we

603
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,840
will now flip

604
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,439
uh and check

605
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,119
the other six

606
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,400
so now we're going to look

607
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,639
at side explaining the other way this

608
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,640
one should trigger correctly now

609
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:32,158
so that seems odd right shouldn't that

610
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,759
have worked because we know that side x

611
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,679
is now zero

612
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,158
and we know that

613
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,278
therefore one one zero

614
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,480
and zero one zero should both have

615
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,480
worked

616
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,480
so

617
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,640
you know what this is wrong

618
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,400
so

619
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,038
we do have a bug

620
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,320
so this is just a straight up

621
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,000
uh

622
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,839
like

623
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,679
this is just a straight up like logic

624
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,439
bug right like you typed in the wrong

625
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,880
thing probably because we've mushed this

626
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,038
around so many times we were checking

627
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,360
for different things at different times

628
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,759
what we wanted here is to allow you to

629
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,959
move if any of these

630
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,919
are open

631
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,679
right

632
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,960
but what this says is that if any of

633
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,960
them are

634
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,640
this doesn't really make any sense

635
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,600
um

636
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,080
so

637
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,678
i believe right we're looking for

638
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:45,439
occupied so if you couldn't move in this

639
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,440
direction it would be this

640
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,558
right if all of them are locked you

641
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,879
can't move in that direction otherwise

642
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,558
you can

643
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,799
the or

644
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:00,079
was the wrong way around that would have

645
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:02,240
been if it was saying which ways you

646
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,399
could go then we would say like if any

647
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,400
you know if any of them are

648
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,320
so i think that is the problem

649
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,919
um

650
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,399
it's only supposed to stop you from

651
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,278
moving into the next cell if you have

652
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,120
that you know criteria

653
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,679
um there are some things that we

654
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,678
probably have to fix uh

655
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,120
with placement at the end due to the

656
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,519
fact that we allowed that kind of motion

657
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:30,158
but that's what we want i think

658
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,119
pretty much across the board

659
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,159
uh

660
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,558
i'm gonna

661
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,400
see what that does by the way in

662
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:37,839
i'm surprised the other way worked i

663
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,759
guess it's just that most of the time

664
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,798
you're moving in the clear

665
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:46,480
so you have all four points but as you

666
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,480
get near obstacles that's just wrong

667
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,840
so let's take a look

668
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,639
uh still nice and solid

669
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,480
there

670
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,320
um

671
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,120
no issues there

672
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,439
uh

673
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,439
roll off corner roll off seems fine

674
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,960
i'm glad we stepped through that that

675
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,918
was just a dumb

676
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,919
that's just a dumb bug

677
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,839
so it looks like that let us tunnel

678
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,839
so that looks like a bug

679
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,839
there

680
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,479
it may not have it was hard to see

681
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,960
whether it tunneled or hopped over

682
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,519
hopping over we currently allow we you

683
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,919
know don't have blockers on the ceiling

684
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,720
uh we probably should

685
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,240
but

686
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,558
let me see if i can make that happen

687
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,558
again

688
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,480
[Music]

689
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,678
again the problem here is that without

690
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,159
you know it's a little bit tricky

691
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,320
because without actually seeing

692
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,440
what it does let me try

693
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:03,879
and see if i can actually just like

694
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,880
get that to happen single step

695
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,720
i i don't seem to be able to

696
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,120
uh which is kind of sucks

697
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,679
i was hoping we would be able to get

698
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,759
that to do something where we could look

699
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,840
at it a little bit more closely

700
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,759
right

701
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,839
um i suppose one thing we could do is

702
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,919
crank the time step down although if

703
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,519
it's somehow time step dependent then it

704
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,240
won't happen

705
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,158
um but i just i don't know how i need to

706
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,000
get a look at it in a way that lets me

707
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,000
know what i'm actually looking at here

708
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
right

709
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,640
so here's a much slower version of this

710
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:06,720
thing

711
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,720
[Music]

712
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,720
um

713
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,319
i cannot really see in

714
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:35,519
hmm well this one's a bit of a puzzler

715
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,519
um

716
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,798
i really just can't tell like i can't

717
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,759
tell if that's just going over the top

718
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,240
or not

719
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,558
starring sylvester stallone

720
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,558
um

721
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,558
because it seems pretty solid everywhere

722
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,720
else

723
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,158
so it seems weird that it would be

724
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,319
somehow sneaking through the geometry

725
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,480
there that said collision detection is

726
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,278
that kind of a problem where some

727
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,679
particular piece of geometry is just so

728
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,200
uh that it exposes a bug in your routine

729
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,880
like that right

730
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
i couldn't tell what happened there i

731
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,360
really want to be able to look at what

732
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,240
happened there but unfortunately i can't

733
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,079
um

734
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,960
so i wonder one thing i could do is

735
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,839
maybe like turn on looping

736
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,720
um

737
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,918
and see if i can get it to happen uh but

738
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,000
again

739
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,480
i don't know what i'm really gonna do

740
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,679
uh even if i can we need a snapshotting

741
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,679
feature for the collision but

742
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,879
uh

743
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,880
yeah again it's a lot of work to

744
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,840
implement

745
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,840
for a small project

746
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,759
um

747
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,080
i don't know

748
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,360
i don't know

749
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:04,359
i'm not sure what we're gonna do here

750
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,038
we may just need to bite the bullet and

751
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,080
get something in there that allows us to

752
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:19,079
like step backwards

753
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,079
um

754
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:32,079
because it looks very solid

755
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,320
99 of the time and i can't i just can't

756
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,879
tell if all that's happening is just

757
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,119
that it goes over the top or not

758
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,120
right

759
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,720
it doesn't look like it

760
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,319
like it doesn't really look like it's

761
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,640
going over the top

762
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,158
but so that's why i'm concerned

763
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,640
but it's really hard to tell because it

764
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,880
happened so quickly and i don't know

765
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,559
that i would really be able to see

766
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,559
either way

767
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,558
um

768
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,000
what was happening

769
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,519
the fact that that happens to be a

770
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,839
changeover point doesn't help

771
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,839
um

772
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,240
and i guess now that i think about it i

773
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,159
also don't know if the changeover point

774
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,480
could be part of the problem

775
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,080
like when it changes over it's like the

776
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,079
collision is in the wrong place for one

777
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:32,519
frame or something like this

778
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,519
i don't think that could be possible but

779
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,240
never say never you know

780
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,640
can we get it to happen anywhere else

781
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,000
if we could get it to happen in similar

782
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,759
circumstances i would be more inclined

783
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,440
to believe it was going over the top but

784
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,599
if it only happens that one spot then it

785
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,840
seems unlikely

786
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,839
right

787
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:58,519
so i don't know

788
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,519
i don't know

789
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,199
i don't think i remember that those guys

790
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,199
left little poofs when they hop around

791
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,320
so i don't know this looks pretty stable

792
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,839
in every other case that we're looking

793
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,879
at here

794
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,000
um

795
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,679
so i really don't know what my guess is

796
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
i'm not sure

797
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,880
uh

798
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,200
i just do not know

799
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,200
um

800
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,120
we need to start being able to battle

801
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,119
enemies look they've boxed me in

802
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:28,720
uh so i don't really know

803
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,720
how i want to approach this

804
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,959
it seems very repeatable i mean i've

805
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,839
done it several times

806
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,840
right

807
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,679
and it seems like it is very specific to

808
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,839
that location

809
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,840
right

810
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,519
and it seems like it's able to get out

811
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,719
of the world like it seems like it's

812
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,719
able to tunnel to me

813
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,039
it doesn't look like it goes over the

814
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,398
top so how is it doing that

815
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:24,239
we know there's three colliders there

816
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,239
you can see them light up right

817
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,280
what's weirder still is it's able to get

818
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,679
back out as well

819
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,320
which also doesn't really make any sense

820
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,000
so it's a pretty peculiar

821
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,639
situation

822
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,639
it would seem

823
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,118
and i do think it it must be a bug

824
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,800
it must be a bug in the collision

825
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,800
routine as it stands

826
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,800
um

827
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,119
um

828
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,959
so there we go

829
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,240
so somehow it's able to kind of get

830
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,440
inside right like it looks like it's

831
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,439
getting inside so i think

832
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,200
i think there's some kind of

833
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,639
there's some kind of uh

834
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,280
like inadvertent

835
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,000
motion that we're allowing here and i'm

836
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,000
not sure what it's coming from

837
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
um

838
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,720
after changing to and

839
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,320
these obviously look correct

840
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,039
and

841
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:29,440
certainly that's a very permissive way

842
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:32,079
to move but it should still mean that no

843
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,440
matter where you move into you had at

844
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,560
least one

845
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,960
um non-colliding corner

846
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,519
so it doesn't seem like that should

847
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,920
really be an issue

848
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,920
um

849
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,000
like i can't imagine that i don't see

850
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,679
how that policy would ever allow

851
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,119
for the kind of motion that allows you

852
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:57,199
to get inside one of the other blockers

853
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,280
right that doesn't make any sense

854
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,799
furthermore it makes even less sense

855
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,280
because you don't get stuck

856
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,280
somehow

857
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,440
so that makes even less sense because if

858
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,199
you can't get stuck it wouldn't doesn't

859
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,800
really

860
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,519
it doesn't really make a lot of sense as

861
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,880
to how you're able to

862
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,559
like how are you able to get in there

863
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,640
you're going to be colliding as soon as

864
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:23,679
you're in there how are you able to move

865
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,920
through it

866
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,919
right

867
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,719
so this is a bit of a puzzler to say the

868
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,719
least

869
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,920
so i guess what i would say is you know

870
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,679
i don't really know any other way to

871
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,519
solve this other than

872
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,480
maybe to actually just put in the single

873
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,000
stepping

874
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,800
it's not that hard to put in single

875
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,480
stepping right uh you just like put

876
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,039
these in sort of a circular buffer and

877
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,039
reset them only so often

878
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,039
um

879
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,199
i assume this thing

880
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,199
like

881
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,399
i assume this thing has some way of

882
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,640
yeah bucketing this up we so you know we

883
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,000
could just do that

884
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:48,400
you know if we look at how this thing is

885
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,800
set up we've got these uh diagrams here

886
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,760
and maybe what we do is just let those

887
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,359
diagram groups kind of pile up

888
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,359
right

889
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:58,358
um

890
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,118
like if you imagined

891
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:11,920
this diagram reset

892
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,599
if you imagined that happening only

893
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,480
every so often

894
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,800
so

895
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,639
like if you imagined this having a thing

896
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,400
in it that was like

897
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,920
reset counter

898
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,320
you know

899
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,400
and you just said like okay

900
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,599
you know as we go through here

901
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,838
were every time someone does a reset

902
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,838
uh

903
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,680
if not group captured right

904
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,119
um every time someone does a reset we

905
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,960
just go like reset counter plus plus

906
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,640
and we just say like if that's equal to

907
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,519
16 or something

908
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:49,519
then it does this

909
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:59,598
in my imagination that would allow us to

910
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,960
store like 16 frames worth

911
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,760
of

912
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,199
you know

913
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,160
look back or whatever you want to call

914
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,439
it

915
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,078
right

916
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,318
um so now you can see

917
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,480
that just kind of getting you know

918
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:12,880
plopped on there right

919
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,838
um

920
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,599
[Music]

921
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:21,440
seems like that just keeps going why is

922
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,440
that not resetting is that cause

923
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,159
oh

924
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,519
slow morning

925
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,199
um

926
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,400
so that'd just leave trails right and so

927
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:42,480
if we wanted to

928
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,559
uh what we could do probably is

929
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,559
make something where it's easy for us to

930
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:50,000
keep some of these around

931
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:54,000
uh and then we can look at the diagram

932
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,159
uh single step uh after the

933
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,400
you know after the bug occurs

934
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:00,000
assuming we can get it to occur

935
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,160
uh which you know it seemed like it was

936
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,838
happening fairly frequently before

937
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,960
of course once we actually try to find

938
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,880
it there we go

939
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,119
so you saw that right

940
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,119
um

941
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,160
so i guess what i would say is

942
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,519
it's

943
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:18,559
really tough calls it looks like it's on

944
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,800
the top there which is really difficult

945
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:23,679
to say whether that's going over the top

946
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,680
let's um

947
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,480
let's maybe put in a hotkey so it's easy

948
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:32,159
for me to

949
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,480
stop it

950
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:35,838
and then we probably can like zoom in

951
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,318
there and look

952
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,318
right hopefully

953
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,118
i really wish this was a little easier

954
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,879
to make happen

955
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,039
um you can see that it's on the top when

956
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,440
it gets to the other side

957
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,960
uh but you can't really see exactly what

958
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,318
happens when the bug first happens so

959
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,559
it's a little bit

960
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,759
difficult to guess

961
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,679
um

962
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,440
again i don't think it's going over the

963
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,279
top because you think you'd see it more

964
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,000
clearly there

965
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,000
but i just don't know

966
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,720
like that clearly went over the top

967
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,358
right

968
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,358
so here's one thing we could try as well

969
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,039
that's maybe a reasonable thing to do

970
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,679
like what would happen if we just change

971
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,960
the heights of these things to be higher

972
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,759
right

973
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,119
um or put a blocker on top

974
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,480
like on the

975
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,720
across the like as a cap like a ceiling

976
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,719
um

977
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,118
that might be something to try as well

978
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,039
so that we know there isn't a hole that

979
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,519
way we're not looking at something that

980
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,960
could actually be a legitimate movement

981
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,280
um

982
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,639
so maybe that's a good good idea

983
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,040
i don't know

984
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,879
what the right way to do that is we we

985
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,358
have to do at some point because we

986
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,760
can't you know we have to not allow

987
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,679
entities to move upward in the world

988
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,800
let's look at a two

989
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,960
stack area here real quick just to see

990
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,400
um what the likelihood is

991
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,599
of

992
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,599
of us doing something stupid

993
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,760
so

994
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,519
i mean yes making them higher for

995
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,599
starters might just be a better idea i

996
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,719
don't know looks wise if it might not be

997
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,200
good though because it might be that

998
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:43,598
looks wise we want them stumpy like that

999
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:44,639
because just for art purposes so i don't

1000
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,838
know what we want to do with the

1001
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,799
blockers of course we can make the

1002
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:52,838
blockers any size we want um so maybe

1003
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,839
like just add the collision

1004
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:03,480
when we're actually putting walls in

1005
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,480
here uh

1006
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,800
this right here

1007
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,799
i believe uh the ad piece occluder is

1008
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,880
for the

1009
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,280
is specifically for the

1010
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,480
lighting system

1011
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,560
and so

1012
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,639
in theory that wouldn't affect the

1013
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,358
collision it's just this collision

1014
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,920
volume here right

1015
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:42,799
so the vol thing where that actually

1016
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,800
gets set up

1017
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,760
to take a look at

1018
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,599
yeah so you you make relative here

1019
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,838
you can see it makes traversal out of

1020
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,838
that

1021
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,920
yeah so i think what i would say is

1022
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,960
looking at the collision volume stuff

1023
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,720
here i think we just want if it's a wall

1024
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,199
we maybe just want to extend its

1025
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,318
collision volume uh up a little bit

1026
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,159
further

1027
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:20,000
so

1028
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,960
but leaving the actual visual the same

1029
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,079
it seems like probably the best call

1030
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,559
um

1031
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,880
in terms of whether or not it's a wall i

1032
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,000
think on wall is pretty much

1033
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,240
the only

1034
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,679
thing we've got so it would be something

1035
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:38,399
like you know if on wall

1036
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,639
uh then the entity collision volume you

1037
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,800
know max z

1038
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,279
we want that to just

1039
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,800
go upwards by some

1040
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,040
amount right

1041
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,800
uh and

1042
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:53,759
i'm not sure what that should be it

1043
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,760
looks like we have

1044
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,879
there's like ceilings

1045
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:01,838
that we were adding in here

1046
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,838
um

1047
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:14,480
so again i'm not really sure how high we

1048
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,920
want these collision

1049
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,440
volumes to go

1050
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,880
but i'm just going to hack that in there

1051
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,159
for now because i'm not sure what we

1052
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,240
want there

1053
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,559
let's just see what that does

1054
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:26,799
so that we can get some more information

1055
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,880
so when i look at it now you can see

1056
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,960
it's not much

1057
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,720
higher though

1058
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,240
um

1059
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:37,039
so we probably want it to be like

1060
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,598
another wall heights worth is is what

1061
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:39,599
i'm thinking

1062
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,440
so we probably want to add like the full

1063
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,679
wall height

1064
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,760
on again or half that height or

1065
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:51,039
something like that so we probably want

1066
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,800
to just do like something like that

1067
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:54,800
and see what that does for us

1068
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:00,079
so let's see how tall that is

1069
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,599
so that seems better right

1070
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,000
um

1071
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,599
that seems better

1072
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,079
uh okay

1073
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,760
so now we know that there should be no

1074
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,560
way to go over the top there's that's

1075
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,119
like just not possible so you can see

1076
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:16,559
now like and and that's really weird wow

1077
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,400
okay

1078
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,719
so

1079
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,639
you could see it still able to do the

1080
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:25,919
tunnel uh i think

1081
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:27,838
yeah

1082
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,920
it's still able to do it even with walls

1083
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:31,358
that high so we just have some kind of

1084
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,838
bug where you're allowed to tunnel

1085
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:36,078
through the corner somehow

1086
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:38,558
um

1087
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,240
but yeah i just don't know how i'm also

1088
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,760
kind of weirded out by the fact that if

1089
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:44,399
you look

1090
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,400
there's like

1091
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,239
is there somehow like

1092
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:52,078
not a collider there like why is that

1093
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:56,078
collider not showing up you see how

1094
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,440
they're all showing up but not that one

1095
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,119
but why not

1096
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,800
when you're in the corner you should be

1097
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,800
colliding with this collider as well

1098
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,920
um

1099
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,720
so that's really strange

1100
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,720
and i don't know

1101
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,440
i don't know what's going on there

1102
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,318
all right well we're not out of the

1103
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,160
woods yet i thought we were in good

1104
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:35,279
shape but we're not quite in good shape

1105
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:38,799
we still got some buggies uh in in the

1106
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,720
way this is working it's it's closer

1107
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,000
but it's not close enough

1108
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:42,349
right

1109
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,599
um

1110
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:46,078
[Music]

1111
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,079
and

1112
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,039
this bug is kind of annoying because

1113
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,279
it's definitely one of those collision

1114
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,119
bugs where you're like all right

1115
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,160
like everything seems to work fine but

1116
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,960
just not

1117
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:01,960
this one place right

1118
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,960
um

1119
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:12,480
i was able to make this happen down here

1120
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:14,239
once right too but

1121
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,318
uh

1122
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,959
again really hard it's really hard to

1123
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:22,199
get it to reproduce

1124
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,199
this behavior

1125
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,920
so just to be a little clearer about

1126
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,400
what i'm talking about

1127
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,200
so do you see how like when you go up

1128
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,440
and push into that corner do you see how

1129
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:46,000
the actual block

1130
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,440
the diagonal block lights up as a

1131
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,039
collider

1132
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,119
so right

1133
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:53,279
you can see like you know

1134
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,519
those white posts sticking out there of

1135
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,519
the

1136
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:03,039
you can you can see like the collider is

1137
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:05,599
active and it being checked

1138
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:07,519
and when i push up into the diagonal

1139
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,318
corner you can see that the one that's

1140
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:12,400
diagonal is getting checked as well

1141
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,558
what i was trying to say is that's not

1142
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:18,480
happening over here

1143
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,680
right like you'd never see

1144
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,400
those

1145
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,000
somehow that one ever getting lit up

1146
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,358
when it's in the corner

1147
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,039
and it should

1148
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:29,199
um you can see it light up the ones

1149
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:31,039
around it right like all the other ones

1150
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:32,639
will light up but not that one as far as

1151
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,239
i can tell

1152
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:37,838
um

1153
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,838
and that's weird right

1154
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,440
so i'm not sure what's going on there

1155
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,439
uh

1156
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,558
does it have a collision volume

1157
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,960
i assume it does

1158
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,920
but i don't know so maybe i could turn

1159
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,159
on drawing of colliders

1160
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,480
and just see

1161
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:00,480
um

1162
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,039
it would be nice if we had a way to do

1163
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,920
that but we don't at the moment

1164
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,920
um i don't think

1165
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:27,838
so i'll just

1166
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:27,838
enable it debug wise

1167
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,119
um

1168
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,400
so it seems pretty obvious that's there

1169
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,800
so that's you know that to me is a

1170
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,800
little bit of a of a

1171
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,318
concern

1172
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,880
i don't know for sure that that's

1173
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:50,159
implicated with this bug but looking at

1174
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,440
it that doesn't fill me with confidence

1175
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,440
right

1176
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,440
um

1177
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,159
[Music]

1178
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:29,679
so why would we not see that

1179
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,119
light up for collision

1180
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,558
the glove

1181
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,960
is a sphere

1182
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:37,599
it's pushing in i guess because the

1183
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,760
sphere because it is a sphere

1184
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,640
might be the reason because the sphere

1185
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:46,160
touches both sides

1186
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:48,318
but not the diagonal

1187
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,598
and it might be that it just so happens

1188
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,558
to be

1189
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,880
far enough over on this one that it does

1190
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,880
touch

1191
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:58,480
of course maybe the question there is

1192
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,200
why does this one touch because it seems

1193
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,960
like

1194
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:04,399
the sides should work the same way and

1195
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,400
the fact that they don't is perhaps

1196
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,358
perhaps a little suspicious

1197
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:17,480
um

1198
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,480
how do we want to handle this

1199
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,760
so

1200
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,000
i just had a thought

1201
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,440
is it

1202
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,440
possible

1203
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,440
well no

1204
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:04,159
so i guess what i would like to do here

1205
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,960
is i'd like to just be able to watch

1206
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,960
right i'd like to see how the search

1207
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,639
happens and what it does

1208
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,920
you know what i mean

1209
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:13,519
um

1210
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,680
so

1211
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:18,318
i think what we just need to do here is

1212
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:19,199
make it so that we can single step

1213
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:20,960
um

1214
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:23,759
have it so that as soon as i see this

1215
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,010
happen there's a key i can hit so i come

1216
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,760
through here and like i see it happen

1217
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:29,520
[Music]

1218
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,640
of course it's not happening anymore but

1219
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:32,480
you know

1220
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:34,719
it happens there i hit like some button

1221
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,599
like space bar right

1222
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,159
um

1223
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,079
and it freezes the diagramming so it

1224
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,358
just stops it stops recording new

1225
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,000
diagrams

1226
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,000
you know what i mean

1227
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,078
when it stops recording new diagrams

1228
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:51,199
then i can step through the diagrams

1229
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,480
like one by one and watch the solve

1230
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:52,899
happen

1231
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,719
um

1232
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:57,200
[Music]

1233
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:59,279
i don't know any way we're gonna solve

1234
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:01,519
this other than that

1235
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,519
uh

1236
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:06,480
because i just don't i just don't see

1237
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,239
how i'm i'm i'm never gonna know

1238
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,760
i'm never gonna guess

1239
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:12,159
like what

1240
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,599
series of events allowed it to do what

1241
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:16,558
it's doing

1242
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,720
um and especially because it seems so

1243
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,440
like like it has a rhyme or reason to it

1244
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:23,519
it seems like it's going

1245
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,519
in a very specific pattern and so it's

1246
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,519
really hard for me to understand like

1247
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:28,719
what what is actually happening there

1248
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,358
right

1249
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:34,078
um and especially because

1250
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:37,039
uh

1251
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,039
also don't know

1252
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,119
like there could be bugs anywhere

1253
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,720
it doesn't have to be in the voxel

1254
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,720
search we could have a bug in the

1255
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:46,639
collision code or something right

1256
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:48,879
that's saying that like

1257
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:50,339
you know it's not colliding

1258
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,720
so without seeing

1259
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:55,280
[Music]

1260
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:57,039
more information about what's gone wrong

1261
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,400
you know we don't really know i mean

1262
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,318
we've got a

1263
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,920
we've got a sphere

1264
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:03,519
collision detector that we just kind of

1265
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,639
threw in there

1266
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:08,639
um and the sphere collision detector

1267
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,480
we don't even know if that works

1268
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:11,759
right

1269
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,199
uh

1270
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,559
so

1271
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:16,480
i'm just not sure

1272
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,359
i'm just not sure

1273
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,079
looking at the sim region

1274
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,078
code here

1275
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:33,838
you know you can see we've got the test

1276
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,838
sphere thing

1277
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:40,838
uh

1278
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,680
like you could easily see this having a

1279
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,679
bug

1280
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,960
right

1281
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:57,960
um

1282
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,960
you could easily see this having a bug

1283
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:16,078
it's definitely getting to be that time

1284
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:18,318
when i start getting stuffy in the fall

1285
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,318
so

1286
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:26,399
you can see what we basically did is we

1287
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,720
compute all these things together and

1288
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,639
then just compute one value that's like

1289
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,399
do they intersect and you can see we

1290
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:34,078
basically combine the values as like if

1291
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,000
a and b are a sphere and the spheres

1292
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,720
intersect if a is a sphere and b is not

1293
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,760
a sphere and you get b rect a

1294
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:41,439
you know

1295
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,400
so you compute some values and then you

1296
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,159
compute

1297
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,039
all the um

1298
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:49,358
possible answers right

1299
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,920
uh and you know

1300
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:55,440
off you go

1301
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,519
so we know in this case um we're pretty

1302
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,838
much always in one particular of these

1303
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:02,079
right so in the collides at p we're

1304
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:04,400
always basically passing

1305
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,599
the glove which is a sphere as the

1306
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,838
entity

1307
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:11,680
which means that when we do uh shapes

1308
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:13,599
collide we do mover is sphere mover is

1309
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:16,000
sphere is true

1310
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,200
so it's a sphere and testosphere is

1311
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,318
false

1312
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:23,118
so we know that a is is sphere is true

1313
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,798
and b is sphere is false

1314
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,000
right

1315
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,000
um

1316
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
so i believe that means we're in this

1317
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
case right so b wrecked a sphere so a is

1318
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
uh

1319
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:42,719
i'm sorry b rect yeah b wrecked a sphere

1320
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:46,558
so it's a is a sphere and not b is a

1321
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:47,838
sphere so we're looking at this

1322
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,240
you know what i mean we're looking at b

1323
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:51,239
rect a sphere

1324
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,960
so b rect a sphere

1325
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,079
is just the length

1326
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,960
of the two

1327
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,960
less than the radius of of um

1328
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,960
of a

1329
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,798
so we're taking the length squared from

1330
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:23,440
the center

1331
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:24,880
of the sphere to the closest point on b

1332
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,358
and we're seeing

1333
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:32,480
if that is less than the squared radius

1334
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:37,199
of the sphere

1335
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:39,199
that seems totally obvious like i can't

1336
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,480
can't see i see where that would have a

1337
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:42,159
bug

1338
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,480
to be honest with you

1339
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:44,480
um

1340
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:50,318
so i'm not sure i would consider that

1341
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,318
particularly

1342
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:55,759
particularly likely to be this source of

1343
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,759
the bug

1344
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,760
right

1345
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:07,200
so that that doesn't seem super likely

1346
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:09,439
um in the collides at p

1347
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:12,558
you know there's not a lot to it

1348
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,720
and we're drawing these things

1349
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,880
so it doesn't seem

1350
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,159
like there would be

1351
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:21,280
[Music]

1352
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:21,279
much of a reason

1353
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,798
to suspect that either

1354
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,838
so

1355
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:29,838
yeah i just don't

1356
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,720
so this is

1357
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:47,838
this part is a little bit

1358
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:52,679
iffy though

1359
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,719
we don't really know much about refined

1360
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,119
voxel placement

1361
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:03,118
and

1362
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,559
and we haven't thought very much about

1363
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:11,759
how that might affect things

1364
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:13,519
i'm not really concerned about it in

1365
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,920
this case because

1366
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:18,079
like i said it shouldn't

1367
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,639
matter much

1368
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,039
because those colliders are solid

1369
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,960
so it's not like there's just a wall

1370
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:26,400
there that's like infinitely thin and if

1371
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,079
you got on the other side of it you

1372
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,119
could move around the colliders were

1373
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:33,519
treated as solid so if you moved into

1374
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,640
him you should be frozen in place at

1375
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:36,838
that point

1376
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:38,400
right you shouldn't be able to move

1377
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:40,078
anymore

1378
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,280
um because when you come out of this

1379
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,599
thing

1380
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,160
we're not handling the embedded case

1381
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,359
and this is why this is so

1382
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:50,838
um

1383
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:54,400
this is why i'm so sure there's a bug

1384
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:56,318
right is because if we're

1385
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,039
basically freezing you so if coroners

1386
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:00,880
come back and they're all unoccupied so

1387
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:03,119
you can't move anymore

1388
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,358
then how are you able to

1389
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,358
go anywhere once you get embedded in the

1390
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:08,239
wall right

1391
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:11,038
um

1392
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:14,038
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense

1393
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,039
so

1394
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,599
so it feels like you should always be

1395
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,200
trapped inside your initial cell

1396
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,240
and you should never be able to actually

1397
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:36,558
get out of there you know what i mean

1398
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,558
um

1399
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:42,200
so that part doesn't add up

1400
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:01,239
hmm

1401
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,440
yep i still don't have it i still don't

1402
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,559
have it

1403
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,400
it's a slow morning i'm very tired i i

1404
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,680
didn't sleep well last night at all

1405
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,920
so

1406
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:21,519
it may be that i'm just missing

1407
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,599
something obvious

1408
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:25,440
uh and if i were more awake

1409
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,119
we wouldn't have this problem

1410
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,480
but i don't actually know

1411
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,599
uh it could actually also just be

1412
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,639
difficult

1413
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,920
so

1414
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:35,759
i'm not sure

1415
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:38,559
i i'm not sure any way to really

1416
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,720
explain that what i could do too just

1417
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,160
really quickly here uh

1418
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:44,959
is

1419
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:47,279
change how we're drawing these diagrams

1420
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,679
so you know a lot of this is not that

1421
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,839
useful so drawing the spheres and stuff

1422
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:54,239
as is not that useful

1423
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:56,000
it doesn't really let us see very much

1424
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:59,439
of perhaps what we want

1425
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:04,318
to see and so what we could do here is

1426
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:07,200
maybe draw something that elucidates

1427
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:09,119
what the corner status is a little more

1428
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,798
clearly right

1429
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,798
so if you

1430
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:13,798
imagined

1431
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:22,160
when we do check corners

1432
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:24,640
we're mostly drawing the colliders but

1433
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:27,038
you know what if instead we mostly drew

1434
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:28,719
so you know instead of like this

1435
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,160
right

1436
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:32,078
um

1437
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:36,159
if instead of that

1438
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:39,880
i feel like we could instead

1439
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:39,879
draw like

1440
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:48,240
what the corner state was

1441
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,240
so what if we like turn this off

1442
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,920
entirely

1443
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,400
uh

1444
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:57,200
and then

1445
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,200
when we do

1446
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:03,599
when we do check corners

1447
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:07,440
anytime we do a new corner

1448
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:09,680
we would draw that point

1449
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,358
and we'd just draw whether it was in or

1450
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:13,199
out

1451
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,038
you know what i'm saying

1452
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:17,358
um

1453
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,359
like

1454
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,599
turn all these off

1455
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:28,079
and then just draw the points

1456
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:30,640
so when we go in here and we test one of

1457
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,839
these uh points

1458
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:32,960
we say

1459
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:34,318
okay

1460
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,240
the

1461
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:38,000
whatever the corner is that we were

1462
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,798
looking at

1463
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,599
uh we know that this was the test point

1464
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:42,639
um

1465
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,760
we will

1466
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:47,838
we will go and say

1467
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,839
diagram

1468
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:50,838
point

1469
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,760
do we have that

1470
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,920
uh

1471
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,920
we'll draw a point there

1472
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,640
and we'll just make the point color

1473
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:12,000
uh be based on the occupied

1474
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,880
setting

1475
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,119
so

1476
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,119
if the field occupied

1477
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,559
is

1478
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:21,519
one way or the other way will set its

1479
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:25,200
right

1480
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,199
so we'll set the color

1481
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,798
if it's an occupied point uh it's red

1482
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,480
and if it's a unoccupied point it's

1483
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:38,590
green

1484
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,920
and now we'd just like be spamming

1485
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:41,440
[Music]

1486
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,000
points that

1487
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,000
we can see

1488
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,920
right as we go

1489
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:49,920
um

1490
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,159
and you know that looks pretty good like

1491
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:55,440
as i'm looking at it it's like okay yeah

1492
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:57,440
like it's there's red collision points

1493
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,760
uh in the places where you can't place

1494
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,760
the thing like near the wall when it

1495
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:05,039
gets too close to the wall

1496
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:06,640
uh and green ones where you can

1497
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,640
and you know i don't expect to

1498
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:10,558
necessarily see anything here

1499
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:13,279
but i'm just curious

1500
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,960
like what it's gonna show

1501
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,200
when it does that hop

1502
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,199
right

1503
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:31,358
and of course it's not doing the hop now

1504
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:34,400
so we don't even we don't see anything

1505
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:36,159
because it's kind of interior right um

1506
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,559
one thing i could do here to make it

1507
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:39,440
easier on us to see is to just not draw

1508
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,440
those

1509
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,880
so when we're in the entity code like if

1510
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,119
i want to be able to just look through

1511
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,119
them

1512
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:51,038
what i could do is in here where we go

1513
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,559
and

1514
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:55,039
render stuff

1515
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,200
i could not draw

1516
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:59,440
uh cubes

1517
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,439
so

1518
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:03,119
you know

1519
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:04,318
just turn that off

1520
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,240
you don't you don't get to do that

1521
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:07,440
anymore

1522
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:10,558
um

1523
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:12,400
so now we can just watch

1524
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:16,119
that happen right

1525
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,118
so let's try that

1526
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,560
of course without the cubes i can't

1527
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:38,600
quite tell so you know what i'm going to

1528
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,600
turn on the colliders as well

1529
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,798
all right

1530
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:50,838
so here's just like the collision space

1531
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:54,560
of the worlds

1532
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:56,880
um so here's the hallway right and

1533
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,480
there's the doorway

1534
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,079
um

1535
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:02,718
and now i just have to get this thing to

1536
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:05,519
like go through there

1537
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,880
so that was weird like why was it black

1538
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,880
instead of

1539
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,279
what does that even mean

1540
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,279
do you see that

1541
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,399
i am very confused by what that means

1542
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:30,039
like it wasn't green and it wasn't red

1543
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,039
what does that mean

1544
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:39,238
again i really need a way to pause this

1545
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:03,439
so maybe let's add that pause feature

1546
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:05,279
where we stop clearing

1547
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:06,799
um and then we can just go take a look

1548
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:08,319
at what it actually drew there because i

1549
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,480
don't understand like that it didn't

1550
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:12,319
even look like something i was drawing

1551
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:14,839
it's probably something from some other

1552
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:16,479
part of the code

1553
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,319
um

1554
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:20,559
which will be good information but like

1555
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:23,039
i don't know why we're drawing black

1556
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,640
points like who was drawing that

1557
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:27,600
and why

1558
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:30,560
um so let's do let's go to the reset

1559
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,440
code and and make that be a thing

1560
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,239
so

1561
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:35,599
in here we've got a thing where

1562
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:36,799
uh

1563
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,120
you know

1564
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:42,000
we can turn diagramming on and off

1565
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:42,000
pretty easily right

1566
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:48,480
uh and so what we need is a way to turn

1567
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:49,759
diagramming on and off and also like

1568
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:52,158
clearing

1569
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,280
on and off or and i guess i don't know

1570
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:54,639
how to say that

1571
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:56,960
uh

1572
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,600
we just need to turn the diagramming off

1573
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,039
at that point and then i think it would

1574
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,440
be fine

1575
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:06,238
i don't know how to do how we want to do

1576
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:07,439
this reset counterpart here i mean maybe

1577
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:10,079
we'll just

1578
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:11,439
record 32 for now which is which is

1579
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,840
more

1580
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:13,839
um

1581
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,350
and then in the

1582
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:20,349
[Music]

1583
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:27,158
in the part where we do diagram is on

1584
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:27,158
uh

1585
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:34,800
captured i guess is the thing

1586
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:38,079
so i guess we just say capture

1587
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:40,159
so we just say when we say capture

1588
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:44,479
you know that is the thing that that

1589
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,479
makes it stop doing the diagramming

1590
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,239
now i don't know we probably need to add

1591
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:50,879
a button for that or maybe we don't it's

1592
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:52,959
right there so i guess we just

1593
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,840
that's all we really need

1594
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,840
um

1595
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,920
i just probably need a hotkey for it

1596
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,920
because i don't know that i can do it in

1597
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,920
time

1598
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:36,359
come on

1599
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,679
i know you would like to slip through

1600
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:42,158
there please

1601
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,158
do so

1602
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:47,119
and of course now

1603
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,960
that i want to actually capture it

1604
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:51,359
it doesn't

1605
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,600
want to do it

1606
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:56,079
why

1607
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,079
there we go

1608
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,920
i was not able to do it in time exactly

1609
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:01,600
as i said

1610
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,960
all right so i need to add a hotkey for

1611
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,840
that because doing with the mouse is

1612
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,840
just not going to cut it

1613
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,319
so i don't know which hotkey i should

1614
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:16,000
add but

1615
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:19,000
we'll take a look so we have the f keys

1616
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
um

1617
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,640
set up in the platform layer here

1618
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:26,880
um i don't know what they're called like

1619
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:30,079
debug keys or something like that

1620
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:33,199
uh but there's basically like a you know

1621
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:35,039
an f key pressed thing

1622
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:38,000
so i want to go take a look at where

1623
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:38,000
we're processing that

1624
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,159
and

1625
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,039
you know we'll

1626
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:45,039
we'll deal with that

1627
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:48,239
there

1628
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:49,600
so

1629
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:52,639
maybe

1630
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,640
because we've got the

1631
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:56,479
we've got the diagram thing

1632
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:58,719
[Music]

1633
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,639
this collision thing here

1634
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:02,719
uh maybe we'll do

1635
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,520
a thing that allows us to toggle there

1636
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:06,480
so if you know if like the shift key was

1637
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,560
down

1638
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:11,279
or something like that like one of the

1639
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:13,520
other uh debug things we have

1640
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:15,289
uh so if you hit shift

1641
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,199
as you're doing it

1642
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:19,198
[Music]

1643
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:23,559
shift f9

1644
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,559
it'll toggle that state

1645
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,960
or just set it to true

1646
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,320
clearing it i guess you can just do with

1647
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,158
the button

1648
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:39,359
so that's just a way of like having

1649
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:40,719
there be some way i can do it more

1650
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:42,238
quickly than having to try and click a

1651
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:45,359
button with the mouse which is not going

1652
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:45,359
to really do it right

1653
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,079
um

1654
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:51,678
so if we look here like you know all

1655
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:54,719
right we're going around and whatever

1656
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:58,319
and then i need to i like see something

1657
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,319
and i can hit f shift f9

1658
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:06,120
did that actually do it didn't look like

1659
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:06,119
there was any

1660
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,920
no that does it

1661
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:18,079
that does it all right

1662
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,119
um all right so hopefully this will get

1663
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:21,119
us something

1664
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:24,679
you know maybe it will maybe it won't i

1665
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,679
guess we'll find out

1666
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:32,158
i could probably just crank that number

1667
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,159
up higher too

1668
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:39,000
number of frames captured

1669
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,199
and once again

1670
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:59,039
it proves rather challenging to actually

1671
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,039
get this thing to go around

1672
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,920
come on man

1673
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,399
it really doesn't want to do that come

1674
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:16,799
on go in there come on get through

1675
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:18,399
you always do it you know the bug always

1676
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,920
happens when it wants to happen it

1677
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:22,799
doesn't happen when you want it to

1678
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:26,079
happen that's that's the really

1679
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,239
egregious thing about bugs

1680
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,519
is you know they don't happen when you

1681
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:31,678
tell them to

1682
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,280
it's really the worst part of it

1683
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,960
if bugs always happened when you told

1684
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:36,960
them to they'd be a lot easier to find

1685
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:41,919
it's kind of fun like seeing the weird

1686
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:44,079
like springy glove thing

1687
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,480
uh it's kind of fun seeing the diagram

1688
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:48,719
of that

1689
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:50,959
right it just looks kind of cool

1690
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,960
um

1691
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,640
all right well i can't really do much if

1692
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,360
this bug will not happen

1693
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,360
mr bug

1694
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,119
this is there you go

1695
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:11,839
so that's mr bug

1696
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,840
um so now we have an actual capture

1697
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,480
so yeah i mean like it's

1698
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:21,679
as far as i can tell this is just

1699
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:21,678
extremely erroneous

1700
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:26,400
the collision detector says none of

1701
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:29,900
those things are allowed it's it's just

1702
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:31,439
able to move

1703
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:32,960
[Music]

1704
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:37,119
even though the collision detector says

1705
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,119
very specifically that it may not do so

1706
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,520
right

1707
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:55,279
um so i mean really good information

1708
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,280
so that's nice i mean

1709
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,400
we basically know

1710
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:00,639
uh

1711
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,719
that

1712
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,719
whatever we did here there's like a

1713
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,640
really severe bug like we're not looking

1714
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,560
for something subtle like numerical

1715
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:11,039
error or something here like this is

1716
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,640
like it's just it allowed this to get

1717
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:14,319
placed

1718
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:18,640
in this region

1719
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:18,639
like you can see those pink marks right

1720
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,360
i believe those pink marks are the

1721
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,920
root finding marks if i remember

1722
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:28,559
correctly when we added those in there

1723
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,000
so so like if you

1724
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,360
go to

1725
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,800
the

1726
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:34,799
part where we do the refine

1727
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,960
uh

1728
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,559
it's this

1729
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,399
i believe

1730
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,640
you know what i'm saying

1731
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:49,119
um

1732
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,119
i think

1733
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:55,840
you know don't quote me on that

1734
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:55,840
uh but i think it's that

1735
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,199
so despite the fact that the collision

1736
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,960
detector

1737
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:08,079
very clearly

1738
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:10,480
and unambiguously says that there's no

1739
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:12,960
way to place it anywhere outside of this

1740
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:16,158
little region over here

1741
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:18,319
nonetheless we somehow called the

1742
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:21,679
placement routine to refine the voxel

1743
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:23,759
placement way the heck out here

1744
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:26,079
so the mystery is

1745
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:29,280
what is wrong you know how did we screw

1746
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:31,679
up the routine that bad

1747
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:36,920
uh that it was able

1748
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,920
uh to somehow think it could do that

1749
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:58,639
so there's even

1750
01:19:56,238 --> 01:19:58,639
more

1751
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:06,560
bad things here than that

1752
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:09,600
actually

1753
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:20,238
so riddle me this

1754
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:20,238
collision man

1755
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,320
think about this diagram that we're

1756
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:26,639
seeing

1757
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:28,960
there's something else that really

1758
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:32,000
doesn't add up here

1759
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:34,319
we don't check corners

1760
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,319
for

1761
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:41,039
anything that's not connected to

1762
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:44,960
an occupiable square

1763
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:47,119
this is stack based we push one initial

1764
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,520
cell onto the stack

1765
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:51,119
and then from each cell

1766
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,840
that's in the stack

1767
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:56,079
when we pop one off

1768
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:58,800
we're supposed to only push things onto

1769
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:00,880
the stack that are accessible

1770
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,039
right that have a green

1771
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,039
so in this diagram

1772
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:07,039
we are only supposed to push things on

1773
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:09,279
that have a green

1774
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:10,079
like cube

1775
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:12,880
uh

1776
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:14,719
touching them somewhere so

1777
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,719
uh

1778
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,560
we shouldn't even see

1779
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:21,359
these red

1780
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:22,960
squares out here because how were they

1781
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:24,880
ever reached

1782
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,840
you should only ever be able to see the

1783
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:30,639
red squares surrounding the green

1784
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,639
squares and then that's it

1785
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:39,039
so our voxel stack push

1786
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:39,039
is itself broken

1787
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,560
right um

1788
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:50,639
we don't really need to talk about the

1789
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:53,519
collision section at all

1790
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:55,199
because we're already wrong like we

1791
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,960
already screwed up

1792
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:58,799
before we even get to the part where

1793
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,319
we're testing to see if something can be

1794
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,239
somewhere

1795
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:03,840
we're already wrong before we ever get

1796
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:06,319
there because we never should have been

1797
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:11,639
able to do that

1798
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:11,639
right we we should not have been able to

1799
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:19,519
we never should have called check

1800
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:22,399
corners on most of those places where

1801
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:25,840
we're seeing the red corners

1802
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:25,839
so like when we come through here

1803
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,279
you know there's two ways that could be

1804
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,710
happening

1805
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:32,710
[Music]

1806
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:42,560
um oh

1807
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:42,559
so it's probably just this

1808
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,320
so it's probably just yeah wow that

1809
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,560
sucks that i spent all this time looking

1810
01:22:50,319 --> 01:22:53,840
for that when we if we had just started

1811
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,679
working on the embed code we would have

1812
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,480
probably fixed it it's probably just

1813
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,600
this

1814
01:22:56,479 --> 01:22:59,839
right

1815
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,840
um it's probably just that when you find

1816
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,960
one that's completely embedded you

1817
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,960
switch them all to false

1818
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:11,359
now of course that well

1819
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:13,519
before i say that though

1820
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:17,158
how did you get there because you

1821
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,159
shouldn't have been able to

1822
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,600
so to be honest

1823
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,440
to be honest that doesn't really quite

1824
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:38,879
explain it

1825
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:40,799
uh

1826
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,400
because yes

1827
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,760
that allows you to move through embedded

1828
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:47,439
spaces but only if you started in an

1829
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,639
embedded space if you didn't start an

1830
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:51,279
embedded space

1831
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:53,600
how would you ever get into you would

1832
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:55,840
never test a cell that had all of its

1833
01:23:53,600 --> 01:24:00,159
corners filled because how did you get

1834
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:02,719
there you had to move to it from

1835
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:05,039
one that was filled and we can see that

1836
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:06,079
that was not happening like this is

1837
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:07,039
green

1838
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:08,800
so

1839
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:12,399
presumably

1840
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,760
unless it accidentally

1841
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:14,719
okay

1842
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,719
let's

1843
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:20,000
create a hypothesis

1844
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,000
maybe this is what happened

1845
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,840
maybe what happens is

1846
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:38,639
our place our refinement placement

1847
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:40,079
routine is capable of accidentally

1848
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:43,119
putting you

1849
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:46,559
slightly outside of the cell that you

1850
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:49,439
were in on the previous frame

1851
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,920
and what happens is in this one specific

1852
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:54,399
case it does that

1853
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,920
and it puts you into a cell that you're

1854
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:59,039
embedded in

1855
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,920
then the embed code which is wrong

1856
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:03,519
because this happens and then we don't

1857
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,520
process it right this is the to do that

1858
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:08,080
we were going to do today

1859
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:10,480
the embed code that is wrong then kicks

1860
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:12,800
in and allows you to move anywhere

1861
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:14,959
because it doesn't properly currently do

1862
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:17,199
anything it just lets you go anywhere

1863
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,198
right

1864
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,560
if that were the case

1865
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:27,039
then it would be

1866
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,639
the refined voxel placement

1867
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:30,079
uh routine

1868
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:32,319
right

1869
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:33,359
uh

1870
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:37,759
the get

1871
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:39,198
closest point in box conservative

1872
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,840
would be like

1873
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:41,839
erroneous

1874
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:08,439
that could be it

1875
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:16,238
let's test this hypothesis

1876
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,080
because it seems like a reasonable

1877
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:20,000
hypothesis

1878
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:24,639
if that were true

1879
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,158
then if i simply didn't do this

1880
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,079
right

1881
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:29,759
if i simply said

1882
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:32,639
no

1883
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,840
we will not change the corner occupancy

1884
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:36,960
results

1885
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:39,440
right uh

1886
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,639
then that should not have happened

1887
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:42,638
meaning we shouldn't be able to

1888
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:43,920
reproduce the exact same scenario we

1889
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:46,719
just saw

1890
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:48,960
we could produce a different scenario um

1891
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:51,840
and in fact you can see it getting stuck

1892
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,800
there right uh so this is interesting so

1893
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,719
so

1894
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,480
maybe we were actually in a place where

1895
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:59,039
we've got some kind of a problem with

1896
01:26:56,479 --> 01:27:00,559
how that refinement placement is working

1897
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:02,960
um

1898
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,639
or and or those were coming from the

1899
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,719
fact that there's an immutable the head

1900
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:08,480
part is minimal but either way so that's

1901
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:10,800
very interesting so the question is can

1902
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:13,279
we reproduce the same problem

1903
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,199
if we do not allow movement

1904
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:16,880
through the embedded spaces

1905
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:18,479
and unfortunately it's kind of hard to

1906
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,560
tell right because we don't know for

1907
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:22,000
sure how to trigger the bug we can only

1908
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,000
sit here and do this for a little while

1909
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,600
and say okay if it never happens then

1910
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,319
maybe that's the case

1911
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:32,320
uh which isn't the best but you know

1912
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:34,000
i'm not sure what else to do

1913
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:36,158
so if that's the case that's good to

1914
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,198
know but we still so we kind of shift

1915
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:41,198
our thinking our bug is not um really

1916
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:43,519
allowing us to move through

1917
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:46,000
spaces that's not what the bug was what

1918
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,560
the bug actually is is that we can place

1919
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,560
the glove

1920
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,679
um or place the entity outside of the

1921
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:55,119
cell

1922
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:55,119
that it should have stopped in

1923
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,119
so that seems bad

1924
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:01,839
uh

1925
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:01,840
so

1926
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:05,359
maybe what we do is try to hunt that

1927
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,399
down

1928
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:08,719
uh because that's a lot more

1929
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:10,079
straightforward we can also assert it

1930
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:11,039
it's something we can assert pretty

1931
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:12,960
easily

1932
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:15,119
we just say look this is the cell that

1933
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,960
we said you were supposed to stop in

1934
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:18,000
show me the position that you end up

1935
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:21,039
picking

1936
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:24,319
uh and if that position doesn't uh

1937
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:25,439
truncate to the same cell then that's an

1938
01:28:24,319 --> 01:28:26,559
assert

1939
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:28,960
right

1940
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,880
so let's just add that assertion and see

1941
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,039
if we can get that to fire

1942
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,639
um

1943
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:36,719
and then we can maybe look at that a

1944
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:38,960
little more closely i will say that

1945
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,800
without that code enabled that allows

1946
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,198
you to move out of the embedded spaces

1947
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:45,679
uh you can't seem to get this bug to

1948
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:46,960
trigger so i do think that's what our

1949
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:47,760
problem is

1950
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,359
but

1951
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,679
again

1952
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:53,359
quote unquote what our problem is

1953
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:56,560
what we really are saying is we do still

1954
01:28:53,359 --> 01:29:00,960
have a problem it's just not a problem

1955
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:02,480
of the type we were thinking about right

1956
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,719
okay

1957
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:07,359
so i would say

1958
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:08,158
let's try to focus here

1959
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:11,279
on

1960
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:12,479
that like yeah let let's look and see if

1961
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:14,319
we can get

1962
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:16,399
some more insight into

1963
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:19,279
why we will be placing outside now this

1964
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:21,679
part of the routine is pretty janky

1965
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:23,279
uh and it has some to do's on it so we

1966
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:25,119
kind of already knew that it wasn't

1967
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:27,519
great

1968
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:30,719
but it's unclear why it would be that

1969
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:33,520
not great uh because the epsilon here

1970
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:36,399
that's being used is pretty large

1971
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:38,320
i mean considering the values that we're

1972
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:39,599
talking about here are in the tens or

1973
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:42,719
hundreds

1974
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:45,679
and it's point zero zero zero one

1975
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:48,319
i mean it could be that that epsilon is

1976
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,359
too small that's not entirely out of the

1977
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:50,319
question

1978
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:53,319
um

1979
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:53,319
but

1980
01:29:55,359 --> 01:30:00,639
uh

1981
01:29:57,198 --> 01:30:00,638
i don't know um

1982
01:30:05,119 --> 01:30:09,119
it does seem a little weird what i will

1983
01:30:07,359 --> 01:30:11,519
say is

1984
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:11,519
that

1985
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:16,718
i agree with the to do here that we

1986
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:20,639
should be doing the tests

1987
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:22,000
so that boxes are in a fixed domain

1988
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,119
so that we don't have to do this it's

1989
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,880
just min

1990
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:26,880
of the box max and so on

1991
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:31,678
but anyway

1992
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,719
so looking at that code

1993
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:45,039
i mean i don't see a lot of ways that

1994
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:49,399
that

1995
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:49,399
screws up uh

1996
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,639
the way the refinement works

1997
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:01,840
i guess i could believe that

1998
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,079
may

1999
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,079
it

2000
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:08,559
puts you

2001
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:11,599
past it slightly

2002
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,600
because of the lerp

2003
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:16,800
[Music]

2004
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:17,920
again not super compelling

2005
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:21,800
so

2006
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,800
i guess i would say

2007
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:36,638
i guess i would say i'm going to start

2008
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,560
with

2009
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:39,440
uh the assertion

2010
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,719
so

2011
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:42,479
when we

2012
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:43,679
do we've got this

2013
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:46,000
notion

2014
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:48,719
in the earlier part of the code where we

2015
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,560
just say okay let's get the index

2016
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:53,920
for some location

2017
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:56,400
what i'd like to do is say after we

2018
01:31:53,920 --> 01:32:00,560
refine the voxel placement

2019
01:31:56,399 --> 01:32:02,879
um i'd like to do a double check here so

2020
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,880
you know

2021
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:14,399
uh i'd like to do a get index where we

2022
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:15,760
say for the grid tell me if this new

2023
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:18,079
placement

2024
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:20,880
um is going to be the same

2025
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:22,800
so i'd basically say like okay

2026
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:26,719
what's the

2027
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:28,880
what's the new p index it's this right

2028
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,960
uh and then i'd like to assert that the

2029
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:33,440
new p index

2030
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:36,800
uh is the same

2031
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:38,638
as the best cell index that we said it

2032
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,400
had to go in

2033
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,600
you know what i mean

2034
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:46,000
um so that way like any time that we

2035
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,440
place the glove

2036
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,279
in

2037
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:51,039
a cell that isn't the cell it was

2038
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:53,119
supposed to stop in

2039
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:54,560
we will get uh

2040
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:55,760
you know an error

2041
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:59,400
right

2042
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:59,400
um or hopefully

2043
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:23,360
and strangely like that is not happening

2044
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:27,440
anywhere

2045
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:27,439
which doesn't make a lot of sense to me

2046
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:35,599
i mean i suppose one other thing is

2047
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:38,560
ensuring that the best cell i

2048
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:40,079
like that that was actually not

2049
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,760
embedding

2050
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:45,119
so another thing we could do here is

2051
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:49,079
assert

2052
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:49,079
corners embedded

2053
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,600
of course it starts embedded doesn't it

2054
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,840
so

2055
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,360
that's kind of an issue it would be nice

2056
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:05,039
if the glove didn't start embedded so

2057
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:06,960
that we could actually use that trigger

2058
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:09,039
um

2059
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:11,439
i mean maybe we can

2060
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:13,198
do that

2061
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:16,198
trying to think of how we fix that

2062
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:16,198
problem

2063
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:29,439
i mean i guess like we just when we

2064
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:32,479
spawn the glove just spawn the glove

2065
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:35,039
over to the side more so it's not

2066
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:35,039
embedded

2067
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:39,439
like

2068
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:40,479
presumably that wouldn't be particularly

2069
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:42,319
difficult

2070
01:34:40,479 --> 01:34:45,279
uh

2071
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:47,840
yeah i mean like you know just

2072
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:47,840
like that

2073
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:59,480
okay

2074
01:34:56,479 --> 01:34:59,479
so

2075
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:05,679
again kind of tricky because i'm not

2076
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:08,639
sure we we do have the problem of

2077
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:11,118
the hero's head

2078
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:15,560
is gonna create embedding scenarios that

2079
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:15,559
we can't necessarily prevent

2080
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:26,000
and like is that one of them or not

2081
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,840
how about

2082
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:29,840
this

2083
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:45,559
when it gets embedded we will set the

2084
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,560
capture

2085
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:18,079
so

2086
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:21,760
you know i would say that's again kind

2087
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:26,559
of possibly okay because of that again

2088
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,560
the head being where it is um

2089
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,520
so you know what's one thing we could do

2090
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:36,800
is we could turn off that head collider

2091
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:39,279
as well or shrink it down so that we

2092
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,640
don't have this problem as much

2093
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:41,039
um

2094
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:42,639
[Music]

2095
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:44,479
because again we can that's something we

2096
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:47,279
can adjust later so

2097
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:50,559
you know if we look at this

2098
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:52,399
uh maybe we make that less wide

2099
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,920
uh i don't even know why it was that

2100
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:56,158
shape to begin with

2101
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,158
but

2102
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,440
that way we don't have that problem

2103
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,880
right

2104
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:08,000
all right

2105
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:10,400
um so here you can see we do have a case

2106
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,279
with embedding there i don't know to

2107
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:17,118
what extent that is

2108
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:17,118
i also don't know why is that updating

2109
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,199
because you'd think capture being off

2110
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,560
would mean that it's not going to do

2111
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:24,238
anything anymore but you can see that

2112
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,760
that slowly kind of updates which is a

2113
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:27,839
little bit weird

2114
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,840
uh anyway oh that may be because we're

2115
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:33,800
hopping through the corn yet okay

2116
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,800
anyway uh so

2117
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,719
we could probably now go back to an

2118
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,600
assertion and then start to debug from

2119
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:41,359
there

2120
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:44,639
uh so let's take a look

2121
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:44,639
if we do an assert

2122
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,719
uh the corners aren't embedded

2123
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,320
when's the first time it fires is it

2124
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:57,599
when we try to go through the wall there

2125
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:57,599
or what happens

2126
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,600
so it's when we're i think kind of

2127
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,280
forcing like again it's i think it's

2128
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,400
just the head collision let's turn that

2129
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:07,519
off

2130
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:09,039
for now

2131
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:12,040
um

2132
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:12,039
entirely

2133
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:25,119
okay cool

2134
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:27,440
so we're actually getting that collide

2135
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:29,039
that like embedding

2136
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,759
right

2137
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:34,639
you know

2138
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:37,639
effectively during an actual

2139
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:37,639
uh

2140
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:54,158
so this may actually be the thing that i

2141
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,238
was talking about before

2142
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:58,559
wow uh

2143
01:38:56,238 --> 01:39:00,799
is it so

2144
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,760
what i said originally is i was like

2145
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,639
well

2146
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,760
when the actual movement of all of these

2147
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:09,199
things

2148
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:10,239
when we hop from one region to the next

2149
01:39:09,198 --> 01:39:13,519
region

2150
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:14,879
we re-center what the world is centered

2151
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:17,520
around

2152
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,520
you know what i mean

2153
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:27,000
i wonder if that's literally what's

2154
01:39:21,118 --> 01:39:27,000
happening if when you slide the forward

2155
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:32,559
it was

2156
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:34,560
actually creating a circumstance where

2157
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,000
it puts you into embedding where you

2158
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,159
weren't before

2159
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,479
because you're just off by a little that

2160
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:42,079
seems so unlikely though in this case

2161
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:43,439
that i'm not really willing to believe

2162
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:45,679
it

2163
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:45,678
right

2164
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:51,279
like that that's just that didn't that

2165
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,199
wasn't the case

2166
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:56,880
so all right let's start to look a

2167
01:39:53,198 --> 01:39:59,879
little bit more for it let's do

2168
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,880
this

2169
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,239
let's just

2170
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:19,158
set a little if statement here that will

2171
01:40:14,238 --> 01:40:19,158
set saw embedding and then if we do

2172
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:27,920
we'll set the capture

2173
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:36,239
so this way we'll say look

2174
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:37,919
uh we'll we'll capture any time we hit

2175
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:40,079
an embedded case

2176
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,319
because we like had one

2177
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:44,079
like right away

2178
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:47,799
yeah so we have one now

2179
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:47,800
right so right there

2180
01:40:57,039 --> 01:41:01,679
so for starters

2181
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:05,198
i'm a little confused with

2182
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:07,600
like why is that why does that even

2183
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:10,000
what's that even embedded in

2184
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:12,639
there are no colliders here so how did

2185
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,639
that happen

2186
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:18,719
we turned the hero's collision volume

2187
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:21,760
off right i mean it's not

2188
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:24,800
there is no collider on the hero

2189
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:26,960
so how did we end up with these

2190
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:29,520
thinking they were colliding

2191
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,118
when they are not like there's no

2192
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,800
collision here

2193
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:34,719
right

2194
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,679
so it seems like we have

2195
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:37,359
a

2196
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:40,158
bug

2197
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:44,759
with setting corners to colliding that

2198
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:44,759
are not actually colliding with anything

2199
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:48,638
right

2200
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,159
so could we investigate that

2201
01:41:56,238 --> 01:42:00,479
uh what is going on there so in the

2202
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:03,839
check corners call

2203
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:03,839
we get the cell bounds

2204
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,039
and we loop through

2205
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,760
the

2206
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:11,760
eight corners of the voxel

2207
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:16,639
we look to see

2208
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:19,360
what the corner index is in each case

2209
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:19,359
and

2210
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:24,960
i guess the cell i that we're passing in

2211
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:27,118
is relative

2212
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:30,399
which is fine it's relative to the mid

2213
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:30,399
quarter which is what you'd expect

2214
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:36,639
the corner code

2215
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,800
that we read out

2216
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:40,639
is going to tell us like whether we've

2217
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:43,600
checked it or not

2218
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:45,920
so if the corner code is zero we're

2219
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,360
gonna have to do work if it's not we're

2220
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,399
just gonna use

2221
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:51,599
that

2222
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:51,599
uh piece of information

2223
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:55,039
that's already stored in the corner

2224
01:42:55,600 --> 01:43:00,639
so we look in there and we say okay if

2225
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:04,159
it's zero then we do this test we say

2226
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:06,000
result cell min plus you know

2227
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:07,920
the

2228
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:12,479
i guess you know we should also check to

2229
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:12,480
see uh now that i think about it do we

2230
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,000
we clear this

2231
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:20,239
uh properly and all that yeah we we

2232
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,639
cleared the voxel stack

2233
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:22,638
here

2234
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:26,879
um looks fine

2235
01:43:28,479 --> 01:43:32,718
so i don't see a problem there

2236
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:35,199
so you know we go in here and we say all

2237
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:36,399
right like grab out

2238
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:37,599
the

2239
01:43:36,399 --> 01:43:39,198
cell

2240
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,000
plus the

2241
01:43:39,198 --> 01:43:41,599
uh

2242
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,840
corner whichever corner of the cell

2243
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,679
we're on right this offsets to the

2244
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:47,600
correct corner

2245
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:49,920
uh and then we then just say like do we

2246
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:52,960
collide there and if we do

2247
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:56,399
uh then set the corner code

2248
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:57,198
uh to two for collision one

2249
01:43:56,399 --> 01:43:59,439
uh

2250
01:43:57,198 --> 01:43:59,439
for

2251
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:04,440
for not right

2252
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:12,559
i mean it's really pretty

2253
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:14,718
straightforward

2254
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,760
at the end we read the uh corner code

2255
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:16,560
out

2256
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,679
so

2257
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:20,480
you know either we updated that code

2258
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,158
here

2259
01:44:20,479 --> 01:44:23,839
or we

2260
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:27,118
are just going to read it from

2261
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:30,319
the array unupdated

2262
01:44:27,118 --> 01:44:34,079
use it use it unupdated

2263
01:44:30,319 --> 01:44:36,559
we get that corner code out

2264
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:36,559
and

2265
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:42,560
yeah we said we just said it that's it

2266
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,920
um

2267
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:00,479
so that's pretty peculiar

2268
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:04,639
i don't know what's causing the

2269
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:04,638
those embed values to come back

2270
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:08,719
the way that they are

2271
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,679
um

2272
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:14,560
those are very odd things to have been

2273
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:17,199
triggered as a hit

2274
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:19,360
um i suppose one thing we could do is

2275
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:21,039
verify that it's not some kind of a

2276
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:23,359
reuse problem

2277
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:24,880
uh so we could do something like this

2278
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:26,960
and say all right

2279
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:29,039
make sure everyone recomputes everything

2280
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:32,239
every time

2281
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:36,000
uh and then tell me you know

2282
01:45:32,238 --> 01:45:38,158
uh are we still having this problem

2283
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:41,840
and you know

2284
01:45:38,158 --> 01:45:43,839
we don't know but we'll try and find out

2285
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,600
um

2286
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,840
because then it's like well maybe the

2287
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:50,320
problem is that the code that does the

2288
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,000
caching is like wrong

2289
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:54,799
so it doesn't look like it because then

2290
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,679
it just it just hit that case again

2291
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,360
so

2292
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:58,480
it doesn't doesn't seem like that's

2293
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:00,079
plausible

2294
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:02,799
right that doesn't seem

2295
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:04,639
that doesn't seem like the case

2296
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:07,520
but i just wanted to check

2297
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:07,520
because you know

2298
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:12,238
so

2299
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:13,759
uh what are the possible options here

2300
01:46:12,238 --> 01:46:16,158
look one possible option is we're

2301
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:18,239
testing in the wrong place

2302
01:46:16,158 --> 01:46:20,158
like when we do our collides at p the

2303
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:23,599
test p values that we're using are not

2304
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:23,599
at actually the correct ones

2305
01:46:24,319 --> 01:46:31,359
i don't know how plausible that is

2306
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:33,840
because it seems very

2307
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:35,279
coherent in all the other parts when

2308
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:37,279
we're looking at them

2309
01:46:35,279 --> 01:46:39,198
so why would it suddenly just be wrong

2310
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:40,559
in just this one case there's not really

2311
01:46:39,198 --> 01:46:42,079
a lot going into this particular

2312
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,920
equation so it doesn't seem like it's

2313
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:46,158
that likely that the bug would be hiding

2314
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:46,158
there

2315
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:49,198
um

2316
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:51,679
it's possible that the collides at p

2317
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:53,359
code is just buggy

2318
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:54,800
certainly and it's just producing

2319
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:56,960
spurious collisions that don't actually

2320
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:57,840
exist however

2321
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:00,480
um

2322
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:02,800
we don't actually see like what is it

2323
01:47:00,479 --> 01:47:07,039
even colliding with so what we might

2324
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:07,039
want to do now is like turn back on

2325
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:12,880
this part of the diagram code to see

2326
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:14,799
what you know

2327
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:16,400
can is there some

2328
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,560
explanation

2329
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:19,920
for like who the heck this thing is even

2330
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,800
colliding with

2331
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,399
right

2332
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:25,920
um so there's a broken case right

2333
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:28,079
and

2334
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,960
where we we somehow got placed into

2335
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:31,118
there

2336
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:32,560
and yeah i mean you know maybe now is

2337
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:34,319
the time that we just add the single

2338
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:36,480
stepping because you know this is just a

2339
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:38,158
giant jumble i can't see

2340
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:40,319
but if i could step through it i would

2341
01:47:38,158 --> 01:47:43,599
be able to see like why it thinks

2342
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:45,599
there's like colliders like up here when

2343
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:46,639
there's no reason why there would be

2344
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,320
right

2345
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:50,880
um it doesn't make sense why there would

2346
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:52,719
be colliders here when

2347
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,840
it's clearly going to be high enough off

2348
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:56,639
the ground at that point that it

2349
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:58,880
shouldn't ever collide

2350
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:58,880
um

2351
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:05,520
i suppose there is

2352
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:07,760
one question which is

2353
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,760
uh

2354
01:48:08,479 --> 01:48:12,000
well we test entities to make sure they

2355
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:14,000
don't collide against themselves so it

2356
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,000
can't be something like that

2357
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
um

2358
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,359
right so there's not going to be

2359
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,880
anything weird there

2360
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:24,399
but it seems like yeah like the single

2361
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,800
stepping is probably what we need to do

2362
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:30,158
so i guess next week what we should do

2363
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:30,159
is add the single stepping

2364
01:48:31,118 --> 01:48:33,839
um

2365
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:44,079
add the single stepping

2366
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:46,479
debug why we're getting those

2367
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:47,920
incorrect collider points is basically

2368
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:50,718
how i would classify them like they're

2369
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:52,399
not actually correct

2370
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:54,560
um they're points where you don't

2371
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:56,238
actually collide but it says you do

2372
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:59,840
you know

2373
01:48:56,238 --> 01:49:00,879
so fix the incorrect collider point

2374
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:05,360
then

2375
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:05,359
we move to doing embedding

2376
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:09,119
and then we should be good

2377
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:11,359
uh

2378
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:12,960
but i don't want to turn the embedding

2379
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:16,479
on

2380
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,920
until i know why it's doing those

2381
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:20,959
because the embedding will just quote

2382
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:22,800
unquote fix this problem it will

2383
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:25,039
allow it to get back out of these

2384
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:27,279
situations where it thinks colliding but

2385
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:29,279
before we do that we

2386
01:49:27,279 --> 01:49:30,880
it would be really irresponsible for us

2387
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:32,880
to not find out why it's getting into

2388
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,239
that state in places where it really

2389
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:36,400
doesn't seem like it should because

2390
01:49:34,238 --> 01:49:38,079
that's probably just a bug and that bug

2391
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:39,359
could lurk there for a while and cause a

2392
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:41,599
lot of problems

2393
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:43,198
so i think we want to do that first

2394
01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:48,360
that's the plan

2395
01:49:43,198 --> 01:49:48,359
uh okay now let's go do q a

2396
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:13,559
if anyone's got any questions if nobody

2397
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:13,559
has any questions then then we're done

2398
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:36,319
ah okay so george who's who's the author

2399
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:38,960
of remedy bg hello george

2400
01:50:36,319 --> 01:50:40,880
uh he says that the reason that the move

2401
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:44,000
entity thing won't set a breakpoint is

2402
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:45,679
because if you load multiple dlls that

2403
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,079
have the same function name in them it

2404
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:50,399
won't set the breakpoint on all of them

2405
01:50:48,079 --> 01:50:52,479
okay

2406
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:54,879
uh yeah that's intentional in handmade

2407
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:56,959
hero uh because it just helps if you

2408
01:50:54,880 --> 01:51:00,800
want to do things like have a constant

2409
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:03,198
string in your code or things like that

2410
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:05,679
um originally in the handmade hero hot

2411
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:07,198
code reloading we didn't we unloaded the

2412
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:08,719
old library and that meant you could

2413
01:51:07,198 --> 01:51:10,960
never do things like have a constant

2414
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:13,439
string somewhere

2415
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:15,279
um and we just decided eventually that

2416
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:17,759
it was better to just leave the old code

2417
01:51:15,279 --> 01:51:19,679
loaded since hey memory is cheap on a

2418
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,440
dev machine just leave the old code

2419
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:23,039
loaded and that way things that point to

2420
01:51:21,439 --> 01:51:25,359
old strings can just keep pointing to

2421
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:27,599
old strings and it won't just like crash

2422
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:27,598
right

2423
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:44,759
any other comments

2424
01:51:41,118 --> 01:51:44,759
questions or concerns

2425
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,520
i suppose in general like

2426
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,440
how does that work with overloaded

2427
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:01,440
functions

2428
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:03,198
or george

2429
01:52:01,439 --> 01:52:04,479
like if you have an overloaded function

2430
01:52:03,198 --> 01:52:06,000
like three different functions called

2431
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:07,919
move entity and you set a breakpoint

2432
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,920
like wouldn't that already have to loop

2433
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:12,480
over all of them to set the breakpoint

2434
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:14,158
or does that also not work currently

2435
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:17,839
because in that case fixing that would

2436
01:52:14,158 --> 01:52:17,839
fix actually both problems

2437
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:21,920
but i guess they're slightly different

2438
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,080
because the overloaded functions will

2439
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:28,679
have different actual link names

2440
01:52:24,079 --> 01:52:28,679
so maybe that's a different path but

2441
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:34,479
gotcha yeah and that kind of makes sense

2442
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,840
because the overloaded function will

2443
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:37,598
have different link names so you had to

2444
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,039
have more code than that like it's

2445
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:40,560
actually it's actually a harder problem

2446
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:41,920
i suppose the overloaded functions the

2447
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:43,440
multiple modules is probably actually

2448
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,719
easier you just have to have a loop over

2449
01:52:43,439 --> 01:52:46,638
the modules whereas the overloaded

2450
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:48,639
functions you have to like

2451
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:50,159
look at some table to see like all the

2452
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:51,840
things that had this name that got

2453
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:54,559
mapped to something which i assume is

2454
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:57,560
like a debug lookup basically

2455
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:57,560
but

2456
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:11,559
yeah the whole the the argument hash

2457
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:11,559
nonsense yeah

2458
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:16,639
all right well it seems like we don't

2459
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:19,039
really have any questions so that's good

2460
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:21,599
so uh i guess i will wrap it up i think

2461
01:53:19,039 --> 01:53:23,279
we know what we're doing pretty clearly

2462
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:24,880
um

2463
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:26,479
so next weekend we're just gonna have to

2464
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,840
single step

2465
01:53:26,479 --> 01:53:29,279
and figure out how the collision

2466
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:32,239
detector is reporting those problems

2467
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:34,000
that's obviously uh wrong

2468
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:34,959
and i don't think if with we just

2469
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
improved the debugging tools a little

2470
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,520
bit i don't really have to be that hard

2471
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,118
to find the reason that we're not

2472
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:40,480
finding it right now is because we can't

2473
01:53:39,118 --> 01:53:42,719
see it right

2474
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:45,039
we can't see what's going on

2475
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:46,560
um and so if we can see it i think we

2476
01:53:45,039 --> 01:53:48,560
won't have that much trouble figuring

2477
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,520
out what it is but until we can actually

2478
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,960
see it

2479
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:51,679
we're just kind of flying blind in there

2480
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,560
and

2481
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:54,239
you know

2482
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:55,119
randomly guessing about where the code

2483
01:53:54,238 --> 01:53:57,678
is

2484
01:53:55,118 --> 01:54:00,399
going wrong

2485
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:01,679
uh all right so that's it for today uh

2486
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:04,158
as i said at the beginning for those of

2487
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:05,520
you who came in late uh our kickstarter

2488
01:54:04,158 --> 01:54:08,238
for the second book of our graphic

2489
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:09,520
novels up so please check that out when

2490
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:12,718
you get a chance

2491
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:15,040
especially for someone who read book one

2492
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:15,039
um

2493
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:20,238
oh no

2494
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:24,319
subscriber only chat is on still crap

2495
01:54:20,238 --> 01:54:24,769
twitch makes this so hard unfortunately

2496
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:27,118
um

2497
01:54:24,770 --> 01:54:28,480
[Music]

2498
01:54:27,118 --> 01:54:30,799
yeah

2499
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:31,919
unfortunately twitch makes that a global

2500
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:33,279
setting

2501
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:37,399
instead

2502
01:54:33,279 --> 01:54:37,399
uh of a

2503
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:42,238
hold on a second

2504
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:45,040
we can fix this

2505
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:47,279
we can fix this uh twitch for some

2506
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:50,079
reason the way twitch works and this

2507
01:54:47,279 --> 01:54:52,479
makes no sense at all to me even a

2508
01:54:50,079 --> 01:54:52,479
little bit

2509
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:59,359
the setting as to whether subscribers or

2510
01:54:56,599 --> 01:55:02,639
non-subscribers can watch the stream so

2511
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:06,559
the ability to to watch the stream

2512
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:09,199
that is set in the stream settings

2513
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:11,360
the ability for people to

2514
01:55:09,198 --> 01:55:14,000
chat on the stream

2515
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:17,039
is set in the channel settings

2516
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:19,679
so it's like a global not per stream

2517
01:55:17,039 --> 01:55:21,198
now this makes like no sense because

2518
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:23,599
presumably

2519
01:55:21,198 --> 01:55:25,839
to the extent that you want to set

2520
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:28,560
either of those you would want to set

2521
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:30,400
both of those in the same place usually

2522
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,880
because like if you're doing like a

2523
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:35,039
subscribers only stream and you set it

2524
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:37,199
to only be viewed by subscribers you

2525
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:38,880
would probably also want to set the chat

2526
01:55:37,198 --> 01:55:40,319
to only be subscribers because it

2527
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,719
doesn't make a lot of sense to allow

2528
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:44,158
people to not watch the stream but to

2529
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:47,840
chat on the stream

2530
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:48,879
it doesn't really make any sense right

2531
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,840
um

2532
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:50,880
but

2533
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,199
uh

2534
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:54,000
that's just not how they do it

2535
01:55:53,198 --> 01:55:55,439
so

2536
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,198
i don't know

2537
01:55:55,439 --> 01:55:58,799
why that's the case

2538
01:55:57,198 --> 01:56:02,079
that's just the case

2539
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:03,599
so let me see if i can set the channel

2540
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:04,880
settings

2541
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:06,560
back

2542
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:07,520
so because i think i did that one time

2543
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,719
because i was like god it's really

2544
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,760
annoying that people can't watch the

2545
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:11,760
stream but they can chat in stream it

2546
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:13,520
doesn't make any sense this should be

2547
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:17,400
unified and i did it and i forgot i

2548
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:17,400
forgot to switch it back

2549
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:30,399
all right

2550
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:31,840
um

2551
01:56:30,399 --> 01:56:34,158
so

2552
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:37,560
hey

2553
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:37,559
did that work

2554
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:49,919
non-subscribers presumably are now able

2555
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:52,238
to chat

2556
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,800
in theory

2557
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:56,799
um according to

2558
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:59,039
the world of twitch

2559
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:01,760
so let's try this again

2560
01:56:59,039 --> 01:57:04,479
now does anyone have any questions who

2561
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:05,520
couldn't post them before because

2562
01:57:04,479 --> 01:57:10,158
the

2563
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:11,520
stream was erroneously set

2564
01:57:10,158 --> 01:57:14,399
to

2565
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,400
subscribers only

2566
01:57:16,238 --> 01:57:19,198
as far as this has been asked a thousand

2567
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,679
times with any news on circle galaxy

2568
01:57:19,198 --> 01:57:25,039
well yeah there was

2569
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:26,800
and it got sent out so yeah i ranted

2570
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:28,960
about this

2571
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:30,480
at the beginning of the stream so as you

2572
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:32,000
may or may not know if you go to

2573
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:34,079
starcoregalaxy.com

2574
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,960
there's a you can sign up for the molly

2575
01:57:34,079 --> 01:57:39,840
rocket mailing list here

2576
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,840
right

2577
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:43,279
uh

2578
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:45,360
we tried to send one out

2579
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:48,238
and it has information about what we're

2580
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:50,158
doing and like the steps that are going

2581
01:57:48,238 --> 01:57:51,279
to be happening to get started galaxy

2582
01:57:50,158 --> 01:57:52,559
out

2583
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:56,158
and

2584
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:57,920
it got sent to spam folder by everything

2585
01:57:56,158 --> 01:57:59,359
so all the people who

2586
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:00,480
put their

2587
01:57:59,359 --> 01:58:01,519
email address in here because they

2588
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:03,118
wanted to find out what's happening star

2589
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:05,199
galaxy i did send out something that

2590
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:06,880
says what's happening with starco galaxy

2591
01:58:05,198 --> 01:58:09,198
and nobody got it because google and

2592
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:11,520
microsoft can't program they literally

2593
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:13,039
do not understand how programming works

2594
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:15,280
or what it does

2595
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:15,279
right

2596
01:58:17,039 --> 01:58:20,479
uh so

2597
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:22,319
so probably like 20

2598
01:58:20,479 --> 01:58:24,799
of the 9 000 people who are signed up

2599
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:26,319
for our mailing list got it

2600
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:28,239
and the other 80

2601
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:30,079
it's either in your spam folder or if

2602
01:58:28,238 --> 01:58:31,919
it's microsoft you just didn't get it at

2603
01:58:30,079 --> 01:58:33,599
all they just outright rejected it

2604
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:35,118
completely if you look at the record

2605
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:38,000
they were like no that's definitely spam

2606
01:58:35,118 --> 01:58:38,000
we're not accepting it

2607
01:58:40,399 --> 01:58:43,399
so

2608
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:08,719
um

2609
01:59:07,198 --> 01:59:10,638
starco galaxy doesn't have a subscriber

2610
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:12,639
limit it's if you put your if you put

2611
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:14,960
your email address in here you will get

2612
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:17,920
the we only send out a mail every once

2613
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:19,599
in a while apparently

2614
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:21,599
yeah if you have hotmail or outlook they

2615
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:23,360
just refuse our mailing list entirely

2616
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:26,079
they refuse to accept it

2617
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:28,719
they hard bounced it they said no

2618
01:59:26,079 --> 01:59:31,039
so 394 people i think it was it wasn't

2619
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:33,760
very many because most people who

2620
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:36,639
subscribed to the mailing list aren't

2621
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:38,639
on hotmail or uh whatever but they just

2622
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:41,359
microsoft just flat out

2623
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:45,279
denied delivery

2624
01:59:41,359 --> 01:59:47,839
i can't really tell you just how angry i

2625
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:50,158
am with microsoft and their level of

2626
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:52,400
absolute garbage programming it's so

2627
01:59:50,158 --> 01:59:54,079
ridiculous like

2628
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:55,839
they have no right to be a software

2629
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:58,319
company at all

2630
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:01,599
like if you can't accept a mailing list

2631
01:59:58,319 --> 02:00:03,198
mail to an email address in 2021 you are

2632
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:06,400
just a failure

2633
02:00:03,198 --> 02:00:07,198
as a team and you should stop

2634
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:09,279
right

2635
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:11,118
don't ship an email service if you

2636
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:13,840
aren't capable of shipping an email

2637
02:00:11,118 --> 02:00:15,839
service

2638
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:19,119
so here's what i'll say

2639
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:23,279
we will try to send out this email again

2640
02:00:19,118 --> 02:00:24,880
we are going to do a few things

2641
02:00:23,279 --> 02:00:28,319
one of the things is we're going to

2642
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:30,719
switch to a different provider email

2643
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:32,639
backend provider we use it you can't

2644
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:33,920
send emails yourself because if you send

2645
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:35,039
emails yourself they'll definitely

2646
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:37,118
bounce

2647
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:39,279
so the only way you have any chance of

2648
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:40,719
sending an email to a mailing list is

2649
02:00:39,279 --> 02:00:41,920
you have to go through a back-end

2650
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:43,599
provider

2651
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:45,199
in 2021

2652
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:48,159
this is a real thing that happens in the

2653
02:00:45,198 --> 02:00:50,319
real world because microsoft and google

2654
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:53,439
literally do not know how to program

2655
02:00:50,319 --> 02:00:55,279
and their mail spam teams are staffed

2656
02:00:53,439 --> 02:00:56,399
entirely with people who have no idea

2657
02:00:55,279 --> 02:00:58,479
what they're doing

2658
02:00:56,399 --> 02:01:01,039
like even a little bit right

2659
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:01,039
it's a joke

2660
02:01:01,198 --> 02:01:05,678
so uh

2661
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:09,639
we're using spark post we'll probably

2662
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:09,639
try to

2663
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:16,400
switch to a different provider

2664
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:18,480
and we'll try sending out another update

2665
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:21,519
we don't know if it'll work

2666
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:24,158
but we'll try we'll see if

2667
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:25,520
it goes to spam less often

2668
02:01:24,158 --> 02:01:27,759
uh you're probably never gonna get it

2669
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:29,679
down to zero right

2670
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:31,199
but if we could get it down to like only

2671
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:33,440
ten percent of the people are having go

2672
02:01:31,198 --> 02:01:35,359
to spam or whatever then maybe that

2673
02:01:33,439 --> 02:01:37,839
would work

2674
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:37,839
um

2675
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:48,319
does live looping still work i think

2676
02:01:46,238 --> 02:01:51,359
there's probably i think there's a

2677
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:53,439
little bit of an issue with it um

2678
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:55,519
i'm not sure

2679
02:01:53,439 --> 02:01:57,118
because we don't use it very often and i

2680
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:00,960
think there may have been a problem with

2681
02:01:57,118 --> 02:02:01,920
one of the things in it uh here's l

2682
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:04,319
yeah

2683
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:06,079
so we've got some kind of an issue with

2684
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:07,439
the way that it is

2685
02:02:06,079 --> 02:02:10,639
uh

2686
02:02:07,439 --> 02:02:14,079
re re loading the blocks there

2687
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:16,480
so we we busted something

2688
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:18,238
it was working fairly recently but

2689
02:02:16,479 --> 02:02:19,598
yeah the some of the architecture stuff

2690
02:02:18,238 --> 02:02:21,919
in handmade heroes is really pretty

2691
02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:22,800
janky at this point and it's unfortunate

2692
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,239
um

2693
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:27,039
it's mostly just that's what happens

2694
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:28,799
when you program one you know hour at a

2695
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:31,519
time it doesn't really

2696
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:33,119
work that well um so we should probably

2697
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:34,239
fix it uh

2698
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:36,000
at some point but it's not a

2699
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:38,000
particularly high priority at the moment

2700
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,359
because i can't even think of look even

2701
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,039
if we had that it wouldn't really help

2702
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:43,279
with our debuggings for the collision

2703
02:02:41,039 --> 02:02:46,599
sector we need something better

2704
02:02:43,279 --> 02:02:46,599
uh so

2705
02:02:56,079 --> 02:03:00,800
no it's like horrible i need to post

2706
02:02:58,319 --> 02:03:02,479
like a very violent rant about this

2707
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:04,639
because

2708
02:03:02,479 --> 02:03:07,839
these people have no business calling

2709
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:09,520
their services email gmail and hotmail

2710
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,960
are not email

2711
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:14,159
what they are

2712
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:16,719
is a sort of pseudo email service that

2713
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:18,879
sometimes gives you something right

2714
02:03:16,719 --> 02:03:21,118
email is when someone sends you an email

2715
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:22,400
from an email account you get the email

2716
02:03:21,118 --> 02:03:23,759
that's email

2717
02:03:22,399 --> 02:03:26,559
right

2718
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:28,400
if you only get that email fifty percent

2719
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:30,400
of the time you're not running an email

2720
02:03:28,399 --> 02:03:34,238
service you're running a joke you should

2721
02:03:30,399 --> 02:03:35,039
call it like you know microsoft not mail

2722
02:03:34,238 --> 02:03:37,759
right

2723
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:40,800
and maybe like gmail could be renamed

2724
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:44,719
like g-e-e-mail like gee mail that would

2725
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:46,400
be nice to get too bad i don't right

2726
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:49,039
um

2727
02:03:46,399 --> 02:03:50,078
it's unacceptable this is a trivial

2728
02:03:49,039 --> 02:03:52,719
problem

2729
02:03:50,078 --> 02:03:54,399
and they turn it into a hard problem by

2730
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:57,279
refusing to accept

2731
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:59,359
the obvious thing which is that you just

2732
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:01,599
need to put the ability to sign up to

2733
02:03:59,359 --> 02:04:03,839
for email addresses into the freaking

2734
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:06,239
program

2735
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:07,279
just make it so that signing up for an

2736
02:04:06,238 --> 02:04:09,598
email

2737
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:13,198
list is something you do

2738
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:13,199
on the on the client side

2739
02:04:18,078 --> 02:04:22,039
it's so freaking simple

2740
02:04:25,359 --> 02:04:28,960
this is just it's a joke these people

2741
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:30,960
have no business running an email

2742
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:32,560
service

2743
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:34,880
they have no business running an email

2744
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:34,880
service

2745
02:04:36,319 --> 02:04:40,078
there should have been a thing in the

2746
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:41,920
spec that basically says

2747
02:04:40,078 --> 02:04:44,399
that you're not allowed to call

2748
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:47,279
something in email service if it doesn't

2749
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:48,719
receive email right like there should

2750
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:51,359
have been a thing that makes what

2751
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:52,399
they're doing not actually comply with

2752
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:53,839
email

2753
02:04:52,399 --> 02:04:54,799
right

2754
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:57,440
so

2755
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:59,599
you know there there we we kind of

2756
02:04:57,439 --> 02:05:01,919
screwed up because we stopped speccing

2757
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:03,520
email before we should have like we

2758
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:04,880
should have specced it

2759
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:06,960
differently

2760
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:09,359
and we should have said like okay here's

2761
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:12,920
how you do guaranteed delivery right and

2762
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:12,920
that sort of thing

2763
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:27,039
uh so internationalizationist the reason

2764
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:28,880
that i don't think it really helps i

2765
02:05:27,039 --> 02:05:30,800
mean it might help a little bit but the

2766
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:33,440
reason i don't think it helps is because

2767
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:35,360
we need to step through what happens

2768
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:37,598
on a particular frame

2769
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:39,759
right

2770
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:42,560
so replaying the bug just doesn't help

2771
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:44,400
me i need the diagram system to actually

2772
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,880
step me through the steps on a

2773
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:49,679
particular frame so once you have to add

2774
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:51,760
that you're going to you then you have

2775
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:52,569
it right so

2776
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,920
recording

2777
02:05:52,569 --> 02:05:56,719
[Music]

2778
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:59,279
you know it can maybe help a tiny bit

2779
02:05:56,719 --> 02:06:00,560
to like isolate a rarely occurring

2780
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:02,719
collision bug

2781
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:04,320
um but it's really not going to get us

2782
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:05,840
all the way which is why i'm just not

2783
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:07,359
that like it's like i could go fix it

2784
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:08,560
but it's kind of just waste of time at

2785
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:11,679
this point i'd rather do it sometime

2786
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:11,679
that's going to be more important

2787
02:06:13,039 --> 02:06:17,599
we don't send out confirmation emails on

2788
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:19,118
subscribe

2789
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:22,520
no we only send them out when we

2790
02:06:19,118 --> 02:06:22,519
actually mail

2791
02:06:41,198 --> 02:06:45,439
do we expect to finish in 2022 i don't

2792
02:06:43,198 --> 02:06:46,879
know we we only do such a small amount

2793
02:06:45,439 --> 02:06:48,638
of programming every week on handmade

2794
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:50,078
hero just because i'm way too busy to

2795
02:06:48,639 --> 02:06:51,920
really devote more time to it that i

2796
02:06:50,078 --> 02:06:55,198
don't know that we would finish in 2022

2797
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:58,158
because that's it's literally 50 hours

2798
02:06:55,198 --> 02:07:00,158
that will happen in 2022 right which is

2799
02:06:58,158 --> 02:07:01,439
not very much programming time or i

2800
02:07:00,158 --> 02:07:03,920
guess maybe 100 hours i don't know

2801
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:08,839
something like that just not very much

2802
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:08,840
so i know maybe but i doubt it

2803
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:19,039
so clay freeman there's no advice you

2804
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:21,198
can really give because we're not

2805
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:23,599
actually getting flag to spam

2806
02:07:21,198 --> 02:07:26,399
the decision gets made before they ever

2807
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:28,880
even really look at the email right it's

2808
02:07:26,399 --> 02:07:31,039
a it's effectively a 10 out of 10 spam

2809
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:32,400
check filter email like there's nothing

2810
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:35,198
in it

2811
02:07:32,399 --> 02:07:38,000
that's suspicious right

2812
02:07:35,198 --> 02:07:39,598
um it passes like spam assassin or any

2813
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,479
of those things so it's not like any of

2814
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:44,480
that they just decided that we're spam

2815
02:07:42,479 --> 02:07:46,000
because like maybe the spark post ip

2816
02:07:44,479 --> 02:07:47,919
address we come from is maybe spammy or

2817
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,520
maybe it's because we don't send out

2818
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:50,560
enough emails

2819
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:53,199
right

2820
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:55,440
when we were sending one a week

2821
02:07:53,198 --> 02:07:57,359
um

2822
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:59,118
you know we

2823
02:07:57,359 --> 02:08:03,238
maybe that was just warm so they would

2824
02:07:59,118 --> 02:08:03,238
be like oh okay right

2825
02:08:12,719 --> 02:08:17,118
wouldn't double opt-in through

2826
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:18,800
confirmation help uh yes so originally

2827
02:08:17,118 --> 02:08:20,880
we didn't do that because it's just more

2828
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:22,639
work for the person trying to subscribe

2829
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:24,239
because it's like either they wanted to

2830
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:26,319
subscribe in which case they can just

2831
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:27,839
get it when it comes out or they didn't

2832
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:29,359
want to subscribe and they're going to

2833
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:30,960
get one piece of email they didn't want

2834
02:08:29,359 --> 02:08:33,039
either way either the mailing list or

2835
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:34,078
the confirmation mail right and both

2836
02:08:33,039 --> 02:08:35,840
they'll have to take the same action

2837
02:08:34,078 --> 02:08:38,078
which is to click the unsubscribe link

2838
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:38,078
right

2839
02:08:38,639 --> 02:08:41,760
um

2840
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:43,599
but like yeah the double confirmation

2841
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:45,679
would be good

2842
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:47,440
uh because we could put a thing up that

2843
02:08:45,679 --> 02:08:48,800
says like all right we're gonna send you

2844
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:50,638
an email

2845
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:52,480
you need to like if you actually want to

2846
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:54,960
get this you're going to have to go mark

2847
02:08:52,479 --> 02:08:55,919
it as okay right

2848
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:57,198
um

2849
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:59,679
and so

2850
02:08:57,198 --> 02:08:59,678
like

2851
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,840
you know

2852
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:12,639
you should make a dmarc record so i'm

2853
02:09:09,198 --> 02:09:14,319
curious to know like what is the dmarc

2854
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:15,520
record that we should have i don't

2855
02:09:14,319 --> 02:09:17,118
really understand this stuff because i

2856
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:18,560
think it's absolutely ridiculous like

2857
02:09:17,118 --> 02:09:19,839
i'll be completely honest i do not

2858
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:22,719
understand

2859
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:26,159
um why most of this stuff exists because

2860
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:27,039
it all seems like total non-solutions

2861
02:09:26,158 --> 02:09:29,279
uh

2862
02:09:27,039 --> 02:09:31,840
to the problem like they're all just

2863
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:33,359
complete like none of this stuff should

2864
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:35,360
even exist

2865
02:09:33,359 --> 02:09:37,598
it's ridiculous because this is not a

2866
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:39,920
hard problem but the people who work on

2867
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:42,319
it are so incompetent that it remains a

2868
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:43,279
hard problem for no reason

2869
02:09:42,319 --> 02:09:46,000
right

2870
02:09:43,279 --> 02:09:48,000
just fix they've added like 20 things to

2871
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,158
the delivery stuff and none of them

2872
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:53,760
fixed the problem just change it so that

2873
02:09:50,158 --> 02:09:54,719
you just change it to be a pull system

2874
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:58,400
right

2875
02:09:54,719 --> 02:10:00,880
it's not that hard um

2876
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:03,920
but anyway uh yes i can put a i can put

2877
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:06,239
a dmarc record in there uh at the moment

2878
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:06,239
um

2879
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:12,880
i think ours is not

2880
02:10:11,279 --> 02:10:15,519
good like it's not

2881
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:18,000
uh

2882
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:18,000
where's the

2883
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:24,599
where's the actual dns this is not

2884
02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:24,599
useful

2885
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:33,920
wanted like the whole thing there we go

2886
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:33,920
well that's fine

2887
02:10:35,359 --> 02:10:38,639
uh so currently that's what it said

2888
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:39,760
uh

2889
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:41,679
and

2890
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:43,440
you know like i guess one question i

2891
02:10:41,679 --> 02:10:44,880
have

2892
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:47,439
uh is

2893
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:50,319
the v equals d mark one p equals reject

2894
02:10:47,439 --> 02:10:52,238
s p equals reject add chem equals s aspf

2895
02:10:50,319 --> 02:10:54,960
equals s part

2896
02:10:52,238 --> 02:10:56,638
so what i don't know is

2897
02:10:54,960 --> 02:11:00,800
how do you actually get that to work

2898
02:10:56,639 --> 02:11:00,800
when your mail is sent by a third party

2899
02:11:03,198 --> 02:11:07,198
like because we have to use spark post

2900
02:11:05,279 --> 02:11:08,639
i'd send the mail ourselves but that

2901
02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:10,479
would be even more likely to bounce as

2902
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:12,159
far as i know

2903
02:11:10,479 --> 02:11:13,839
maybe that's not true like maybe i

2904
02:11:12,158 --> 02:11:16,000
should be sending the mail myself but i

2905
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:19,960
kind of thought that the idea was you

2906
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,960
had to use a third party

2907
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:28,559
it's spark post

2908
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:30,800
so

2909
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:32,800
i mean they support

2910
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:34,000
you can even get your own ip address

2911
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:36,239
right with them

2912
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,238
like

2913
02:11:36,399 --> 02:11:40,078
uh

2914
02:11:37,198 --> 02:11:42,399
so you know but i don't know

2915
02:11:40,078 --> 02:11:44,479
like because this stuff is not something

2916
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:46,158
that i even ever wanted to know i just

2917
02:11:44,479 --> 02:11:47,598
want to send a freaking email to a

2918
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:48,719
customer

2919
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:51,199
um

2920
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:53,520
so i'm not sure

2921
02:11:51,198 --> 02:11:57,198
what i have to set in here that would

2922
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:58,880
allow spark posts to do it properly

2923
02:11:57,198 --> 02:12:02,158
i don't i don't know maybe they have a

2924
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:02,159
page that talks about it

2925
02:12:03,359 --> 02:12:07,039
the problem was

2926
02:12:05,118 --> 02:12:08,559
dmarc got added after we started our

2927
02:12:07,039 --> 02:12:10,399
mailing list so that's the reason why it

2928
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:12,400
was never set up as well

2929
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:14,238
um otherwise i would have went and read

2930
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:16,559
about it at the time but of course the

2931
02:12:14,238 --> 02:12:18,879
ad things that make it

2932
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:20,960
i just i can't rant enough at how bad

2933
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:24,078
gmail and

2934
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:27,078
and hotmail are it's just absurd

2935
02:12:24,078 --> 02:12:27,078
um

2936
02:12:41,599 --> 02:12:47,319
so let's take a look

2937
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:47,319
do they have anything

2938
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:59,440
like yeah i know i i'm just

2939
02:12:56,639 --> 02:13:03,000
can you tell me

2940
02:12:59,439 --> 02:13:03,000
what you do

2941
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:20,078
so that's not very helpful because it

2942
02:13:18,639 --> 02:13:21,679
doesn't really say

2943
02:13:20,078 --> 02:13:24,719
much about what kind of support they

2944
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:24,719
have but

2945
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:28,239
but i can check

2946
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:29,118
i don't know that we care because i

2947
02:13:28,238 --> 02:13:30,638
don't know that we're going to keep

2948
02:13:29,118 --> 02:13:33,519
using spark post

2949
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:35,039
like for starters if they were a good

2950
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:38,000
service they would have warned us about

2951
02:13:35,039 --> 02:13:39,039
things like this earlier right

2952
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,158
um

2953
02:13:39,039 --> 02:13:41,519
and

2954
02:13:40,158 --> 02:13:42,799
you know the fact that we're just not

2955
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:44,800
getting good delivery with them and they

2956
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:46,400
didn't even like try to contact us and

2957
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:48,079
tell us to change something or anything

2958
02:13:46,399 --> 02:13:49,519
just kind of suggests to me that like

2959
02:13:48,078 --> 02:13:52,880
maybe we need to go with somebody who's

2960
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:55,520
a little bit more proactive right

2961
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:58,319
and we had some people uh contact me on

2962
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:59,599
twitter when i was posting about this

2963
02:13:58,319 --> 02:14:01,118
and

2964
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:02,880
so we're talking to some other companies

2965
02:14:01,118 --> 02:14:04,399
now to see if there's somebody who'd be

2966
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:06,000
willing to like step in and actually

2967
02:14:04,399 --> 02:14:07,679
help us actually get this email

2968
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,359
delivered properly

2969
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:10,880
uh and if that's the case then we would

2970
02:14:09,359 --> 02:14:13,679
just switch away

2971
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:16,719
um from

2972
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:19,039
uh from them right

2973
02:14:16,719 --> 02:14:19,039
uh

2974
02:14:19,359 --> 02:14:22,000
send grid i'm i don't know that i would

2975
02:14:21,039 --> 02:14:23,118
switch to sun grid because i think

2976
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,639
sendgrid would be basically the same as

2977
02:14:23,118 --> 02:14:26,719
spark post it would basically just be a

2978
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:28,000
giant nameless service and it'd be like

2979
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:28,800
well

2980
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,078
uh

2981
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:31,760
you know maybe your emails go through

2982
02:14:30,078 --> 02:14:34,078
maybe they don't and they don't really

2983
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:37,039
care super much right because that's

2984
02:14:34,078 --> 02:14:38,399
more or less what spark post is

2985
02:14:37,039 --> 02:14:40,399
they're basically the same kind of

2986
02:14:38,399 --> 02:14:42,799
service right

2987
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:45,359
and so uh there's some other smaller

2988
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:47,119
services like postmark app and sockets

2989
02:14:45,359 --> 02:14:49,920
lab and stuff like that

2990
02:14:47,118 --> 02:14:52,719
that are more like look we actually sit

2991
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:54,719
there and try to babysit your stuff

2992
02:14:52,719 --> 02:14:57,118
and find out like how we make sure it

2993
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:57,118
goes through

2994
02:14:58,158 --> 02:15:01,198
um

2995
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:03,359
and

2996
02:15:01,198 --> 02:15:04,078
that's more what i would be interested

2997
02:15:03,359 --> 02:15:06,799
in

2998
02:15:04,078 --> 02:15:06,799
you know what i mean

2999
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:11,039
uh clay freeman unfortunately we're we

3000
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:12,480
don't have anything prepared to send out

3001
02:15:11,039 --> 02:15:14,479
today

3002
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:15,839
if you want to just email me

3003
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:18,158
you know my email address is casey

3004
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:20,400
mollyrocket.com right so if you want to

3005
02:15:18,158 --> 02:15:22,719
email me assuming gmail doesn't put your

3006
02:15:20,399 --> 02:15:25,198
email in the spam folder if you want to

3007
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:26,880
email me i'd be happy to let you know

3008
02:15:25,198 --> 02:15:28,879
when we're going to send something out

3009
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:29,319
if you want to look at it

3010
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:30,639
um

3011
02:15:29,319 --> 02:15:35,078
[Music]

3012
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:35,078
and and we can see right but

3013
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:41,679
yeah a centroid uh

3014
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:43,520
the spark post doesn't so spark post

3015
02:15:41,679 --> 02:15:44,960
like all the stuff just lists us as

3016
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:47,440
being set up

3017
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:49,039
like because we set up spf and dkam or

3018
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:52,158
whatever the hell those other ones are

3019
02:15:49,039 --> 02:15:54,000
called um

3020
02:15:52,158 --> 02:15:55,519
those are already set up

3021
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,679
they don't have anything that says that

3022
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:58,719
our this is why i say like i didn't i

3023
02:15:57,679 --> 02:16:00,158
kind of don't really want to use them

3024
02:15:58,719 --> 02:16:02,639
anymore because it's like i didn't even

3025
02:16:00,158 --> 02:16:04,799
know about dmarc because i don't spend

3026
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:07,039
time reading about this i just expect it

3027
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:10,000
to work because it's email

3028
02:16:07,039 --> 02:16:11,359
right but somewhere between 2015 or

3029
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:14,158
whenever we started the mailing list and

3030
02:16:11,359 --> 02:16:15,118
now they added dmarc and spark plus

3031
02:16:14,158 --> 02:16:16,960
never

3032
02:16:15,118 --> 02:16:19,359
really let me know there isn't like a

3033
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:21,840
big red warning sign on the homepage

3034
02:16:19,359 --> 02:16:26,000
that says like hey

3035
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:26,000
you need to do more dmarc stuff

3036
02:16:27,039 --> 02:16:30,800
i mean they didn't even warn me i had to

3037
02:16:29,198 --> 02:16:32,959
have somebody on twitter tell me how to

3038
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:36,079
go look and find out that hotmail hard

3039
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:38,159
rejected all of our mails

3040
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:39,840
i didn't even know they're the homepage

3041
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:41,840
for spark but doesn't even say that you

3042
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:44,000
would think i put up a big red warning

3043
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:47,558
that's like all of your mail to hotmail

3044
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,558
did not go through

3045
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:53,119
but they didn't even say anything

3046
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:53,119
right

3047
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,760
um

3048
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:59,280
so it's kind of an epic disaster so i do

3049
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:01,040
think we would probably switch away from

3050
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:02,800
spark post because i really just don't

3051
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:04,319
think they're a good service

3052
02:17:02,799 --> 02:17:06,318
none of those things are things that

3053
02:17:04,318 --> 02:17:08,959
would have happened for an email service

3054
02:17:06,318 --> 02:17:10,959
that was good they would have obvious

3055
02:17:08,959 --> 02:17:12,558
ways of

3056
02:17:10,959 --> 02:17:13,358
sounding the alarm

3057
02:17:12,558 --> 02:17:15,279
when

3058
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:17,519
an entire

3059
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:19,200
when your email is rejected by an entire

3060
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:20,800
service provider you would think that

3061
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:23,439
would be a huge red flag that they would

3062
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:25,840
then like look at themselves or contact

3063
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:27,359
you about or at least put an automated

3064
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:30,478
warning on a web page they did none of

3065
02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:30,479
those things right

3066
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:36,799
so uh i'm talking to

3067
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:39,519
uh socket labs right now

3068
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:41,279
and i'm gonna talk to postmark app

3069
02:17:39,519 --> 02:17:43,840
and we'll see what we can do

3070
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:43,840
right

3071
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:50,318
no spark wasn't so sparkles doesn't know

3072
02:17:48,239 --> 02:17:52,638
that gmail put it in the spam filter so

3073
02:17:50,318 --> 02:17:54,079
that part they don't know that hotmail

3074
02:17:52,638 --> 02:17:55,598
bulk rejected it all they do know

3075
02:17:54,079 --> 02:17:58,079
because the way i figured that out was

3076
02:17:55,599 --> 02:18:00,478
on someone on twitter told me how to go

3077
02:17:58,079 --> 02:18:03,039
into the spark post control panel and

3078
02:18:00,478 --> 02:18:05,679
filter by hard bounces so i could see

3079
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:08,479
and it showed the count and it was like

3080
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:09,519
number of heart sent to hotmail

3081
02:18:08,478 --> 02:18:11,358
you know

3082
02:18:09,519 --> 02:18:12,559
some number number of howard bounces

3083
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:16,159
that number

3084
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:18,959
so so it knew it right

3085
02:18:16,159 --> 02:18:20,478
uh so they knew that hotmail flat out

3086
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:22,000
just rejected us without ever even

3087
02:18:20,478 --> 02:18:22,959
looking at the mail

3088
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,840
uh

3089
02:18:22,959 --> 02:18:27,039
per inbox right at the actual ingress it

3090
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:28,639
was just like no we're not accepting

3091
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:31,639
that

3092
02:18:28,638 --> 02:18:31,638
so

3093
02:18:48,558 --> 02:18:53,638
isn't there an ack in the out box

3094
02:18:56,718 --> 02:19:00,159
i i don't know what that means

3095
02:18:58,799 --> 02:19:01,358
there's a good chance that your ip is

3096
02:19:00,159 --> 02:19:03,200
already blacklisted on google so

3097
02:19:01,359 --> 02:19:05,519
changing provider may not help

3098
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:08,079
so it can't really be blacklisted though

3099
02:19:05,519 --> 02:19:10,398
because half the people do get it at

3100
02:19:08,079 --> 02:19:12,318
gmail

3101
02:19:10,398 --> 02:19:13,439
you know

3102
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:15,439
so

3103
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:17,519
it's something else

3104
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:19,760
presumably

3105
02:19:17,519 --> 02:19:21,040
like like i don't quite understand how

3106
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:23,120
gmail works

3107
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:25,120
in that some people it goes to spam and

3108
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:27,280
some people it doesn't

3109
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:29,280
the outlook one i understand a little

3110
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:30,239
bit more

3111
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:31,359
right

3112
02:19:30,239 --> 02:19:34,318
um

3113
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:36,559
which is that

3114
02:19:34,318 --> 02:19:36,558
the

3115
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:40,718
if they just flat out don't trust you or

3116
02:19:39,519 --> 02:19:42,719
don't

3117
02:19:40,718 --> 02:19:44,638
you know whatever

3118
02:19:42,718 --> 02:19:47,638
that makes more sense

3119
02:19:44,638 --> 02:19:47,638
uh

3120
02:19:48,398 --> 02:19:51,398
but

3121
02:20:26,159 --> 02:20:29,760
i did get the mail but didn't get

3122
02:20:28,079 --> 02:20:31,840
notification that it came what does that

3123
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:31,840
mean

3124
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:44,079
are the emails properly marked as being

3125
02:20:40,398 --> 02:20:46,959
bulk list mail um

3126
02:20:44,079 --> 02:20:48,559
i guess i don't know

3127
02:20:46,959 --> 02:20:50,318
what kind of mark

3128
02:20:48,559 --> 02:20:53,318
would they

3129
02:20:50,318 --> 02:20:53,318
have

3130
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:07,520
yes there is a list unsubscribe header

3131
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:17,280
um i don't know about list id

3132
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:20,079
uh

3133
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:22,399
i'd have to look at that

3134
02:21:20,079 --> 02:21:22,398
um

3135
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:26,679
so so i don't know

3136
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:40,079
uh anyway all this just reminds me that

3137
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:41,519
this stuff all needs to get burned down

3138
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:43,840
and someone needs to build an actual

3139
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:46,000
ecosystem that actually works

3140
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:47,920
uh this is nuts

3141
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:49,760
it's

3142
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:52,000
anything that microsoft or google are in

3143
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:53,840
charge of just doesn't work

3144
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,559
at all right

3145
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:59,359
from the operating system to the email

3146
02:21:56,559 --> 02:22:01,439
to the search to anything like these

3147
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:04,079
companies just can't do anything

3148
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:06,318
it's it's mind-bogglingly bad

3149
02:22:04,079 --> 02:22:06,318
um

3150
02:22:06,398 --> 02:22:08,639
so

3151
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:10,640
you know

3152
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:12,959
at some point this has to get fixed the

3153
02:22:10,639 --> 02:22:15,920
solutions are obvious

3154
02:22:12,959 --> 02:22:17,759
i mean rss would just solve this problem

3155
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:19,359
if they just integrated that into gmail

3156
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:21,600
that would have been it and you never

3157
02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:22,720
would have had this problem ever again

3158
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:24,720
right

3159
02:22:22,719 --> 02:22:26,318
um mailing lists would just be things

3160
02:22:24,719 --> 02:22:28,879
that were pull which is what they should

3161
02:22:26,318 --> 02:22:31,439
have been in the first place

3162
02:22:28,879 --> 02:22:33,199
but that's just too much for them

3163
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:34,639
and billions of dollars the r d budget

3164
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:37,200
just could not figure that out they were

3165
02:22:34,639 --> 02:22:38,000
like we just don't know how to do that

3166
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,920
um

3167
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:42,079
we're just we we have no idea how we

3168
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:45,120
would ever do that we're just not

3169
02:22:42,079 --> 02:22:47,200
capable of something like that right

3170
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:48,840
not only that but there's 50 billion

3171
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:50,640
other ways they could have solved this

3172
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:52,000
problem they could have just had it so

3173
02:22:50,639 --> 02:22:52,719
that you register your mailing list with

3174
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,398
them

3175
02:22:52,719 --> 02:22:55,679
and then their users just click i want

3176
02:22:54,398 --> 02:22:58,159
to subscribe to this mailing list on

3177
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:59,359
gmail side right

3178
02:22:58,159 --> 02:23:02,159
there's so many ways you could solve

3179
02:22:59,359 --> 02:23:03,200
this problem if anybody at any of these

3180
02:23:02,159 --> 02:23:05,359
companies

3181
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:07,200
thought about it for 10 seconds they

3182
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:10,960
could solve this problem tomorrow and

3183
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:12,880
they just can't handle it right

3184
02:23:10,959 --> 02:23:14,398
it's so far outside of their

3185
02:23:12,879 --> 02:23:16,839
conceptualization that maybe what they

3186
02:23:14,398 --> 02:23:19,039
should do is solve an actual

3187
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:20,639
problem instead of whatever it is they

3188
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,840
think they're doing when they go to work

3189
02:23:20,639 --> 02:23:23,760
during the day

3190
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:26,079
it's so nuts that this is still a

3191
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:26,079
problem

3192
02:23:26,879 --> 02:23:29,759
it's just so simple

3193
02:23:30,478 --> 02:23:35,438
um so anyway yeah uh

3194
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:38,720
what can you do

3195
02:23:35,439 --> 02:23:39,680
rss would be fine uh it's just that you

3196
02:23:38,719 --> 02:23:41,438
don't

3197
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:45,120
really have the option to use it because

3198
02:23:41,439 --> 02:23:47,280
nobody has a reader you know what i mean

3199
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:50,640
um

3200
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:52,880
so you might as well not

3201
02:23:50,639 --> 02:23:55,519
anyway i'm gonna wind it down this makes

3202
02:23:52,879 --> 02:23:57,199
me so angry like i just i'm so angry

3203
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:59,200
with with

3204
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:02,319
those email providers

3205
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:04,960
for we send out something that's

3206
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:06,478
only every is it's only rarely it's

3207
02:24:04,959 --> 02:24:08,879
definitely not spam it's something

3208
02:24:06,478 --> 02:24:12,719
people signed up for and they just

3209
02:24:08,879 --> 02:24:14,478
they're just so freaking irresponsible

3210
02:24:12,719 --> 02:24:17,358
it's really

3211
02:24:14,478 --> 02:24:17,358
makes me unhappy

3212
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:22,318
um

3213
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:24,479
so anyway uh i'm gonna wrap it up

3214
02:24:22,318 --> 02:24:26,398
again if you missed being in the stream

3215
02:24:24,478 --> 02:24:28,478
our kickstarter is live now for our

3216
02:24:26,398 --> 02:24:30,398
graphic novel it's really really high

3217
02:24:28,478 --> 02:24:33,358
quality print stuff

3218
02:24:30,398 --> 02:24:35,199
uh i showed it earlier on the stream

3219
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:38,000
i'll show it again

3220
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:40,079
uh but i hope you'll consider backing it

3221
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,079
and it does a great job on this thing

3222
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:44,318
uh it looks super cool this was the book

3223
02:24:42,079 --> 02:24:46,959
one that we did uh in the previous

3224
02:24:44,318 --> 02:24:48,559
kickstarter uh and it's just like it's a

3225
02:24:46,959 --> 02:24:50,239
really really good

3226
02:24:48,559 --> 02:24:51,439
uh

3227
02:24:50,239 --> 02:24:54,079
it's it's just a really really high

3228
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:57,840
quality graph novel i'm i'm a fan

3232
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:05,920
yeah if you're interested in checking it

copy okay

3236
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:13,600
um anyway if you're just in checking it

02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:14,639
out head over here to kickstarter uh you

3238
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:16,399
can just look for me on the infinite

3239
02:25:14,639 --> 02:25:18,639
book 2 on there you can just search for

3240
02:25:16,398 --> 02:25:20,239
meow book 2 kickstarter in fact no

3241
02:25:18,639 --> 02:25:22,159
matter where you are that'll that'll go

3242
02:25:20,239 --> 02:25:24,398
there

3243
02:25:22,159 --> 02:25:26,799
um and that will

3244
02:25:24,398 --> 02:25:28,879
uh do it for today for me

3245
02:25:26,799 --> 02:25:31,119
um i'll be back here next week to do

3246
02:25:28,879 --> 02:25:33,119
exactly what i said we were going to do

3247
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:35,359
um oh and frackle mind mike yes there's

3248
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:36,160
a backer here to receive both editions

3249
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:37,200
uh

3250
02:25:36,159 --> 02:25:38,719
there's tiers that are just called

3251
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:39,600
bundle and they come with book one and

3252
02:25:38,719 --> 02:25:41,920
two

3253
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:43,600
um there's also add-ons

3254
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:45,520
so uh

3255
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:47,760
because kickstarter finally added

3256
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:50,720
you know add-ons onto their system

3257
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:51,600
any tier that you back you can add books

3258
02:25:50,719 --> 02:25:53,119
to

3259
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:55,439
like so if you

3260
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:57,280
back a tier and you want to add more

3261
02:25:55,439 --> 02:25:59,040
book ones or more book twos to it that's

3262
02:25:57,280 --> 02:26:02,319
just an add-on you can just add and

3263
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:04,960
they'll ship in the same box right um so

3264
02:26:02,318 --> 02:26:07,680
like if you want to uh

3265
02:26:04,959 --> 02:26:10,000
uh buy you know

3266
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:12,639
two book ones and three book twos or

3267
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:14,478
whatever you can just do that uh it's

3268
02:26:12,639 --> 02:26:16,159
really easy to customize they didn't

3269
02:26:14,478 --> 02:26:17,760
used to be the case kickstarter used to

3270
02:26:16,159 --> 02:26:18,840
be actually pretty pretty tough to do

3271
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:22,000
that

3272
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:22,880
um because you had this situation where

3273
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:25,760
uh

3274
02:26:22,879 --> 02:26:28,079
they didn't allow add-ons so every every

3275
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:30,478
possible combination that anyone might

3276
02:26:28,079 --> 02:26:32,559
want to order you had to support as a

3277
02:26:30,478 --> 02:26:34,799
tear or what some people would do is

3278
02:26:32,559 --> 02:26:37,439
they'd create like these external sites

3279
02:26:34,799 --> 02:26:39,519
you could go to to like add things on to

3280
02:26:37,439 --> 02:26:41,520
your backing thing through with

3281
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:44,000
a second system right

3282
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:46,319
so thankfully kickstarter finally like

3283
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:49,359
last year or something added

3284
02:26:46,318 --> 02:26:50,719
uh just actually i think i mean this

3285
02:26:49,359 --> 02:26:51,920
it was probably 20 20. i don't i don't

3286
02:26:50,719 --> 02:26:54,318
remember which year it was might have

3287
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:57,359
been 2021 they added the ability to do

3288
02:26:54,318 --> 02:26:58,398
add-ons and so one of the real nice

3289
02:26:57,359 --> 02:27:00,159
things

3290
02:26:58,398 --> 02:27:02,559
um

3291
02:27:00,159 --> 02:27:04,478
that you can do now is

3292
02:27:02,559 --> 02:27:06,559
any other stuff you want to add on you

3293
02:27:04,478 --> 02:27:08,959
can just add them on and you don't have

3294
02:27:06,559 --> 02:27:10,318
to provide like so all these tiers where

3295
02:27:08,959 --> 02:27:12,639
it's just like so confusing and you

3296
02:27:10,318 --> 02:27:14,159
can't find it so it really simplified

3297
02:27:12,639 --> 02:27:16,559
the process and and it's great that they

3298
02:27:14,159 --> 02:27:19,039
finally did that because it's way easier

3299
02:27:16,559 --> 02:27:21,199
and it's not necessarily as bad for us

3300
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:23,280
because you know uh we're selling more

3301
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:24,479
of a simple thing right it's a graphic

3302
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:26,399
novel

3303
02:27:24,478 --> 02:27:28,639
um but even that as you get into a

3304
02:27:26,398 --> 02:27:29,760
series like this is a three book series

3305
02:27:28,639 --> 02:27:31,599
there's book one there's book two

3306
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:33,120
there'll be a book three by the time you

3307
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:34,479
get to book three that kickstarter it's

3308
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:35,680
like wow it'd be really confusing okay

3309
02:27:34,478 --> 02:27:36,959
how many book boos you want how you book

3310
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:38,880
one so we book threes right there'll be

3311
02:27:36,959 --> 02:27:40,318
so many tiers

3312
02:27:38,879 --> 02:27:42,959
so

3313
02:27:40,318 --> 02:27:45,199
one of the things

3314
02:27:42,959 --> 02:27:46,478
that it helps for is that

3315
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:47,520
but that's

3316
02:27:46,478 --> 02:27:49,039
i think

3317
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:51,120
nothing compared to these people who do

3318
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:53,120
like you know board game kickstarters or

3319
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:54,240
like trading card kickstarters or things

3320
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:55,920
like that

3321
02:27:54,239 --> 02:27:58,000
there's probably so many different

3322
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:59,760
things different things that people want

3323
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:02,318
to customize like oh i want like three

3324
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:04,239
booster packs and and and two miniatures

3325
02:28:02,318 --> 02:28:06,398
or whatever right like

3326
02:28:04,239 --> 02:28:09,199
so we actually had it easy compared to

3327
02:28:06,398 --> 02:28:11,519
other people uh and even we found that

3328
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:13,680
that having add-ons was a huge

3329
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:15,359
improvement i think that it's probably a

3330
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:17,479
massive improvement for people doing

3331
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:20,399
like physical like

3332
02:28:17,478 --> 02:28:22,799
multi-set things because those were

3333
02:28:20,398 --> 02:28:24,639
probably just impossible to do before

3334
02:28:22,799 --> 02:28:26,079
right um

3335
02:28:24,639 --> 02:28:27,920
and and now you can do them probably

3336
02:28:26,079 --> 02:28:31,600
pretty cleanly just by using the add-ons

3337
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:31,600
so that's cool right um

3338
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:33,680
so anyway

3339
02:28:32,799 --> 02:28:36,159
uh

3340
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:38,318
i think that's about it i will be back

3341
02:28:36,159 --> 02:28:40,719
here next week to do the series of steps

3342
02:28:38,318 --> 02:28:43,279
that i said before add single stepping

3343
02:28:40,719 --> 02:28:45,119
look at why we're getting the erroneous

3344
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:46,079
um

3345
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:47,520
red

3346
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:49,760
squares

3347
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:51,840
fix that then do the embedding and i

3348
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:53,200
think that is the recipe for finishing

3349
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:55,200
up the collision detector it's looking

3350
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:56,720
good it's just we're still getting a

3351
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:58,479
couple things that suggest me there's

3352
02:28:56,719 --> 02:29:00,159
some little bugs looking in there and i

3353
02:28:58,478 --> 02:29:00,959
want those out of there but it's looking

3354
02:29:00,159 --> 02:29:03,039
good

3355
02:29:00,959 --> 02:29:07,039
so i'm happy with it it just needs a

3356
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:10,160
little more it just needs a little more

3357
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:13,920
all right folks i will catch y'all later

3358
02:29:10,159 --> 02:29:16,639
uh let me take a look and see

3359
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:18,960
um if there is

3360
02:29:16,639 --> 02:29:18,959
