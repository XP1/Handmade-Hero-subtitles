1
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:10,920
okay hello everyone and welcome to the

2
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:13,888
stream I did sort of a thing we've never

3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:16,019
done before which is I had had some

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,519
folks who had written in and this had

5
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,750
happened sort of multiple times

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,419
throughout the course of running

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,969
handmade here oh I've had people who

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,750
rode in and asked me a very specific

9
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:29,640
question they're several different

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,530
people asked the same exact question and

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:37,770
it was what advice do you have or what

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,899
is it like to change careers from what

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm doing now to something like what you

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,759
show on handmade hero like you know I

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,619
want to go from career X to doing sort

16
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:51,149
of low-level programming or programming

17
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:52,890
in general as a career and you know I I

18
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,840
can only assume that the reason that

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,039
this question was asked of me is just

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,770
because it happens to be a fairly public

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,588
sort of stream for programming because

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,090
obviously I have no idea right I've been

23
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:08,938
programming for so long and I never

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,340
switched careers I don't really know the

25
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,529
answer to that question but I suspected

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,780
that the reason that I was getting this

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,960
question is because there weren't enough

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,180
sort of accessible materials out there

29
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,890
for people who wanted to go this rat so

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,270
after I'd gotten this question several

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:30,840
times I just like what can we do to help

32
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:32,849
give these folks an answer because I

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,280
can't answer them I have literally

34
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,289
nothing useful to say I'm like the worst

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,420
person to ask about this any advice I

36
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,479
have is probably wrong it's certainly

37
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,920
uneducated and not backed up by an

38
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,438
experience so I don't want to like

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,109
respond and say here's some advice that

40
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,209
and have them get steered totally down

41
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,060
the wrong path so what I did is I just

42
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:56,009
posted on Twitter and I said hey you

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,750
know I've been getting this question a

44
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,090
lot I suspect that there's a lot of

45
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,680
people out there who know the answer or

46
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,939
I mean you know the answer is probably

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,079
the wrong way to look at it right the

48
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,169
answer probably different from it for

49
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,758
everybody but who have a personal answer

50
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,860
who've had a personal experience with

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,750
this who have changed careers either it

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,210
went well or it went poorly they learn

53
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,889
thing from it - they have advice that

54
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,530
they'd like to pass along they you know

55
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:22,479
even just wanna to share maybe a story

56
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,789
that would help other people who are in

57
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,619
this position feel more comfortable with

58
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:29,079
their decision or give them things to

59
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,670
think about so I just kind of asked it

60
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,490
broadly and said you know anything you

61
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:35,139
want to write in you know write in and

62
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,020
let me know and I'll put them together

63
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:40,029
into you know sort of one big corpus

64
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,070
that we can put out there and that way

65
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,830
people who are interested in this

66
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:47,739
question can take a look and have sort

67
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,260
of a much better answer than I could

68
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,930
have given and the response was

69
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:55,000
fantastic I had many many people write

70
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,129
in and they wrote in sort of

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,199
impressively long stories to like really

72
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:01,269
good complete stories and so I just

73
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,810
figured the best thing to do at least as

74
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,760
a start was just to read them because I

75
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,250
think they're kind of great and we could

76
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,899
put this up as a video for reference

77
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,979
that people can look at when they're

78
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,360
thinking about this just to give them

79
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:15,310
things fuel and I could put up an audio

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,370
version if they want to listen to it as

81
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,289
a podcast for example but I I think it's

82
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,849
like it's just a lot of great

83
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,959
information here just for people who are

84
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:27,669
considering this sort of thing so

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,969
without further ado I would just like to

86
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:33,389
say thank you very sincerely to everyone

87
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:35,859
who took the time to write in because

88
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:38,500
none of this would be possible without

89
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,030
so many kind folks taking the time to

90
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,759
write it up I know that it's nobody's

91
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,860
favorite thing to take a bunch of time

92
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:47,709
to write a bunch of stuff about their

93
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,870
personal life I mean it takes time and

94
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:53,170
it's like you know it's reflective and

95
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,180
difficult and so you know a very

96
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:57,309
heartfelt thank-you goes out to everyone

97
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,299
who took the time to to share with us

98
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:05,159
and if anyone who watches this would

99
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:08,170
like to share similar stories we can

100
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,289
probably organize a good way to do that

101
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:15,099
I will try to post in the links to this

102
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:18,459
on youtube a reference where you can go

103
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:20,769
ahead and discuss this more so if you're

104
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,139
someone who found out about this only

105
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,569
after the video was already done you

106
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:27,129
could use use that contact information

107
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,629
to sort of get in touch and

108
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,240
share your stories and maybe we can kind

109
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:33,759
of keep this going as things go alright

110
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,069
so let's get started here the first one

111
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,439
I'm gonna read is actually the last one

112
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:39,519
I received and I'm gonna start off with

113
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,079
it because it's someone I know it's

114
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,079
someone I've met in person they came to

115
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,959
our conference both times actually

116
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,129
regretfully I didn't get a chance to

117
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,189
talk with them this time

118
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:54,819
but the first conference I did and this

119
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:56,529
comes from Andrew ah Stav and one of the

120
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,969
things that when people Brodie and I

121
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,469
said let me know if you want this to be

122
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,290
attributed to you or whether you'd like

123
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,000
to remain anonymous and so I'll be

124
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,300
giving the contact information for

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,920
people who wanted to be attributed and

126
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,750
I'll just be you know saying it on a

127
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,509
miss for those who didn't but this one

128
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,319
comes from Andrew ah stuff and he gave

129
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,980
his contact information

130
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:21,969
tiny construct on Twitter it's at TI NYC

131
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:27,280
o NS TR u CT give him a follower say hi

132
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:29,080
if you liked this story and he says hi

133
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,089
everyone my name is Andrew ah stop I'm

134
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,209
30 and I'll be graduating with a BS in

135
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:37,419
computer science in the fall of 2017

136
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:39,399
when I was seven or so I started

137
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,870
plunking around with some flavor of

138
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,000
basic and experimented with a few

139
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,949
languages and purpose-built engines as I

140
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,230
got older but living in rural

141
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,599
pre-internet Minnesota definitely

142
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,980
affected how much I learned my parents

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,350
knew how important computers were

144
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,480
becoming and we always owned a decent

145
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,600
machine so in many ways I was extremely

146
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,400
lucky on the other hand I didn't know

147
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,590
any programmers we didn't get dial-up

148
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,329
internet till I was 12 and our small

149
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:08,379
town was a two-hour drive from the

150
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:09,939
nearest bookstore and I just interject

151
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:12,610
here this is very similar to the way I

152
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,230
grew up I and I think one of the things

153
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,330
that I have always been very fortunate

154
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,910
to say is that my father was a

155
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:20,740
programmer so I did actually know

156
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,240
someone but it's important to kind of

157
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,000
keep in perspective here depending on

158
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,250
how old you are if you're like me you

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,230
maybe didn't grow up at a time when you

160
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,420
had access these things so anyway a nerd

161
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,920
continues maybe worse well I wasn't

162
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,199
great at math and still wouldn't say I

163
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,350
am during my senior year of high school

164
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,610
a friend basically taught our class

165
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,720
precalculus because a temporary teacher

166
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,610
didn't understand

167
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,860
the material and that more or less

168
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,170
describes how well organized our schools

169
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,150
math department was you're probably

170
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,860
beginning to see why I think internet

171
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:52,959
access and online resources are so

172
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,050
important to say nothing of communities

173
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,060
that happily accept beginners so I

174
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,710
stayed away from serious programming for

175
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,899
a few reasons and got a degree in

176
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:04,149
journalism to abbreviate that history

177
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:05,649
let's just say the era of quote-unquote

178
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:08,199
should our newspaper have a twitter

179
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:10,209
account was not the best time to go into

180
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,789
that field and I don't know that it's

181
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:14,769
gotten any better after four years I was

182
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,840
a little burnt out and was ready to move

183
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:19,199
when my now wife graduated from her

184
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,789
master's program with a job offer I

185
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,099
started digging into courses that put

186
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:27,220
all of their materials online like mi

187
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,560
t--'s cs50 which is mostly taught in C

188
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,140
I'd always enjoyed learning more about

189
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,269
how computers actually function so that

190
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:35,680
was great this got me thinking about

191
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:38,019
maybe going back to school or just

192
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,220
buying a bunch of books with the goal of

193
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:40,959
getting hired as an entry-level

194
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,240
programmer somewhere in Minneapolis

195
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,310
doing basically anything because

196
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,069
basically anything would be more fun and

197
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,019
pay better than my previous job I still

198
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:51,579
loved games but still had no perspective

199
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:54,159
on how they were made

200
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:55,930
then handmade hero started up I'd only

201
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,880
ever heard people describe low-level

202
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,340
programming as too complicated for games

203
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,139
which is obviously crazy and seeing

204
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:04,269
someone doing it was definitely a

205
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:06,339
wake-up call so I said hey there's

206
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:08,109
always more loans and started burning

207
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:09,519
through Khan Academy math videos after

208
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,610
signing up to take some intro

209
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,019
programming courses and calculus one

210
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,090
since then I've taken both great and

211
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:18,519
terrible classes but the University of

212
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:19,959
Minnesota parenthesis Twin Cities CS

213
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,180
program seems pretty good overall

214
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,339
everyone has to do C programming an

215
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,478
assembly reading between classes on its

216
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,399
operating systems and machine

217
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:28,870
architecture I've learned math that I

218
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,819
would have struggled with if I'd had to

219
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,129
teach myself and I've only had one

220
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:35,950
required class that's really hard about

221
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:37,719
modern software development it's a large

222
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,310
school but I have been surprised at the

223
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,650
number of people my age who are in the

224
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,538
program there's always more to learn and

225
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:46,449
I've got a long way to go but I think we

226
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:48,490
all know how getting good computers to

227
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,070
how getting computers to do their

228
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,959
freakin job can feel the expense sucks

229
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,460
and it's frequently humbling to be peers

230
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,049
to 20 year olds but every day

231
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,580
practicing something I enjoy instead of

232
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:00,069
pounding away at something I hate and

233
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,350
I'm already decent at I definitely

234
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,080
recommend the former best regards and

235
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:10,870
restof again he's tiny construct on

236
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:13,330
Twitter so that's a pretty good I would

237
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,370
say story about Pete you know about

238
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:19,030
being in the process of switching

239
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,759
careers which is sort of exactly the

240
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:23,620
position that I think a lot of people

241
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,929
are in right now I heard from some folks

242
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,310
who said I don't have a story to story

243
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:30,250
to share yet because I'm kind of just in

244
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:31,659
the middle of switching but I'm really

245
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,519
interested to hear what other people's

246
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:35,139
experiences are Andrew wrote in and gave

247
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,629
us kind of the Midway experience right

248
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:40,419
he's still going to university for it

249
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:42,159
and he you know obviously hopes to make

250
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:44,169
the transition I'm assuming from

251
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,480
university to working in either the game

252
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:49,269
industry or some other programming

253
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,820
industry and honestly like I feel like

254
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,919
he's probably going to have a lot of

255
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,270
success at that I've obviously I said I

256
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,759
know him and I've talked to him before

257
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:59,409
and I've seen him on the twitch chat a

258
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,490
lot of times and he seems to know what

259
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:02,309
he's doing so I think he's probably

260
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,509
gonna have pretty good luck at that but

261
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:06,250
that's a pretty typical story I think

262
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:08,439
also from a lot of people that I've

263
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,059
heard where it's like hey you know I I

264
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,380
kind of knew that my current career

265
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:14,049
wasn't working for me for whatever

266
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:17,049
reason and I wanted to switch so I just

267
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:19,689
like found some things to grab onto

268
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:21,279
right like you know things online that

269
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,780
that seemed to stick and then I just

270
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,639
decided to take the plunge and now I'm

271
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,579
you know I'm going for it

272
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,110
so obviously I wish him all the best of

273
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,940
luck and he's someone that I know

274
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,710
personally now so I will certainly be

275
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,130
keeping in touch with him and seeing how

276
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:38,259
it goes the rest of our stories are from

277
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:40,389
folks who have kind of been either

278
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:41,769
finished the transition and it went well

279
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,769
or finished a musician and it didn't go

280
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:48,009
well and so now we'll move in to some of

281
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:50,470
those so this this next one is actually

282
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:54,220
was submitted and honestly and it's from

283
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:56,560
someone who was in the sciences and was

284
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,660
it was a little younger in life so they

285
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,759
were in sort of university for the

286
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:03,339
sciences around 23 years old when they

287
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,319
decided to switch so I thought I'd start

288
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,450
out with this one and then there's one

289
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,260
that I'll pair it with afterwards so

290
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,420
here's that story

291
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:14,129
again this one's not attributed so my

292
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:15,809
story starts off as a biochemistry

293
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:17,399
student in Canada on track to do

294
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,009
medicine and it's continuing now as a

295
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,850
programmer working at Ubisoft

296
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,549
essentially there came a point in my

297
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,409
life around 23 years old where for the

298
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:27,240
first time I seriously sat down to

299
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:29,088
answer the question what would I truly

300
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,379
enjoy waking up and doing every day

301
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:33,839
video games have always been a big part

302
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:35,549
of my life and so with only one life to

303
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,570
live I made the commitment to make video

304
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:38,759
games for a living

305
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,310
this was easily the biggest and hardest

306
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,649
step and so they're kind of saying here

307
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:45,750
that the toughest part of this journey

308
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,339
if you will is just the decision to

309
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,490
actually do it which i think is probably

310
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,080
true for a lot of people because while

311
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,269
everything is hard work in making a

312
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,040
transition deciding that you really want

313
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:58,549
to do it is obviously something that

314
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:02,189
takes a lot of courage as well as

315
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:04,199
reflection I think anyway they continue

316
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,930
from here it's easy once you know what

317
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,120
you want just add work I knew where I

318
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:11,219
was I knew where I wanted to get to so I

319
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,019
asked the question what are the exact

320
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,120
things I need to do in order to get from

321
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:17,009
here to there and then I went out and

322
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,740
did exactly those things there's no

323
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:23,129
magic here just work every night after

324
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,709
my day job and every weekend so he

325
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:27,000
listed these kind of an order number one

326
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,469
for about two months

327
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,600
I read the following books cover to

328
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,339
cover the C programming language second

329
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,899
edition by Kernighan and Ritchie this is

330
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,330
the K NRC book for those of you don't

331
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,549
know it introduction to algorithms by

332
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:42,420
cormen leiserson rivest and stein or

333
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:46,588
CLRS and operating system concepts by

334
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:48,929
Silver shots Galvin and Gagne step two

335
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,790
for one month I trained for the coding

336
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:52,979
interview by doing every question in the

337
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:54,449
standard interview books every new grad

338
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,789
program are looking to get a job at

339
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,079
Google Facebook etc has done these it

340
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:59,549
was hugely important in gaining

341
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,139
confidence knowing I was on the right

342
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:02,669
track applying knowledge I had acquired

343
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,789
from reading too many problems and

344
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:07,409
identified my weak areas and these books

345
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:09,419
were cracking the code interview fourth

346
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:11,309
edition by Lachman elements of

347
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:14,189
programming interviews by Aziz Prakash

348
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:17,819
and Lee and then he just had a website

349
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:22,350
which is project Euler net PR oj ec t e

350
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,820
UL e r dotnet step three I did

351
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,129
coating interview with a Silicon Valley

352
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,690
tech exec isolated from any software

353
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:29,129
people it was so great to finally step

354
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,480
out of the dark and get real feedback

355
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:32,429
from someone who had interviewed many

356
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,680
many programmers before was hugely

357
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:36,359
important in feeling and he says feeling

358
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,500
I couldn't compete I'm not sure if he

359
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,389
means I could compete or couldn't

360
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,970
compete I read this entry fairly

361
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:43,889
carefully and it sounds like maybe he

362
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,899
did actually mean couldn't compete

363
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,730
because it kind of goes through you know

364
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,490
a failure and a success here in in a

365
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,080
minute so you'll have to forgive the

366
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,750
ambiguity there I'm not sure but anyway

367
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,670
step number four for two months I

368
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,470
applied to Google even my closest

369
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,899
friends don't know this I didn't get an

370
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,180
offer no excuses no way to sugarcoat it

371
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,679
failure really sucks and it is

372
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,779
humiliating

373
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,639
I kept the Google visitor pass on my

374
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,860
wall for over a year to constantly

375
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,639
remind me of that feeling I reluctantly

376
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,379
include this point for four reasons

377
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,059
first after only a few months the above

378
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:19,740
training actually does prepare you very

379
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,679
well for algorithm OS and computer

380
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,060
architecture questions next it does not

381
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,000
help you answer software design

382
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:28,739
questions next doing these all-day

383
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,289
on-site interviews is very different

384
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,940
than sitting at your desk thinking and

385
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:34,889
problem solving under pressure and time

386
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,460
constraint is hard and finally when you

387
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:39,960
fail you still wake up the next day now

388
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,740
I would just like to interject here that

389
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:47,790
I cannot agree more with what he just

390
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:50,789
said and I guess what I would say here

391
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:53,459
is I I have been through a similar

392
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:55,139
process sort of like I the first

393
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,740
experience I ever had sort of with

394
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:01,679
outside programmers was interviewing at

395
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,740
Microsoft for an internship and it is

396
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:08,309
very very different and very unnerving

397
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,350
to be put in that situation it's also

398
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,669
where you kind of have these problems

399
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,200
turn at you you're not used to this

400
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:14,879
environment you're not used to problem

401
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,030
solving this way under pressure like

402
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,610
that it's also one of the reasons that

403
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:23,129
I've very very often loudly criticized

404
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,620
on our stream this interview process in

405
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:27,120
particular because not only do I think

406
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,950
it's not a good interview process for

407
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,870
experienced programmers but I also think

408
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,660
it's particularly off-putting and

409
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,860
particularly difficult for novices and I

410
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,919
think that means you don't get a very

411
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,470
picture of novices actual ability now I

412
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:43,599
like I said this was an anonymous

413
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,430
submitted story I have no idea what this

414
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,019
person's qualifications were at the time

415
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:48,189
and I'm not saying that they should or

416
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,049
should not have gotten a job or anything

417
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,850
like that but I just want to underscore

418
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:54,669
the fact that these interview processes

419
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,680
that are very adversarial and sort of

420
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:58,539
like pressure oriented that a lot of

421
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:00,639
tech companies do these days have never

422
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:04,778
felt comfortable to me and I do not like

423
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,778
them and so I want to really say you

424
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:09,789
know yep

425
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:11,019
take to heart what that person said that

426
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:13,449
it's a very difficult and challenging

427
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:15,310
experience definitely try to prepare a

428
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,980
psychological you can for it I apologize

429
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:19,750
on behalf of our entire industry for

430
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,120
these it's certainly never an interview

431
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,950
that I would ever consent to giving but

432
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,539
it is unfortunately reality at a lot of

433
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,930
the entry-level positions that you will

434
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:30,879
have to try for if you want to get into

435
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:33,370
an industry they unfortunately do things

436
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,769
this way and it is very stressful and it

437
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:38,470
is humiliating it's set up to be

438
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:40,389
humiliating if you fail unfortunately

439
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,769
perhaps not intentionally on the part of

440
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,970
the companies but it really is difficult

441
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:47,379
and so yes again I am sorry for that

442
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,759
that's not so I really wish that was

443
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:50,320
something that this industry would

444
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,929
change it's not the kind of interview I

445
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,339
would ever be okay giving and I really

446
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:57,759
don't like the way it probably makes

447
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:59,410
people feel when they fail them or even

448
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,389
when they succeed to be honest you may

449
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:04,599
do very well more and you will still

450
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:06,129
feel bad it will leave a bad feeling to

451
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,078
you and and I wish that that was

452
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,780
something that we would change but

453
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,759
that's a topic for another day

454
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:14,500
continuing on step 5

455
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:16,000
I watched handmade hero everything I'd

456
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,939
learned to date was just a piece in the

457
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,308
orchestra OS concepts on percussion

458
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,589
algorithms the brass math on piano and

459
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:25,539
si played the strings I like this

460
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:26,109
analogy handmade hero however was the

461
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:27,369
maestro

462
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,959
it brought all these instruments

463
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,668
together to try and teach me how to

464
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,140
program watching a professional

465
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:33,660
programmer think through each step show

466
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,860
the process encounter problems

467
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,990
contemplate and rationalized solutions

468
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:40,209
all on a straightforward no BS way it

469
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,099
has been an irreplaceable education it

470
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,450
also fast tracked me down what I now

471
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,339
perceive to be the right way to design

472
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,870
software a skill I was sorely missing

473
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:48,189
I'm confident in saying watching

474
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:49,359
handmade here was a single most

475
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,980
important action I took

476
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,229
and here's the single biggest reason I

477
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,880
managed to realize my original goal

478
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:58,028
thank you very much for that praise I

479
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,760
probably don't deserve it but number six

480
00:17:58,028 --> 00:18:03,069
I started my own HMH inspired projects

481
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:05,019
it's one thing watching KC work through

482
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:06,579
encountering a problem it's another when

483
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:08,349
you have to solve it yourself especially

484
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:10,990
if down the line you find out it wasn't

485
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:13,389
a good idea those lessons stick I wrote

486
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,899
a lot a lot of really bad code to start

487
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:19,509
perhaps my co-workers still think this

488
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:21,219
and I would say again I really agree

489
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:24,339
with everything that's in this story

490
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:29,079
basically the amount of bad code I've

491
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:31,359
written in my life is I can't even

492
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:34,569
fathom how much it is I still write bad

493
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,729
code today on the road to good code and

494
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:37,928
the the hope is always that you have

495
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,808
enough time to get to go code sometimes

496
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:42,820
you don't and the bad code ships but

497
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:44,558
there is no substitute for writing a lot

498
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:47,138
of bad code if you want to become a good

499
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:51,250
coder it's very analogous I think to

500
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:53,439
almost every other sort of trade skill

501
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,599
that I know of you don't get to be a

502
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,308
great artist without drawing a lot of

503
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,079
really bad drawings you don't get to be

504
00:18:57,308 --> 00:19:00,398
a great musician without playing a lot

505
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,798
of horrible sounding notes from your

506
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:04,239
instruments and the same is true of code

507
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,220
you just don't get to be a good coder

508
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,829
without writing a lot of really bad code

509
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,149
it's just the nature of it and so I

510
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:12,369
think that's really good advice to take

511
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:15,308
to heart okay finishing up this story

512
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:17,048
they say that's it roughly a year after

513
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:18,638
picking up King RC I interviewed and got

514
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:20,230
a job doing gameplay programming at

515
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:22,269
Ubisoft jumping into triple-a

516
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,190
development on large team sizes spread

517
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:26,019
across the globe with massive massive 20

518
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,919
plus year old code bases is a totally

519
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,319
different learning experience and

520
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,909
frankly it has been hard the biggest

521
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,980
skill I've had to learn is how to sift

522
00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:34,450
through and read foreign code and try to

523
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,759
understand different systems written by

524
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,659
different people at different times

525
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,730
potentially on different projects as a

526
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:41,620
caveat the type of programming thinking

527
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,849
and problems encountered at larger

528
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:44,709
companies is for my limited experience

529
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,990
very different than you see on handmade

530
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,639
hero it's less about solving the actual

531
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,700
problem and I agree with this

532
00:19:48,638 --> 00:19:53,769
wholeheartedly on handmade hero I try to

533
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,470
teach very sane straightforward

534
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:59,339
programming practices a lot of times on

535
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:02,889
a lot of projects you will not have that

536
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:03,308
that fortunate experience a lot of times

537
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:05,048
things

538
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:07,509
very overcomplicated very overweight

539
00:20:05,048 --> 00:20:09,519
very large and unwieldy and that is

540
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:11,169
something that I don't think really

541
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,659
anything can prepare you for other than

542
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,669
just having to do it it's unfortunate

543
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:17,799
it's not very satisfying to to have to

544
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:19,480
wade into things like that but the truth

545
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:21,579
is that no matter where you go

546
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,679
Ubisoft not being some kind of exception

547
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:27,099
to this but rather the rule everywhere

548
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,389
you go the code bases are what has been

549
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:30,998
able to work and what's been able to

550
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:33,069
manage and it is often the times that

551
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:35,528
they are not going to be perfect clean

552
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:37,329
gems of wonder they're just going to be

553
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:39,788
very large and very healty a lot of the

554
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:42,490
times and it is our job as software

555
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:44,200
engineers to figure out how to make them

556
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,089
better every day and that's just the

557
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,788
truth right so that's that's how it goes

558
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:49,928
anyway concluding currently I'm really

559
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:51,278
trying to focus on my own game and

560
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,990
overall trying to get better every day

561
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:55,690
have a long way to go I still study

562
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,859
every weekend that's the story I hope it

563
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,778
provides some contemplating switching

564
00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:00,219
with a real example from A to Z to

565
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:01,659
reiterate what I started with the

566
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,730
hardest part was just committing to the

567
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,528
goal after that it was just keeping my

568
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,558
head down and putting in the work no

569
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:10,419
magic other recommended books they just

570
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,249
as the final thing they said linkers and

571
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:15,278
loaders by Jay Levine and linear algebra

572
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:16,868
gen right by Axler so there you go

573
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:18,669
that's a really good success story too I

574
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:21,730
suspect a lot of people would be pretty

575
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:23,379
happy to get their their first job at

576
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,149
some place as prominent as Ubisoft

577
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:29,288
obviously makes a lot of games

578
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:34,839
Assassin's Creed for example watchdogs

579
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:37,269
etc that are pretty famous so

580
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:39,069
congratulations on such a successful

581
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:41,319
transition and I hope you continue to

582
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:44,589
have a fulfilling career in the game

583
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:46,689
industry yeah and thanks so much for

584
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:48,819
sharing your story now let's move to

585
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,590
somebody who also started in the

586
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:52,298
sciences to remember that last story was

587
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:56,648
was starting in the sciences in

588
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:59,558
university let's look at a fella who

589
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:03,008
switched from the sciences at a later

590
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:09,099
time so this one comes from Eric / - on

591
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:12,190
Twitter they are e RI k PE RT tu and

592
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:13,928
there it in with this story I have

593
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,000
always used computers in one way or

594
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:17,170
another mostly due to me being very much

595
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,369
into playing

596
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,350
we got our first computer in our

597
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:23,349
household in the early 90s if I remember

598
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:26,199
correctly it was an Intel I 46 SX 25

599
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:29,740
megahertz with 2 or 4 megabytes of RAM

600
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,529
and a 120 megabyte hard drive this was

601
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,970
not my first computer I'm sorry this was

602
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:36,009
not the first computer we had in our

603
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:38,170
home though due to my dad's line of work

604
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:41,440
occasionally we would have a Toshiba T

605
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:44,769
3100 that he would bring home and on

606
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,390
that one he had Tetris most of my early

607
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:47,859
computer years was spent playing games

608
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,080
it was my dad who introduced me to

609
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:51,879
Wolfenstein 3d he mentioned that on the

610
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,470
computer at his work there was a game

611
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,380
where you would go around with a gun and

612
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,539
shoot Nazis the way he described it to

613
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,520
me really piqued my interest whatever

614
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:02,129
this game he was talking about was I had

615
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:04,299
to get in on that it sounded amazing

616
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,040
after I had played that game on his work

617
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,809
computer I somehow got a hold of the

618
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,519
shareware version of will 3d and could

619
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:11,619
play it at the computer at home I

620
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,480
started to subscribe to gaming magazines

621
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:15,789
and you would get a shareware disc every

622
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,220
month with new games on it fast forward

623
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:21,460
a couple of years at around 1994 we got

624
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,559
Internet which at the same time which at

625
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,509
the time was very early for the part of

626
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:27,369
Sweden where I grew up that's the first

627
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:29,559
time I tried online gaming which was

628
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:31,689
something new to me after high school in

629
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:33,700
the early 2000s I started studying for

630
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,289
my engineering degree in college looking

631
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,180
back now I probably should have went

632
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,009
with a computer science degree I looked

633
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,570
at that computer science programs but

634
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:43,089
they seemed to be so difficult because

635
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:44,470
of the math involved which is actually

636
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:47,349
kind of a surprising statement if I may

637
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:49,809
interject for a second I am surprised to

638
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:51,309
hear that an engineering degree has less

639
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:53,859
stringent math requirements than a

640
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:55,629
computer science degree but I never went

641
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:59,049
to university so I guess I I don't know

642
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,370
I always thought of engineering like you

643
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:01,450
know general mechanical engineering or

644
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:03,699
stuff like that is happening sort of

645
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,009
more rigorous math demands but then

646
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,870
again that's sort of looking more at

647
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:09,549
just what I thought University in the US

648
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:11,529
would have certainly I don't know about

649
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:13,419
what universities in Sweden would have

650
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:16,779
and also I I don't never sure because I

651
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,550
never went so anyway I looked at the

652
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:19,869
computer science programs but they seem

653
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:21,639
to be so difficult because the math

654
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:23,559
involved in engineering there was math

655
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,330
and physics but there were also a lot of

656
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,399
other classes that did not involve so

657
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:29,230
much logical thinking I had struggled

658
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,250
with math for most of my life and did

659
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,049
not think that I would be

660
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,059
able to finish all the math logical type

661
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,849
thinking classes that were necessary for

662
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:39,339
a computer science degree okay

663
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:41,230
first engineering job I finished college

664
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:44,169
in late 2006 and got my first

665
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,910
engineering job in 2007 I started

666
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:48,000
working as a development engineer for a

667
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,860
pharmaceutical company outside Stockholm

668
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,869
after about two years after around two

669
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:54,609
and a half years I was extremely fed up

670
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:56,049
with the slow process in getting

671
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:58,359
anything done due to the nature of

672
00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:00,309
pharmaceuticals which if it's anything

673
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:03,149
like it is in the US I'll just interject

674
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:05,619
I can imagine how tedious that is

675
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:07,420
continuing it could take weeks and

676
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,889
months to get anything approved because

677
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,750
it had to go through several different

678
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,520
departments and offices this was also

679
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,079
around the time for the 2009 global

680
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:15,369
financial crisis so a lot of the

681
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,889
projects that were supposed to be done

682
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:20,679
never took off the products I was

683
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:22,240
supposed to do were put on ice and me

684
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,039
and my boss decided that it was probably

685
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,289
better if I left and started to look for

686
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,299
another opportunity I was not enjoying

687
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:31,809
anything at work and the things that was

688
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:34,629
hard to do were not there anymore and so

689
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:36,519
now the switch I left my engineering job

690
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,260
in late 2009 and started to look for a

691
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:40,210
new job due to the global financial

692
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:41,890
crisis that was in full swing by this

693
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,779
point there were not a whole lot of

694
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,759
engineering jobs for me to apply to I

695
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:47,740
was unemployed for several months but I

696
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,379
had friends working in the IT field in

697
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,390
Stockholm a couple of them were thinking

698
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,980
about starting up a small web company

699
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,390
and mentioned that if I learned

700
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,099
programming I could get an entry-level

701
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,640
position at the company they were about

702
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:03,299
to start in 2010 at 28 years old I

703
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,940
started to study a two-year college

704
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:09,669
course called agile web developer at a

705
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,799
pyrotechnic Vik goal school in Stockholm

706
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:14,230
I have no idea what a pyro Technical

707
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:15,460
School is but I truly hope that is

708
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,099
exactly what it sounds like

709
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,150
which is like a school where you learn

710
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:21,039
to light things on fire

711
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,690
that is the best name I've ever heard

712
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,259
pyrotechnical I'm sure that's not what

713
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:29,230
it means I'm sure it actually means

714
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:31,869
something like you know vocationally

715
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:34,240
oriented or something like this but the

716
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:36,099
phrase pyrotechnical sounds so cool ok

717
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,559
sorry anyway the frustration starts

718
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:41,019
switching careers so late was not easy

719
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,149
even if I had studied my fair share of

720
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:43,929
math earlier in college I was badly

721
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,278
prepared for the

722
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:47,619
complex thinking that is needed for

723
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,298
programming I had not used a whole lot

724
00:26:47,618 --> 00:26:50,949
of my math logical knowledge up to that

725
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:52,269
point and it was several years ago since

726
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,730
I had studied the subjects that would

727
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:56,288
have helped me I remember having a very

728
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,749
hard time getting back into the way of

729
00:26:56,288 --> 00:27:00,700
abstract thinking and it took a very

730
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:03,249
long time before I could visualize code

731
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,899
in my head I was also a bit jealous at

732
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:06,129
other people studying who seemed to

733
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:08,138
understand everything the first time a

734
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:10,388
new topic came up I talked to these

735
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:12,278
students and most of them had some prior

736
00:27:10,388 --> 00:27:14,378
programming knowledge or had grown up in

737
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:16,419
a home where a sibling or parent was

738
00:27:14,378 --> 00:27:18,278
working with programming this gave them

739
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:19,778
a huge edge they would understand

740
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:22,118
concepts in the terminology because they

741
00:27:19,778 --> 00:27:25,538
had heard or seen it before but for me

742
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:27,220
it was something completely new and now

743
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:28,359
the next section they said was called

744
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,490
struggling with my programming

745
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:31,808
vocabulary which I've never really

746
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,490
thought about this too much but I can

747
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:34,960
imagine program vocabulary must be a

748
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,759
nightmare for people who aren't used to

749
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,740
it because there's so many weird terms

750
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:42,220
that we throw around that people are

751
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,240
just supposed to do and they're totally

752
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,950
forward weird they don't even

753
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,128
necessarily imply what they actually

754
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,869
mean so anyway he continues I struggled

755
00:27:48,128 --> 00:27:52,148
a lot with finding words for what it was

756
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,829
I wanted to do in the beginning even the

757
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:56,439
simplest things were confusing to me if

758
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:58,329
I have a list and inside this list there

759
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,460
is another list how do I get access to

760
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:02,109
the inner list I know or at least I

761
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,298
think I know this can be done but what

762
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:05,558
is it called what word should I use when

763
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:07,839
I try to find information about it

764
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,950
online these things never seem to be a

765
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,538
problem for people with prior

766
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,009
programming knowledge they knew what

767
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:14,288
words to use and where to find this

768
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:16,179
information the tips I got from

769
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:17,980
experienced programmers at the time were

770
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:19,269
usually something along the lines of why

771
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,558
don't you just visit the page that

772
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:22,599
contains the manual for the language

773
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,118
from framework you're using that in

774
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,558
itself is not bad advice for me but it

775
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:28,689
really didn't help that much because I

776
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,298
still didn't know the word that I was

777
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,369
looking for I ended up having to ask

778
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:35,259
people and with my own words trying to

779
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:37,569
describe what it was I wanted to do

780
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:39,069
slowly my programming vocabulary started

781
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:41,048
to grow and I found myself getting

782
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:45,339
better and better at actually finding

783
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:49,538
what I was looking for now here's a

784
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:51,220
section on resources that helped I do

785
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:53,349
not have any specific books or websites

786
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:57,159
that I can recommend I can however give

787
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:59,348
some advice on when selecting resource

788
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:02,139
sorry I can't however give some advice

789
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:03,848
for when selecting a resource some

790
00:29:02,138 --> 00:29:05,408
things you can learn from that in the

791
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:07,418
beginning everything and anything that

792
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,519
was related to programming because I had

793
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:11,288
no previous knowledge or experience I

794
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,179
really had no way of doing things that

795
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:14,528
meant that I had no preconceived notion

796
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:16,330
about what was right or what was wrong

797
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:18,429
so anything I read or learned was

798
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:19,689
something new and exciting however after

799
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:21,460
a while you start to develop your own

800
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,889
way of doing things you get an opinion

801
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,720
of what's right and what's wrong and if

802
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:27,158
you have friends at work as programmers

803
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,348
you will take a lot of their opinions as

804
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:30,700
facts I personally do not see that as a

805
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:32,618
problem when you are learning something

806
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,598
new but you will all have to start

807
00:29:32,618 --> 00:29:36,519
researching a bit on your own not just

808
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:37,689
accept everything everyone says and as

809
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:39,489
soon as you do not understand a concept

810
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,080
or word look it up and read about it

811
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:42,190
depending on the language you are

812
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,048
learning there are good and bad

813
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,269
resources if you are learning a language

814
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:47,528
that is very popular you have to be more

815
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:49,690
careful when selecting learning

816
00:29:47,528 --> 00:29:51,069
resources I made the mistake of taking

817
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,048
the first accepted answer on

818
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:57,489
stackoverflow.com several times at the

819
00:29:53,048 --> 00:29:58,839
beginning and I feel like this is

820
00:29:57,489 --> 00:30:02,259
probably a very common pitfall these

821
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:04,028
days because as a beginning programmers

822
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,618
sorry to interject again I feel like

823
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:06,878
people would have no idea sometimes the

824
00:30:05,618 --> 00:30:09,728
answer on the top of Stack Overflow is

825
00:30:06,878 --> 00:30:12,339
good sometimes it's awful and how would

826
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:13,359
you know right well you know is there

827
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:14,738
something that looks like an

828
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:16,928
authoritative resource and here it is

829
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:18,460
you don't have any way to evaluate

830
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:21,700
whether you think it might be right or

831
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,869
wrong and experts in the field don't

832
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,028
necessarily do a very good job of

833
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:25,928
policing these things not to mention the

834
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:27,638
fact that there's arguments among

835
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:29,590
experts about what is or was is not

836
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:30,998
right ways of doing things so that can

837
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:32,499
be very daunting I would imagine for

838
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:34,538
someone just trying to learn anyway

839
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:36,278
continuing and sadly I started doing

840
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:37,778
things in a bad sloppy way I later

841
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:39,190
noticed that I would also have to check

842
00:30:37,778 --> 00:30:40,929
the date on the answer to see if it was

843
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,308
still relevant and answer from two years

844
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:44,619
ago might not be the correct waited for

845
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:45,668
you to do things today before anyone

846
00:30:44,618 --> 00:30:47,618
decides to start reading a book about

847
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:48,970
programming start by checking the

848
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:50,589
reviews for the book to see if it is a

849
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,848
good resource there are so many books

850
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:53,589
out there today and not all of them

851
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:54,999
should be read or recommended is the

852
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:56,408
book up to date if it's about a

853
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:57,788
framework make sure it's at about the

854
00:30:56,409 --> 00:30:59,109
version you will actually be using is

855
00:30:57,788 --> 00:31:00,729
the book ding that your skill level

856
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:02,079
there are plenty of programming books

857
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:03,429
and they usually say what skill level

858
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,509
they expect you to have before you start

859
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:09,070
reading it I hope my story will I hope

860
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:10,298
my story will have given people some

861
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,689
information about some of the problems

862
00:31:10,298 --> 00:31:12,490
of solutions

863
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:18,390
they were run into and again that's from

864
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:21,670
Eric / 2 e e RI k PE r TT you on Twitter

865
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,500
thanks very much for writing it now

866
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:27,220
let's move on to somebody who switched

867
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,960
from a totally non-technical field I

868
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,360
mean it I guess that's not entirely true

869
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,360
these days because almost every field

870
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:38,019
has technical aspects to it you know if

871
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:40,419
you are an artist or a you know musician

872
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:43,450
or a schoolteacher or anything that

873
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:46,750
might sound non-technical if it was 50

874
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,160
years ago honestly there's text all over

875
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,930
the place so to the degree to which it

876
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,450
is technical probably actually has a lot

877
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,980
to do with the particular place that

878
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,240
you're doing that thing or the

879
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,279
particular variant of that thing that

880
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,569
you're doing so when I say non-technical

881
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,879
I don't really mean that technically so

882
00:31:58,569 --> 00:32:04,149
if I just mean not a field which is

883
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,030
specifically engineering let's say so

884
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,820
this comes from Christian Flores and

885
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:17,349
this is you can find them on twitter at

886
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:19,149
cfl o is AMD and they write in hello

887
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:21,039
casey here is my experience of switching

888
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,590
careers into software engineering later

889
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,970
in life my experience with going into

890
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:26,439
soft development as a professional later

891
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,150
in life is somewhat unique because i

892
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,680
started programming quite early in high

893
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,870
school and even got a computer science

894
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,250
degree in university i wanted to make

895
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:35,559
games with a hot bomb with a couple of

896
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,480
good friends of mine and we did one of

897
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,759
my friends was a good artist but we had

898
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,470
no one to tackle audio i had always had

899
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,109
an interest in music so i took it upon

900
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:45,370
myself to be the audio guy long story

901
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:46,929
short i became very excited about

902
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:49,239
writing music for games and film as a

903
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:51,610
career and so I stayed in university for

904
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,640
another six years to take bachelor's and

905
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:56,409
master's degrees in music the following

906
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,030
two years were spent trying to get jobs

907
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:00,519
of composer and sound designer for indie

908
00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:01,990
films and games with mixed success one

909
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:04,299
thing that became clear as I pursued

910
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:05,680
game jobs was the importance of audio

911
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:07,839
implementation when it comes to game

912
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,759
audio this revelation brought me back to

913
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,500
my roots as a programmer and he can

914
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,789
perfectly honest the realization that I

915
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,279
had always been a better programmer than

916
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:16,899
a composer my first order of business

917
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,389
was picking up the audio programming

918
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,980
book by bulan sure and Lazzarini the

919
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:23,170
book even contained a short primer or

920
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,230
refresher in my case on C and I was

921
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,150
amazed at how fast

922
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,250
was able to recall so many things from

923
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:30,890
my programming days which was now about

924
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,990
eight years past crucial to me getting

925
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:35,090
back up to speed on programming was just

926
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,220
driving in and writing things in this

927
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:38,899
case it was audio plugins and I wasted

928
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,910
no time in writing a handful of plugins

929
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,929
in both VST which is for Steinberg and

930
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:46,490
au which is for Apple formats but no

931
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:48,290
less important were the many online

932
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,940
resources and communities that I sought

933
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:51,700
help from when I needed it including

934
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,890
forums on DSP plug-in development

935
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,419
websites blogs and published papers it

936
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:58,100
was a big boost to my confidence and

937
00:33:56,419 --> 00:33:59,750
satisfaction to build projects from the

938
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:02,019
ground up that I could then release

939
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,069
however small they were at first

940
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:05,808
furthermore I stayed away from any

941
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:08,358
third-party framework used to build

942
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:10,579
plugins like ju c e synth edit j plug

943
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:13,069
etcetera and i firmly believe that this

944
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:14,840
is an important part of learning where

945
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,519
those libraries may have had a place

946
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,710
building all my projects from scratch

947
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:21,320
really helped me learn the fundamentals

948
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,389
of interacting with an sdk such as VST

949
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,210
and au at a lower level and sharpening

950
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:27,440
my debugging and troubleshooting skills

951
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:30,079
and i would just jump in here and

952
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,909
interject and say that is absolutely one

953
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,049
of the core principles on handmade hero

954
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:37,340
as well is that it's not so much that

955
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,840
libraries and frameworks and these sorts

956
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,608
of things are bad they may be very

957
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,519
useful to you and they may be important

958
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:45,199
part of your job it's more that it's

959
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,759
very important to learn the fundamentals

960
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,648
and if the fundamentals are already

961
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,760
always being taken care of for you by

962
00:34:48,648 --> 00:34:51,769
one of these frameworks or libraries

963
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,750
then you never get a chance to learn

964
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:55,759
them and so I think it's really

965
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,590
important in any programmers career at

966
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,290
some point to take it upon themselves to

967
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,358
do some low-level work if for no other

968
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:04,039
reason than educational right it doesn't

969
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:06,469
have to be huge but just something I

970
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:09,920
think it makes a huge difference in your

971
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:11,059
skill level as a programmer to gain that

972
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,130
understanding all right

973
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:14,840
sorry for the interruption continuing on

974
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,400
I was also fortunate enough to have met

975
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,050
several like-minded people along the way

976
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,820
with ideas for building plugins and

977
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,410
other applications some are more

978
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,269
fruitful than others but I don't regret

979
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:25,399
taking on any of the opportunities that

980
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:26,869
came my way I ended up working with a

981
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,059
sound designer for a little over a year

982
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:31,760
building audio tools in unity for him to

983
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:33,349
use in the games he worked on unity had

984
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,210
notoriously bad audio support prior to

985
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:37,190
version 5 and still there audio engine

986
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,949
is far from acceptable in my opinion

987
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,780
a couple of other collaborations led to

988
00:35:39,949 --> 00:35:43,848
some iOS apps which then led to my

989
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,829
career my current full-time professional

990
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:47,990
job as an iOS developer at a company

991
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:49,369
looking back I am very happy to have

992
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:51,259
come back around to software development

993
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:52,880
after a little detour to music I feel

994
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,200
much more confident in what I can do as

995
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,780
a programmer than I ever did as a

996
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:58,848
musician I love building things I love

997
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,290
the feeling of solving problems one of

998
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:01,880
the more daunting thing is I found

999
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:03,559
facing me when I got back into software

1000
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,450
development was the sheer vastness of

1001
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:06,739
resources and options so it really

1002
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:08,029
helped to focus on something specific

1003
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:09,559
that I enjoyed and found very

1004
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,380
interesting and that kept me engaged

1005
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:15,019
through the relearning process Cheers

1006
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:18,170
Christian fluent and again that's CFL oh

1007
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:19,699
is AMD on Twitter and again I apologize

1008
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,200
to anyone for mispronouncing the name

1009
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:23,838
most folks did not send into

1010
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,098
pronunciation so I'm probably going to

1011
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:30,710
get some of them wrong and I sincerely

1012
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:35,630
apologize for that upfront okay now

1013
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:38,210
let's go to a special treat I really

1014
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,680
want to thank and personally from

1015
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,480
reading and this is from somebody who I

1016
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:44,568
actually know there in the Seattle area

1017
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,920
his name's max Leon E and it's a really

1018
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:48,529
special treat because this is from

1019
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,539
somebody who is very prominent in

1020
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,880
software development actually as you'll

1021
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:56,000
find out as we go through their story

1022
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,309
and was also very prominent in another

1023
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,159
field and so I feel like it was really

1024
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:03,858
just a really wonderful thing I know

1025
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:05,509
they're very very busy all the time so

1026
00:37:03,858 --> 00:37:07,219
it was a really wonderful for them to

1027
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:09,619
take the time to write in thank you so

1028
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:14,000
much for doing so I imagine a lot of

1029
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:16,010
people will obviously have just a

1030
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,929
tremendous amount to gain from from from

1031
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:21,380
what you have to say so this one's from

1032
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:23,449
Max Leon E and he writes in hi Casey so

1033
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,160
here is my story my name is max Ayane

1034
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:27,139
and I worked at Pixar animation studio

1035
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,639
as the senior lead software engineer for

1036
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:30,920
render man but it was not always like

1037
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,269
this changing career and embracing

1038
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,460
software engineering later in life is

1039
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:36,259
like changing culture or moving to a

1040
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,420
different country I know this because I

1041
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,609
have done both more than once actually

1042
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,559
the change brings both positives and

1043
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:44,150
negatives at the beginning you find

1044
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,489
yourself in a different territory with

1045
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,889
different dynamics establishments laws

1046
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:50,879
and even inside jokes that you don't get

1047
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:52,318
you are mature and have

1048
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,000
lots to offer in other domains of

1049
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:56,130
knowledge but you are just learning how

1050
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,750
to write code and if there is something

1051
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,390
that coders take very seriously it is

1052
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:02,250
the code on the one hand you may find

1053
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:03,900
new truths in there in the other you can

1054
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,088
find yourself in a house of cards and

1055
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,460
unnecessary fabricated reality that your

1056
00:38:06,088 --> 00:38:10,318
colors truly believe in you may buy into

1057
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,329
it or not it is up to you just do not

1058
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:14,759
underestimate the value of the different

1059
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:16,048
perspective you can bring and just

1060
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,730
interject for a second I think that's

1061
00:38:16,048 --> 00:38:20,429
really true one of the probably most

1062
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:22,318
valuable things that a person who's

1063
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:24,449
changed careers can bring to software

1064
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:26,788
development is you've had a career

1065
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:28,679
outside software development right and a

1066
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:30,210
lot of people such as myself who are in

1067
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,399
soft development don't know anything

1068
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:35,099
else and we don't have that kind of

1069
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,509
perspective that people from outside can

1070
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,240
bring and that can be extraordinarily

1071
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:41,818
valuable to a team or to the industry in

1072
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,439
general when someone decides who did

1073
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:45,659
something else for a living

1074
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,970
to come in and sort of bring that

1075
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:50,690
perspective so it is a truly valuable

1076
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:53,389
advice I think to not let that get lost

1077
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:55,798
programmers can be very abrasive

1078
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:57,598
obviously we can be not the nicest

1079
00:38:55,798 --> 00:38:59,909
people that may just kind of go with the

1080
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,579
territory sometimes don't let that

1081
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:05,940
abrasiveness convince you not to show

1082
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:08,278
your experience you know push back on us

1083
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,409
and be like hey you know I think we

1084
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:14,579
could be doing this better share that

1085
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:16,768
insight and don't let people divert you

1086
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,660
from that because that may end up being

1087
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:20,848
one of the most important things you can

1088
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:22,889
bring to the job is a fresh perspective

1089
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:24,960
that really could change the way that

1090
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:27,690
something's being done at the place that

1091
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,108
you end up going to work and I think

1092
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:32,759
that is a really really true thing

1093
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:34,318
continuing with Max's story when I was a

1094
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:36,329
young fellow I liked art science and

1095
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:38,670
technology computers weren't ubiquitous

1096
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:40,470
like today and I couldn't see a career

1097
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,579
in software engineering my first close

1098
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:42,538
encounter of computers was with the

1099
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,700
Commodore 64

1100
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:46,349
I surely punched in a few lines of basic

1101
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:50,159
and played with logo but I did not see

1102
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:52,318
it as a purpose later in my teen years I

1103
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,598
had a coding class of Pascal it was easy

1104
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:56,699
and natural to me but again what would I

1105
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:58,259
use it for it was a bit like mathematics

1106
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:59,969
in high school how many of you have

1107
00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:02,579
asked yourself the question what do I

1108
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:04,469
need this for and I can't inject an I

1109
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:06,930
would add myself to people who asked

1110
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:09,329
question sometime on stream we should

1111
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:10,460
talk about that because it is definitely

1112
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:13,650
true

1113
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,420
moving on in the early 90s I discovered

1114
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,829
computer graphics I started working as a

1115
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,780
cg artist just out of high school

1116
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:20,699
computers were the tools software was

1117
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,290
something that somebody else wrote my

1118
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:24,059
life was made of techniques to define

1119
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:26,279
colors and shapes while I was thinking

1120
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:28,049
about composition and the psychology

1121
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,609
behind it after a few years I got pretty

1122
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,740
good at it up to some point when the

1123
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:33,179
limitations of software I had began to

1124
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:36,209
hold me as an artist

1125
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:38,129
I knew that software engineering was the

1126
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:40,079
mysterious thing that I glimpsed at when

1127
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,760
I was younger I also knew that the

1128
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,019
problems I was facing were presenting

1129
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,330
themselves in the form of software or

1130
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:47,429
the lack thereof I took a step back

1131
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:49,500
bought a C++ book and read it with the

1132
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:51,559
guidance of a friend if I could write

1133
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,869
the suffering he did there was an answer

1134
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:56,940
whether that is a render farm scheduler

1135
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,800
or a new shader or subdivision services

1136
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,200
for my favorite digital content creation

1137
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,609
application if I learn how to code a

1138
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,549
solution my problem I could produce

1139
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:07,409
better art this in contrast to my first

1140
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:10,650
encounter coding this had a clear

1141
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:12,838
purpose I dusted off my math and physics

1142
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,789
and kept studying how to write code

1143
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:16,559
better codes lower level code how to

1144
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:18,358
optimize it how the hardware works

1145
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,349
certainly commercial software was

1146
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:21,389
getting better and better

1147
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:23,010
trumping some of my earlier solutions

1148
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:24,150
but the more I progressed as an artist

1149
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,920
the more I faced different harder

1150
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:28,079
problems this duality of artists

1151
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,909
engineer went on for over a decade I

1152
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,679
have moved between several Studios

1153
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:33,358
mostly working as an artist as a leading

1154
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:34,409
artist as a supervising artist but

1155
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,969
crossing the background was the

1156
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,649
persistence of problems to solve and

1157
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,989
they were getting bigger and bigger as

1158
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:42,088
my level responsibilities was grilling

1159
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:43,889
at some point I realized that what Beth

1160
00:41:42,088 --> 00:41:45,299
I had to offer was not my artistry but

1161
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:47,150
my ability to understand software and

1162
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,339
engineering from an artists perspective

1163
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:53,369
or conversely how to formulate a user

1164
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:55,679
need in terms of engineering during

1165
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:57,358
production of the lego movie we reached

1166
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,289
one of those crisis points that required

1167
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,088
extreme solutions

1168
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:01,259
I left my well-established artistic

1169
00:42:00,088 --> 00:42:03,960
career and started writing software

1170
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,450
full-time I had to create a whole new

1171
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,820
production path tracer renderer for the

1172
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:10,529
movie as soon as that may seem that was

1173
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,960
the only way out and I knew there was no

1174
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:15,540
going back that was my departure so I

1175
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,070
did it I knew exactly what I needed what

1176
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:18,279
my users needed and I could cut through

1177
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,930
the design process

1178
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,980
the solution and save the production

1179
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:25,179
literally and that's the kind of story

1180
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,820
that I kind of feel like it would be

1181
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:29,710
great to hear the whole story of and I

1182
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,390
wonder maybe if max would be willing to

1183
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,090
come on the show at some point and share

1184
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:36,489
with us that story because it sounds

1185
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:37,690
amazing actually but I'll simply

1186
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:39,819
conclude with his final thoughts here

1187
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:41,260
sometimes I miss being an artist

1188
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,000
I miss the rhythm and energy of my

1189
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,740
previous career but to balance that I

1190
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,960
take satisfaction in knowing how my work

1191
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:50,769
is helping many younger Me's to express

1192
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:54,699
themselves through art and again that's

1193
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:57,250
from Maxie Ani it's it's MaxL I a and I

1194
00:42:54,699 --> 00:43:00,460
on Twitter if you want to send a thank

1195
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:01,869
you or follow him thank you so much

1196
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:05,889
again for writing in that was that's

1197
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:08,920
just a wonderful story and I I always

1198
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:12,489
like to hear about people who switch who

1199
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:15,070
you know liked their previous career but

1200
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:17,199
still switch to software development for

1201
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:20,230
some other reason because that's sort of

1202
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:21,460
a separate category people of must write

1203
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,949
a lot of people will switch career to

1204
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,690
sufferers because they found that their

1205
00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:26,980
previous career they didn't like it it

1206
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,260
wasn't for filming us for some other

1207
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:32,619
reason they'll switch over and find

1208
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:34,000
software to be a solution to that but

1209
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:36,130
there's also lots of people who may be

1210
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,380
very good and very satisfied at their

1211
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,730
current job they're not feeling abrasion

1212
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,809
there they're not feeling like they're

1213
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:43,300
doing the wrong thing with their life

1214
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:45,009
but for some reason they see software as

1215
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,440
important and they're like I feel like I

1216
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:49,300
need to go do this other thing

1217
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,530
and so in Max's case it's because he

1218
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,269
just doesn't feel like the tools are

1219
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:55,150
there for what he wanted to do and that

1220
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:56,769
can be a great motivating factor and I

1221
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:58,570
think that's a really important thing to

1222
00:43:56,769 --> 00:44:03,190
embrace so thanks so much max for

1223
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:05,740
sharing that now we get to I absolutely

1224
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:08,679
loved this story because this was one

1225
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:10,000
that I would would have hoped I would

1226
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:12,039
have gotten but wouldn't have expected

1227
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,869
to get and this is from someone who

1228
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:16,179
switched careers from the public sector

1229
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:18,819
into software development specifically

1230
00:44:16,179 --> 00:44:20,559
from the military and the reason I find

1231
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,030
that so important is because there's a

1232
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,719
lot of people who get into the military

1233
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:28,240
in America anyway very young because

1234
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,159
it's actually a career path for for

1235
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,558
young people

1236
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,389
in in the u.s. that a lot of people take

1237
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,220
the option of doing it it's our

1238
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:38,139
government isn't necessarily great at

1239
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:39,518
providing work opportunities for people

1240
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:42,489
it's not something we do particularly

1241
00:44:39,518 --> 00:44:44,618
well just as a country it's not our

1242
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:46,028
strong suit unfortunately but the

1243
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:47,289
military is one place that that can

1244
00:44:46,028 --> 00:44:49,568
happen so there are a lot of young

1245
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:52,240
people who get jobs that way get their

1246
00:44:49,568 --> 00:44:53,739
first jobs that way but being in the

1247
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,149
military isn't necessarily have anything

1248
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:57,308
to do with programming like maybe you

1249
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,480
might get it you know into program a

1250
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:02,019
little bit if that's what you happen to

1251
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,960
be you know designated to do but it's

1252
00:45:02,018 --> 00:45:06,189
probably unlikely and so I was super

1253
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,048
psyched to have someone write in and say

1254
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:10,509
that they had gone that route and came

1255
00:45:08,048 --> 00:45:11,650
around to software development because I

1256
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:13,298
think there's a lot of people out there

1257
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,380
who might be really interested to hear

1258
00:45:13,298 --> 00:45:16,750
this because they might be in the

1259
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:19,028
military or might be considering going

1260
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,528
into the military at a young age and I

1261
00:45:19,028 --> 00:45:22,929
feel like this story could be very very

1262
00:45:20,528 --> 00:45:24,969
relative to them it comes from a fellow

1263
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,288
named Jeremy singleton and thank you so

1264
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:29,618
much for writing this in because this is

1265
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:31,569
a really important one I think he writes

1266
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:33,940
in as requested here is a short version

1267
00:45:31,568 --> 00:45:36,608
of my career switching story I'm 37 I

1268
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,400
got my first job programming at 35 I

1269
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:41,619
joined the Navy back in February of 2001

1270
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,349
I had grand dreams of becoming a Navy

1271
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:46,119
SEAL and tried twice unfortunately I did

1272
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:48,309
not become a Navy SEAL but I did deploy

1273
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,838
and support spec ops as an intelligence

1274
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:52,359
specialist for about eight of my 12

1275
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:54,759
years in the Navy after I separated from

1276
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:56,798
the Navy in 2013 I got a job working as

1277
00:45:54,759 --> 00:45:58,900
a contractor for a special Group within

1278
00:45:56,798 --> 00:46:00,969
the Special Operations Command which is

1279
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,470
abbreviated SOCOM in fact we have a game

1280
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:04,588
series called SOCOM if you're in the

1281
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:06,969
game into gaming you probably played it

1282
00:46:04,588 --> 00:46:08,588
during one of my deployments I got fed

1283
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:10,538
up with the crappy software we had to

1284
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:12,518
use and decided to roll my own this

1285
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:15,069
turned out to set a fire under my ass

1286
00:46:12,518 --> 00:46:16,719
that I couldn't put out eventually SOCOM

1287
00:46:15,068 --> 00:46:18,518
laid off a bunch of us in senior level

1288
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,919
positions and I was forced to find

1289
00:46:18,518 --> 00:46:22,598
another job while I was waiting for my

1290
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,579
clearance to be transferred to a job I

1291
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:26,710
accepted contracting for the CIA I

1292
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:28,420
received a call from a developer at

1293
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,309
computer science corporation they were

1294
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,139
looking for a junior developer to fill a

1295
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:33,630
role at the Office of cybersecurity and

1296
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:35,889
communications in Pensacola Florida

1297
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,750
while I had no professional programming

1298
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:39,639
experience they liked my enthusiasm and

1299
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,528
offered me the job I took it without

1300
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:43,679
hesitation even did the pay was less

1301
00:46:41,528 --> 00:46:45,389
than half of what that ping

1302
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,819
of what the job was paying that I had

1303
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:49,799
accepted previously this was extremely

1304
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:51,269
stressful as I had no clue if I could

1305
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,370
actually do it if I was actually gonna

1306
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:54,960
be good at programming I knew I loved

1307
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:56,759
the idea of programming and I love the

1308
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,079
little personal products I had done but

1309
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,690
actually working in the real world as

1310
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,369
developer was a scary idea even though I

1311
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,110
was able to answer the questions I was

1312
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:06,059
asked during the interview I still felt

1313
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:08,430
like an impostor I was leading the

1314
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:11,159
comfort of SpecOps to support of specop

1315
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:12,929
support to take a job programming it

1316
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:15,059
turned out to be not that big of a deal

1317
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:17,609
switching jobs at all the developers I

1318
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:19,500
worked with at DHS understood that I was

1319
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:21,450
starting from scratch and they were more

1320
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,670
than accommodating actually having

1321
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:26,009
someone jr. around motivated them to do

1322
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,720
more training I did make sure I took

1323
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,910
specific steps to not get in their way

1324
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,919
and to give them reasons to trust me

1325
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:34,109
with certain projects I always made sure

1326
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,420
that I did my own research first before

1327
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:38,130
asking one of them for help and when I

1328
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,230
did ask for help I made sure to explain

1329
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,240
the problem as I understood it and what

1330
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,949
research had done up to that point

1331
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:46,109
nothing is worst than a douchebag that

1332
00:47:43,949 --> 00:47:49,049
asks for help without trying to solve a

1333
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:50,430
problem first that's pretty much it I'm

1334
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,750
now working my second job in the

1335
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:53,609
industry and couldn't be happier

1336
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,110
well I could be happier if I was

1337
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:56,730
creating games for a living but not

1338
00:47:55,110 --> 00:48:00,090
everyone gets their dream dream job

1339
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:03,420
right away and so that that once again

1340
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:05,700
from Jeremy singleton if you know he

1341
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,500
would like a job in the game industry so

1342
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:09,750
I will say anyone out there listening

1343
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,989
who's got a position open if you're

1344
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:16,469
interested if you need his contact

1345
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:17,879
information let me know and hey if you

1346
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:19,769
happen to be someone who works on like a

1347
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,360
military shooter title it might be nice

1348
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:25,019
to have somebody who was actually in

1349
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:26,510
SOCOM and did intelligence support as

1350
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:30,440
one of your programmers on the team

1351
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:32,700
that's that's what I'd say about that

1352
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,829
all right so thank you very much again

1353
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:36,569
Jeremy for writing that one in I really

1354
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:40,529
appreciate it because that's I think a

1355
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:43,950
segment of sort of the career world that

1356
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:45,930
I was not expecting to get any stories

1357
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:47,759
from and I really was kind of hoping

1358
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:50,219
that we would and the fact that you

1359
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,330
wrote one in was awesome and I think

1360
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:55,559
that's going to be really helpful for

1361
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:57,480
people now let's move on to one that's

1362
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:59,009
way outside tech

1363
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,650
because I think these are kind of

1364
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:03,599
interesting stories from from people who

1365
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:06,119
you know sort of the ones we had before

1366
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,640
a lot of them are kind of still inside

1367
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:11,369
the tech window to a certain degree

1368
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,739
right or had sort of brush attack and so

1369
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:16,548
I kind of wanted to move on now to ones

1370
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:19,409
that are very far from that as as a

1371
00:49:16,548 --> 00:49:22,230
starting point and kind of end up in

1372
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:23,399
tech in the end so let's let's go

1373
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,519
through some of those just to see what

1374
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,079
they end up looking like this is I don't

1375
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:29,699
know how to pronounce the names all the

1376
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,920
time so again I apologize this is from

1377
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:34,078
Curtis pop or poppy and metro to

1378
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,409
pronounce it but on Twitter it's cjp

1379
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:40,170
oppe so if you want to give a shout out

1380
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:43,289
or give him a follow that's where to

1381
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,909
look and they were in hey Casey sorry it

1382
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:46,079
took a couple days to write you I wanted

1383
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:47,969
to make sure I took the time to give

1384
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,920
this the thought it deserves I'm sorry

1385
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:52,048
for the novel that follows thank you for

1386
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,700
taking the time to read these responses

1387
00:49:52,048 --> 00:49:55,500
and looking for experiences outside your

1388
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,750
own that's a kindness which seems to be

1389
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,548
rarely seen these days for the last

1390
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,750
seven years I had worked at the same

1391
00:49:59,548 --> 00:50:03,030
restaurant chain and was growing

1392
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,559
increasingly unhappy I was one of those

1393
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,180
people who didn't know what I wanted to

1394
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,589
do coming out of high school and after a

1395
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:09,588
few unfulfilled years going to college

1396
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:11,818
for a pre-med degree I dropped out I

1397
00:50:09,588 --> 00:50:13,679
ended up working for this restaurant

1398
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:15,170
chain and like in my other careers I

1399
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,219
advanced quickly and repeatedly

1400
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:19,289
unfortunately this meant moving further

1401
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:21,088
and further away from family and more

1402
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:22,380
hours in a given week with no additional

1403
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:25,558
compensation than I felt comfortable

1404
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,930
with an average rook week for me for the

1405
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:30,059
last two years I was there was about 40

1406
00:50:27,929 --> 00:50:32,669
I'm sorry about 70 hours with many

1407
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:35,670
closer to 90 and at a salary designed

1408
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:37,440
for 50 nonetheless I was too comfortable

1409
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:39,000
my living situation to up and leave to

1410
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,068
find something more agreeable to me and

1411
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,889
so I enrolled in a tech school program

1412
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:45,750
for web analysis programming it was one

1413
00:50:43,889 --> 00:50:48,058
of the few that I could find and take

1414
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,869
fully online which was necessary to work

1415
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:51,089
into my schedule

1416
00:50:48,869 --> 00:50:52,950
needless to say even at a few classes a

1417
00:50:51,088 --> 00:50:54,630
semester the time it took in addition to

1418
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:56,879
my regular work schedule was quite the

1419
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,349
investment I know it's not easy to

1420
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,608
switch careers especially into a

1421
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:01,710
specialized field like software

1422
00:50:59,608 --> 00:51:02,848
development I thought I would be able to

1423
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:04,470
show my continued excellence in the

1424
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:06,720
field I was in my ability to work

1425
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:08,129
closely with the and lead a team and my

1426
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:09,779
commitment and dedication toward getting

1427
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,690
my degree even with the hours required

1428
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,700
as evidence of my

1429
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:15,550
value to an organization but I was wrong

1430
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:17,199
I live in Wisconsin and as I've said a

1431
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:19,390
priority for me was to move a bit closer

1432
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,980
to my family I know it's not the next

1433
00:51:19,389 --> 00:51:22,420
Silicon Valley or anything but other

1434
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,800
than a few local companies that left the

1435
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,829
majority of my search from the Twin

1436
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,539
Cities or you Claire Wisconsin I began

1437
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:30,550
putting out applications about a year

1438
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:32,858
ago at this time I probably averaged

1439
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:34,210
five a week all with customized cover

1440
00:51:32,858 --> 00:51:35,889
letters and as much research as possible

1441
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:38,108
into the values and culture of the

1442
00:51:35,889 --> 00:51:41,019
company to see if and where I could be a

1443
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:43,119
good fit during this time I wasn't even

1444
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:45,608
able to get an interview to this day I

1445
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,730
never saw a job posting looking for

1446
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:50,170
entry-level developers in my area

1447
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,608
internships were the closest I had seen

1448
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:53,769
and between having recently graduated

1449
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:56,409
and not being able to take the quality

1450
00:51:53,769 --> 00:51:58,630
of life hit I was a hmm quality of life

1451
00:51:56,409 --> 00:52:01,210
hit it require I was unwilling to apply

1452
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:03,190
for such positions in March I finally

1453
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:06,280
decided to leave the position I was at

1454
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:07,599
and dedicate myself full-time to further

1455
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,819
building my already serviceable

1456
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,160
portfolio and job hunting from that

1457
00:52:09,818 --> 00:52:15,250
point on I began putting out at least 15

1458
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,469
resumes per week I was only called back

1459
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:19,088
for two interviews and one can probably

1460
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:22,179
be attributed to kind words from a

1461
00:52:19,088 --> 00:52:24,429
friend of a friend that one was in

1462
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:26,710
person and went well it was for a small

1463
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:28,149
contractor in La Crosse I was told and

1464
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,889
heard later that I was a very strong

1465
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:31,539
candidate but given they were in crunch

1466
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:33,549
time they felt I lack experience and

1467
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:34,000
needed someone who could hit the ground

1468
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,099
running

1469
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,108
the second was a phone interview and

1470
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:40,030
honestly I'm pretty glad I didn't get it

1471
00:52:38,108 --> 00:52:41,500
I don't recall the interviewers title

1472
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:43,089
but he was the leader of the software

1473
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,650
development team and one of his first

1474
00:52:43,088 --> 00:52:46,239
questions was about how many lines of

1475
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:48,430
code the largest program I'd written was

1476
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,439
measuring code quality and lines is a

1477
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:51,549
big red flag but I've worked on some big

1478
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,650
projects so I didn't think it would

1479
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:55,300
affect the outcome negatively when I

1480
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,338
told him about my github profile and the

1481
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,500
products I had on there at the time he

1482
00:52:57,338 --> 00:53:02,049
had never heard of git github or version

1483
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:05,380
control another red flag I never heard

1484
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:07,030
back every other resume or application I

1485
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,068
turned in I either never heard back from

1486
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,869
or received what amounted to and

1487
00:53:09,068 --> 00:53:12,608
automatically generated email thanking

1488
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:14,349
me for applying but telling me I was

1489
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:15,480
rejected because they were looking for

1490
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:17,019
someone with more experience

1491
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,490
unfortunately I don't have any

1492
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:20,139
connections in the industry and in my

1493
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:21,459
experience not having 3 to 5 years

1494
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:22,529
experience doesn't get you in the door

1495
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,329
in my area

1496
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,460
the impressiveness of my portfolio my

1497
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:28,739
dry personality or related experience

1498
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,720
doesn't mean as much as whether I have a

1499
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:32,519
professionally used whether I have

1500
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,869
professionally used X language or

1501
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:35,699
framework for some amount of time

1502
00:53:33,869 --> 00:53:38,039
outside of personal products and

1503
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:39,960
volunteer projects I took a job that I'm

1504
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:41,099
happier with in early October but it's

1505
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,780
still not the one I would have wished

1506
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:44,339
for I'm pleased with the company though

1507
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,190
maybe someday a door will open for them

1508
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,750
into their IT department and another

1509
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:50,010
opportunity will come along I'm not sure

1510
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,929
if I can think of any other information

1511
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:53,760
to offer and it's a bit rambling so I

1512
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:54,839
apologize for that but thank you again

1513
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,400
for your time and I wish I could offer

1514
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:00,750
you a more positive experience

1515
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,610
sincerely Curtis Pape I would actually

1516
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:05,699
say that hearing negative experiences is

1517
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:07,800
actually really good I'm of course sad

1518
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:09,779
to hear that you didn't end up getting

1519
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,990
yet the job that you actually want doing

1520
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:15,180
programming and I hope that someday you

1521
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:16,739
actually will but I think hearing

1522
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:18,569
negative experiences is actually really

1523
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:20,069
important for people because I suspect

1524
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,590
that a lot of people's first experiences

1525
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:24,690
are negative I'm guessing that these

1526
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:26,519
days especially like you said if you're

1527
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,230
in an area that doesn't have a lot of

1528
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:30,179
tech jobs you know if you're in Silicon

1529
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,860
Valley there's so many tech jobs right

1530
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:35,369
people have to hire for these jobs

1531
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:36,630
there's just a lot more pressure to get

1532
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:38,549
people in the door they may be more

1533
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:40,500
willing to accept novices right but in

1534
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:41,910
places where there very few tech jobs I

1535
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,260
feel like it becomes a lot more

1536
00:54:41,909 --> 00:54:44,609
difficult to find those entry-level

1537
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,810
positions they're probably much much

1538
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,820
more difficult to come by would be my

1539
00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:49,349
guess I don't really know again my

1540
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:51,630
experience is very out of date

1541
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:55,139
I'm too old at this point to know much

1542
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:57,300
about that but I shouldn't say too old

1543
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:58,829
because hey if I was switching careers

1544
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,900
right now I wouldn't be too old to be

1545
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:03,480
experiencing exactly this I mean I'm too

1546
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,309
long in the tooth in this industry to

1547
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,570
have sort of a perspective on what it's

1548
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:07,980
like to get into it because when I got

1549
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:11,580
into it it was very different than it

1550
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:13,289
was now so I really value hearing these

1551
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:16,289
negative spaces and really I would love

1552
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:18,869
to just say to everyone who wrote in who

1553
00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:20,820
shared something negative I that's so

1554
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:24,000
valuable because I feel like other

1555
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:27,420
people need to hear that it's hard you

1556
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,789
know they may be facing the same kind of

1557
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,500
trouble getting into the industry and I

1558
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:33,630
don't think it helps anyone to feel like

1559
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,369
they're alone right it doesn't help to

1560
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,150
just hear a bunch of positive stories

1561
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:37,259
hearing

1562
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,880
you know stories is extremely valuable

1563
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,829
because it lets you know that that's

1564
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,750
happening to everyone out there and that

1565
00:55:40,829 --> 00:55:44,880
it's very difficult sometimes to just

1566
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:46,650
get into the industry once you're in it

1567
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,150
it's so much easier because then all

1568
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:50,460
these networking opportunities open up

1569
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:52,048
for you and you can change companies or

1570
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,760
meet people and and move to other

1571
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,288
positions that you might like better or

1572
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,730
whatever else but getting that foot in

1573
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:58,380
the door can be incredibly difficult

1574
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,670
especially if you're in an area that

1575
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:06,210
just doesn't have a lot of tech jobs

1576
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:07,559
right it's just very difficult so thank

1577
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,838
you very much Chris for writing that in

1578
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,269
I really appreciate it I want to follow

1579
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:14,058
that up with letter from Daniel Riley

1580
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:18,269
that's kind of from a similar

1581
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:21,569
perspective which is to say something

1582
00:56:18,269 --> 00:56:23,969
that was not really was not necessarily

1583
00:56:21,568 --> 00:56:25,710
in any kind of a tech really or

1584
00:56:23,969 --> 00:56:28,139
programming related industry but kind of

1585
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:30,568
moved into that so this one's from

1586
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:34,769
Daniel Riley on Twitter it's at D

1587
00:56:30,568 --> 00:56:36,449
underscore K underscore R e I ll Y so

1588
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:41,130
give a follower a shout-out on Twitter

1589
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:42,058
if you want to talk about this story he

1590
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:44,220
writes in hi Casey

1591
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:46,500
I got started fairly late in life as a

1592
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:48,480
programmer I didn't learn to write code

1593
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,829
until I was 27 I sent the majority of

1594
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,630
the time from high school until then

1595
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:52,109
moving around the country working odd

1596
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,059
jobs

1597
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:55,889
I cooked stock shelves bar attended

1598
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:57,690
waiting waited tables worked in

1599
00:56:55,889 --> 00:56:58,920
factories did data entry inspected

1600
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:01,559
electronic components and a few others

1601
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:04,019
I'm sure I'm forgetting at the age of 27

1602
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:05,849
I decided it was time for me to continue

1603
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:07,798
my education I started taking courses at

1604
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:10,048
a local Community College I took intro

1605
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:12,000
to CS in programming 101 learning mostly

1606
00:57:10,048 --> 00:57:13,739
Java after two semesters of this I

1607
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,969
needed to move back home and an old

1608
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:16,500
friend of mine who had been working and

1609
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:18,088
stuff for about ten years contacted me

1610
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,559
he knew I had started my software

1611
00:57:18,088 --> 00:57:21,239
education and wanted to know if I was

1612
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,130
interested an entry-level job to be

1613
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:25,889
honest it was less than entry-level I

1614
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:28,260
had a meeting with his boss and he for

1615
00:57:25,889 --> 00:57:31,288
reasons I still cannot fathom he offered

1616
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:33,299
me a position I accepted during the

1617
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:35,880
first day he sat with me and guided me

1618
00:57:33,298 --> 00:57:37,288
through some things at almost every

1619
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,119
point he would say something or even

1620
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:41,520
worse ask me something that I would have

1621
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,829
no idea what he was talking about I

1622
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:45,480
thought I was doing a miserable job that

1623
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:46,740
would only serve to make everyone's life

1624
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,869
their more difficult than they were

1625
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:49,869
willing to abide I went home feeling

1626
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:51,960
pretty down

1627
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:54,309
and thought I would be let go very soon

1628
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,619
after I shook off the dread I was

1629
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:58,029
feeling I decided to work non-stop to

1630
00:57:56,619 --> 00:58:00,069
become the most valuable member of the

1631
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:01,780
team I could possibly be I read every

1632
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:04,030
book I could find took every online

1633
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,800
course I could and asked every dumb

1634
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:07,720
question Under the Sun to my

1635
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,060
astonishment my co-workers continued to

1636
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:11,709
work with me and mentor me it turns out

1637
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:14,049
they just wanted someone who cared and

1638
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:15,579
was willing to work hard and learn which

1639
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:17,980
is something I continue to try to do to

1640
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:19,719
this day it's been seven years since

1641
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:21,309
then and I can't imagine what my life

1642
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:23,049
would be like without this incredible

1643
00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:25,150
opportunity I never made it back to

1644
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:26,650
college after taking that first job some

1645
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:28,269
might find formal education work great

1646
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:30,700
for them but I found hands-on experience

1647
00:58:28,269 --> 00:58:32,289
was best for me my advice to other

1648
00:58:30,699 --> 00:58:33,969
people in that situation is to accept

1649
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:36,099
that you are learning things much later

1650
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:37,989
than others and that it does not matter

1651
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:39,940
ask questions after you've exhausted

1652
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:41,500
other resources like Google or books if

1653
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:43,000
you show that you are willing to put in

1654
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,599
the effort it's surprising how willing

1655
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,670
others are to help you along the way and

1656
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:50,349
again that's from Danielle Riley I

1657
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,269
apologize guys I don't know how to

1658
00:58:50,349 --> 00:58:53,949
pronounce these names correctly but

1659
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:57,940
that's d underscore candor score Riley

1660
00:58:53,949 --> 00:59:01,469
on Twitter all right thank you so much

1661
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:04,269
for writing that in I think that it's

1662
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:06,579
also good to hear like I was saying but

1663
00:59:04,269 --> 00:59:08,230
from people who feel like they're not

1664
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:09,309
gonna be able to do the job or that they

1665
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:11,170
just don't know what they're doing when

1666
00:59:09,309 --> 00:59:13,239
they go in there but then it turns out

1667
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,800
that they totally can write because that

1668
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:17,919
we've actually talked about the whole

1669
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:20,680
impostor syndrome thing on this handmade

1670
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,300
hero a bunch of times and like I feel

1671
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:24,219
like it's important to attract that

1672
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:26,500
everyone thinks they're not good enough

1673
00:59:24,219 --> 00:59:29,980
right like it's very few people who are

1674
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:31,719
so brash and confident that they're just

1675
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:34,300
gonna be like no no I'm awesome at this

1676
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:36,069
right like everyone is just like wow

1677
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,810
this is really hard especially when

1678
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:40,570
they're first starting out even if they

1679
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:42,279
sound confident that may just be a front

1680
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:44,140
right I know that certainly when I was

1681
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,970
younger getting into it I always tried

1682
00:59:44,139 --> 00:59:47,889
to sound much more confident in fact

1683
00:59:45,969 --> 00:59:52,569
these days I sound a lot less confident

1684
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:54,670
because I feel like I don't have to

1685
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:56,380
appear more ineligible than I am I feel

1686
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:58,030
like it's okay to just ask questions to

1687
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:01,210
be like wait what I didn't understand

1688
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:02,650
what you say they're right because I

1689
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,670
feel like I don't have to prove myself

1690
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,680
in that way anymore

1691
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:08,829
but when you're first starting out you

1692
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:10,449
know it can be really tough and you you

1693
01:00:08,829 --> 01:00:12,700
know that you don't know a lot of the

1694
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:14,289
stuff that you need to know and you may

1695
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:15,598
have a mistaken impression that everyone

1696
01:00:14,289 --> 01:00:17,829
else does even though they really

1697
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,769
oftentimes don't know that much either

1698
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:22,210
you know a lot of us who even who've

1699
01:00:20,769 --> 01:00:23,588
been working in this many many years may

1700
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:25,869
not know a bunch of things that we

1701
01:00:23,588 --> 01:00:27,308
really should know you know it's it's a

1702
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:29,140
vast field then it's difficult to

1703
01:00:27,309 --> 01:00:32,230
remember everything or to be aware of

1704
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:33,940
all of the changes in it and and so yeah

1705
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:35,769
it's really good to hear from people who

1706
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,000
just drive home the point that like when

1707
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:38,139
you start out it's gonna feel really

1708
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,909
uncomfortable you're gonna feel like you

1709
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:42,909
don't know anything that's where

1710
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:44,348
everyone was and honestly it never

1711
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:46,179
really goes away that much there's

1712
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:47,588
always going to be people out there who

1713
01:00:46,179 --> 01:00:50,019
know more than you about whatever a

1714
01:00:47,588 --> 01:00:52,058
particular thing it is and everyone in

1715
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:54,219
programming is just you know trying to

1716
01:00:52,059 --> 01:00:55,630
learn as much as they can to do the best

1717
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:57,519
job that they can on what they're

1718
01:00:55,630 --> 01:01:00,760
working on that's the nature of the

1719
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:03,219
beast there's it's not like a very

1720
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,109
well-defined thing like riding a bicycle

1721
01:01:03,219 --> 01:01:07,029
where you just learn to do it and then

1722
01:01:05,108 --> 01:01:08,739
you can do it it's it's this constant

1723
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,150
process of getting better and this

1724
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:12,939
constant process of there being new

1725
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:15,970
things involved so thank you so much for

1726
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:17,619
writing in let's let's now move to

1727
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:19,750
someone who switched over from

1728
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:21,519
mathematics which I think it's pretty

1729
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:23,048
interesting because it's again it's sort

1730
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:24,460
of a related field but very very

1731
01:01:23,048 --> 01:01:27,730
different in terms of what you might be

1732
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:30,818
doing for a living and this one comes

1733
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:32,980
from Victoria Patriarca I'm sure I'm not

1734
01:01:30,818 --> 01:01:34,389
pronouncing that right either but on

1735
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:39,190
Twitter it's at

1736
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:42,969
Vict PA t RI AR CA so give a shout out

1737
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:44,769
there for this story and here it is hi

1738
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:47,409
KC I started my career after Laurent a

1739
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:50,108
few months ago at 31 years old after a

1740
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:51,940
Masters of Science in mathematics since

1741
01:01:50,108 --> 01:01:53,798
I learned C and C++ in high school more

1742
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,838
than 15 years ago it was not a difficult

1743
01:01:53,798 --> 01:01:56,409
transition I knew that I like to develop

1744
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:59,529
software

1745
01:01:56,409 --> 01:02:01,509
I like algorithms and things that have

1746
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:03,670
to do with complexity and I felt that I

1747
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:05,400
didn't want to continue with a PhD even

1748
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:07,630
if I still adore math and doing research

1749
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,369
moreover my twin brother is a software

1750
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:11,108
developer too since I'm at the beginning

1751
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:13,690
of my career I still have a lot to learn

1752
01:02:11,108 --> 01:02:15,400
and I like to learn in the future I plan

1753
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:16,700
to search for a more research-oriented

1754
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,740
position compared

1755
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:21,049
- the one I have now but for now I am

1756
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:23,299
really satisfied this transition is my

1757
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:25,460
second one in fact before graduating in

1758
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,230
mathematics I graduated in international

1759
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:30,079
relations and I wanted to be a diplomat

1760
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:30,920
that one was much more difficult even if

1761
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,950
I do not regret it

1762
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,750
there were times in which I doubted it

1763
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:37,368
then I think is important to decide on

1764
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:39,320
your own and try to have as much

1765
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:41,720
information as possible what I mean is

1766
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,160
that I like to play games is not a good

1767
01:02:41,719 --> 01:02:45,139
reason to become a software developer

1768
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,670
moreover I think that you don't need to

1769
01:02:45,139 --> 01:02:48,319
change professions to learn one or more

1770
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:49,940
programming languages once you have

1771
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:53,088
spent enough time in front of your ID or

1772
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:54,470
test editor you can decide if you really

1773
01:02:53,088 --> 01:02:56,690
want to become a professional software

1774
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:58,699
developer I'm not the best person to ask

1775
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,349
what you need to know but I think that

1776
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:01,608
if you are not passionate about softer

1777
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:03,380
them and prepared to learn from your

1778
01:03:01,608 --> 01:03:05,420
errors you will never have been able to

1779
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,619
find the job you want I also do not

1780
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,970
suggest you use computer science

1781
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:09,858
curricula as a guide for your

1782
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:11,389
preparation furthermore I think it's

1783
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:13,608
important to focus on your abilities and

1784
01:03:11,389 --> 01:03:16,389
not on other person's hypothetical ones

1785
01:03:13,608 --> 01:03:22,519
best regards Victoria Petrarca again at

1786
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:25,250
Vict PA t RI AR CA on Twitter I love

1787
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:26,900
that one because I love the fact that

1788
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,519
someone went to school to become a

1789
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,780
diplomat and then ended up in software

1790
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:35,568
engineering that's pretty awesome

1791
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:38,540
I think pretty rare um I I don't really

1792
01:03:35,568 --> 01:03:42,349
even know what that career path must be

1793
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:45,050
like in the US I think you must be like

1794
01:03:42,349 --> 01:03:47,210
kind of going to one of the like Ivy

1795
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:49,780
League's or something like you maybe go

1796
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:54,139
to something like Princeton and go to

1797
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:55,609
you know one of their special schools

1798
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:56,838
for politics or something like that I'm

1799
01:03:55,608 --> 01:03:58,730
guessing is something like this which is

1800
01:03:56,838 --> 01:04:00,739
really far away from software as a thing

1801
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:04,159
so anyway thank you so much for writing

1802
01:04:00,739 --> 01:04:07,899
in and sharing that one I'm trying to

1803
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:10,219
give me one quick second I want to see

1804
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:12,800
where we are because I want to break

1805
01:04:10,219 --> 01:04:18,078
about halfway in I was going to break

1806
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:21,500
into two parts so I think yeah okay so

1807
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:25,519
I've got about two more to do here I'm

1808
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:29,449
gonna do these two or maybe three before

1809
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:30,588
stopping okay so now we're gonna hear

1810
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,179
for someone who switched from our

1811
01:04:30,588 --> 01:04:34,778
texture which i think is pretty cool

1812
01:04:32,179 --> 01:04:37,068
because actually architecture and

1813
01:04:34,778 --> 01:04:38,690
software kind of seem a little similar

1814
01:04:37,068 --> 01:04:40,460
to me in sort of their structure even

1815
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:41,929
though obviously the the nuts and bolts

1816
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:45,318
are completely different pun intended I

1817
01:04:41,929 --> 01:04:48,978
suppose and this one's not attributed

1818
01:04:45,318 --> 01:04:49,998
synonymous they write in I switch to

1819
01:04:48,978 --> 01:04:51,889
computer science after studying

1820
01:04:49,998 --> 01:04:54,018
architecture realizing I was really good

1821
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:56,028
at coding and enjoyed it but being put

1822
01:04:54,018 --> 01:04:58,338
off by some really bad advice in the 90s

1823
01:04:56,028 --> 01:05:00,018
when CS took off and I had four years

1824
01:04:58,338 --> 01:05:01,278
working in a paraprofessional field I

1825
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:04,929
tried to get back into it

1826
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:08,028
I did a cert qual which is sort of like

1827
01:05:04,929 --> 01:05:10,848
for those of you don't know in software

1828
01:05:08,028 --> 01:05:13,429
you can get like certified you can you

1829
01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:16,130
can sort of go and take tests or classes

1830
01:05:13,429 --> 01:05:18,679
that certify you in some particular

1831
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:19,759
discipline of software usually it's for

1832
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:22,548
something like you know oh this

1833
01:05:19,759 --> 01:05:24,920
particular framework or web development

1834
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:27,048
thing or like Microsoft ecosystem you

1835
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,759
know something like this I did a circ

1836
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,858
well and had done some coding on my home

1837
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:32,809
computer but struggled to get work went

1838
01:05:30,858 --> 01:05:34,130
back to uni doing nights in a call

1839
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:36,140
centre while studying it was

1840
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:38,960
unbelievably hard compared to the first

1841
01:05:36,139 --> 01:05:41,929
time I went to uni in my teens and I can

1842
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,659
imagine how hard that must be working it

1843
01:05:41,929 --> 01:05:47,210
at a call centre while doing college

1844
01:05:44,659 --> 01:05:49,759
it's hard enough to do college yeah that

1845
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:52,309
sounds rough I came out with great

1846
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:54,619
grades a uni CS job and my fresh degree

1847
01:05:52,309 --> 01:05:57,920
but again struggled to get a job I took

1848
01:05:54,619 --> 01:05:59,809
one with $5,000 pay cut and a short

1849
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,849
probation period after a month they made

1850
01:05:59,809 --> 01:06:04,099
up the five thousand and lifted the

1851
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:06,229
probation three years later I was team

1852
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:07,729
lead then I started getting pulled into

1853
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:09,439
interviews and noticed a lot of sexism

1854
01:06:07,728 --> 01:06:11,478
in the guys after the door had closed on

1855
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,159
candidates many women didn't even get

1856
01:06:11,478 --> 01:06:15,588
considered as they didn't tick all the

1857
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:19,129
acronyms guys would claim that they had

1858
01:06:15,588 --> 01:06:21,018
for example C++ knowledge and still not

1859
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:23,358
know what a pointer a reference was but

1860
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:24,768
they'd get an interview anyway I began

1861
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:27,639
to wonder if that was what happened to

1862
01:06:24,768 --> 01:06:31,308
me but I'll never know

1863
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:33,679
and again that's one's keeping not

1864
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:37,609
attributed for obvious reasons they

1865
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:40,219
probably don't want to say bad things

1866
01:06:37,608 --> 01:06:43,219
about their particular employer having

1867
01:06:40,219 --> 01:06:43,950
sex in there whatever but you do hear

1868
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:46,889
that thing

1869
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:48,989
we frequently and I've never actually

1870
01:06:46,889 --> 01:06:51,239
been a part of the interview process at

1871
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:54,000
a big company so I don't actually know

1872
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:56,848
how that sort of thing works but I do

1873
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,980
think especially in a case where you

1874
01:06:56,849 --> 01:07:01,859
have interview processes that are so

1875
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:03,838
subjective because programming although

1876
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:07,139
programming is ostensibly kind of an

1877
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:10,679
objective thing and we would like it to

1878
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:14,009
be it's really not it's there's a lot of

1879
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:17,549
art to it and I think as a result being

1880
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:19,470
objective about you know candidates in

1881
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:21,900
programming is not really all that

1882
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:26,279
possible and people are a lot worse as

1883
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:28,858
they say so in terms of room for sexism

1884
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:32,040
and racism and just in general prejudice

1885
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:34,078
of any kind to creep into that process I

1886
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:36,059
feel like there's a lot ton of it

1887
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,710
because even though essentially it's

1888
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:40,409
like oh dude how did this person do on

1889
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:43,199
this programming problem might sound and

1890
01:07:40,409 --> 01:07:45,449
like an objective thing it's really not

1891
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:48,328
because like I said earlier in the

1892
01:07:45,449 --> 01:07:52,189
stream those programming problems really

1893
01:07:48,329 --> 01:07:55,318
are poor ways of assessing a candidates

1894
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:58,380
capabilities as a programmer they have a

1895
01:07:55,318 --> 01:08:00,869
lot of sort of psychological things

1896
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:04,230
baked into them that may affect

1897
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:06,750
different people differently and I feel

1898
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:09,440
like really like they're still just a

1899
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:12,150
tremendous tremendous amount of

1900
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:15,000
subjectivity in these kind of interviews

1901
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:18,539
which does create environments where

1902
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,210
it's very easy for people's personal

1903
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:24,000
opinions about groups of people to come

1904
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:25,980
into play in ways that either they are

1905
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,000
not aware of or are aware of and just

1906
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:31,229
don't care either way so it's

1907
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,270
unfortunate but I think it's definitely

1908
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:35,548
true and I do think that it's worth

1909
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:37,400
noting and which is why I think it's

1910
01:08:35,548 --> 01:08:41,670
really great that this person root in

1911
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:44,179
it's worth noting that if you are in a

1912
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:46,289
situation where that might happen that

1913
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:48,210
could easily have been why you didn't

1914
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:50,640
get the job right that could easily have

1915
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:52,770
been why you didn't get the job and I

1916
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,500
really hope that it doesn't discourage

1917
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:57,659
people unnecessarily from contingent

1918
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,569
pursue it because there are places

1919
01:08:57,658 --> 01:09:03,358
that will be fairer if you take more

1920
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:07,139
chances hopefully there will be places

1921
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:08,729
that are not going to be prejudiced

1922
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:11,099
against people and that will give you a

1923
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:14,939
chance and it's definitely a field that

1924
01:09:11,099 --> 01:09:16,199
needs a lot more people in terms of

1925
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:18,029
diversity in it

1926
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:21,798
I think there's been more than enough

1927
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:21,799
information about that sort of thing

1928
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:28,889
talked about in a lot of Spears so I

1929
01:09:26,578 --> 01:09:30,238
won't belabor the point but again thank

1930
01:09:28,889 --> 01:09:33,059
you very much for writing in again

1931
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:35,068
unattributed but thank you so much now

1932
01:09:33,059 --> 01:09:38,069
we'll move on to similar to architecture

1933
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:40,499
civil engineering and this one is not

1934
01:09:38,069 --> 01:09:42,269
rooted by name but they did want me to

1935
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:44,248
give their handle on the hammering

1936
01:09:42,269 --> 01:09:46,619
Network forums it's just the user name

1937
01:09:44,248 --> 01:09:48,599
Brian on there so if you want to give a

1938
01:09:46,618 --> 01:09:49,108
shout out for this one that's the place

1939
01:09:48,599 --> 01:09:52,349
to do it

1940
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:53,819
and Brian writes in I started in civil

1941
01:09:52,349 --> 01:09:55,769
engineering but after dropping out due

1942
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:57,570
to both my health and really a lack of

1943
01:09:55,769 --> 01:09:59,699
interest in the field I worked as a

1944
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:01,768
surveyor for a few years it started as a

1945
01:09:59,698 --> 01:10:03,509
co-op job for school but due to me

1946
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:05,729
failing my last term and finding out

1947
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:08,969
while working I simply continued working

1948
01:10:05,729 --> 01:10:10,650
for a while I was not enjoying the work

1949
01:10:08,969 --> 01:10:13,109
for there was very little ambition at my

1950
01:10:10,649 --> 01:10:15,179
job I wanted to go back to school I

1951
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:16,529
happened to see a commercial for a video

1952
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:17,880
game program at the International

1953
01:10:16,529 --> 01:10:19,768
Academy of Design and Technology in

1954
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,439
Toronto and got excited for all the

1955
01:10:19,769 --> 01:10:25,439
wrong reasons I ended not only going to

1956
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:28,289
school but also not graduated I'm sorry

1957
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:31,829
I ended up not only going to school but

1958
01:10:28,288 --> 01:10:35,550
also graduating sorry my my reading

1959
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:38,188
skills questionable timeframe this would

1960
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:40,860
be July of 2004 I started class and

1961
01:10:38,189 --> 01:10:43,889
graduated December 2005 I'm slightly

1962
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:46,589
younger than you are September 1979 so I

1963
01:10:43,889 --> 01:10:48,569
was turning 25 when I started the school

1964
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:50,668
was okay but really it was just very

1965
01:10:48,569 --> 01:10:51,899
expensive and unfortunately for most of

1966
01:10:50,668 --> 01:10:54,359
the students who managed to get through

1967
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:56,069
it most did not get jobs in industry I

1968
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:58,168
can tell you more about the school if

1969
01:10:56,069 --> 01:10:59,788
you wish but like with everything you

1970
01:10:58,168 --> 01:11:02,309
got out of it what you put into it our

1971
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:03,809
last project sixth and final term which

1972
01:11:02,309 --> 01:11:06,179
for the whole class to make a fighting

1973
01:11:03,809 --> 01:11:08,038
game we made a smash smash brothers type

1974
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:10,109
game with barnyard animals using Ogura

1975
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:10,960
3d for the main engine and rack net for

1976
01:11:10,109 --> 01:11:12,759
the networking

1977
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,680
after graduating I had a really hard

1978
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:18,190
time getting an interview let alone a

1979
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:20,140
job I think I may I've had only a

1980
01:11:18,189 --> 01:11:22,089
handful of interviews before finally

1981
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:25,060
getting a job Electronic Arts as a QA

1982
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:27,489
tester this would have been May of 2007

1983
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:30,700
I was a QA tester for a few titles speed

1984
01:11:27,489 --> 01:11:32,559
for speed fro Street mad in 2009 before

1985
01:11:30,699 --> 01:11:33,729
getting a job as a test engineer on Need

1986
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,310
for Speed undercover

1987
01:11:33,729 --> 01:11:38,199
obviously I'm not an engineer but EA

1988
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:40,510
needs that tends to freely give out

1989
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:42,039
engineer as titles test engineers were

1990
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:44,380
basically software programmers for QA

1991
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:45,789
they would help out both the dev and QA

1992
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:47,230
teams writing simple tools and

1993
01:11:45,789 --> 01:11:47,590
integrating debugging features for the

1994
01:11:47,229 --> 01:11:49,839
team's

1995
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:51,430
over a few years I moved over to build

1996
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,350
engineer positions on skate 3 and need

1997
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:55,030
for speed to run if you're not familiar

1998
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:56,620
with the position remember the drugs

1999
01:11:55,029 --> 01:11:58,979
work you did in episode 1 he's talking

2000
01:11:56,619 --> 01:12:01,449
about handmade hero setting is that

2001
01:11:58,979 --> 01:12:02,799
setting that up for the team or some of

2002
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:04,689
my responsibilities so what he's

2003
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:08,020
referring to as the build engineer it's

2004
01:12:04,689 --> 01:12:10,329
a position on larger teams that's

2005
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:12,310
basically it's a person in charge of

2006
01:12:10,329 --> 01:12:14,559
making sure that projects actually can

2007
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:16,750
be built and this ends up you know it's

2008
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,490
might sound like something that's not

2009
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:21,189
necessary if your only experiences with

2010
01:12:18,489 --> 01:12:24,750
small projects but on big projects

2011
01:12:21,189 --> 01:12:27,279
builds can be incredibly complicated and

2012
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:29,819
Bilgin build engineer is a very common

2013
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:31,899
position actually it's not that rare

2014
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:33,789
because these products can get very

2015
01:12:31,899 --> 01:12:35,500
unwieldy very quickly and it will

2016
01:12:33,789 --> 01:12:37,420
require someone's full time attention to

2017
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:40,600
make sure that they still build believe

2018
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:42,039
me this happens a lot and it's a nun in

2019
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,140
field position because you are dealing

2020
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:47,260
with a lot of very crazy utilities

2021
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:49,329
oftentimes broad class of systems it can

2022
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:53,380
be a pretty tricky job position actually

2023
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:55,029
and so yeah it like I said it's it's not

2024
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,829
an uncommon position and it's a much

2025
01:12:55,029 --> 01:12:59,289
more complicated position than you may

2026
01:12:56,829 --> 01:13:01,720
think it is if your only experience has

2027
01:12:59,289 --> 01:13:05,369
been with small projects builds on large

2028
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:08,680
things get incredibly complicated

2029
01:13:05,369 --> 01:13:09,729
all right in 2011 I was laid off and

2030
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,289
managed to get another build engine

2031
01:13:09,729 --> 01:13:14,199
position at radical entertainment which

2032
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:15,909
is now Activision I was definitely fun

2033
01:13:14,199 --> 01:13:17,199
it was definitely fun but unfortunately

2034
01:13:15,909 --> 01:13:18,369
was laid off again when the game shipped

2035
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,989
April 2012

2036
01:13:18,369 --> 01:13:22,539
sadly the whole studio was laid off a

2037
01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:24,159
few months later on my birthday of 2012

2038
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:24,590
the FIFA Server team reached out to me

2039
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:26,118
in need

2040
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:29,360
build engineer and I join them a few

2041
01:13:26,118 --> 01:13:30,799
weeks later on October 15th 2012 I state

2042
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:33,319
the date for almost four years to the

2043
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,719
date October 14 2016 was my last day

2044
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:37,549
that is where you came in that was the

2045
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:38,689
other email you received about inspiring

2046
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:40,760
me this is an email I sent to me

2047
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:42,589
privately I'm good at what I do but I

2048
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:44,599
want to be better so I quit my job

2049
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:45,920
having nearly 10 years experience hoping

2050
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:48,860
that I could learn as much as I can

2051
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,179
during the time off so I went back so

2052
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:52,399
that when I go back to work I will be

2053
01:13:50,179 --> 01:13:54,408
even better my goal of my time off is

2054
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:56,479
simply to learn and I have a goal of

2055
01:13:54,408 --> 01:13:58,429
making at least one simple game a dream

2056
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,198
would be I am able to make money doing

2057
01:13:58,429 --> 01:14:00,949
that but I do not want to set myself up

2058
01:14:00,198 --> 01:14:03,529
for failure

2059
01:14:00,948 --> 01:14:05,149
anyway at 37 after 9 years working for

2060
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:07,158
large video game companies I've quit my

2061
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:09,799
job to be a better programmer and try

2062
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:12,198
making games from scratch at the moment

2063
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:15,380
I'm writing transcripts of handmade con

2064
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:17,178
2015 which man that sounds like a tough

2065
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,420
job but I think people would really love

2066
01:14:17,179 --> 01:14:19,310
that

2067
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:21,649
but we'll move on after learning as much

2068
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:23,539
as I can from you again that's from

2069
01:14:21,649 --> 01:14:25,098
Brian on the handmade network forums

2070
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:30,250
give him a shout out if you enjoyed that

2071
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:30,250
story and yeah there you go

2072
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:37,908
let me see where we're at here this is

2073
01:14:33,289 --> 01:14:41,630
the last one all right this one comes

2074
01:14:37,908 --> 01:14:47,049
from Jessie Meyer and that is at Jessie

2075
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:51,289
our Meyer J es ser ma ye are on Twitter

2076
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:53,090
and they're at in I thought it would be

2077
01:14:51,289 --> 01:14:55,969
therapeutic to impact my experiences

2078
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:58,190
below is my story after a decade in the

2079
01:14:55,969 --> 01:14:59,750
IT industry I came to realize I hadn't

2080
01:14:58,189 --> 01:15:01,789
the slightest clue how computers worked

2081
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:03,859
I had developed a productive mental

2082
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:05,500
model but an honest probing would reveal

2083
01:15:03,859 --> 01:15:07,819
a fundamental lack of knowledge

2084
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,260
ethically I was making decisions that

2085
01:15:07,819 --> 01:15:11,179
would impact real people based on

2086
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:13,520
knowledge built atop quicksand which was

2087
01:15:11,179 --> 01:15:16,099
unacceptable however this was generally

2088
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,599
acceptable to my colleagues largely I

2089
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:19,460
suspect because their knowledge banks

2090
01:15:17,599 --> 01:15:20,630
suffered from similar deficiencies an

2091
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:22,579
acknowledgement of Computer Basics

2092
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:25,010
ignorance was a violation of our

2093
01:15:22,579 --> 01:15:26,719
self-image as IT specialists so as

2094
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:28,099
victims of cognitive dissidence we just

2095
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,500
told ourselves that basics are not

2096
01:15:28,099 --> 01:15:32,239
necessary confirmation bias would tell

2097
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:34,010
us this is fine because we've been able

2098
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:34,549
to solve our problem so far problem

2099
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:37,190
solved

2100
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:38,239
we are problem solvers after all but I

2101
01:15:37,189 --> 01:15:40,129
wondered

2102
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:41,808
what are these problems what if these

2103
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:44,179
problems are symptomatic of ignorance

2104
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:46,309
how could we detect fundamental problems

2105
01:15:44,179 --> 01:15:47,899
if we did not know the fundamentals have

2106
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:49,400
you been living with deep problems under

2107
01:15:47,899 --> 01:15:51,529
our nose defying detection by

2108
01:15:49,399 --> 01:15:52,939
unintentional acclamation just because

2109
01:15:51,529 --> 01:15:55,788
we are not sensitive does that mean

2110
01:15:52,939 --> 01:15:58,009
they're not there something was off I

2111
01:15:55,788 --> 01:16:01,158
decided to address what I could myself

2112
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:02,570
at age 25 the time when most that age

2113
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:03,888
come rowing out with their diplomas

2114
01:16:02,569 --> 01:16:05,710
prime to tackle the worst problems and

2115
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:08,118
confidence I was suffering from intense

2116
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:09,590
self-inflicted self-doubt and not the

2117
01:16:08,118 --> 01:16:11,808
Honorable Descartes in kind

2118
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:13,369
I felt stupid stupid for giving up

2119
01:16:11,809 --> 01:16:14,929
assessable career so you but for

2120
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:16,069
starting over but worst of all stupid

2121
01:16:14,929 --> 01:16:19,099
for feeling I could make a difference

2122
01:16:16,069 --> 01:16:21,259
the anxiety was incapacitating panic

2123
01:16:19,099 --> 01:16:24,139
attacks hospital visits therapy etc

2124
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:25,610
quarter life crisis my health problems

2125
01:16:24,139 --> 01:16:27,139
prevented me from working full time so I

2126
01:16:25,609 --> 01:16:29,630
picked up a part-time web development

2127
01:16:27,139 --> 01:16:31,248
job requiring no previous experience my

2128
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:32,599
boss was excellent in accommodating for

2129
01:16:31,248 --> 01:16:35,569
my personal problems but also as a

2130
01:16:32,599 --> 01:16:38,179
teacher I was amazed at what we he came

2131
01:16:35,569 --> 01:16:40,308
to me I was amazed at what he knew and

2132
01:16:38,179 --> 01:16:41,569
how proficient he was watching a master

2133
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:43,099
at play is an extremely valuable

2134
01:16:41,569 --> 01:16:45,558
learning environment viewers of handmade

2135
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:46,819
hero will understand the job was sort of

2136
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,800
like a programming trade school

2137
01:16:46,819 --> 01:16:50,448
experience I quickly picked up pragmatic

2138
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,038
web development techniques some of which

2139
01:16:50,448 --> 01:16:54,078
generalized well for leader programming

2140
01:16:52,038 --> 01:16:56,509
tasks which was encouraging but I also

2141
01:16:54,078 --> 01:16:57,679
started experiencing deja vu the nature

2142
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:59,599
of the problems we were facing were

2143
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,078
uncannily similar to the ones I faced in

2144
01:16:59,599 --> 01:17:04,219
IT what boggled my mind were the

2145
01:17:02,078 --> 01:17:06,498
rationalizations used to tolerate poor

2146
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:08,929
solutions in web dev they were the same

2147
01:17:06,498 --> 01:17:11,300
ones I heard in IT there is something

2148
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:14,920
about us that is the problem the problem

2149
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:17,059
I decided was education I'm 28 now I

2150
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,800
studied computer science and mathematics

2151
01:17:17,059 --> 01:17:20,300
at the University of Connecticut my

2152
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,779
academic interest is to explore

2153
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:25,788
mathematical represented note helpful

2154
01:17:23,779 --> 01:17:27,319
metrics in varying contexts in three

2155
01:17:25,788 --> 01:17:28,788
years I went from virtually zero real

2156
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:30,529
program experience for mathematical

2157
01:17:28,788 --> 01:17:32,149
know-how to one of the top performing

2158
01:17:30,529 --> 01:17:34,488
students in my class if that metric is

2159
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:37,399
at all compelling I'm writing my own

2160
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:39,288
game engine a game / engine that's

2161
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:41,238
highly inspired by KC's handmade hero

2162
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:42,920
his circle of friends are also highly

2163
01:17:41,238 --> 01:17:45,468
inspirational to me John Fabi and Shawn

2164
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,998
etc I taught myself the physics and math

2165
01:17:45,469 --> 01:17:48,469
which I had always believed to be poor

2166
01:17:46,998 --> 01:17:50,219
at growing up which I had always

2167
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:52,769
believed I was poor at growing

2168
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:54,059
to implement PBR and HDR rendering

2169
01:17:52,769 --> 01:17:55,949
that's physically based rendering in

2170
01:17:54,059 --> 01:17:57,449
high dynamic range rendering in a

2171
01:17:55,948 --> 01:17:58,738
reasonable optimized speedy render I

2172
01:17:57,448 --> 01:18:00,598
wrote from scratch

2173
01:17:58,738 --> 01:18:02,308
I wake up motivated every day to learn

2174
01:18:00,599 --> 01:18:04,679
or unlearn elements of our software

2175
01:18:02,309 --> 01:18:06,029
operated world shifting careers has been

2176
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:07,469
the most fulfilling choice of my life

2177
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:09,748
but it was also the most costly

2178
01:18:07,469 --> 01:18:12,748
thankfully I didn't accomplish it alone

2179
01:18:09,748 --> 01:18:17,219
I lived with my Uncle Tom who was a

2180
01:18:12,748 --> 01:18:19,019
scholar he's a PhD in forestry from is a

2181
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:21,380
PhD in forestry a master's in computer

2182
01:18:19,019 --> 01:18:24,329
science and a bachelor's in engineering

2183
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:26,279
and he is a Judas at Yukons natural

2184
01:18:24,328 --> 01:18:28,259
resources department when he heard of my

2185
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:30,779
desire to reform my foundations he took

2186
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:32,579
me in as a mentee there is no doubt that

2187
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:34,439
without mentorship I would not have been

2188
01:18:32,578 --> 01:18:36,268
able to unwind from my anxiety ridden

2189
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:38,460
doubt a real case of being wrapped

2190
01:18:36,269 --> 01:18:40,530
around the axle as smoothly as I had

2191
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:42,448
which ultimately turned into a source of

2192
01:18:40,529 --> 01:18:44,130
rejuvenation the very thing that caused

2193
01:18:42,448 --> 01:18:46,018
me anxiety is today the source of

2194
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:47,159
strength I'm not married to the

2195
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:48,570
challenges of my career shifting while

2196
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:50,998
tending to a family will naturally take

2197
01:18:48,569 --> 01:18:52,889
a different path but it can be done my

2198
01:18:50,998 --> 01:18:54,599
twin brother has taken such a path he's

2199
01:18:52,889 --> 01:18:56,849
married and has a daughter from being

2200
01:18:54,599 --> 01:19:00,090
retort rhetorician preacher to a

2201
01:18:56,849 --> 01:19:01,679
historian in the classics and again

2202
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:05,119
that's from Jessie mired that's Jesse R

2203
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:05,118
Meyer Jes s

2204
01:19:05,368 --> 01:19:11,189
Twitter again thank you so much for

2205
01:19:07,828 --> 01:19:12,658
writing in that I will say I am very

2206
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:15,899
interested in the fact that you are

2207
01:19:12,658 --> 01:19:18,899
dedicating academic time to studying API

2208
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:21,328
design I would love to hear more about

2209
01:19:18,899 --> 01:19:25,408
what you find when you start researching

2210
01:19:21,328 --> 01:19:27,988
that I feel like API design is a

2211
01:19:25,408 --> 01:19:29,819
extremely important research topic that

2212
01:19:27,988 --> 01:19:31,649
very few people are actually tackling

2213
01:19:29,819 --> 01:19:33,299
and it is fascinating to hear about

2214
01:19:31,649 --> 01:19:34,679
someone who not only is talking about

2215
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:38,849
but tackling that after switching

2216
01:19:34,679 --> 01:19:41,099
careers later in life that is really

2217
01:19:38,849 --> 01:19:43,979
inspiring and I'm really interested to

2218
01:19:41,099 --> 01:19:45,170
see what happens in your newly chosen

2219
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:48,510
field that sounds really interesting

2220
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:50,819
thank you so much for writing in now

2221
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:52,469
I've come to the end of the ones that

2222
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:54,630
I'm going to read on this session which

2223
01:19:52,469 --> 01:19:57,569
is not to say that at the end of the

2224
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:59,159
ones I actually have I actually have two

2225
01:19:57,569 --> 01:20:02,488
others that I would like to go over but

2226
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:03,909
they were very very long so what I'd

2227
01:20:02,488 --> 01:20:07,869
like to do is stop

2228
01:20:03,909 --> 01:20:11,170
for this session and next week I'd like

2229
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:14,109
to do a second video with these other

2230
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:17,829
ones in it and then I'll have also a

2231
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:20,649
little discussion sort of as a coda to

2232
01:20:17,829 --> 01:20:23,890
it where I'll talk about some of the

2233
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:26,500
themes in here but thank you so much for

2234
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:28,780
joining me for this special edition of

2235
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:31,329
the stream it's been a pleasure reading

2236
01:20:28,779 --> 01:20:34,269
all of these stories and hearing from so

2237
01:20:31,329 --> 01:20:36,579
many folks who took the time to write in

2238
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:39,340
and share very personal details of their

2239
01:20:36,579 --> 01:20:41,409
life their successes their failures how

2240
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:43,750
they were feeling I know that's a very

2241
01:20:41,409 --> 01:20:44,819
difficult thing to do and to put

2242
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:47,199
yourself out there like that

2243
01:20:44,819 --> 01:20:48,729
but I feel like it was incredibly

2244
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:50,679
valuable for people there are a lot of

2245
01:20:48,729 --> 01:20:51,459
folks who will be following in all of

2246
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,260
your footsteps

2247
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:56,409
and I think it will make a really big

2248
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:58,989
difference for them to hear about how

2249
01:20:56,409 --> 01:21:00,760
other people fared and what their

2250
01:20:58,989 --> 01:21:02,319
experiences were like and how it was

2251
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,550
emotionally I think will make a

2252
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:05,289
tremendous difference for people as well

2253
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:07,480
as all of the advice that was in here

2254
01:21:05,289 --> 01:21:10,630
lots of good things for people to think

2255
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:12,069
about in terms of like what the

2256
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:13,960
resources were they turn to how

2257
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:15,369
important it was to have mentor is where

2258
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,810
their first jobs were all these sorts of

2259
01:21:15,369 --> 01:21:19,059
things could be really valuable to

2260
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:21,970
someone so again thanks to everyone who

2261
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:23,770
wrote in it's been tremendously

2262
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:25,390
educational for me and I think will be

2263
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:29,080
very very valuable for other people to

2264
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:31,869
hear these stories I will be back again

2265
01:21:29,079 --> 01:21:34,180
next week with a another stream where

2266
01:21:31,869 --> 01:21:36,729
we'll finish up the material that that

2267
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:39,220
folks have written in and also sort of

2268
01:21:36,729 --> 01:21:41,679
have a discussion about it and I will

2269
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:44,320
also probably try to create a special

2270
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:47,220
forum area again that I'll link at the

2271
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:49,750
bottom of these videos when we post them

2272
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:51,579
that's where people can go to engage

2273
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:53,199
with us more if you're someone who's

2274
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:56,680
interested in switching careers into

2275
01:21:53,199 --> 01:22:00,849
software like the folks who have been in

2276
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:01,780
these in these stories that way there'll

2277
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:03,460
be somewhere to go where you can

2278
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:04,960
continue the discussion or share your

2279
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:06,609
story for someone who's already done it

2280
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,560
and would like to share with other

2281
01:22:06,609 --> 01:22:09,880
people so again thank you so much to

2282
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,610
everyone it's been really educational

2283
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:14,319
for me hearing from everyone about this

2284
01:22:12,609 --> 01:22:17,019

2288
01:22:20,289 --> 01:22:25,390
software development after switching and

2289
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:27,550
for those of you who found it harder or

2290
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:29,170
haven't had success yet I sincerely hope

2291
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:32,140
that you do find success and that you
