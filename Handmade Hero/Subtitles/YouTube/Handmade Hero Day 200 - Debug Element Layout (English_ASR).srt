1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,500
okay hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:08,308
handmade hero sure we could a complete

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:13,888
game live on stream in this particular

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:16,019
case i will say that yeah we're on a

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,368
little bit of a diversion and it's the

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,140
diversion that i decided to take just

7
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,300
because like i said before on the stream

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,760
we won't really get a chance to talk

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,670
very much about you I code in handmade

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,349
hero because it's not a game you know

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,090
it's not a forex game it's not you know

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,579
civilization or something where there's

13
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,079
a lot of you I it's not the sims where

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,579
there's lots of like pop-up menus and

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,200
radial menus and crazy stuff like that

16
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,020
and so I just thought I would do a quick

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,600
detour to sort of talk about those sorts

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,700
of things and give us maybe a little bit

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,439
more debug you I than we would otherwise

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,539
have like if we were just sitting here

21
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,859
going what's the absolute minimal thing

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,020
we could get away with for a debug

23
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,988
display it might be something very genki

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,149
with like you know only like minimal

25
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,339
keyboard controls or maybe we would just

26
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,469
implement just a console and there's no

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,930
overlays and no mouse interaction at all

28
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,239
it's just the types of text and get some

29
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:07,438
printouts or something but I thought it

30
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,478
would be a little more interesting if we

31
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,529
actually kind of went into detail and

32
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:15,150
had sort of more of a like more of a

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,530
like discussion about how user interface

34
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,630
code is implemented and again this is

35
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,728
not meant to be a full explanation of

36
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:22,379
that because implementing user interface

37
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:25,319
like you know a full user interface

38
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,810
library is a big topic and weren't you

39
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,129
know plenty of time on stream to it you

40
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,590
know that would be something that we'd

41
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:33,658
spend you know 100 days on if we wanted

42
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,759
to do like here is the complete UI

43
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,640
library meant to ship like applications

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,319
on and all this other good stuff so I'm

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,969
by no means trying to say that we're

46
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,709
going to cover completely but I just

47
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,030
want to do some things where we kind of

48
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,859
show what's going on and so I'm going to

49
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,349
do some program it's a suit day 200 so

50
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,180
you want to unpack day 1 99 s source

51
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,978
code and I'm just going to continue down

52
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,229
a little bit this sort of path of

53
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,179
pulling things out cleaning things up so

54
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,879
you can kind of see how to make a little

55
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,079
bit of reasonable UI code again if this

56
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,750
is something that you are interested in

57
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:06,089
doing for your code yourself when you

58
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,828
are making your engines or your games or

59
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,200
whatever you're making if you want to

60
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:12,299
add some UI to it or you want to add

61
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,349
debug you I to it as well again that's

62
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,880
just kind of what we're

63
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,590
here so you can remember kind of what we

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,930
did is we started to talk about these

65
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,610
interactions and we sort of pulled out

66
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,170
the code that does these interactions

67
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,400
into something that was a little cleaner

68
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:25,500
and can now be used a little more

69
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,659
generically so we have stuff like oh you

70
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,520
know if you open the profile it's got

71
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,049
like a resize interaction here and we

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,000
didn't have to rewrite that interaction

73
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,920
for here we could just use the same one

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,139
and furthermore we could even constrain

75
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,969
the aspect ratio by just adding one or

76
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,829
two lines of code in the thing that

77
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:43,109
actually draws these guys and so again

78
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,810
what we're kind of doing here right is

79
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,120
we're focusing on how we we can

80
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,890
architect this code for its desired

81
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,200
purpose which is really flexible quick

82
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,059
ability to add new UI things so that as

83
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,409
we want them we can just add them and we

84
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,060
don't have to worry too much it's not

85
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,979
like a big overhead the programmer to

86
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,629
put in new widgets or new tool just like

87
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,399
that so that's really what the focus is

88
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,469
kind of the way that we're architecting

89
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,969
this as we go and that's a pretty good

90
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:07,759
way to go with a debug you I right

91
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,949
because specially with the debug you I

92
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,870
you really don't want to be spending all

93
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:14,669
of your time later on in the game when

94
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,219
you're trying to do something else IE

95
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:19,109
not working on the debug code you know

96
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,939
you want to do the debug UI code and you

97
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,680
want to have it done and then later on

98
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,389
you know if you want to add something

99
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,920
you don't want to be in this situation

100
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,439
where it's going to be this huge

101
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,669
investment of time to go like riorca

102
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,620
tech the code and pull it apart to add

103
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,539
this new widget or whatever you need to

104
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,430
do you want to be able to just really

105
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,739
simply go in and change a few quick

106
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,510
things leverage existing code really

107
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,950
easily and have the new widget that you

108
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:43,139
want it or whatever right and so that's

109
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,989
kind of more like well like I said what

110
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,689
we're talking about here okay and so

111
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,580
what I wanted to look at today since we

112
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,590
kind of obstructed that widget code I

113
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,660
mean the interaction code reasonably

114
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,460
will yesterday there's more we could do

115
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,150
but i think you know like i said it's

116
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,620
not this is not meant to be an entire

117
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,560
you know massive section on you I or

118
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,530
anything I what I would like to do now

119
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,689
is take a look at the actual way that

120
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:14,640
we're doing the drawing of the debug you

121
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:16,230
i right and there's really two things we

122
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,029
can do with this I don't know we can

123
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,170
start with that today or I can push it

124
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,579
off till tomorrow I'm trying to think of

125
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,379
exactly I want to do it because the

126
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,899
other thing that we could do is do the

127
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,978
deep copying of values because the other

128
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,109
thing that I was saying is you know we

129
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:29,029
had this thing where when you

130
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,158
copy something like if I copy the

131
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:32,779
renderer over here and I make another

132
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:36,288
copy of it it does this kind of weird

133
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:39,948
thing that you can see where it like it

134
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:42,339
has kind of because it's just a

135
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,348
referential copy it puts everything

136
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:47,359
exactly as you see it and everything is

137
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:49,188
mirrored completely and we don't really

138
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,530
want that right and we also want the

139
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:53,389
iteration to kind of be locked to just

140
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:55,788
inside its children and they're just a

141
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:58,579
bunch of things that that we are

142
00:04:55,788 --> 00:05:00,649
currently living with for but that way I

143
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:02,688
don't think we would want and so I don't

144
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,068
know how relevant that is to the drawing

145
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:06,590
part of things so i don't know i think

146
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:08,569
i'm a stick with just let's go ahead and

147
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:11,538
make the drawing stuff work properly and

148
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:14,598
go from there okay so so let's let's

149
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:17,750
just take a look at that and we'll see

150
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:20,778
what we can do from there alright so

151
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,098
what I want to do here is I want to take

152
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,079
a look at how we are currently drawing

153
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:26,658
things and I just want to start pulling

154
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,329
it apart in a way that it's not quite so

155
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:31,788
ad hoc right because if you look at how

156
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,649
we are drawing them now I did and again

157
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:35,329
this is what I think you should do this

158
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:37,370
is not like oh we were bad people for

159
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:39,978
doing this way it's just you don't want

160
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,930
to leave it this way what I did was I

161
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:44,568
said like okay inside debug drum menu

162
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,158
here is a for loop and what I will do in

163
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:48,289
this floral loop is I will go through

164
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:50,959
and for everything that I have it's a

165
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:53,088
type that I want to draw i will just go

166
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,848
ahead and put the code in pure that

167
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:57,348
draws it and that's exactly what we did

168
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:58,370
the interactions the first time too but

169
00:05:57,348 --> 00:06:00,319
then you know we went through and said

170
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,538
okay let's make a little type called

171
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,338
debug interaction that can sort of

172
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:05,810
capture what those things are that we

173
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:08,959
want to do so that then we could start

174
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,120
leveraging actual calls to these things

175
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,399
to make it so that they are no longer

176
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,468
totally ad hoc that we can do things

177
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:16,788
like interaction is clot test to see if

178
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:19,158
particular interaction is hot so we can

179
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:20,899
highlight things properly and then we

180
00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:21,949
can just assign the whole interaction to

181
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:24,288
something to make that the hot

182
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:25,579
interaction like we do here and it just

183
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:26,838
kind of makes it again it start spinning

184
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:29,959
up that code and making that code a

185
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:32,180
little bit more reasonable so what I'd

186
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,829
like to do is that same exact thing with

187
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,658
the drawing code and you can see here

188
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:38,389
that I've got the drawing code it's just

189
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:40,430
very very ad hoc right I just kind of

190
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,819
create things like I'm computing minimum

191
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,650
corners maximum corners I'm doing like

192
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:48,680
these sort of putting widgets in the

193
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:50,629
corners of these things and computing

194
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,850
where that is myself and so what I'd

195
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:55,100
like to do is maybe pull that code out

196
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,680
as well so that we can start to think a

197
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,230
little bit more directly about that

198
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,019
right so we can start to have shared

199
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,750
code where we're having sort of like

200
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:07,039
duplicated duplicated code and that way

201
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,879
we can sort of make those things a

202
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,069
little richer and make those things

203
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,409
potentially a little more interesting or

204
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,810
a little more robust by focusing on just

205
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,570
having it in one place and so we can

206
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,280
make sure that place does things well so

207
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:21,170
all I'm going to do here is start by

208
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,539
just again doing the standard kind of

209
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,280
compression oriented programming sort of

210
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,250
thing I'm going to basically try to just

211
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,649
put out here some things like I'm just

212
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,430
kind of a loft up some of these things

213
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:35,599
that we're doing into a function and I'm

214
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,970
just going to see what comes out of it

215
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,040
right so if i look at these two things

216
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,380
here like in particular like the bitmap

217
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,350
display and the counter thread list

218
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,850
right we can kind of see and you know

219
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,610
what even let's let's let's take a look

220
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,530
at this guy here as well right we can

221
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,290
see that a lot of these guys they sort

222
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:56,059
of have this notion of starting at a

223
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,450
particular place and that place is

224
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,910
almost always the same right and in fact

225
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:03,709
we kind of have a situation if you if

226
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,320
you want to look at it where we've

227
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:08,599
really just kind of duplicated totally

228
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,519
willy-nilly some very specific things

229
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,470
that are happening here if we wanted to

230
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,729
change like how the indentation works in

231
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,620
these things we'd have to change it in

232
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,910
all three places right so you can really

233
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,850
see how that code is kind of getting

234
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:22,280
duplicated out there right so I think

235
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,110
the first thing I'd like to do is pull

236
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,149
that out into something that can be

237
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,220
common right so I'm just going to go

238
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:30,519
ahead and start here by saying that okay

239
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:34,100
maybe we've got some of these things

240
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:36,590
like the depth you know and the line

241
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,500
advance maybe I'll just go ahead and

242
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,870
pull those out here so that's when we're

243
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,539
actually working on these separately and

244
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,919
you know maybe this at Y and at least

245
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:49,009
look kind of like good candidates to

246
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:51,129
write maybe like this and I could even

247
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:54,039
if I want to just make that be a nap

248
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:55,840
right so you can kind of see that these

249
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,370
things are being used so I'm just

250
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,560
grabbing them out and putting them here

251
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,940
and so then if I wanted to I could say

252
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,219
that this was you know something like a

253
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,220
layout or something like that right and

254
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,190
I'll take the layout and I'll say that

255
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,540
when i initialize that i'm going to you

256
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,240
know take all of these things that I was

257
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:14,709
doing originally in two variables I'm

258
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,659
just going to bundle them into this

259
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,000
structure so nothing has changed

260
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:22,389
everything is exactly the way that it

261
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,919
originally was but now these are in the

262
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:25,360
structure and the reason that I'm

263
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,949
putting them in the structure is not

264
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,659
because I just want them in a structure

265
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,180
it's because now it's trivial for me to

266
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:33,069
pass that whole state over to another

267
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:35,319
function and so essentially what we're

268
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,600
doing here basically is we're sort of

269
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,040
making our own little version you know

270
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,180
like almost our own little closure we're

271
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,409
basically saying we want get to have

272
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,429
some layout routines these layout

273
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:44,500
routines are going to have to know about

274
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:45,969
this stuff and since it's pretty hard

275
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,519
from you sail I can see that they're

276
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,110
like local functions or something what I

277
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,079
can do instead is just bundle up the

278
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,789
actual local variables into a struct and

279
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,230
have that struck to be something that I

280
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:58,240
can then pass as like the first

281
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,800
parameter to these layer routines so

282
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,980
that they will be able to do the things

283
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,199
that is that they need to do you know

284
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,789
all right so if that is what you know if

285
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,740
that's taken care of then you can start

286
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:10,179
to see how like in here maybe some of

287
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,480
these things can start to be automated

288
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:15,909
right and so right now we have a sort of

289
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,800
an annoying thing where we do this at

290
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:19,959
why get min corner thing that happens

291
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:22,089
right it's kind of the reason that we

292
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,530
did it that way and with the bounds

293
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,780
being the way they are kind of like

294
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:27,579
being processed in here like almost all

295
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:29,319
of that stuff is just because we were

296
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,250
trying to share the advancement code

297
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,960
we're trying to make sure that the

298
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,730
advancement code is the same so you the

299
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,170
bounds would like to flow out but

300
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,399
there's no reason for these bounds to

301
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,599
even ever flow out of these case

302
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,459
statements there's nothing that even

303
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,560
says that there's not multiple bounds

304
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,350
for object potentially but we just were

305
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:46,179
kind of trying to leverage that sort of

306
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,860
single code path in terms of advancement

307
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,659
so now when we think about it we've got

308
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,240
like opportunities now to make that not

309
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:54,429
be a thing so what I'd like to do

310
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,029
instead is start to look at that in a

311
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:57,799
more holistic way

312
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,289
right I'm going to pull the bounds

313
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:03,919
inside for now right I'm going to have

314
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:06,319
it be something like this so I've got

315
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:11,360
these bounds everywhere there in here

316
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:14,540
are going to be local functions here we

317
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,759
go and you even remember it was kind of

318
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,929
a finicky to do the text thing because

319
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,129
of the way we were doing it because we

320
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:21,529
had to like make it come out with the

321
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,730
bounds and all these are the things so

322
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:24,529
you know we actually were kind of

323
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,019
bending over backwards to support that

324
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:29,839
as well so here we are with our oops

325
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:32,629
that was not my intention let's get back

326
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,100
there so you and you can see then we get

327
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:35,929
down to here and we're going to use the

328
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,600
bounds to advance my why and what I

329
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:40,189
would rather do like I said before is I

330
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,340
would rather have something where these

331
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:46,190
guys themselves do a little bit more of

332
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,080
that work right they do a little bit

333
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,250
more of that advancement so maybe you

334
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,120
know just start with something like

335
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,730
let's say we call advance on the layout

336
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,500
something like this now that's not

337
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,810
exactly what I want yet but that's

338
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,220
roughly what I want it to be and I want

339
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:03,469
it to be you know something like this

340
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,779
right so I'm just going to go ahead and

341
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,110
put that in here temporarily again this

342
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:12,019
is just kind of like a very simple sort

343
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,120
of a thing and I think also we can go

344
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:18,529
ahead now and and just do exactly what

345
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:20,690
it was doing which is to get that min so

346
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,370
that that made a matter so if i go ahead

347
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,870
and say ok there's an advanced function

348
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,779
this advanced function takes the layout

349
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:31,490
there's the layout and cure is the

350
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:36,620
bounds oops then what i want to do is

351
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:38,889
take that bounds oops let me get the

352
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,169
minimum of that get the minimum corner

353
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:44,750
and then I'm going to take that why

354
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:46,969
we're just gonna make the layouts at y

355
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,080
equal to that get min corner that's all

356
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,570
we were doing before and that's all

357
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,129
we're going to do now right so now if i

358
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,390
come through here and kind of port this

359
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:54,879
stuff you can see that now I no longer

360
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:56,629
have to do this this assignment

361
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,549
component why is because we're actually

362
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:01,039
just going to take it directly so that's

363
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:02,689
nice as well and so let's go through

364
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,889
cure and now port like all the rest of

365
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,140
the compile errors that we're going to

366
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:08,629
have for having switch this up a bit so

367
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,250
here we've got layout add X right we've

368
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:16,450
got layout

369
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:20,110
oops at top why that's good let's keep

370
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:25,090
going through here we've got another one

371
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:28,560
cure like so we've got the bounds min

372
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:35,830
the spacing why is now in there as well

373
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:39,299
see what else we've got um see here oops

374
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:43,600
that's not a pointer not a pointer

375
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:47,039
really not a point there we go okay the

376
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,519
depth is also part of the layout as well

377
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:55,329
the line advance also part of the layout

378
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:58,240
what else we've got keep on going we

379
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:04,900
have again the line advance we've got

380
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:19,629
the depth and we have let's see let's

381
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:25,409
see here we go and not much more here so

382
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:38,370
there we go layout spacing xbase y at X

383
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:40,419
go and depth my advanced mind advance

384
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,779
nothing particularly interesting nothing

385
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:49,079
to see here just the basic boarding and

386
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:53,049
I think that's about it so now in theory

387
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:58,450
we should be back to the point where

388
00:14:53,049 --> 00:15:00,519
everything is oh yeah you know what this

389
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,379
is a little bit weird because I guess we

390
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,870
never really specified which one of

391
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:07,179
these guys it was going to be so that's

392
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,070
a bit strange we'll probably have to

393
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:11,588
talk about that in a second but that's

394
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,620
fine we can fix that as well let's see

395
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,910
here because that looks like said

396
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,529
actually well I guess I don't have to

397
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:23,029
move it in there

398
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:24,860
there go alright so this should all be

399
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:27,679
the same as it was and it does look that

400
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,980
way right so that all seems pretty

401
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,539
reasonable okay so now what I'm going to

402
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,889
do now that I have this layout structure

403
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:35,719
and everyone's using it I'm just going

404
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:37,759
to go in here and start to pull out

405
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,379
things that are obviously like very do

406
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:44,870
you know sort of duplicated right things

407
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:47,509
that that look like there's just no

408
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,310
really real reason for them to have to

409
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:52,850
be done custom they could be shared

410
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:54,469
right so in this case like when we look

411
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,850
at the counter thread list you can kind

412
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,620
of see that like the dimension is

413
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,590
something that's wrote specified like we

414
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,110
just have the concept of a dimension for

415
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:07,460
this thing and so there really doesn't

416
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:10,610
need to be any particular reason for us

417
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,050
to do this computation here this could

418
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,259
be something that anybody with a

419
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:17,120
dimension could use right so we could do

420
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:19,220
something like all right instead of

421
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,840
having like advanced or whatever this

422
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,149
sort of thing we could just have

423
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,370
something where if you want you can get

424
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:29,689
a rectangle to back where you could just

425
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:31,310
say like you know I don't know if it's

426
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,190
what with the right thing here like

427
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:37,219
insert or place just maybe like place

428
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,720
rectangle or something like that and all

429
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,290
you would do is you'd say like okay

430
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,970
what's the dimension of this thing so I

431
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:45,620
would say something like here's the

432
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,509
dimension of the thing that I want to

433
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,429
place and then you'll just returned to

434
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:51,740
me the rectangle in which i should draw

435
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:55,250
that thing you don't I'm saying

436
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,600
something like that and so we'll start

437
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,070
and again we want to do something we

438
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,810
want to do a little bit more than that

439
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,040
but again we'll just start there again

440
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:03,559
because it's a simple thing that you can

441
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,209
see I can see it in the code and it

442
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:07,009
should be pretty trivial so if we gret

443
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,410
if we place that out you can see we have

444
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:12,949
min corner and Max corner here and we're

445
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:16,699
creating them this way right and then we

446
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:19,400
end up making this sort of rectangle

447
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:21,289
balance thing out of it right so in

448
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,030
order to do that you can see that all of

449
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:25,809
this stuff is stuff that I know about on

450
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:28,490
the layout right I know the layout

451
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,669
various at things and all and all this

452
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,700
sort of thing

453
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,110
right I know all of that and so now all

454
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,420
I really need to do is just make sure

455
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:39,479
that i'm only using the dimension stuff

456
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,730
that gets passed in here like so but

457
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,200
everything else is the same and so what

458
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,089
you can see here is is this is all

459
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,529
calculated for me automatically that's

460
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:48,029
all good we then can make the rectangle

461
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:50,279
min max and we can return that and

462
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:51,569
that's all we would have to do to do the

463
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,019
place rectangle now we can basically

464
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:58,169
replace this code right here by saying

465
00:17:55,019 --> 00:18:02,730
all right I want to make my rectangle

466
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:05,910
tube of the bounds I don't know what

467
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:08,730
size P but that's the location where

468
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:11,450
we're going to do that so sighs p is

469
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:14,549
really just the max quarter min corner

470
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:19,380
of this thing so i guess we would just

471
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:21,779
do like get max corner of the bounds get

472
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,990
min corner of the bounds it's really

473
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:26,549
just that that's the size B so now we

474
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,069
can kind of say like all right all of

475
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:34,859
this stuff does not matter we'll just

476
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:36,629
grab the dimension pass the layout and

477
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:39,509
then all of this stuff just kind of

478
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:42,090
nicely goes away right and all of this

479
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:44,700
stuff just kind of works so in theory

480
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:47,519
now our profile stuff is going through

481
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:52,230
there and should just work and it does

482
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:54,119
so that's nice so that's step one and

483
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,289
now step two would be it would be nice

484
00:18:54,119 --> 00:19:00,029
if we could do the same thing you know

485
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:03,899
just just leverage that same code and

486
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:07,139
you can see here how we have sort of

487
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,480
this bitmap scale notion and what we did

488
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,080
is we sort of corrected the bitmap scale

489
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,180
notion by using this right we connect we

490
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,879
sort of corrected that bitmap display

491
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,340
dim x that stuff but then once we did

492
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,240
that work you know and you can see here

493
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:27,629
actually that min corner like we were

494
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,430
passing it here but we don't care where

495
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,500
it actually was because we were just

496
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,120
getting the dimensions so really this

497
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,160
could have just been complete nonsense

498
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,869
and min corner could have just been

499
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,970
moved down here right there's nothing

500
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:40,919
because all we need to know was the size

501
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,680
of the bitmap we didn't really care

502
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,240
where it was right

503
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,950
so what we can do now is say like all

504
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,720
right after doing just this little

505
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,120
preamble and correcting the size which

506
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,980
we want to do we can now leverage this

507
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,779
code that we pulled out into the layout

508
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,370
routine to have it do the layout for us

509
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:59,200
which is what we want because now again

510
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:00,669
we're reducing that code duplication and

511
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,000
making it so that things are kind of

512
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,769
nicely coherent right and now you can

513
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,990
see is it's going to get that size peak

514
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:10,089
which we can copy from here hopefully

515
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,700
you are getting the same sense that I am

516
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:15,069
about that size P if you're not that's

517
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,769
okay we'll talk about in a second but

518
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:19,779
anyway yet you can then see like okay

519
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:21,819
this guy needs to get the min corner of

520
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:24,339
the bounds in order to draw the bitmap

521
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:26,740
there but then again we've successfully

522
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:30,069
compressed that code which is great so

523
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,809
now this and this are using the same

524
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:35,529
layout routine and that's exactly what

525
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:37,869
we wanted because now again anyone who

526
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:41,079
wants that sort of thing can just make

527
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:43,299
that happen right can just make that

528
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,589
sort of Bounce thing happen really

529
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:46,869
easily for them and they don't really

530
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:52,000
have to do any any work anymore work on

531
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:54,819
it right okay so what I'd like to do now

532
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,740
is I'd like to expand potentially this

533
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:58,919
notion because when we were doing that

534
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,289
like I saw like I can't just pointed out

535
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:04,420
the size box is also the same on both of

536
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:06,250
them so it would be kind of nice if the

537
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,680
layout routines could just do the size

538
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,170
box for us because again then every time

539
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,060
if we want it to go add something that

540
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,250
work the same way the other fees profile

541
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,079
or the bitmap views work if we want to

542
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,670
add those we could just leverage that

543
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:20,439
code right we could make it so that

544
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,759
anyone wants a size box it's free they

545
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,640
just say like oh I wants by the way I

546
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,470
want a size box right and that's what

547
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,880
you want in a good UI system you want to

548
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,009
be really easy for people to just say oh

549
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,270
I wanted to use that thing and it's as

550
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:37,089
easy as possible for them to do so so

551
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:38,619
how do we do that part right so to do

552
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,269
that part what we'd like to do is pull

553
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:44,379
out these things you can see there's the

554
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:46,240
size fee right and let's see where that

555
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,820
that drawing happens right so you can

556
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,200
see it all happening here we've kind of

557
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:54,700
got this apart occurring there like that

558
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,569
and so if you look at it we've got some

559
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,580
things that are that are pretty

560
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:00,589
tricky here right so first of all we

561
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:02,028
know that the size P is related off the

562
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:03,949
bound so that's pretty easy for the

563
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:05,599
layouts us to understand it's pretty

564
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,130
easy for it to know how to draw like

565
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,119
whatever it wants to draw like a you

566
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,980
know whatever it's trying to draw like

567
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:12,109
that little square that's not a big deal

568
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,788
sighs interaction is pretty obvious what

569
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:15,408
it's going to be but you could always

570
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:21,019
override it as well so that's not a big

571
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:23,950
deal but this part is a little trickier

572
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:27,048
it needs to be able to override whatever

573
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,028
happening in this because we want to

574
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:31,069
make sure that these is in rectangle

575
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:34,128
calls don't sort of conflict with each

576
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:36,138
other right if I was to do this then we

577
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:39,109
have sort of a bit of a problem on our

578
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:42,109
hands right because if you look at what

579
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:44,869
occurs when you do that you can kind of

580
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:46,369
see that now the upper part well you

581
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,839
know maybe you can't see that actually

582
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,949
maybe only I can see that because it's

583
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,509
like not going to be clear enough on the

584
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,120
twitch but well you actually know what I

585
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:55,399
can do for you here's what I'll do if I

586
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,778
just make this much bigger and obviously

587
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:59,808
this is ludicrous and you wouldn't want

588
00:22:56,778 --> 00:23:01,759
to do it but it just makes it clearer so

589
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:04,128
if I come in here and open this guy up

590
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,349
again now I've got a giant sized box

591
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:08,538
well you can see that only part of the

592
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:10,459
rectangle works this part works just

593
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:12,710
firing I can grab it but in here it

594
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,659
doesn't work in here it thinks I was

595
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,129
interacting with the circle I'm with the

596
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,169
bitmap itself and it does the tear-off

597
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:20,359
interaction which is what we wanted to

598
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:21,500
do but not when we're right there when

599
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,808
we're right there I should be reacting

600
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,250
with this that is because like the way

601
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:27,319
that we are doing our hip testing right

602
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,509
now is just in order which means that

603
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:31,009
whoever hit test first is the weakest

604
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,210
and whoever hit test last is the

605
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,710
strongest in terms of who gets

606
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,120
preference because it just over rights

607
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:38,629
whatever the earlier head tests were

608
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:41,329
right now we could introduce a z-value

609
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:44,990
or something here if we wanted to sort

610
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:47,148
of sort those but it you know it it

611
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,589
might be you know I don't know if we

612
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:51,609
really want to do something like that is

613
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:54,439
that really necessary you know and so on

614
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:58,339
when we could perhaps just make sure we

615
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,710
architect this thing to you know to tell

616
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:02,599
us essentially whether or not we're

617
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,919
interacting with with what's in that or

618
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,829
whether we're inside that particular

619
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,570
thing so what I was thinking is you know

620
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:10,250
we could do something more along the

621
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:12,619
lines let's just I'm just spit

622
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:15,069
ballin here what if we did something

623
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:20,839
that was more like this where we said

624
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:24,500
Jimmy what if we did something like okay

625
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:29,449
we want to do a rectangle so we do

626
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:35,180
something like begin rectangle you know

627
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:38,029
like this so this is like a this is a

628
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:41,960
layout or well element will just say

629
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:44,960
right and this is going to be our only

630
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:49,299
element really that we have so we'd say

631
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,299
something like you know begin elements

632
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:56,180
rectangle and we pass the dimensions of

633
00:24:52,609 --> 00:25:01,250
that rectangle then we would say you

634
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:08,570
know something like ad size or make

635
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:11,900
sizable or element set sizable make

636
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:14,659
element sizable I don't know the name I

637
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,940
don't I'm not just saying that I

638
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,769
literally just don't know the name so

639
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,740
like I want to make this element sizable

640
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:23,629
you know whatever it is so let's go

641
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,339
ahead and do that and then at the end

642
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:29,930
you just do something like if and

643
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:34,819
element like that and we'll just say

644
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:37,160
that this will return to you you know

645
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:38,899
whether or not you should process your

646
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,730
interaction whether or not you're like

647
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,380
the mouse is going to be something that

648
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,640
you're going to deal with or whether

649
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,340
it's something that was dealt with by

650
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,630
the layout system right so it just kind

651
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:48,919
of lets you know and that way we

652
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,630
wouldn't have to introduce things like

653
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,150
ze or stuff like that which may just

654
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:56,560
over complicate things for no real you

655
00:25:53,150 --> 00:26:00,170
know obvious value if that makes sense

656
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,419
seems pretty reasonable and so if we do

657
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:05,269
something like that then we would end up

658
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,039
being able to abstract presumably all of

659
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:10,269
this stuff away right like all of this

660
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,990
stuff could kind of get sucked up into

661
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,990
this system here

662
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:20,589
that was a little tight go there and so

663
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:22,930
this would start to look pretty nice at

664
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:25,839
that point right we would sort of have

665
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:30,009
this ability to do the layout like this

666
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:32,129
and you know yeah this is just a regular

667
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:34,210
drawing code that we're using to draw

668
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,490
everything we wouldn't need to draw the

669
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:40,150
size box that could be handled up here

670
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:42,759
as well so yeah I think that's pretty

671
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:44,440
good I might say that like maybe we draw

672
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,690
this first so that we have the UI system

673
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,100
control like on top of us but otherwise

674
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,920
you can see this is starting to get like

675
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:53,709
much nicer now and doesn't have all of

676
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,990
this stuff in it and and this guy would

677
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,640
get even simpler right because this guy

678
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,079
doesn't need the size interaction or any

679
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,009
of these things with the size box he

680
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:05,889
just has his draw profile in call right

681
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:08,589
and so he would be even simpler he would

682
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:11,230
just look like this where we do like

683
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:15,549
elements excisable end elements

684
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:19,329
something like that and then here it

685
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:23,139
would just look like this right so I

686
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:25,389
think that's really good I think that's

687
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,550
pretty good so all we would really need

688
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,770
there is a way of saying what the

689
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:31,779
dimensions actually were that we wanted

690
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:33,879
sized now there's a couple of ways we

691
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:37,629
could do that I'm going to go for the

692
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,550
most direct route here I don't know if

693
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,100
it's the best idea but I'm going to do

694
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:44,619
it so when we pass the dimensions I'm

695
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:46,059
going to pass the address and then it

696
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:47,679
will just know when it's sizable it will

697
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:50,829
use the address that was already passed

698
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,509
in this function right so now you can

699
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:58,019
see we're getting like really pretty

700
00:27:52,509 --> 00:28:02,740
simple here for the most part and um

701
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:04,269
yeah well you know what now that I think

702
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,150
about it there is one thing that's a

703
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:09,400
little bit trickier here right which is

704
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:12,009
that we don't know what the bounds are

705
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,410
perhaps until the element is finished so

706
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:18,519
that might make it a little harder in

707
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:21,000
that sense I'm not sure how I feel about

708
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,000
that

709
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:33,170
hmm well let's find out I'm going to go

710
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:35,720
a little further with this because I

711
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,580
can't quite predict what I want so I'm

712
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,799
just going to see how it goes by playing

713
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:41,889
around with it so what I'm going to

714
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:44,329
assume is we have something like this

715
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:47,720
where we just do draw profiling at the

716
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:51,319
end element of bounds like this right

717
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,509
and that's I guess just what I'll do for

718
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:56,240
now and we have make elements sizable

719
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:57,529
there so this all kind of works out and

720
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,559
we have something that looks like this

721
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:02,359
now at that point advanced is no longer

722
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,419
really necessary either because advanced

723
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:09,589
can happen inside here inside where we

724
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:11,480
do our our element stuff so we can also

725
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:14,059
kind of just say that you know the

726
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,519
advancement happens like in here right

727
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:19,609
and so I think we're now down to like

728
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:21,829
some really straightforward stuff so you

729
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:24,139
can kind of see we've got all this stuff

730
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:25,639
compressed pretty tightly there's not

731
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:30,100
very much code that you would have to

732
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:34,970
write and in fact this part right here

733
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:38,689
we could almost also do we could almost

734
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:41,210
let that happen automatically as well we

735
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:45,799
could say something like the default

736
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:51,230
interaction gets passed in here like

737
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:53,990
something like default interaction you

738
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:59,480
know I'm saying and then it would just

739
00:29:53,990 --> 00:30:02,870
look like that right and that's pretty

740
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,659
good too so maybe we'll do it that way

741
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:08,348
as well

742
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:09,820
that that's pretty good I feel like so

743
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:12,638
we just say okay we have a tear

744
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:16,028
interaction here that we're going to do

745
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:18,459
and then we would say you know this sort

746
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:21,519
of thing default interaction is the tear

747
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:26,409
interaction and there's that element

748
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:29,278
again right the bounds min x been why

749
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:34,330
thing minus equals layout spacing wide

750
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:36,249
that should also probably be in here and

751
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:38,228
we should probably just have a way of

752
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:41,528
turning it off I'm guessing so it's

753
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:43,778
probably something like okay you know

754
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:51,519
we're going to add the spacing right

755
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:54,128
here right and then we just do something

756
00:30:51,519 --> 00:31:01,509
where that would be turned off so we do

757
00:30:54,128 --> 00:31:04,748
something like you know if there was

758
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:07,058
some kind of override for the text so I

759
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:09,519
think that looks pretty good to me that

760
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:10,808
seems like the right thing again this

761
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,210
guy's code is a little more complicated

762
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:16,239
just because he's doing more unique

763
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:17,848
stuff right but it seems pretty good

764
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:20,950
again it's simplifying quite a bit and

765
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:23,888
so then here I think we have roughly the

766
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:26,098
same thing happening we're getting the

767
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:28,769
text size that can happen at any time

768
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:31,720
and then we're sort of doing a bunch of

769
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:33,970
fussing here with these things here is

770
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:39,159
obviously our height like we know what

771
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:47,079
the height is and our width is just

772
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:49,539
going to be excuse me our width is just

773
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:51,148
going to be the text bounds with so I

774
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:54,878
feel like you know we could probably

775
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:59,288
duplicate this pretty easily by just

776
00:31:54,878 --> 00:32:01,478
doing like you know let's see here do

777
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:04,419
this exact same code if we were going to

778
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:06,729
phrase it in this exact way right we

779
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:10,509
would just do something like okay begin

780
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:14,278
an element the v2 for this guy this is

781
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:17,289
the dimensions right the v2 for this guy

782
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:21,670
is going to be

783
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:24,759
the text bounds get width text bounds

784
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:28,860
and then whatever the layout line

785
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:31,390
advance is right something like this and

786
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:36,339
so this stuff can kind of go away I

787
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:39,420
think the debug text out that's going to

788
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:42,339
be whatever the the bounds come back as

789
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:45,100
right and all I can also this item

790
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:46,769
interaction is the default interaction

791
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:50,829
as well so all that stuff goes away

792
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:53,109
right and so looking at this stuff well

793
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:57,939
I've got left PX that's just going to be

794
00:32:53,109 --> 00:33:01,179
the get min corner right that's just

795
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:07,230
going to be whatever my element bounds

796
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:10,090
are after it's finished and then the top

797
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:12,279
where we do the get starting baseline

798
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:15,579
thing I believe that's just going to be

799
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:18,250
so get the max corner why and then we're

800
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:20,169
doing this sort of like offset to align

801
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:22,509
the font properly to align where that's

802
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:27,420
going to be baseline wise but then this

803
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:34,599
goes away as well you know so i think

804
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:36,850
that's relatively clean again like seems

805
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:38,799
all pretty straightforward i like the

806
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:40,569
look of it it's pretty reasonable and

807
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,129
now all of these guys are going through

808
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:43,750
the same path so let's go ahead and see

809
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:50,350
what it looks like if we just implement

810
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:53,950
those exactly as they are all right so

811
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:58,029
what would I do there I would go ahead

812
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:59,140
and say we have these functions and I

813
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:02,349
think those are actually the only

814
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:04,150
functions that we have right so we've

815
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:06,429
have like a function here that rude

816
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:09,639
turns a layout elements called begin

817
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:12,010
element rectangle right and it takes a

818
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,069
layout and it takes a pointer to the

819
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:21,730
dimensions of that rectangle we then

820
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:24,190
have a layout elements here where we say

821
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:26,860
that we want it to be sizable and that

822
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:29,650
would add the size box to it we then

823
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,250
have a way of setting its default

824
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:34,630
interaction

825
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:39,340
and that is just going to be a debug

826
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:41,650
interaction and finally we have a way of

827
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:44,230
ending it saying that we were done with

828
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:48,760
all of the specification that we wanted

829
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:51,130
to to have so I think that's all good

830
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,230
the way that this is working now we can

831
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:56,670
kind of just do with this all in line at

832
00:34:53,230 --> 00:35:02,949
the moment so I feel like that's

833
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:05,200
probably good enough so I'm just going

834
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:07,629
to go ahead and do it all in line you

835
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:10,679
could defer this stuff to the end so

836
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:12,820
that when you call end element you do it

837
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:14,829
trying to think if that makes sense it

838
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:21,039
probably does let's go ahead and say

839
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:27,250
that does so here is like a b2 to be v2

840
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:29,259
dim there this will be the size quainter

841
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:32,170
as well there will have the layout

842
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:36,610
itself in here just putting these

843
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:39,639
together here eh this probably wants to

844
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:41,440
be in there as well and all this is

845
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:43,719
really doing is naming a bunch of stuff

846
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,039
and and storing it around so that it can

847
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:46,959
be done in sort of that piece male

848
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,119
fashion so that people can kind of

849
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:54,730
construct the UI elements they want and

850
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:57,460
get it right so yeah I think that's all

851
00:35:54,730 --> 00:36:00,039
good I feel like that all makes

852
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:02,110
relatively good sense so let's just go

853
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:05,110
ahead and implement that when I do begin

854
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:06,670
element rectangle what I'm going to do

855
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:09,269
here oh and then of course we have some

856
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,269
out params

857
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:21,329
which was like the rectangle to which

858
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:23,309
are the bounds so what I want to do now

859
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:25,259
is I want to make it so that basically

860
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:28,019
when you call end element that puts

861
00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:30,769
everything together so essentially like

862
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:34,588
all of the stuff that we were doing here

863
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:40,378
so place rectangle essentially all of

864
00:36:34,588 --> 00:36:43,438
this stuff is going to happen here like

865
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:46,048
everything right so the default

866
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:47,878
interaction thing is just going to go

867
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:49,858
ahead and set the element interaction to

868
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:51,568
interaction the make element sizable is

869
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:53,759
just going to set the size pointer to be

870
00:36:51,568 --> 00:36:58,108
the same as the dim pointer and the

871
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:59,128
element dim I'm sorry the the begin

872
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:02,128
element layout is just going to

873
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:05,938
initialize these things to reasonable

874
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:11,699
values right so the layout equals the

875
00:37:05,938 --> 00:37:13,528
layout the gym equals the dim size is

876
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:20,608
null the interactions know the bounds

877
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:22,228
are no that's it so once all those are

878
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:25,648
set then when we get down to the end

879
00:37:22,228 --> 00:37:28,798
here we now need to figure out how big

880
00:37:25,648 --> 00:37:30,058
this thing is supposed to be right so

881
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:33,028
the first thing that I would say we want

882
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:37,528
to do is like we want to create like the

883
00:37:33,028 --> 00:37:39,028
total dim of this thing and the total

884
00:37:37,528 --> 00:37:41,148
dim is obviously going to be whatever

885
00:37:39,028 --> 00:37:44,548
dimension that they actually asked for

886
00:37:41,148 --> 00:37:46,798
but now like maybe like we say if you

887
00:37:44,548 --> 00:37:50,128
want a size the thing right you want to

888
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:52,739
change the things sighs maybe we want to

889
00:37:50,128 --> 00:37:55,828
put like a sizing frame around it right

890
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:57,478
a be a little bit more like a

891
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:59,639
traditional thing where there's you know

892
00:37:57,478 --> 00:38:01,498
you can grab any corner of it or

893
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,689
something like that and pull it out or I

894
00:38:01,498 --> 00:38:05,218
don't know right it doesn't even make

895
00:38:03,688 --> 00:38:06,688
any sense to say that really so I

896
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:09,048
suppose I don't even know why I'm saying

897
00:38:06,688 --> 00:38:12,328
it but let's just go ahead and pretend

898
00:38:09,048 --> 00:38:14,548
that you can do that and so we're going

899
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:16,019
to do that all right so we have one of

900
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:19,228
these elements we said that we're going

901
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:21,448
to make it sizable and so what I'd like

902
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:24,298
to do is take the total dimension and I

903
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:26,099
just want to expand that dimension for

904
00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:29,369
by however big I want sort of

905
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:31,470
that size boxes hit area so if I take a

906
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:34,349
look at the map I think we might I don't

907
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:38,759
know if we have a grow or a big house

908
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:41,479
key some in here let's see if we do

909
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:46,858
doesn't look like we do I thought we did

910
00:38:41,478 --> 00:38:50,460
there we go ad radius to write so I'd

911
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:51,719
like to do is take the total dim and the

912
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,409
total dim welcomes are going to do it in

913
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:58,588
line here it's just add radius to

914
00:38:54,409 --> 00:39:01,440
whatever that actual dim was and this v2

915
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:03,989
is going to be like the frame you know

916
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:09,479
it's like the chrome of this thing and

917
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:10,588
we'll start out at 0-0 but if the saw if

918
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:12,419
we have like a thing that we're trying

919
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:15,748
to make you late for the size will take

920
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:19,710
the frame and we'll make that be like a

921
00:39:15,748 --> 00:39:24,088
you know sighs handle width or something

922
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:28,769
with that frame size angle pixels she'll

923
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:30,778
do with that right and so we can just

924
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,268
say ok there's you know sighs handle it

925
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:35,880
sits for pixels wide or something like

926
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:40,018
that so we're going to add that like

927
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:44,278
around sort of the outside of the thing

928
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:47,758
right and then we now have the actual

929
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:50,460
dimensions of the entire frame which is

930
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:52,498
again bigger than the dimensions of the

931
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,818
thing that we're actually going to

932
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:55,649
return to the user we're going to tell

933
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:59,130
the user that the thing is like the the

934
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,318
inset of that the original dim ok so

935
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:05,278
then we're going to produce the min and

936
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:06,449
Max corner of the like of the total and

937
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,940
the minute max corner like we're based

938
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:10,379
going to produce these rectangles right

939
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:16,200
so I'm going to start by saying like

940
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:20,430
okay maybe maybe we've got a like total

941
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:24,179
min corner and total max corner and then

942
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:26,068
we have a yeah and then we and then we

943
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:29,338
have the sort of the inset one as well

944
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:31,558
so we know that this is actually this is

945
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:35,429
all actually correct right this is

946
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:37,430
actually the corners of these things but

947
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:39,179
the depart where we subtract the dim

948
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:41,009
instead of of you

949
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:43,348
using just the interior dim we want to

950
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,569
use the total dim here and then

951
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:47,789
similarly for the max corner we want to

952
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,259
use the total damn for the width I think

953
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:52,639
we had about 20 minutes on the clock so

954
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:56,700
I'm going to go to about 6 15 or so 620

955
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:58,618
all right so we did that then we know

956
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:00,419
that if we want to create the regular

957
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:04,890
min corner and the regular max corner

958
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:06,210
like you you know I guess client is

959
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:08,789
usually what's called like in windows

960
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:13,429
for example i don't know i call it the

961
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:17,699
interior maybe the interior min corner

962
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:21,058
is going to be the total is going to be

963
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:24,659
the total min coroner offset by whatever

964
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:26,670
that radius difference is right so if we

965
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:28,949
add the frame to the total min corner

966
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,450
well i guess we have to technically do

967
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:32,848
since it's kind of annoying because of

968
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:33,838
the way that we've built things no I

969
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:36,180
guess that's right you just add the

970
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:38,130
frame you're done right so that's total

971
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:39,719
min corner the interior max corner is

972
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,769
just going to be the min corner plus the

973
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:47,159
actual dim right whatever that dim

974
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:54,239
whatever that dim is and the actual dim

975
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:56,429
is just the element dim like this I feel

976
00:41:54,239 --> 00:42:00,659
like that's what we would need to do

977
00:41:56,429 --> 00:42:03,328
there that seems right I feel like this

978
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:05,818
part the total max corner again can just

979
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:07,530
just be the total min corner plus the

980
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:09,058
total damn that's just the definition of

981
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:12,690
it so we can just save ourselves some

982
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:15,329
time there and that all looks about

983
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:18,690
right to me so now we have both of these

984
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:20,789
things so we can produce anything that

985
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:22,500
we want now we can have the total bounds

986
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:24,420
and that's just the total min corner and

987
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,130
the total max corner we can also have

988
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,809
the elements bounds that we're going to

989
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:30,630
return to the user we now know what that

990
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:32,400
is as well right we have the interior

991
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:39,720
min corner and the interior max corner

992
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:42,088
like that and in here we can we can now

993
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:45,989
use those to produce exactly what we

994
00:42:42,088 --> 00:42:47,460
want our size stuff and our our thing

995
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:48,959
that we return and we can do all of our

996
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,500
size checking and everything else that

997
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,610
we want to do

998
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:56,429
so in here this is the code that does

999
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:57,960
the advancement of the app why and so I

1000
00:42:56,429 --> 00:43:00,119
think what I'll probably do is push that

1001
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:07,409
all the way to the end and the way that

1002
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:08,880
will do that I guess the way that will

1003
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:13,049
do that is will say whatever the min

1004
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,640
corner is of the total bounds we want to

1005
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,890
do that and then we want to advance by

1006
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,329
the spacing right so I think that's just

1007
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:19,650
about correct and then we need to sort

1008
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:21,750
of do that special case for the text

1009
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,400
there where we have somebody who's

1010
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,829
telling us what the spacing between two

1011
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,050
lines of text should be which is

1012
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:31,049
different you know then when we're

1013
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:36,289
putting rectangles together so in here

1014
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:40,380
when we do the rest of the stuff okay me

1015
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:43,409
when we've got the size box that has to

1016
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:46,650
come in there this is the code for

1017
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:48,629
putting that size box in place for now I

1018
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,000
guess what we'll do is we'll just draw

1019
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:54,000
sort of that total balance as like a

1020
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,650
maybe like a black border thing and then

1021
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,989
we'll put a little thing in the corner

1022
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,910
of it well no because we went allowed to

1023
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:01,559
be see-through so what I'll actually

1024
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:04,829
just go ahead and draw the whole border

1025
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:08,059
of the thing right so to draw the border

1026
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:13,590
of the thing what we'd like to do is is

1027
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:15,960
first I'll just draw the upper trying to

1028
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,250
think can we even just well I'll just

1029
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,210
I'll just draw each individual part

1030
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,710
because I think we're probably going to

1031
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,929
want to make this a little bit fancier

1032
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:23,490
in a second here so drawing each

1033
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:27,089
individual part you know we know we have

1034
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:29,519
to put a rectangle here right something

1035
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:31,530
like this and then we know that we need

1036
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:32,789
to pass whatever we want the color to be

1037
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,350
for now I'm just going to pass anything

1038
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:37,079
that's not the size box portion of it

1039
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:42,119
I'm just going to pass black just for

1040
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:43,799
now then the size box will have a

1041
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:46,440
separate thing will treat the size box

1042
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,140
exactly the same way as we were doing

1043
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:53,670
before so fierce that size box code the

1044
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:55,259
size P never actually gets used except

1045
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,090
in the size box there so I'm just going

1046
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,460
to say will create the size box we have

1047
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:01,410
the size interaction we know everything

1048
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,179
that that's going to be and we know

1049
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:05,608
exactly

1050
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:07,649
as well who it's going to modify because

1051
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:10,170
they pass that into us so everything

1052
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:13,800
else here I think can just totally work

1053
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:15,630
right and I feel like end elements is

1054
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,890
doing the work should probably also take

1055
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,838
the debug state so it can do

1056
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:21,299
modifications to it although i don't

1057
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:22,710
know maybe everyone wants that so maybe

1058
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,680
really that should just be something

1059
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:27,568
that gets put in here again these are

1060
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,399
going to be on like sort of in the

1061
00:45:27,568 --> 00:45:31,469
compilers purview to like eliminate and

1062
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,690
simplify I think for the most case so i

1063
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:35,429
don't i'm not too worried about like

1064
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,480
sort of storing extra pointers and doing

1065
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:38,159
stuff here because they're just kind of

1066
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,710
temporary variables and that's all they

1067
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:43,588
really do all right so there we go with

1068
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:46,858
the with the debug state that all looks

1069
00:45:43,588 --> 00:45:48,389
good to me so in here i can also pull

1070
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:51,269
that out right i could say that the

1071
00:45:48,389 --> 00:45:54,920
debug state equals the element debug

1072
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:58,739
state and i could say that's layout

1073
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:05,970
close to home now that's just like

1074
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:07,289
convenience okay so i think that's all

1075
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:11,429
good so I just have to finish this stuff

1076
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:13,829
up here so the size box is the only

1077
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:17,098
thing that we don't have here I'm going

1078
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:20,818
to make the size box be a rectangle min

1079
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:22,980
max actually and the way that that's

1080
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:26,489
going to go is I'm going to have the

1081
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,559
rectangle min max go from the get I kind

1082
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:31,379
of want it to be you know that that

1083
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:36,180
lower corner of the thing so I want it

1084
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:37,829
to be the get min corner of the well

1085
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:39,779
this is that annoying thing that's it's

1086
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:43,019
not quite the min it's like the min-max

1087
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,910
corner so I have to actually create the

1088
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:48,449
v2s to pick out the thing that I want

1089
00:46:44,909 --> 00:46:52,279
which is kind of annoying but oh well so

1090
00:46:48,449 --> 00:46:56,129
we want the max corner of the Interior

1091
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:59,480
right bounds and I guess you know what I

1092
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:06,150
already have that I know its interior a

1093
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:09,510
max corner I want that X and the y I

1094
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:13,170
want the interior max corner y as well

1095
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:15,690
right or I know sorry VIN corner because

1096
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,920
i want that lower one and then I want

1097
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:21,000
the interior

1098
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:23,639
sorry the total max corner X for the

1099
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,650
width and I mean for the place to go out

1100
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:27,650
to and I want the interior min corner

1101
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:31,679
equivalent as well for the for the total

1102
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,899
so I'm just kind of drawing from the

1103
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:34,949
from the from the interior to the

1104
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,170
exterior so that's just that little

1105
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:39,269
corner piece so that's the part that

1106
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,190
will do for the size box for now and

1107
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:43,110
then for this guy I just want to do

1108
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:46,619
again essentially that exact same thing

1109
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:48,900
I'm going to sort of hand code here the

1110
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:50,969
rectangles that would give us a border

1111
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,380
around the thing and then we'll kind of

1112
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:57,259
look at doing something maybe a little

1113
00:47:52,380 --> 00:48:01,980
bit fancier in a second so all right I

1114
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:05,820
got to draw four edges so i'll start by

1115
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:07,320
drawing the left edge and i'll draw the

1116
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:10,500
left edge i'm going to draw it without

1117
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:12,300
the corners in place for the moment and

1118
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,449
there's a rhyme or reason for that but

1119
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,710
we'll talk about in a second so i want

1120
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:19,669
to draw it without the corner so i want

1121
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:23,039
to do is the width at sort of the the

1122
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:28,680
interior min corner right and the end

1123
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:30,090
the total min corner let those in the

1124
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:32,669
wrong order their total min corner

1125
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:35,280
pyramid corner sort of form the min and

1126
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:37,619
Max that I'm drawing 2x wise and then

1127
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:44,070
the Y is just going to be the the

1128
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:45,569
minimum Y obviously right would be you

1129
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:50,970
know as realized these two are backwards

1130
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:54,800
to aren't that right this this is going

1131
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:57,209
to be greater than this always right so

1132
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:00,660
this these are these are the minimums

1133
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:03,510
here and these are the maximums so

1134
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:05,099
anyway I'm going to start at that Tobin

1135
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:07,470
corner going to go to the max winter for

1136
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:09,690
X and then in why I'm going to do

1137
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:11,399
essentially the same thing right I'm

1138
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:16,980
going to I'm going to just pick out I

1139
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:21,059
want to go from the the the interior min

1140
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:23,429
corners why up to the interior max

1141
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:27,360
corners why so just spanning that entire

1142
00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:29,460
interior length right and I can just do

1143
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,390
that exact same thing on the other side

1144
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,380
so

1145
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:42,328
so if I want to do the interior max

1146
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:47,220
corner to the total max corner right I

1147
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:49,380
can do sort of the yeah that was a big

1148
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:50,818
mistake as well I can do the outside one

1149
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,010
so that's the left edge on the right

1150
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:55,980
edge and then I can do the top and the

1151
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:58,109
bottom here in exactly the same way

1152
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,789
right in fact you could almost it

1153
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:01,980
probably just copy exactly what I did

1154
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:06,329
like here so it's going to be interior

1155
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:07,980
oh well but because we're going upside

1156
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:09,329
down left to right I don't know it's a

1157
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,659
little bit flipped around but either way

1158
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:17,420
so for here I want to be able to start

1159
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:22,828
probably at the total min corner why and

1160
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:25,108
go up to the interior min corner why and

1161
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:27,630
for the X i want to start from that

1162
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:29,969
interior min corner X I want to go all

1163
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:33,390
the way to the interior Mac Mac's corner

1164
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:34,980
X right so that's again exact the same

1165
00:50:33,389 --> 00:50:37,318
thing here and that can be duplicated

1166
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,539
because this part is the same and now

1167
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:41,880
it's just going to be these two guys are

1168
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:44,519
going to be slightly different right

1169
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:48,349
you're going to start at that interior

1170
00:50:44,518 --> 00:50:51,229
max corner and go to the total maximum

1171
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:55,680
so that will draw all those rectangles

1172
00:50:51,230 --> 00:51:00,588
let's take a look here there's steak

1173
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,588
there epub state

1174
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:08,798
let's see what else we got ad radius two

1175
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:11,318
electrodes can convert all advertised

1176
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:15,759
idries to rectangle to v2 is that not

1177
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:17,889
what we had with a V 2 and 0 oh right

1178
00:51:15,759 --> 00:51:20,708
that's actually just a dim so we don't

1179
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:24,118
need to do is add radius to at all just

1180
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:30,268
add a to the dimension 2 times the thing

1181
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:34,509
that's that's pretty easy so that's good

1182
00:51:30,268 --> 00:51:37,238
so there you go easier than thought it's

1183
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:40,389
going to be so then this guy the size

1184
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:43,349
interaction needs to be part of this

1185
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:46,868
used to be defined first that's all fine

1186
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:48,669
the mouse p we don't know and so the

1187
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:51,130
mouse p also would have to be something

1188
00:51:48,668 --> 00:51:56,168
that kind of comes in here that's a

1189
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:58,630
little annoying and we probably want to

1190
00:51:56,168 --> 00:52:01,958
actually fix that in a slightly separate

1191
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:03,400
way so we'll take a look like that well

1192
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:05,608
you know what actually we can fix it

1193
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,259
right now that would just go in here

1194
00:52:05,608 --> 00:52:10,418
right that would be that would be where

1195
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:12,188
that goes because that way when you

1196
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:13,978
recreate the layout you put the mouse be

1197
00:52:12,188 --> 00:52:18,129
in there and it flows through everything

1198
00:52:13,978 --> 00:52:20,218
properly at that point okay so let's see

1199
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:24,338
this guy has to take the debug state now

1200
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:27,219
as well oh and you know what that's

1201
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:30,429
actually a good point too why aren't why

1202
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:32,380
isn't that in here right because again

1203
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:34,418
these are just I think these will all be

1204
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,519
relatively easy for the product pile out

1205
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:38,018
although to be honest with without no

1206
00:52:36,518 --> 00:52:39,728
aliasing turned on maybe it will get a

1207
00:52:38,018 --> 00:52:41,348
little confused unfortunately but yeah

1208
00:52:39,728 --> 00:52:43,989
this is not super performance oriented

1209
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:49,499
code so presumably we wanted to worry

1210
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:51,699
too much about it we'll find out so yeah

1211
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:55,868
that is how we would have to get at the

1212
00:52:51,699 --> 00:52:57,219
DIA web state but I think that's better

1213
00:52:55,869 --> 00:53:00,419
because then it doesn't get passed every

1214
00:52:57,219 --> 00:53:06,599
time can just something like that right

1215
00:53:00,418 --> 00:53:12,420
alright so moving on

1216
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:14,640
when we do the layouts here we would

1217
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,769
just say debug state equals debug state

1218
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:20,608
and mass the equals mouse p and then

1219
00:53:16,768 --> 00:53:22,738
those are done okay so what's going on

1220
00:53:20,608 --> 00:53:25,650
here we got our bounds we're doing our

1221
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:29,849
push Rex that stuff is going to happen

1222
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:35,519
here and it is going to happen with the

1223
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:40,079
element bounds and let's see element

1224
00:53:35,518 --> 00:53:41,459
bounds apparently what bounds we talked

1225
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,298
about here okay we're talking about

1226
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:47,909
element bounds again we go we've got

1227
00:53:45,298 --> 00:53:53,940
getwidth identify are not found I think

1228
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:58,409
it's actually get dim why oops text and

1229
00:53:53,940 --> 00:54:01,588
layout is a dot there let's see beacon

1230
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:04,498
element rectangle that's just going to

1231
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:05,940
take the address all right so we made a

1232
00:54:04,498 --> 00:54:08,429
lot of changes so I'm sure this will be

1233
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:15,210
a complete catastrophe but let's find

1234
00:54:08,429 --> 00:54:16,919
out wait that's got a size box oh we

1235
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:22,499
didn't put it we didn't put a predicate

1236
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:25,920
around that um okay my bad sorry about

1237
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:29,518
that guys you know I forgot about that

1238
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:32,389
so yeah after we can struct all these

1239
00:54:29,518 --> 00:54:36,209
things this stuff all of this is

1240
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:39,358
actually only going to happen right all

1241
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:41,789
of that stuff is actually only going to

1242
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,509
happen if we had a size box so let's

1243
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:50,930
just make sure that's out of there

1244
00:54:44,509 --> 00:54:54,420
that's not good why is that happening

1245
00:54:50,929 --> 00:54:56,098
what just happened there if element size

1246
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:59,039
you push all the wrecks if not you don't

1247
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:02,059
we didn't make the element up well that

1248
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:05,430
do it we told that it was sizable

1249
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:07,140
operator error okay good so that's

1250
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:09,058
working now we just need to go in and

1251
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:12,268
actually add the default interaction

1252
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:15,528
right so if the default interaction with

1253
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:15,528
something so like you know if

1254
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:25,400
this elements interaction what did I

1255
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:27,650
call that interaction type if they set

1256
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,410
it to something then I want to do

1257
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:38,420
looking if and I guess I could put and

1258
00:55:30,409 --> 00:55:41,960
is in rectangle for the actual interior

1259
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:47,210
bounds so the elements bounds right if

1260
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:50,510
that's the case then i'm going to set

1261
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:54,230
the debug states next hot interaction to

1262
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:56,150
this guy and I'd like this to I'd like

1263
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:58,068
the size box to take precedence even

1264
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:59,990
though now they don't overlap if we

1265
00:55:58,068 --> 00:56:02,210
chose to have them overlap I would like

1266
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:06,798
that take precedence so let's see how we

1267
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:08,690
do so somewhat surprisingly everything

1268
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:13,699
seems to be actually working pretty well

1269
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:20,179
ah so yeah well that went a lot better

1270
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:25,699
than I was expecting to be fair so yeah

1271
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:28,129
we did it um expecting after debug some

1272
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:30,548
of that well that's fine I'm not going

1273
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:34,220
to complain about not having to debug

1274
00:56:30,548 --> 00:56:36,259
okay so now if we wanted to write we

1275
00:56:34,219 --> 00:56:38,149
could also make it so all of these size

1276
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,520
pieces like this was actually a thick

1277
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:41,780
frame that actually could have sizing

1278
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:44,059
associated with it or something like

1279
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:46,250
that right where you could go in and and

1280
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:49,400
actually size from any of these pieces

1281
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:50,869
that you wanted to I don't know that we

1282
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,980
want to really do that right now because

1283
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:54,470
we're kind of getting to the end of the

1284
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:56,690
stream but point being that's all now

1285
00:56:54,469 --> 00:56:58,879
possible and of course we should also

1286
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:04,010
check make sure that like these guys are

1287
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:07,608
also working properly they are right so

1288
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:12,589
that's all good looking nice looking

1289
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:15,639
nice so yeah okay I'm pretty happy with

1290
00:57:12,588 --> 00:57:15,639
that pretty happy with that

1291
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:19,199
so now we can also start to expand see a

1292
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,130
little bit more so i think i'm going to

1293
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:21,689
save it for tomorrow because i think

1294
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:23,400
that's that's like we're a good stopping

1295
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:25,650
point we pulled out all the layout code

1296
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,510
so then now it's pretty trivial to just

1297
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,099
like that's the entirety of the code

1298
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:32,160
that it takes to code a new element now

1299
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:33,659
which is pretty great and we can just

1300
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,519
start adding more things in there like

1301
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:37,139
if they're movable or terrible or other

1302
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:39,900
things we can make that sort of

1303
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:41,579
encapsulated in there so that you can

1304
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:45,960
just add more properties that you might

1305
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:48,480
want to your to your stuff all right I

1306
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,039
don't know if I can go to a QA because I

1307
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:54,170
don't have the ability to connect to the

1308
00:57:50,039 --> 00:58:01,289
internet apparently it's pretty awesome

1309
00:57:54,170 --> 00:58:05,210
its just oh poor Linux it never actually

1310
00:58:01,289 --> 00:58:09,150
ever works unfortunately I wish it did

1311
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:13,679
cuz I would switch to it on everything I

1312
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:14,700
could but I can't so I won't so I guess

1313
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:16,919
I'll just go ahead and reboot this

1314
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:19,500
machine so i can actually use the

1315
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:23,579
wireless in it and we'll just hope that

1316
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:26,969
maybe that works not particularly

1317
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:29,159
optimistic of course since reboot

1318
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:32,730
doesn't work either i have to actually

1319
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:36,239
fill up a nerve pinch this machine and

1320
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:37,679
then start it back up again but yeah so

1321
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:39,479
i'll probably have fun reinstalling the

1322
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:42,239
sky tonight i guess if i regress back

1323
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:45,090
down to 14 which is what it was running

1324
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,279
on previously maybe that would work i

1325
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:49,350
don't know i would certainly be

1326
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,390
interested in suggestions from people

1327
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:53,789
who actually run linux on optimus

1328
00:58:51,389 --> 00:58:55,889
laptops people who run linux on desktops

1329
00:58:53,789 --> 00:58:58,320
they don't quite understand just how

1330
00:58:55,889 --> 00:58:59,789
hard it is to get linux to run on an

1331
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:04,890
optimist laptop it's like almost

1332
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:07,070
impossible nothing ever works sound

1333
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:10,679
doesn't work the graphics don't work

1334
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:13,470
sleep doesn't work and of course

1335
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:14,940
Wireless doesn't work and so if you are

1336
00:59:13,469 --> 00:59:17,099
someone who has a lot of experience with

1337
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:20,429
getting the next to work on Optimus

1338
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:21,239
laptops modern Optimus laptops do let me

1339
00:59:20,429 --> 00:59:24,690
know if there's a particular

1340
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:26,489
distributions that you found actually is

1341
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:28,530
reliable on them because I would you

1342
00:59:26,489 --> 00:59:28,919
know I'll try installing some different

1343
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,350
things

1344
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,539
right and see if any of them work since

1345
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:37,039
I have to reinstall it anyway it's free

1346
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:37,039
for me to try out some different things

1347
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:43,830
alright so if you have questions please

1348
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:46,280
post them with Q colon because I

1349
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:49,469
probably and do it quickly I guess

1350
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,780
because I probably will only be able to

1351
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:58,039
see questions for like 15 seconds or

1352
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:58,040
something but we'll do the best we can

1353
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:21,028
it is kind of crazy how not working this

1354
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:31,048
laptop is yeah this is this is a

1355
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:32,159
disaster I can't see anything can I why

1356
01:00:31,048 --> 01:00:35,788
don't you connect to chat with your

1357
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:37,348
desktop it's a good question I because

1358
01:00:35,789 --> 01:00:38,910
it was nice hat kind of having the chat

1359
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:42,900
up on the side that I could just look at

1360
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:44,129
and it used to work so I'm going to get

1361
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,680
it working again and that way I can have

1362
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:49,588
it so I'll do that tonight I'll actually

1363
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:55,139
get it working to a certain extent

1364
01:00:49,588 --> 01:00:57,630
hopefully reasonable I could also maybe

1365
01:00:55,139 --> 01:01:00,420
just plug in a net cable or something

1366
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:02,460
like that I don't know it's so weird I

1367
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,809
don't understand how like it can't

1368
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:11,338
connect to the wireless any more like

1369
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:13,440
how does that even happen how does it

1370
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:17,369
even happen I don't even know so it just

1371
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,778
disconnected again how is it like how

1372
01:01:17,369 --> 01:01:20,849
are you connected to the wireless and

1373
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:24,210
then it just stops working it doesn't

1374
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:26,490
make any sense like what is happening

1375
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:29,130
inside i wish i could see the code right

1376
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:30,808
now i want I mean the Linux code is

1377
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:32,190
public right so like I want something

1378
01:01:30,809 --> 01:01:34,230
where I can just kind of they need some

1379
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:36,869
like a linux code explorer when I can

1380
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:38,608
just go see like okay show me who is

1381
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:40,318
actually responsible for the wireless

1382
01:01:38,608 --> 01:01:42,869
networking right now what is the code

1383
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,670
doing such that it could connect and

1384
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:47,160
then just spontaneously disconnect even

1385
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:51,900
though nothing has happened you know

1386
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:55,288
nothing at all and and I wish I I wish I

1387
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:59,400
could understand this but I don't it's a

1388
01:01:55,289 --> 01:02:02,010
mystery to me and there's like tons of

1389
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,660
different wireless networks listed here

1390
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:06,470
and mines listed but it just doesn't

1391
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:06,469
think connect

1392
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:19,569
so fascinating is this like what I don't

1393
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:22,340
know either like is this what it's like

1394
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:24,410
like when Linux developers are like

1395
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:26,119
using Linux tit is this what it's like

1396
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:29,929
for them did they have some kind of

1397
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:31,579
magical machines that work or they just

1398
01:02:29,929 --> 01:02:36,199
like cool with it or they're just like

1399
01:02:31,579 --> 01:02:40,090
gal you know it doesn't work it doesn't

1400
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:43,189
work like I just won't use Wi-Fi today

1401
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:45,350
or until this Colonel gets revised or

1402
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:48,740
whatever yes I think that's not going to

1403
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:51,980
happen all right so I guess there's no

1404
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:53,750
QA today my job for this evening will be

1405
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:56,090
to restore the laptop to working order

1406
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:58,969
so that I can actually answer some

1407
01:02:56,090 --> 01:03:03,019
questions on the stream you will have to

1408
01:02:58,969 --> 01:03:05,809
wish me some luck with that because it's

1409
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:10,280
linux and luck is usually very much

1410
01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:12,469
required so hopefully if I'm if i am

1411
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,850
lucky i will be able to find a

1412
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:16,879
distribution that will work on this

1413
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:19,519
laptop without me having to go like

1414
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,869
patch the drivers or something but you

1415
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:24,829
never know okay so i will why it down

1416
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:26,300
hopefully the stuff that we did in

1417
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:28,039
today's dream was pretty straightforward

1418
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,680
so there wouldn't be too many questions

1419
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:32,929
about it essentially what it was you

1420
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:37,159
know was sort of the same thing i did in

1421
01:03:32,929 --> 01:03:39,669
the witness right and so you know if you

1422
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:43,089
want to take a look at this some more

1423
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:45,619
you can go if you type k senior tory

1424
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:48,890
calm and it'll just redirect you to my

1425
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:51,910
page easy to remember if you look at the

1426
01:03:48,889 --> 01:03:54,319
working on the witness series here

1427
01:03:51,909 --> 01:03:57,319
they're not very i want to move this

1428
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:59,869
over to the new web gem stuff because

1429
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:02,090
it's better but like you can jump

1430
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:04,760
through these the first like I think up

1431
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:08,000
through 11 maybe our grass but then

1432
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,859
number 11 starts talking about almost

1433
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,710
exactly the same thing so the witness

1434
01:04:09,858 --> 01:04:14,210
code looked exactly like our code from

1435
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:16,309
before this stream kind of looked and

1436
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:19,730
this is like the sort of stuff that was

1437
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:21,529
happening in that code and again it was

1438
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,070
just because nobody bothered like really

1439
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:26,300
cared

1440
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:27,769
about that part and you know John's

1441
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,120
pretty good about like not over

1442
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:31,099
engineering stuff so it's like if people

1443
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,599
haven't done a lot of you I then there's

1444
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:35,329
just not it's just like whatever it's

1445
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:36,889
whatever it is but it's still really

1446
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:38,929
written pretty sensibly because John's a

1447
01:04:36,889 --> 01:04:40,549
good programmer and so you know that's

1448
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:41,989
what we had the beginning stream today

1449
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:43,550
like when i came across in the witness

1450
01:04:41,989 --> 01:04:45,259
it looked exactly like what we had this

1451
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:47,810
dream today sort of everything was done

1452
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:49,700
manually all the time for the most part

1453
01:04:47,809 --> 01:04:51,980
and very few things had been compressed

1454
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:53,480
out and so what I did is I just went

1455
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:55,099
through and did exactly look and see I

1456
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,929
even made the same thing like a panel

1457
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:58,369
layout guy who does starts doing the

1458
01:04:56,929 --> 01:05:02,719
layout and I just kind of started

1459
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:03,739
reducing the code down and like I said I

1460
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:06,109
think that's sort of the same thing

1461
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:07,789
that's like John's approach to so it's

1462
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,050
like again I don't think it was like

1463
01:05:07,789 --> 01:05:10,820
John wanted the code the other way I

1464
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:13,850
think John just never cared about this

1465
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:15,140
particular use of code and so he was

1466
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:16,759
just kind of waiting for time to

1467
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:18,529
actually do any of that stuff I assume

1468
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,090
and I was the person who would happen to

1469
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:22,510
be writing a lot of you I could so I was

1470
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:25,039
like now is the time and so literally

1471
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:26,930
it's you know what I showed in today's

1472
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:29,960
dream is literally something i did on a

1473
01:05:26,929 --> 01:05:33,859
production project like not less than

1474
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,690
two years ago right because on any

1475
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:39,710
project especially one that's as big as

1476
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:42,559
the witness nobody has the time to go do

1477
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:45,079
the right thing everywhere right let's

1478
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,929
forget it there's too much stuff to do

1479
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:49,069
and too much to worry about and so you

1480
01:05:47,929 --> 01:05:51,109
have to pick and choose we're going to

1481
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:53,030
do stuff and so the right time for

1482
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:54,110
something like what i did is when

1483
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:56,150
somebody's going to come along and do a

1484
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:57,530
bunch of heavy work on this thing then

1485
01:05:56,150 --> 01:06:00,650
that is the time to go hey let me get

1486
01:05:57,530 --> 01:06:02,540
more serious about this right and so

1487
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:05,240
like I said this is exactly the sort of

1488
01:06:02,539 --> 01:06:06,710
thing that happens and in like so I

1489
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:09,109
literally this is the kind of thing that

1490
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:11,000
I actually do in real life it's exactly

1491
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:13,490
the same and you can almost see it

1492
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,760
playing out exactly the same way so if

1493
01:06:13,489 --> 01:06:18,859
you look at these articles stuff I did

1494
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,390
on the witness for like just cleaning up

1495
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:22,820
the UI system a little bit for the

1496
01:06:20,389 --> 01:06:25,789
editor is exactly the same stuff that we

1497
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:28,640
did today it's just really standard very

1498
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:29,989
straightforward coding and it's like I

1499
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,210
said it's a really good way to go lazy

1500
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:34,219
compression is a really good programming

1501
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:35,519
methodology because it means you're not

1502
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:37,679
spending a lot of time over

1503
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:39,960
engineering things that don't need that

1504
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:40,919
but it does mean that like you're not

1505
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,720
going to end up with total spaghetti

1506
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,329
code because you're actually doing the

1507
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:48,059
compressions when necessary and you know

1508
01:06:45,329 --> 01:06:49,440
it's generally the case to like on the

1509
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:51,029
witness right now the places that are

1510
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,970
spaghetti ish are just the places where

1511
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:55,470
people haven't had the time to go you

1512
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:56,759
know actually figure out how to like

1513
01:06:55,469 --> 01:07:00,449
pull the stuff out of it and make it

1514
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:02,160
like cleaner right and so every so often

1515
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:03,149
somebody when they're like oh my god I'm

1516
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:04,589
going to go have to do a bunch of work

1517
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:06,599
in this code I know it's kind of messy

1518
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:08,820
that's the time ago okay hold on stop

1519
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,230
before I do that let me go pull some of

1520
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:12,809
the stuff out a little bit more before I

1521
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:15,570
start making them it worse by adding you

1522
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:18,989
know more UI code on top of a kind of a

1523
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:20,610
super verbose stringy implementation let

1524
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:22,139
me stop now is the time to like figure

1525
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:26,970
out some compressions on this get it

1526
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:29,219
down to a nice simple core and then then

1527
01:07:26,969 --> 01:07:31,439
I add on right don't be the guy who just

1528
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:33,359
comes and is going to add a hundred UI

1529
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,950
features and and just cut and paste all

1530
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,510
the code and adds at all and it's just

1531
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:37,710
that you're you know don't be that guy

1532
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:39,210
when you come to something you like you

1533
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:42,119
can see that the programmer before you

1534
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:44,039
haven't yet put it into like a toolkit

1535
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:46,380
kind of thing they're like go do that

1536
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:47,489
work first don't leave a giant mess for

1537
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,050
them you know it's kind of a good thing

1538
01:07:47,489 --> 01:07:50,609
so anyway you can take a look at these

1539
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:56,910
are supplied shove posts on it there's a

1540
01:07:50,610 --> 01:08:01,410
quite a few actually right 14 15 16 yeah

1541
01:07:56,909 --> 01:08:02,940
17 so that's that's that all right thank

1542
01:08:01,409 --> 01:08:04,049
you everyone for joining me for another

1543
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,309
episode of handmade here it's my

1544
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:06,750
pleasure coating with you as always if

1545
01:08:05,309 --> 01:08:08,849
you would like to follow along at home

1546
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:10,829
you can pre-order the source code on

1547
01:08:08,849 --> 01:08:13,349
handmade hero or well period of the game

1548
01:08:10,829 --> 01:08:15,090
it comes with the source code I'm Hannah

1549
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:16,470
media org you can download it every

1550
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:18,000
night I upload it right after I'm done

1551
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:22,650
so you can always work on sort of the

1552
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,819
the most recent one just like I am we

1553
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:24,809
also have a patreon page you want

1554
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:25,920
support the video series you can

1555
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:27,900
subscribe to that it's always much

1556
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,850
appreciated we also have a for website

1557
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:32,338
we can go to ask questions or view anted

1558
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:33,990
episode guide with previous episodes if

1559
01:08:32,338 --> 01:08:35,699
you missed any and want to catch up we

1560
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:38,599
have a tweet pot you can go to if you

1561
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:40,889
want to know what the schedule is and

1562
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,510
yeah if you want to let schedules for

1563
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:45,720
tomorrow I will be back here 5 p.m.

1564
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:48,180
pacific daylight time tomorrow and we

1565
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,869
will do some more you I coding starting

1566
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,250
to look pretty good

1567
01:08:48,869 --> 01:08:51,479
like I said we're getting there we're

1568
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:54,210
sort of starting to get things into a

1569
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:57,029
pretty nice clean way and so we can

1570
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:58,680
start to sort of Titan a few more screws

1571
01:08:57,029 --> 01:09:00,689
down on that and then add a few more

1572
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,010
things to kind of let us the thing that

1573
01:09:00,689 --> 01:09:04,409
I really want to do is be able to view

1574
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:06,270
like our profile and view our memory we

1575
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:07,979
need some UI for that that'll work a

1576
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:10,290
little better than we've got now so

1577
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:13,169
there we go hope see you back here

1578
01:09:10,289 --> 01:09:14,430
tomorrow until then please have fun

1579
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:17,449
programming and I'll see you guys on the

1580
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,450
internet take use everyone
