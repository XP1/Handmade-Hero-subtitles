00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:06,209
start recording hello everyone and

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,940
welcome to handmade Hero the show where

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:12,690
we code a complete game live from

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:17,609
scratch on Twitch new libraries no no

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:19,019
engines and we are kind of right in the

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,490
thick of it right now doing some fairly

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,649
interesting graphics coding actually

8
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:24,689
speaking at the from scratch stuff we

9
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,778
are working on doing how we want to do

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,050
lighting and we left off yesterday with

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:33,210
a bug and the bug was actually solved at

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,130
least I'm 99% sure it's all I haven't

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,689
actually tried checked it myself but I'm

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:42,600
99% sure itself on the forums by slapped

15
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,149
silly username so hats off to you for

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,700
for I think getting guessing what the

17
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:52,350
bug actually was before we actually

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,090
covered it on the stream so without

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,439
further ado let's go talk about what the

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,390
bug was or is and verified that that's

21
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,299
actually true and fix it

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,400
so before I get started just a quick

23
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,289
reminder today's day one zero three so

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,580
if you happen to have pre-order the game

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,710
on handmade hero not org and you'd like

26
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,079
to follow along please go ahead and

27
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:16,259
download the source code pack the latest

28
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,359
source code pack and unzip day 102 out

29
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,890
of that pack that will put you exactly

30
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,319
where I am today so you can follow along

31
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,629
if that is something that you would like

32
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:30,149
to do so here is a quick synopsis let's

33
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,280
first of all remember what the bug

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,460
actually was I suppose just so we can

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,549
sort of you know bring everyone up to

36
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,919
speed so if you'll notice we're doing a

37
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,899
total debug view right now so this is

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,170
not the bug this is a debugging view

39
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,379
that we did and what we did is we just

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,570
started drawing we're in our these are

41
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,310
our Maps here this is one environment

42
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,199
map this is another environment map

43
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,530
right and this one we're not using quite

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,450
yet but we had to sort of notions of an

45
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,728
environment map a top and a bottom and

46
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,159
what we found is that one of the maps

47
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:07,920
appeared to be reflecting properly or at

48
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,050
least not obviously wrong when we

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,270
implemented it and the other one was not

50
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,980
and you can sort of see what's going on

51
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,810
up here actually we

52
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,939
ended up drawing where we were sampling

53
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,830
from the map I'm just kind of cool and

54
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,408
you can see that even though we were

55
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,299
expecting to see a fairly blobby region

56
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:28,048
like this we actually got this very thin

57
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:29,519
sliver and we have no idea why that was

58
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:31,080
happening we were like this doesn't make

59
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,860
sense we check things fairly carefully

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,469
and they looked reasonable now what

61
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,049
actually ended up happening I'll sort of

62
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,449
explain on the on the blackboard real

63
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,939
quick if I can find where is mischeif

64
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:46,548
did mischeif go away I feel like

65
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,739
mischeif is gone

66
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:51,239
Wow I don't know where mischeif went but

67
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,870
I guess we'll go ahead and bring it back

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,250
up again

69
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,530
somebody must have closed mischeif I

70
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,628
don't think it was me all right so let's

71
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,098
let's talk about it it's actually a very

72
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:05,340
very simple bug assuming that it's

73
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:07,949
correct in what our servers ation was on

74
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,598
the forums but let's just talk quickly

75
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:15,988
about what it was so here on day 103

76
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:19,649
right basically here's the deal we

77
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:22,259
already had a bug essentially about this

78
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,849
and it just didn't occur to me that we

79
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:27,959
would essentially have another one and

80
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:31,259
that is because the way we were

81
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,299
computing our reflection map right is we

82
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,879
were saying well let's suppose we're

83
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:41,639
looking let's suppose this as a top-down

84
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:42,750
view of the game right then we'll

85
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,120
basically say well we've got a

86
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,889
reflection map that essentially is is

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,209
you know going to kind of line up with

88
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,459
the screen right and we drew a

89
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,769
checkerboard on it right so we kind of

90
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,150
got this sort of thing so for testing

91
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,459
we've got that checkerboard on it and

92
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,250
what we want to do is we want to pretend

93
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,789
right if we were to look at this from

94
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,079
the side in a sort of more a little more

95
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:05,459
perspective II kind of way so there's

96
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,510
just we can understand what's happening

97
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,060
just kind of see what's happening a

98
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:12,179
little bit better we wanted to pretend

99
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,250
that if this was say the sky right up

100
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,150
here so here's the sky right

101
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,519
checkerboard if this was the sky and

102
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,189
someone was down here we want to cast up

103
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,139
at it and see where we hit so we know

104
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:27,480
what we should be reflecting right and

105
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,459
that's a pretty reasonable thing

106
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,160
to think of doing we wrote the code for

107
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,439
that it seemed okay but we ended up

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,790
having weird reflection patterns on one

109
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,060
of our maps and it was like what's going

110
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,700
on well what we were doing of course is

111
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,680
we were using the screen space UV so

112
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,259
like when we were drawing our sphere we

113
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,240
were using the screen space UV of the

114
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,250
sphere to figure out where to start the

115
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,139
castrum so if here was the sphere we're

116
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,029
starting the cast at each point on the

117
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,550
sphere wherever it was on the screen

118
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:58,229
right which seems like a very sane thing

119
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,660
to do if you think about a sphere

120
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,819
sitting here that's exactly what it

121
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,430
should be right you want to start from

122
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,639
the 2d location wherever it was on this

123
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:13,079
plane and cast upwards makes perfect

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:16,050
sense problem is just like before we're

125
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:19,889
not actually looking down on some

126
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,600
sprites so for example the trees and

127
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:24,329
that sort of stuff and the sphere are

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,400
like cards that are sort of sticking up

129
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:28,649
out of the plane in terms of their

130
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,049
perspective and we see them flat on

131
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:33,179
against the ground even though they're

132
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,579
sort of in this weird lien and it's just

133
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,800
a conceit of how to diem artworks that

134
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,269
we allow that it doesn't make any sense

135
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,579
in terms of the perspective of the game

136
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:43,439
but that's just how we tend to do it

137
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,629
when we do those isometric things you

138
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,980
know normally if it was really any kind

139
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:50,000
of reasonable top-down perspective

140
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:53,580
they'd be much more tilted than they are

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,189
so since that was the case as we move up

142
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,829
on that card like the base point the

143
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,050
actual location of the entity is

144
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:03,300
correctly where we should start sampling

145
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,090
but and as we move left to right our

146
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,579
x-coordinate is totally also correct

147
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:11,310
right so starting the the cast from the

148
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,829
x-coordinate off of the base is totally

149
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,300
correct the problem is when we move up

150
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:20,490
and down up and down actually

151
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:24,600
corresponds to Z movement for sprite

152
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,910
cards like this not Y movement right it

153
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,640
does not correspond to Y movement in any

154
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,280
way so we were pretending we were moving

155
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,169
this way for casting when really we were

156
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,909
just going straight up and down and so

157
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,430
the reflection we were getting was

158
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,439
actually logical if somehow than those

159
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,220
normals which are all pointing the other

160
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,670
way

161
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,010
were somehow smushed onto a flat Fang

162
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,439
that was lying on the ground which is a

163
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,149
totally it can't happen like normals

164
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,009
couldn't be pointing that way on a thing

165
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:54,750
that was flattened right it's as if you

166
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,240
had a thing you know if we're standing

167
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,490
here this is the ground and here's the

168
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,230
card all the normals are like pointing

169
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,480
out of this thing but now we're

170
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,670
interpreting it as if it was flat here

171
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,439
so this normal is like here and pointing

172
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,590
that way it's just nonsense

173
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,969
right it's a nonsensical thing which is

174
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,189
why we were getting a reflection that

175
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,610
looked just totally weird

176
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:19,829
right so what would happen of course is

177
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,259
the reason that we were getting the flip

178
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:23,819
where the bottom half would be fine in

179
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,339
the top half would would not be is

180
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,430
because that was what determined whether

181
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:32,310
or not the reflection movement was going

182
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,620
with the grain of motion up the up the

183
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,930
card or against it and if it was going

184
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,639
against it it would tend to collapse the

185
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,709
area of the reflection if it was going

186
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,139
with it witty long gait and that's why

187
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:45,750
we have to these are both wrong I

188
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,789
believe it's just this one doesn't look

189
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,949
that wrong and it's hard for our eye to

190
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,900
tell that it's wrong because you know

191
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:53,849
humans aren't perfect we can't just look

192
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,409
at an arbitrary weird checkerboard test

193
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,689
boundary like oh that reflection doesn't

194
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:03,270
look like like maybe if we actually were

195
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:05,399
wearing you know valves 3d glasses and

196
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:07,109
we're looking at a real scene we could

197
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,299
like look at it and go yeah that's

198
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,919
that's not right like my intuition all

199
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,930
works here and I can see the whole scene

200
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,759
and I can tell that's wrong maybe that's

201
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,189
true but in a 2d perspective where

202
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,740
things are already intentionally wrong

203
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:21,209
because the art wants them to sort of be

204
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,189
different there's no way for us to

205
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,870
really see that error I think so I

206
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:27,329
suspect both of these are actually

207
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,918
incorrect we just didn't quite focus on

208
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:30,810
this one as being wrong we we had some

209
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,088
nosed inclinations that maybe not

210
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:37,529
everything was quite right but you know

211
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:42,469
there there we have it so that is what

212
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,468
we we need to fix starting now right

213
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,409
and fortunately I think that's not a

214
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:51,609
particularly difficult fix we just need

215
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:54,529
to kind of do a little bit futzing with

216
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,120
determining sort of what the base point

217
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:58,879
we just need some notion of what the

218
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,409
base point of this card is so that we

219
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,809
kind of know all right

220
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:05,240
here's here's our central cast point

221
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:08,299
here's our X span which is the same as

222
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,340
it was before but then our Y will move

223
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:13,279
us up and down in Z for these types of

224
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,050
cards that seems like a like a pretty

225
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,730
straightforward thing I don't think

226
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:18,620
it'll be too difficult to do but that's

227
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,830
what we got to do and so I think that

228
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:26,779
will will fix our problem here if that

229
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:29,840
makes sense because and to be a little

230
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:31,490
clearer about why that's the case the

231
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,740
reason we need that base point is we

232
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,490
still do need to know where to start the

233
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:40,879
cast from so we still need to have some

234
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,440
notion of where you know where in the

235
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,480
world we're supposed to be casting from

236
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,130
and since we don't really know if this

237
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,590
thing is like floating or what it's

238
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:51,080
doing we kind of want to have some

239
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,790
notion that comes in from the game that

240
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,790
says hey this is where this thing

241
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:57,559
actually is in the world and here is how

242
00:09:55,789 --> 00:10:00,620
I want you to interpret its coordinates

243
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,329
in terms of in terms of casting so we

244
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,529
kind of need to get a little bit of a

245
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:08,330
handle on that right alright so let's go

246
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:10,699
ahead and get that started

247
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,950
wait I should already have an e max it

248
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,900
looks like I typed D max yeah I guess I

249
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,600
closed it down I guess I closed it down

250
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:20,120
before we started all right so let's go

251
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,710
ahead and go into render group here and

252
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,190
first of all we can take a look at the

253
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:28,790
offending notion essentially it's it's

254
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:31,670
the screen space UV bit right the screen

255
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:33,769
space UV that we passed to this guy has

256
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:35,029
to be corrected and the way that we're

257
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:36,710
doing that as you can see is we're just

258
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:39,829
using the x and y coordinates directly

259
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:43,400
and so what we want to do is we want to

260
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:45,560
think more carefully about exactly what

261
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:49,250
we're doing there first of all we want

262
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:52,549
to say that our y coordinate is is

263
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,009
probably not something that we're

264
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:56,779
actually ever going to use directly

265
00:10:55,009 --> 00:11:00,799
based off of the M

266
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:04,399
max right so really our y-coordinate for

267
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:07,939
screen space UV for cards is going to be

268
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,679
something like our fixed cast Y or

269
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,860
something right like that's just gonna

270
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:16,189
be some value and then our y-coordinate

271
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,550
is actually going to be not so much

272
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:23,150
about where we are in when Y here that's

273
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:26,539
going to be actually more about where we

274
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:28,879
are in Y off of of the axis so it's

275
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:31,250
actually the V coordinate that we

276
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,860
actually care about right the V

277
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:36,110
coordinate tells us how far up the card

278
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,269
that sort of sprite card we actually

279
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,950
were right

280
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,939
and again we're a little bit messed up

281
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,200
right now because we haven't done a

282
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,190
coordinate system finalization but we're

283
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,600
just going to assume that everything

284
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,910
goes bottom-up even though it doesn't

285
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,950
quite yet just so we can get the math

286
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:50,360
right in here and then very next thing

287
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,150
we'll be doing next week will be the

288
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,529
coordinate pass so you know we should

289
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,539
have everything to be able to tighten

290
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:58,490
everything up at that point and make

291
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:01,929
sure everything is totally kosher before

292
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,279
doing any sort of optimization work so

293
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,989
what we want to do here is take that

294
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,939
screen space UV which we're passing

295
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:11,750
right and now we want to essentially

296
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:14,570
offset the screen space UV if necessary

297
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,000
now we don't have really any need to

298
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,520
offset the cast Y for cards it's fixed

299
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,389
what we do want to do is offset the Z

300
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:26,090
height of the thing by whatever our V is

301
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:28,549
times some height that we want the card

302
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,950
to be in Z like how tall should this

303
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:34,099
tree be right and that's what we'll use

304
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:38,080
so when we're down here all we really

305
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:42,470
have to do is say okay when we compute

306
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,660
that distance from map can Z this is

307
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,779
actually now going to be based on V

308
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:51,709
right so it's actually going to be 2.0

309
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:55,009
right that's the distance the map is you

310
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:56,120
know in Z let's say right and in fact I

311
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:58,279
guess what we could do is say let's

312
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,320
let's not actually well I guess we could

313
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,419
still do it this way and then say all

314
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,260
right depending on which one of these we

315
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:08,818
are we can talk about how far away it is

316
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:10,980
based on the motion that it actually

317
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:12,299
yes and I suppose actually we don't need

318
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,610
to do that here we can just add it in

319
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:17,370
right here right so we want to do a

320
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,808
height of of card is the thing we want

321
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,379
to do here we want to say okay however

322
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:25,078
far our way the map was as we move up

323
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,610
the height of the card right the

324
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:28,859
distance of the map is either going to

325
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,419
get smaller or greater depending on

326
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,269
whether we're moving away from it or

327
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:35,308
towards it now the map distance from map

328
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:37,049
in Z is going to be negative on the

329
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:40,249
bottom right

330
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:45,419
so as the the the height of card

331
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:47,819
consuming as as we move we just have to

332
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:50,610
figure out I should do this on the on

333
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:52,378
the blackboard sorry we just have to

334
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,329
figure out a good way of making sure

335
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,220
that we always get the sign right so the

336
00:13:54,328 --> 00:13:59,188
way that we have it right now right is

337
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:03,600
if we're talking about the top guy or

338
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:07,558
the bottom guy this will either be

339
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,899
negative right or positive depending on

340
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:16,049
which one it is so as we move up the

341
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:18,448
card in in V right and I suppose you

342
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:19,708
know what V is not really a hundred

343
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:22,169
percent correct either now that I think

344
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:24,748
about it because we could be rotating

345
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:27,928
and so really what we want to do is

346
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:32,839
figure out the the direction this way

347
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:35,458
that we are up off of of the base right

348
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:36,929
whatever that base point actually is or

349
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,489
if that's the center point here is

350
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:43,078
something like this right what we really

351
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:46,409
want to do is find that right so I guess

352
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:50,428
now that I think about it I was I was I

353
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:52,799
was off I was off I was not correct this

354
00:14:50,428 --> 00:14:56,909
is not going to be fixed cast Y it will

355
00:14:52,799 --> 00:15:02,068
be this the difference is just that it's

356
00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:02,730
going to be I'm sorry my bad that's not

357
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:06,328
what I meant

358
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:09,589
I meant the Z the difference is it will

359
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:12,688
still be that value it will still be

360
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:17,069
sort of the the Z difference will still

361
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:19,620
be based on the Y it's just going to be

362
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:22,229
based on the Y's difference from

363
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,649
whatever some fixed point is

364
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:28,560
in space right meaning we don't know

365
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:29,909
exactly how we want to measure it but I

366
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,768
guess it's probably should be from the

367
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:33,149
origin of the coordinate system right so

368
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:35,459
if this is the origin of the coordinate

369
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:38,458
system let's say what we want to do is

370
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,989
say alright we're gonna tell you the the

371
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,369
thing that's doing the rent that's like

372
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,039
issuing these rendering commands the

373
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,828
game is gonna say this is at this

374
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:50,370
particular Z height I'm telling you that

375
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:54,028
and furthermore I'm telling you how far

376
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,980
in Z I want you to go how what the

377
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:57,328
height in meters actually is and and we

378
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,509
could actually have this be a constant

379
00:15:57,328 --> 00:16:02,669
thing which is like a Y 2 meters

380
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:06,929
conversion that basically just tells us

381
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:08,909
ok as we move in Y how many you know in

382
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:11,578
meters 2 pixels is probably a good

383
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:12,689
approximation of it right because that's

384
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:14,669
what we're doing we're basically saying

385
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,440
the inverse of that however many pixels

386
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:18,569
we go up we want to know how many meters

387
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,029
we actually moved and that would be how

388
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:24,209
far off of that base z height we were

389
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:25,649
right so we I I misspoke when I said we

390
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:28,559
don't need that fat anymore we do need

391
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:31,649
that value we just need to know what it

392
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:35,338
actually is relative to the origin of

393
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:37,799
our coordinate system which we need to

394
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,959
figure out right so the origin of our

395
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,338
coordinate system is this guy so what we

396
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:44,159
want to do is say all right

397
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:46,410
the origins Y we subtract that away and

398
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,409
now we've got our Delta this is now our

399
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:51,448
Z difference it's whatever we we invert

400
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:53,370
here this is our this is our z

401
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:55,469
difference this would be this would be

402
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,149
in pixels so really instead of invite

403
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,490
max we just need something that's kind

404
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,919
of like got that that conversion factor

405
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,620
built in right so we want a pixels to

406
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,078
meters here that will turn this z diff

407
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:09,808
into something that as a proxy is in

408
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,849
actual world space right so then once we

409
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:14,058
get to distance from map in Z we're not

410
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,708
using that we're using Z diff like so

411
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:18,750
and now we just have to get back to the

412
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:20,250
sign thing so sorry I totally misspoke

413
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,949
there when I said it we don't care about

414
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,509
V V would be rotating around and not

415
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:26,640
giving us a reliable value so we

416
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:28,318
actually want to know we actually do

417
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,990
want to know that Y basis okay so back

418
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:35,339
to here we've got our Z value whatever

419
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,740
our xiv base value actually is and

420
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:40,259
you know in that's actually something

421
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,930
that we probably want to to bake in here

422
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,700
as well so distance from map in Z being

423
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,070
to like this is something we probably

424
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,670
should actually parameterize in fact we

425
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:54,750
could actually do something like um you

426
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:57,090
know what is the the origin Z kind of a

427
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:00,720
thing whatever our origins evaluate is

428
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:04,679
the distance from the map is actually

429
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,470
going to be is actually going to be

430
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,019
based on that in some sense like trauma

431
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,660
thinking how to explain this since at

432
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:15,539
the moment this distance from map in Z

433
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:19,170
is totally relative to some imaginary

434
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:22,139
thing we couldn't do something like say

435
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:25,200
we've got these two maps like we've got

436
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,940
the top and the bottom map right we

437
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,130
can't do something like say we've got

438
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,600
the floating head and it's up here so it

439
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,520
should be reflecting close to the top

440
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,019
and we've got some ball sitting on the

441
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,789
ground and it should be reflecting close

442
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:37,680
to the bottom right there's no

443
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:39,599
information about that there's no

444
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,810
information about the relative height of

445
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,789
the sprites right so what we kind of

446
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:46,619
want to do I think is turn this into a

447
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:49,529
little bit more sane equation first

448
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:53,189
which is to say let's first compute

449
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:56,549
where we are in Z so this is just our Z

450
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:58,980
like this is our Z position right in our

451
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,509
Z position would be like some origin Z

452
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,490
value that we're saying is where we're

453
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:11,430
starting at right in that origin Z value

454
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:14,250
is going to be modified by this the z

455
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,660
diff right so it's actually going to be

456
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,839
it's going to be doing this sort of

457
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,430
thing so whatever our origin Z is we're

458
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,069
going to modify that by the z diff so

459
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,570
we'd be going like up you know if it's

460
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,109
if we're getting higher or down if we're

461
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:28,049
getting lower

462
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:30,269
that's our PZ and then instead of doing

463
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:33,359
distance from map in Z we would just do

464
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:35,849
something like map Z right which is like

465
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,829
where the map actually is and what we

466
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:41,129
could do for that to make things much

467
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:43,859
cleaner I think is just say this is the

468
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,200
maps location in Z right like this is

469
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:47,939
where it actually is so then we don't

470
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,559
actually have to deal with any of this

471
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:55,710
stuff we can just say

472
00:19:49,559 --> 00:20:00,599
okay the distance from the map in Z is

473
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:05,160
just going to be consuming is just going

474
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:06,990
to be entirely based on subtracting the

475
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,600
two values just like we would do in any

476
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:12,359
other vector situation so like the far

477
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,059
map if we've got one right we just go

478
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,549
ahead and take the far map Z wherever

479
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:19,799
that is in Z and we say okay to get to

480
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,899
the map you would go from where we are

481
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,980
and Z to that right and then it'll

482
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,530
automatically be negative or positive

483
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,480
based on whichever way the map was to us

484
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:29,190
and since we're picking which one it is

485
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,519
based on the normal direction it should

486
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:35,940
all work out okay for us right so I

487
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,559
think that's a little bit saner to start

488
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,980
with let's go ahead we've got a bunch of

489
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,799
stuff we got to clean up now so so

490
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,099
there's that but yeah so what we want to

491
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:49,440
do is say I guess we want to I suppose

492
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:56,159
we could probably just assume that our

493
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:58,920
fixed cast position I think we want to

494
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,540
pass this in eventually so I'm gonna I'm

495
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:04,110
gonna say that our fixed past cast

496
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:05,759
position is is is going to be at the

497
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:06,779
origin of our thing for now but that's

498
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,950
probably not what we want to do we're

499
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,539
gonna need more control over these

500
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,740
things eventually and so we'll have to

501
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:13,170
think through how we want them all

502
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,970
specified but for now we can just go

503
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:20,360
ahead and assume that it's at the origin

504
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:25,230
so this will need to be specified

505
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:27,750
separately so for right now we could say

506
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:30,150
that you know origin Z we could say that

507
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,049
that was just at 0 for now it's or

508
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:38,190
something like this or you know or 1 I

509
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:39,720
don't even know 0.5 who knows so we

510
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,460
could say whatever we want to say for

511
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:47,460
origin Z and then we can also for our

512
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:50,460
fixed cast Y our fixed cast Y position

513
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,759
could just be whatever that initial

514
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,490
origin is wherever wherever the origin Y

515
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,710
actually happens to be like so and so

516
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:03,410
that can be I could be computed down

517
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,410
here after we have those values like so

518
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:07,920
and then our pixels to meters

519
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,530
I feel like pixels to meters is

520
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,590
something that we normally do have in

521
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:15,539
terms of rendering information right we

522
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:18,750
have needles meters to pixels so we

523
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:21,839
could easily do pixels to meters here so

524
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:25,220
I'll go ahead and pass meters to pixels

525
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:29,629
or sorry pixels to meters right like so

526
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:40,759
and then here we can just pass one over

527
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:49,260
hmm our what do we actually call it here

528
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:51,089
it is rendered rip okay

529
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:54,450
so we're not quite there yet we're

530
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:57,209
getting there but we also now when we

531
00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:01,049
actually make those maps we have to say

532
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,900
where we want the maps to be so we you

533
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:05,009
know when we're actually sort of

534
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,080
producing them we have to sort of give

535
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:10,319
them a height in the world that says

536
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:12,990
where the map should exist so when we're

537
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,149
doing this this setting them up here

538
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,339
when we're actually drawing into them we

539
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:21,290
can also take a second and say that the

540
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:23,879
trans state end maps right for each map

541
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:27,480
and I think we actually said which which

542
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,550
ones they are here so zero is bottom so

543
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,819
you know our our bottom map is going to

544
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:35,549
be temporarily at that maybe we'll do

545
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:37,349
that sort of a thing and this will be

546
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,480
like the sky will be maybe two meters

547
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,169
above us I don't know it's just an

548
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,799
example

549
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:46,650
oops QZ so and that'll just say where

550
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:50,970
that we want those maps to be for now so

551
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:52,650
there we go and then we have two well I

552
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,269
guess we got a we got a couple different

553
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:58,190
things we might want to do but for the

554
00:23:54,269 --> 00:24:03,019
moment let's let's let's see let's keep

555
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:08,490
keep taking a look at this stuff here so

556
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:10,910
looking at where we are casting right

557
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,910
now

558
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:21,239
yeah I couldn't unfortunately I'm gonna

559
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:24,730
say I don't necessarily know exactly

560
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:27,700
what I think should be happening on

561
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:30,069
these so I don't even know how close

562
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,769
that is yet it's a little confusing to

563
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:34,298
say the least but I would like to go

564
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:36,640
through the code once before we actually

565
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:37,990
do any more work on it anyway but I just

566
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,750
kind of wanted to see where we were at

567
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:47,859
on on that so yeah let's just go ahead

568
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:49,509
and let that lie for now if that's okay

569
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:52,329
with you guys

570
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:56,470
so all right going back up here and also

571
00:24:52,329 --> 00:25:00,038
we can we can probably take our sample

572
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,929
stuff and and turn it off for a second

573
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:04,359
just so we can kind of see what the

574
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:09,220
result is so here is our little thing

575
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:12,038
that you know if you want to see turn

576
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:22,028
this on to see where in the map you're

577
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:28,558
sampling yeah okay so there's our our

578
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:32,079
new reflective sphere right and I would

579
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,720
say that at least it's looking a little

580
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,658
saner now but I still think our top

581
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,100
reflection is probably still a little

582
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:40,600
borked although it's hard to say

583
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,769
obviously our top reflections actually

584
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,678
our bottom reflection I think

585
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:50,109
technically right however you want to

586
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:52,710
think about that but either way well

587
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:52,709
that's kind of interesting

588
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:03,450
that is really bizarre how that's

589
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:05,250
looking actually huh sorry I'm just a

590
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,380
little bit mesmerized by that so anyway

591
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,670
yeah I mean like I said I still think

592
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,140
we've got a little bit of work to do to

593
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,900
make sure that all the changes that I

594
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,790
made are actually correct here but I

595
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,900
think we're getting there all right so

596
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:20,700
let's go through this step by step so at

597
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,350
the moment we're essentially saying that

598
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,140
everything no matter where is in the

599
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:29,819
world it's just going to come in at the

600
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:32,460
origin Z of 0.5 so it's like halfway you

601
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:34,619
know it's always halfway in between the

602
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,630
two maps that's just where it's going to

603
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:38,729
be or I guess it's not quite halfway in

604
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,830
between the two maps I could for now set

605
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,690
it to halfway just so we can kind of see

606
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:46,189
if they're similar so this would be

607
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:52,080
halfway in between the two maps right

608
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:53,900
and they are quite quite similar now so

609
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,460
that's actually that's actually

610
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,798
definitely an improvement from where we

611
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,259
were similarly I suppose we could we

612
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,418
could go ahead and do it this way for

613
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,609
testing at the moment we could say this

614
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:08,520
was it you know the similar values to

615
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:10,379
what we were using before and then we

616
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,529
can sort of see what those look like

617
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,720
right there's our there's our we're at

618
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:17,819
zero and then we have a map that's

619
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,110
negative to below us negative 2 meters

620
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:24,210
and then 2 meters above us basically and

621
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:26,819
if you look at what happens there it's

622
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:30,779
actually you know it's actually somewhat

623
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:33,240
reasonable you know not too bad again

624
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,990
not not sure about it but it's it's much

625
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:40,410
more sane I think than we were getting

626
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:42,569
so let's keep going so we're specifying

627
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:44,910
origin C and now like we're two away on

628
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:47,490
either one of these we're saying and the

629
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,410
fixed cast location in Y is just going

630
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,000
to be wherever the origin of the thing

631
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,740
was so that's like whichever one of

632
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,279
these quarters is the origin and we

633
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:58,980
could actually figure out which one that

634
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:02,910
was right we can say draw a rectangle

635
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,740
outline we could actually oh you know

636
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,360
what we could do let's say for now that

637
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,490
the origin is actually the middle

638
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,469
because that would be a fairer thing

639
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,509
in terms of how we are comparing our

640
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:16,350
stuff so what I'll do is I'll say the

641
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:21,119
fixed cast Y is actually going to be the

642
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:24,240
origin plus the x axis plus the y axis

643
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:27,449
in half amounts right so sort of like go

644
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:31,349
to the center of this thing and that's

645
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:37,019
actually going to be that cast location

646
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:39,599
right so now we should be the middle

647
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:42,629
should be sort of of this guy should be

648
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:45,029
where we're thinking the we're actually

649
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,120
casting from hopefully that's the goal

650
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:50,849
anyway so that's our fixed cast location

651
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:54,059
that's where we are in terms of moving

652
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:56,579
around on the bitmap and in terms of

653
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:58,500
taking a look at that we can take that

654
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:00,629
out of the equation if we want to write

655
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,450
we can always say that the screen space

656
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:06,510
UV just equals 0.5 point five we wanted

657
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:10,380
to make it be in the center for example

658
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:12,089
right if we just wanted to say it

659
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:21,420
doesn't actually matter where it moves -

660
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:22,949
oops there and so you know if we are in

661
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,750
that circumstance then since we have a

662
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,400
spherical normal map what we would

663
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:30,720
expect is not to see any changes at all

664
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,210
except in you know these these outer

665
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:39,809
regions here and that is what we see for

666
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:41,759
the most part although little okay so

667
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:48,720
there's definitely some changing going

668
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:54,690
on there so that seems sort of wrong to

669
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:58,680
me although I guess now I think that so

670
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:02,720
that I think bears inspection so if we

671
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:07,289
are not moving the screen space UV and

672
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:11,400
since it is spherical I would like to

673
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:16,559
know why we are getting that change

674
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:22,980
let's stop the displacement as well

675
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:27,690
and take a look at that disk so if we

676
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:42,210
stop the displacement so oh yes we'll do

677
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:44,009
it this way so if we stop the

678
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:48,269
displacement and leave it in the center

679
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:49,920
right so now we know that there's

680
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:54,180
literally nothing happening except the

681
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:56,759
rotation we can definitely see changes

682
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:59,820
in these guys which we should not be

683
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,200
seeing right so let's just trip let's

684
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:03,210
take a minute and track that down

685
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,779
because that's definitely I believe a

686
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:08,549
bug that should not be happening but

687
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,690
let's keep so let's keep walking through

688
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:12,539
this and see if we can't figure out

689
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,180
what's going on there so we've got our

690
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:17,490
pixels two meters and in fact this now

691
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,620
should always be the same as well and so

692
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:21,720
the difference between these two things

693
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:26,479
should be should should not there should

694
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,480
be none right between those two things

695
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:37,680
yeah and it seems like that's relatively

696
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:39,390
correct right like it's going to be a

697
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,210
little bit different because the

698
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:44,210
location isn't quite exactly the same ah

699
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:54,870
well I guess I should say the screen

700
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,759
space UV has to actually move across the

701
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:58,529
face of the thing so this is not

702
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:05,970
actually a fair test not I think about

703
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:07,920
it I do I am Not sure though why the

704
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,299
rotation is causing that thing but now I

705
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,039
think about it that's really not a fair

706
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:13,289
test because we have to very over the

707
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,269
face of it it's only this the center of

708
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:17,909
the thing that wouldn't have to change

709
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:19,950
but anyway so since we're staying in

710
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,930
this is actually the fairer test staying

711
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:26,720
in one place and making sure that the

712
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:29,870
sphere does not change as it rotates and

713
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,279
that looks pretty good

714
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:34,349
let me verify it's the throat and rather

715
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:36,690
slowly so what I might want to do here

716
00:32:34,349 --> 00:32:40,079
is just kind of speed up the rotation a

717
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,610
little bit so that we can get you know a

718
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,099
little clearer picture of what's going

719
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:47,069
on I'd also like to maybe move this down

720
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:52,619
so these things are nearer to each other

721
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:56,460
there we go so the rotation is right

722
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:58,589
here and so what I want to do is speed

723
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,279
this up a bunch just so we can see if

724
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:04,609
there's anything

725
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:07,109
oops if there's anything going on there

726
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:09,659
okay so we're still you can still see

727
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:12,569
that we are actually working right as we

728
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,580
rotate and I feel like we should be able

729
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:17,339
to get it down to where we're not having

730
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:19,230
that happen you know I don't know if

731
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:20,699
maybe our normal transform isn't quite

732
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,230
right yet or whatever's going on but

733
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,250
there so I think we've got some work to

734
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:26,880
do all right

735
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:28,589
so fixed in place and you know what I

736
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,840
can also turn back on our sampler

737
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:32,849
because then we can see what's happening

738
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,619
to the shape which will help us

739
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:38,509
potentially debug it so I'm gonna go

740
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,509
ahead and turn that on like so

741
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:47,560
yeah so we're oscillating we're actually

742
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:49,930
changing who is who is large and who is

743
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:52,149
small in terms of our sampling there

744
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:54,850
which is commas are but let's so let's

745
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:59,190
work through it so we come down here

746
00:33:54,849 --> 00:34:01,659
we're doing our normal sampling like so

747
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,980
and I suppose one thing we could do we

748
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,160
did this before that would kind of be

749
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:08,320
helpful here is let's see what that

750
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,329
bounce Direction actually looks like

751
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,340
so after here after do that let me just

752
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:18,099
romp over the Texel RGB with actually

753
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:21,070
the bounce direction so we'll just do a

754
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:25,898
point five point five point five times

755
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:29,429
the bounce direction and oops times 0.5

756
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:34,500
times bounce direction that way plus

757
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:34,500
let's just take a look at that and see

758
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:44,739
it looks pretty stable to me like I

759
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:50,230
don't see there's a little fluctuation

760
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:52,629
in there I guess but I feel like it's

761
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:57,039
pretty stable right I mean there's not

762
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:59,110
the outside obviously is changing but I

763
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,599
feel like the inside is is staying

764
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:04,960
relatively stable and you know we could

765
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:11,710
also if we wanted to actually go ahead

766
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:15,579
and make a version of this where we have

767
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:20,530
that sort of that test let's see where

768
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:25,659
it is here we've got test defuse so test

769
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:29,170
defuse oops test defuse where we

770
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:32,559
actually make that test defuse what we

771
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:36,639
could do is go ahead and actually make

772
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:40,239
test defuse also be a sphere so we could

773
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:44,889
say make sphere diffuse map as well and

774
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:47,409
make test diffuse like so and that might

775
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:49,359
actually be interesting as well right

776
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:51,609
and so if I go up to mix your normal map

777
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,970
if I was to take this function and just

778
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,559
make

779
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:56,889
another test function here which is like

780
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:58,420
makes your a diffuse map then what I

781
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,799
could do I'll get rid of the Russell

782
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:04,440
boobs I'll get rid of the roughness

783
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,440
coefficient Shakespeare diffuse map

784
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:11,019
essentially exactly the same code but

785
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:12,550
the only difference here is in the

786
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:15,099
diffuse map we'll actually put in an

787
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:17,619
alpha channel that will allow us to

788
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:20,920
determine where where the sphere

789
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:23,550
actually is right so if we go ahead and

790
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:27,280
take a look at this we could just say

791
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:31,240
use this root term thing and and know

792
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,820
which one we want right so all we need

793
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:35,289
to do here is say that we've got

794
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,920
essentially a color we've got the color

795
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:43,829
x color Y color C and that's always

796
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:48,789
going to be actually I guess this is a

797
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:52,679
base color or something like that okay

798
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,679
we'll have the base color will be white

799
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,960
and this keyboards driving me nuts I had

800
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,820
to send my as you know from yesterday's

801
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,108
cream I had to send my my actual

802
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:07,088
keyboard off to get our M aid they don't

803
00:37:05,108 --> 00:37:08,588
make them like they used to anyway and

804
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:11,170
this value will actually just be the

805
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:12,880
Alpha and so what I want to do is I want

806
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,170
to compute the Alpha here and we'll just

807
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,550
do it a very simple way we won't

808
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,559
actually do coverage at the moment what

809
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:20,859
we'll do is we'll say all right get rid

810
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:23,858
of the normal term and instead what

811
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:26,650
we'll do is say all right whatever you

812
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:28,500
know I guess we don't end Z I don't even

813
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,760
know why that was defined up in there

814
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,829
when we actually do this if the root

815
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,140
term is greater than zero then the Alpha

816
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:36,670
will be 1.0 otherwise the Alpha will be

817
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:39,309
zero I guess it's already zero so that's

818
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:42,159
fine and that'll allow us to do a map

819
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:43,989
that kind of clips the sort that those

820
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,838
sort of bogus normals out of the way for

821
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:49,500
us right so if we if we go ahead and

822
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:49,500
rerun this now

823
00:37:52,199 --> 00:38:01,348
oh right and we got a pretty multiply

824
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:02,338
that as well so let's go ahead and take

825
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:08,250
that into account

826
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:13,380
so the Alpha value needs to 55 0.5 times

827
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:15,269
alpha and we also need to go ahead and

828
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,559
multiply this by alpha so that's

829
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:17,730
pre-multiplied alpha since we're

830
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:21,719
premultiplied alpha everywhere at the

831
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:23,820
moment think that should be correct that

832
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:26,539
is definitely not correct what did I do

833
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:30,480
wrong there make sure a diffuse map

834
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:39,960
either the alpha 0 or 1 the color is

835
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:46,170
going to be that looks totally that's

836
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:49,380
not right I'm asleep I'm asleep the

837
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:52,670
switch today people let's be honest it's

838
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,670
just not just not fabulous

839
00:38:53,630 --> 00:39:01,789
so that looks loops more like it

840
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:11,700
go and since alpha is just going to be

841
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:14,250
255 or 0 basically through there we

842
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:15,828
could also multiply the alpha by 255 on

843
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,880
the way in which would do that

844
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:21,960
automatically for us so we can just do

845
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:25,490
this and then that should take care of

846
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,490
it automatically right

847
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:45,529
so that seems good right now four times

848
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:49,599
and let's give it another go okay so we

849
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:52,670
now just need to make sure this actually

850
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,659
doesn't overwrite it I'm assuming it

851
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:59,750
doesn't textile RGB so we would just

852
00:39:56,659 --> 00:40:01,039
need to do Texel RGB where premultiplied

853
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:05,960
alpha again so we just need to multiply

854
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:07,820
by a and that should just work there is

855
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,750
our sphere that was harder than it

856
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,570
should have been if I wasn't asleep

857
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:14,000
today that would have gone quicker but

858
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:16,340
either way it's okay so we can kind of

859
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,340
see here I feel like it's pretty easy to

860
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:21,650
verify that our bounce Direction does

861
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,870
not appear to be changing am I correct

862
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:26,090
like I don't see the bounce Direction

863
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:28,969
looks fairly constant certainly not

864
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:32,180
varying enough to make this difference

865
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:35,149
happen right so I feel like that's good

866
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:37,119
let's go ahead and say if zero out on

867
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:42,260
here

868
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:44,799
this is draws the bounce direction so

869
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:48,650
what else we got what else is actually

870
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,330
plausible to you know to actually be

871
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,789
changing if the bounce Direction

872
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:55,849
computation is not changing what is

873
00:40:52,789 --> 00:41:00,369
changing so there's the P Z value right

874
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:07,519
which is the origin z plus the diff see

875
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:11,750
there is the screen space UV but that

876
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:14,989
should be relatively constant now across

877
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:17,449
the surface so I do wonder about let's

878
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:20,449
go take a look at that z diff and just

879
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:23,480
see what that looks like at the moment

880
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:29,089
so what if we take the z diff out of the

881
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:32,329
equation for a minute then it's constant

882
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:34,880
so that's what we want to see so if we

883
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:37,880
just if we just take a look at that for

884
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:43,579
a second I feel like that indicates to

885
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:47,150
me at least to some degree that the

886
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:52,910
if is is bogus and so the question is

887
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:55,999
why are we getting such a erroneous such

888
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:58,838
an erroneous computation of our z diff

889
00:41:55,998 --> 00:41:58,838
there and

890
00:42:09,798 --> 00:42:14,880
so I guess now that I think about it

891
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,769
that's actually the way it would work if

892
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,999
it was based off of the origin of the

893
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:22,439
coordinate system because as it spins

894
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:25,548
you're going to have more of it going

895
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:29,009
below so that's actually that's actually

896
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:30,509
sort of right right and probably means

897
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:32,579
we don't really want to specify it this

898
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:34,650
way going forwards but if you think

899
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:37,318
about what that means you know if I've

900
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:39,930
got this and this is my origin and I'm

901
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:42,889
saying that this is at zero if I then

902
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:45,778
rotate down like so

903
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:47,998
even if I move this up to a cop to

904
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:49,588
account for it and try to put it in

905
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:52,588
exactly the same place so the spheres

906
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:54,599
are overlaid this point on the sphere is

907
00:42:52,588 --> 00:42:57,210
now considered to be lower because it's

908
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,420
lower than the origin point as opposed

909
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:03,478
to here where it was higher than it so

910
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,818
that may indicate that we don't really

911
00:43:03,478 --> 00:43:08,429
want to do it that way

912
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:11,608
so that rotating things don't have to

913
00:43:08,429 --> 00:43:16,379
counter themselves I'm not sure exactly

914
00:43:11,608 --> 00:43:18,389
how we want that to work but what we

915
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:21,660
could say is you know we've got this

916
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:25,528
this thing here we could say we have an

917
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:29,159
origin Y you know that is that's this

918
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:37,949
sort of a deal right if that's our

919
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:40,639
origin Y like so then we could that's

920
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:46,259
not pretty capitalizes it then we could

921
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:52,978
imagine this being a little saner there

922
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:54,900
let me just verify that fail like so if

923
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:56,578
we were to use that value now it's at

924
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,650
the center of the sphere and that is

925
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:04,309
going to be consistent across the

926
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:04,309
rotation right so if we do this and

927
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,980
so there it's constant again as we're

928
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,519
rotating around so that's remaining

929
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,769
constant like exactly like we expect

930
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:20,610
that it should be so I'll go ahead and

931
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:24,300
turn off the sampling overdraw for the

932
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:26,430
moment as well and so hopefully that

933
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,110
will get us back to to something

934
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:29,489
reasonable oh and we're gonna have to

935
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:32,880
make our sphere dark enough to be able

936
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:35,519
to see what we actually contribute in

937
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,559
terms of lighting right because right

938
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,650
now it's full bright so the light can't

939
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:43,139
actually add anything to it so our

940
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,570
diffuse map should probably start with a

941
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:49,440
base color that's dark in fact we could

942
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:51,330
just make it well no let's make it well

943
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,750
if we're doing lighting we'll make it

944
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:56,369
black just so we can see you know the

945
00:44:54,750 --> 00:45:00,539
perfect reflection on it it's just all

946
00:44:56,369 --> 00:45:02,940
it's all light that's incoming so there

947
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:07,650
we go there's our sphere which is nice

948
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:11,220
and stable at the moment yeah looking

949
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,750
much much better we probably still have

950
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:14,250
a little ways to go but at least we're

951
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,309
looking much better so let's go ahead

952
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:20,190
and allow it to move around again we'll

953
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:24,210
take a look at that disp will let disk

954
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:26,250
kick back in so there's our sphere

955
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:29,940
that's moving around and that's a very

956
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:31,769
plausible that now looks very plausibly

957
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,019
like what should happen to the

958
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:35,550
reflection during motion so the only

959
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:37,590
thing that I think is a little

960
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,570
potentially broken right now is I feel

961
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:43,680
like the reflection shape is a little

962
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:45,180
odd and should be more curved but we'll

963
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:48,149
have to think about that a little bit so

964
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:49,379
anyway that's the primary thing that I'm

965
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,750
thinking of I'm just looking at that

966
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,610
there in terms of other bugs that we may

967
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,559
want to look at we also have the

968
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:57,120
bilinear sampling at the edge that's

969
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:58,920
causing little sparkly as I'm not sure

970
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,420
what we really want to do about that

971
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,030
because that may not actually be a

972
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,550
problem because if we if we actually

973
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,110
properly set those to be sort of blurred

974
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:09,780
for bilinear sampling something we'll

975
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:12,300
talk about a little bit later in the

976
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,830
string in the series that may actually

977
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,010
not be a problem but we're getting

978
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:19,940
pretty good it's getting more certainly

979
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:22,339
getting more marble like at the moment

980
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,599
which is pretty awesome I'm like in

981
00:46:22,338 --> 00:46:25,670
there without looking it's very nice and

982
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,440
stable I don't see a lot of bugs in

983
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:28,700
there so I think the only thing we

984
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,210
really want to verify is that that

985
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:35,058
reflection shape is not wrong but I

986
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:37,730
think we're we're just about there so

987
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:38,630
with that we'll leave that we'll leave

988
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:43,750
that where it's at

989
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:43,750
I guess and we will go to the QA

990
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:11,659
these Seven Samurai the reflection is

991
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:14,930
inverted the edge should be the center

992
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:16,548
and vice versa and and Carl and Oh bloom

993
00:47:14,929 --> 00:47:19,399
thinks as well yeah me too I mean I just

994
00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:22,639
I feel like it should be reflected this

995
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,430
way right it should bow it should bow

996
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,989
inward and so I'm assuming we've got one

997
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:31,098
more math bug in there but I think we're

998
00:47:26,989 --> 00:47:33,588
pretty close it looks much more nice and

999
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:38,599
stable now and and so I think we're I

1000
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:41,558
think we're just about there I guess in

1001
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,970
the Q&amp;A if nobody has any Q's we can go

1002
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:45,950
continue to pursue it we could go take a

1003
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:48,098
take a look at the math now and see what

1004
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:48,098
we've got

1005
00:47:53,768 --> 00:47:57,798
Tecna Rath how long do you anticipate it

1006
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:59,989
will take before we get into more game

1007
00:47:57,798 --> 00:48:03,199
designing type topics rather than

1008
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:04,849
building up the engine so if you're if

1009
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,498
you're interested in game design this is

1010
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:09,798
not really gonna be the stream for you I

1011
00:48:06,498 --> 00:48:12,439
am NOT a game designer and so we won't

1012
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:14,748
really ever be doing game design a-type

1013
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,130
topics if that makes sense

1014
00:48:14,748 --> 00:48:20,028
we will only be doing game

1015
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:28,849
implementations so we're only you know

1016
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:30,018
we're only doing we're only doing engine

1017
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:32,150
implementations these sorts of things

1018
00:48:30,018 --> 00:48:35,199
and game implementation but we're doing

1019
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:35,200
implementation not design

1020
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:44,640
Oh stellar seven you know what you're

1021
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:46,890
right we do have 12 minutes left of

1022
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:49,079
normal stream time because we started 12

1023
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:50,579
minutes late so let's just use some more

1024
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:54,119
of the Q&amp;A let's use a little bit more

1025
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:55,679
of the QA - since since I am of the

1026
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,239
opinion that it's bowing the wrong way

1027
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,579
or potentially blowing the wrong way and

1028
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:04,559
other people are as well let's just go

1029
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:07,199
ahead and take a look and and and take

1030
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:18,150
take a look and see if that's actually

1031
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:21,149
correct in there right so I guess the

1032
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:26,639
first thing to think about is why does

1033
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:31,820
that actually happen on a real sphere

1034
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:31,819
right the reason that would happen is

1035
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:39,590
because as the reflection gets more up

1036
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:39,590
this way

1037
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:54,730
mm-hmm

1038
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,289
I have to think about because it's we're

1039
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,440
doing something a little stranger which

1040
00:49:56,289 --> 00:50:02,019
is because we're doing the feathering

1041
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:05,260
this sort of feathering stuff it makes a

1042
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:09,489
little harder to think about exactly how

1043
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:12,160
it's supposed to work I do wonder a

1044
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:16,889
little bit about how much that

1045
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,889
interferes with what we're doing

1046
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:37,420
hmm well either way because you'll

1047
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:40,329
notice it's really the feathering I I

1048
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:45,010
it's the feathering that creates that

1049
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:49,029
pattern right and so I feel like what

1050
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:53,760
we're really seeing there is actually

1051
00:50:49,030 --> 00:51:00,160
this this a result of this calculation

1052
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:02,760
right because so so hear me out on this

1053
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:02,759
one guys

1054
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:10,179
you know I I just like I I feel like I

1055
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:12,250
feel like I need I need you to think of

1056
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:19,509
me as the man now dog just for a second

1057
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:21,699
here if I may so if I stop the disk the

1058
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:24,940
bowing is going the correct direction

1059
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:27,309
the reflection goes the right direction

1060
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:29,470
it's the feathering that is curved this

1061
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:31,449
way and the reason that the feathering

1062
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:34,539
is curved this way is just because we're

1063
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:38,589
using the magnitude of that bounce

1064
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:41,440
direction Y to determine which way how

1065
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:45,220
we feather the edge so if we were to

1066
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,470
take off the edge feather right so

1067
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:49,689
instead of tea farm app we just so we

1068
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:55,799
said you know I don't know it's just

1069
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:55,800
it's 1.0 or whatever right like this

1070
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,360
you can kind of see that it's really

1071
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:08,250
just that's that shape that we're seeing

1072
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:10,620
there is the shape of this test right

1073
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:14,719
it's saying when the it's it's the test

1074
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:14,719
of the bounce directions y-component

1075
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:24,300
so maybe the answer there is we want to

1076
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,640
do a different test if we want the shape

1077
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,440
to be different because the actual

1078
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,139
reflection looks like it's curved the

1079
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,849
right way you know what I mean like

1080
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:37,079
their reflections actually curving this

1081
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:41,549
way not that way the actual lines that

1082
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:45,869
are reflected so I feel like that bodes

1083
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:49,140
well for the calculation how do people

1084
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:50,909
feel about that you know I'm saying and

1085
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:53,039
so that's just that's just like the

1086
00:52:50,909 --> 00:53:00,349
frisket where it's actually doing kind

1087
00:52:53,039 --> 00:53:00,349
of the sort of the the blending on there

1088
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:05,369
so yeah I don't know and that's just

1089
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:09,390
that's that's sort of what I'm thinking

1090
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:12,239
I do wonder I feel like it goes it

1091
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:14,279
doesn't quite dim as gradually as I

1092
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,609
might have expected so I also feel like

1093
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:24,240
perhaps that tea farm map value might

1094
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:26,250
want to sort of be accentuated right you

1095
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:29,339
know what I mean like something where

1096
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,659
it's gonna be a more gradual so I know

1097
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,880
if you saw what I did there like you

1098
00:53:30,659 --> 00:53:35,250
know if you want to make a value ramp

1099
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,890
more quickly when you square it like

1100
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:42,389
that you can you can make its fall-off

1101
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:44,819
be much more hard right basically what

1102
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:47,519
happens in that range because remember

1103
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:50,370
we're always talking about things that

1104
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:53,820
are sort of in that range where you've

1105
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:56,159
got you know a zero to one thing and so

1106
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,620
if you if you have a fall-off you know

1107
00:53:56,159 --> 00:54:01,379
that's going like this so you're talking

1108
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:02,759
about you know I guess like sorry it's a

1109
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,890
fall-off so I guess technically it's

1110
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,770
going like that right so you're talking

1111
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:10,529
about like as this value goes up

1112
00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:14,009
you know or did down however you want to

1113
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:16,650
imagine it going if it's between zero

1114
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:18,720
and one if you take whatever the output

1115
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:21,269
value of the thing is and you square it

1116
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:24,149
it's always going to produce a more

1117
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:26,759
bowing effect like however many times

1118
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:29,190
you square it right because since all

1119
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:32,940
the values are less than 1 1 times 1 is

1120
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:35,220
1 and anything less than 1 like point 7

1121
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:37,230
or whatever times point 7 right I guess

1122
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:40,230
I'll just write them squared 1 squared

1123
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:42,809
is 1 right and anything less than 1 like

1124
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:45,869
point 7 squared or whatever is going to

1125
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:49,289
be equal to something less than its

1126
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:52,289
original value because 1 times point 7

1127
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:54,179
will be equal to 0.7 anything less than

1128
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:58,320
1 times when something is a fraction of

1129
00:54:54,179 --> 00:55:00,659
0.7 so squaring always accentuates those

1130
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,820
curves whereas square rooting lofts them

1131
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:05,429
up right it's sort of like the gamma

1132
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:11,190
stuff we were doing and so that's

1133
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:13,399
perhaps more of a reflection pattern but

1134
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:13,400
yeah

1135
00:55:28,769 --> 00:55:33,159
decent samurai my guess is that the

1136
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,349
normals of the edges are now pointing

1137
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:41,980
straight up while the normals at the

1138
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:43,239
center are pointing sideways the normals

1139
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,240
that the edges are now pointing straight

1140
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:51,159
up with a normal I'm not sure I follow

1141
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:52,659
you I mean I guess the part that I don't

1142
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:54,099
understand now is what about that

1143
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:56,859
reflection looks wrong it looks that

1144
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:58,989
that actually looks correct right I mean

1145
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:01,570
if there was something here that's how I

1146
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:05,349
would expect it to curve it was only the

1147
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:07,600
fact that the frist kidding which is a

1148
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:09,670
totally not reflected it has nothing to

1149
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,809
do with reflection at all right the

1150
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,519
frist kidding is just the thing that's

1151
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:15,929
on there to make it so that we gradually

1152
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:18,639
change between different reflection Maps

1153
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:20,109
so and I don't know if we don't want

1154
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:21,339
that curve I'm not sure we don't though

1155
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:24,849
I'm not sure that that's a bad thing

1156
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:26,950
having that curve because then obviously

1157
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:29,170
this is this this middle area here is

1158
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:34,389
all gonna fill in with other reflection

1159
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:38,550
stuff right move it and then it looks

1160
00:56:34,389 --> 00:56:38,549
wrong Carl and Oh bloom says

1161
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:53,269
so left-to-right motion obviously looks

1162
00:56:50,989 --> 00:57:02,599
correct to me right I mean that looks

1163
00:56:53,269 --> 00:57:06,259
pretty pretty sensible an up-and-down

1164
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:08,179
movement I mean I think part of the

1165
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,040
problem there is since we don't have the

1166
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:14,899
coordinate system for up and down quite

1167
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:16,519
yet the maps are are not probably doing

1168
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,590
exactly the thing that you would expect

1169
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:22,670
them to do necessarily in terms of which

1170
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:25,070
direction we're moving but that looks

1171
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:28,400
correct as well right I mean that's what

1172
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:29,930
it should do it should move you know I

1173
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:35,869
mean you have to imagine you're moving

1174
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:37,940
it essentially through you know you're

1175
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:41,170
moving it essentially as if this was

1176
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:41,170
moving on top of it right

1177
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:56,970
so where the walls are is there like

1178
00:57:52,260 --> 00:58:00,210
here and here on the sphere right which

1179
00:57:56,969 --> 00:58:06,750
is the weird thing the super crazy weird

1180
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:09,179
thing about yeah about about this we

1181
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:12,000
could create a sphere that does a

1182
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:14,460
different thing right if we wanted to we

1183
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,420
could create a sphere that has the

1184
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:21,570
normals rotated so for example if we did

1185
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:24,329
in make sphere normal map and we wanted

1186
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:26,940
to make it so that it was a top facing

1187
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:28,380
sphere essentially if we wanted to do

1188
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,200
that then we'd only see one thing

1189
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:33,570
reflected right we'd see the top thing

1190
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:35,189
reflected so if we wanted to make us for

1191
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:38,070
a normal map that way what we would do

1192
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:40,710
instead is in here we would actually

1193
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:43,950
swap these right so it would actually be

1194
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:45,990
this way and that's for a thing that's

1195
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:49,108
lying down and pointing up at the

1196
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:51,799
ceiling right but we can't quite do that

1197
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:58,409
yet because we're not we're not actually

1198
00:58:51,800 --> 00:59:00,060
we don't have a way to do we don't

1199
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,379
actually have a way to do that yet

1200
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:04,139
because we have we would have to do the

1201
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:08,608
math differently for them for the Z it's

1202
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:10,949
that now the Z diff is wrong right so we

1203
00:59:08,608 --> 00:59:12,900
basically have to add two paths like I

1204
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:16,789
said to the normal thing one for stuff

1205
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:19,619
that's lying down where the pixel motion

1206
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:24,358
corresponds to actual motion in screen

1207
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:25,800
space UV right so you know we could

1208
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:29,400
almost we could prototype it in here

1209
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:37,940
right it would be it would be like this

1210
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:40,670
if card then do it that way like so

1211
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:44,940
otherwise the Z diff is always zero

1212
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:48,210
right there's no Z diff at all and the

1213
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:52,119
screen space U and V gives the previous

1214
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:56,530
one that we calculated right

1215
00:59:52,119 --> 01:00:01,389
and in tight max so that's what that

1216
00:59:56,530 --> 01:00:04,150
would look like right and similarly we

1217
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:06,159
would end up going

1218
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:10,389
well let's let's go ahead and recompile

1219
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:15,569
this here right similarly to that we

1220
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:15,569
also need to take what happens in here

1221
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:28,060
and when we do this reflection that's

1222
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:33,610
correct we get the reflection out of

1223
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:40,269
that we would take the bounce direction

1224
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:41,500
why so yeah it's not correct I have to

1225
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,699
think this is why I say we have to do

1226
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,860
the coordinate system pass because we

1227
01:00:42,699 --> 01:00:46,239
have to then go through now and actually

1228
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,800
make sure we have all of the coordinate

1229
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:54,250
system stuff correct that's that's a

1230
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:56,170
little best that's not quite right yeah

1231
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,250
I feel like we need to actually spend

1232
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:58,480
time to get that quite right there's

1233
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:01,090
because there's a couple other things in

1234
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,880
here that wouldn't be correct about how

1235
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:06,220
the bounce is being fit Kirk calculated

1236
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:10,720
for things that are lying down as

1237
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:14,579
opposed to two pointing up right and so

1238
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:17,049
we can we can kind of play with that

1239
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:18,699
next week when we do the coordinate

1240
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:22,230
system stuff and we can do one that's

1241
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:22,230
that's kind of flat on itself

1242
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:38,450
reflect kaceyface

1243
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:54,389
Saoirse heaven it feels like the red and

1244
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,329
blue should swap places yes so they will

1245
01:01:54,389 --> 01:01:59,338
that's the that's the why up and why up

1246
01:01:57,329 --> 01:02:06,510
versus why down thing like I said that

1247
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:08,400
will get fixed next week can we make the

1248
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:09,540
checkerboard a bit tighter sure I think

1249
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,639
all we would have to do to make the

1250
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:15,509
checkerboard a bit tighter is change

1251
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:19,289
where the maps are so if we wanted to we

1252
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:24,210
could do making them further away so

1253
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:27,179
they can be reflected more exacerbated I

1254
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:30,380
can I can make them as as far away as

1255
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:33,739
you want there I don't know if that

1256
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,740
helps at all

1257
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:53,278
so and that that really looks that

1258
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:56,219
really looks pretty right to me

1259
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:57,568
I mean maybe we've got still some bugs

1260
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:59,759
in there but that looks really correct

1261
01:02:57,568 --> 01:03:02,369
to me again the frisk getting is a

1262
01:02:59,759 --> 01:03:04,588
separate effect that is not part of our

1263
01:03:02,369 --> 01:03:06,479
reflection math the frisk getting effect

1264
01:03:04,588 --> 01:03:08,130
is so that we can blend three normal

1265
01:03:06,478 --> 01:03:09,419
maps to three environment maps together

1266
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:19,528
that have nothing to do with each other

1267
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:21,269
right it's purely synthetic and ESC do

1268
01:03:19,528 --> 01:03:23,338
you only want support standing cards and

1269
01:03:21,268 --> 01:03:26,248
lying cards or also any other angle I

1270
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:28,440
think just standing and lying down and I

1271
01:03:26,248 --> 01:03:33,838
don't even know if we want that we may

1272
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:35,068
only really want this this shape but I

1273
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:37,228
feel like we should work it out to have

1274
01:03:35,068 --> 01:03:39,449
both just in case while we're on it

1275
01:03:37,228 --> 01:03:40,468
because not much work to when we're

1276
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:42,328
actually going through and making

1277
01:03:40,469 --> 01:03:45,289
cleaning up the coordinate system I feel

1278
01:03:42,329 --> 01:03:45,289
like it should be really easy

1279
01:03:52,349 --> 01:03:56,969
but yeah but I'm pretty I'm pretty

1280
01:03:55,050 --> 01:04:00,000
confident that that's correct now I

1281
01:03:56,969 --> 01:04:02,519
think I think that's right that that

1282
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,230
looks right to me so we do need to the

1283
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:06,900
blue and the red should swap but that's

1284
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:09,269
the Y up-down problem so that'll get

1285
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:12,110
taken care of next week when we do the

1286
01:04:09,269 --> 01:04:12,110
coordinate stuff but

1287
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:24,369
and also grumpy giant it's definitely

1288
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:29,139
not sitting on the floor at all right

1289
01:04:24,369 --> 01:04:32,369
because it's eight units away and it is

1290
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:32,368
not eight units tall

1291
01:04:32,728 --> 01:04:38,649
so so it's definitely yeah this is this

1292
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:40,449
is a hovering it's like that's a sky and

1293
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:43,210
a ground that are far better I mean

1294
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:48,429
they're not far away but they're not

1295
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:50,170
right up against it right and we could

1296
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:52,798
certainly make it closer but then you

1297
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:56,380
can't see much of the checkerboard right

1298
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:58,210
you know if it's if it's we don't get

1299
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:04,180
much of of the checkerboard at that

1300
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:05,679
point and again we've got we can affect

1301
01:05:04,179 --> 01:05:10,058
that factor too

1302
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:11,978
right like we have there's other aspects

1303
01:05:10,059 --> 01:05:17,650
of it that we haven't really addressed

1304
01:05:11,978 --> 01:05:20,528
yet because we don't really know how big

1305
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:22,150
these maps are in world space and this

1306
01:05:20,528 --> 01:05:23,528
is why I say we really kind of want like

1307
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:30,999
you know like you v's per meter for

1308
01:05:23,528 --> 01:05:34,690
example we need we need other stuff here

1309
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:36,068
that that's a fudge factor that we don't

1310
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:37,650
actually know what that should be so you

1311
01:05:36,068 --> 01:05:40,119
know if the thing was one unit away

1312
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:43,690
maybe it should actually look more like

1313
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:47,588
you know that or something right

1314
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:50,289
I don't know right I have no idea what

1315
01:05:47,588 --> 01:05:52,028
the actual values here should be and

1316
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:54,640
that's again why I say maybe coordinate

1317
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:57,039
system work maybe should be happening

1318
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:59,710
here just so we can kind of figure out

1319
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:02,579
what what we want to say for all these

1320
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:06,548
values so you know there's a there's

1321
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:08,559
another example right of the

1322
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:14,650
checkerboard being reflected at a much

1323
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:16,239
more a much less a much less its

1324
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:18,579
assuming that the checkerboards are much

1325
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:22,539
much much larger than we were assuming

1326
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:27,160
them to be right if that makes any sense

1327
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:29,559
I don't know if it does or not but there

1328
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:31,058
you go and I feel like it's also sort of

1329
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:33,480
a little bit intersecting there so I

1330
01:06:31,059 --> 01:06:41,500
feel like this

1331
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:43,990
whereas render handmade let's see PZ so

1332
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,849
I feel like we made I don't I didn't go

1333
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:50,229
actually calculate how far things should

1334
01:06:45,849 --> 01:06:52,119
be so you know that's that's kind of

1335
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:56,710
more what the what a large checkerboard

1336
01:06:52,119 --> 01:07:03,880
would look like right kind of that looks

1337
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:09,159
better to people or not right so again

1338
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:12,490
those values just aren't we have to do

1339
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:13,779
some work now when we go through and do

1340
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:15,879
coordinate system stuff to really

1341
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:18,880
determine what all these values should

1342
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:22,119
be like how big is the environment map

1343
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,740
in world space so that we map the units

1344
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:25,920
properly and all that sort of thing

1345
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:25,919
right

1346
01:07:35,059 --> 01:07:39,860
so yeah so we'll actually work out what

1347
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:42,320
these values are actually supposed to be

1348
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:44,630
I mean we'll we'll actually this will

1349
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,950
this is not an unknown value we know

1350
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:50,510
what it is we just haven't worked it out

1351
01:07:45,949 --> 01:07:53,929
it's gonna be based on how much area we

1352
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:57,470
want to capture for our lighting right

1353
01:07:53,929 --> 01:07:59,960
it's going to be based on how dense the

1354
01:07:57,469 --> 01:08:05,409
map is versus that right and so we'll

1355
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:07,699
we'll have you know well we'll have that

1356
01:08:05,409 --> 01:08:09,940
dialed let me let me go through it next

1357
01:08:07,699 --> 01:08:09,939
week

1358
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,969
so yeah

1359
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:40,739
so yeah pretty happy with how that's

1360
01:08:30,368 --> 01:08:40,738
going any more questions

1361
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:07,619
looks like no more questions maybe maybe

1362
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:20,349
alright alright so I'm pretty happy with

1363
01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:21,009
where we got here and like I said it's

1364
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:22,810
crazy

1365
01:09:21,009 --> 01:09:26,829
this is ridiculous how fast this is

1366
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:28,779
running for such sloppy code that we've

1367
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,519
done I mean we were just literally it's

1368
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:31,810
all just kind of like the code to figure

1369
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:35,380
out how to make all the math work the

1370
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:37,839
way we wanted it to it's crazy how fast

1371
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:42,009
that's running so I guess that bodes

1372
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:44,939
well for software rendering yeah I mean

1373
01:09:42,009 --> 01:09:49,180
as a simple example right if you just

1374
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:51,429
even with the same code this machine has

1375
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:53,579
something like 16 cores or something in

1376
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:57,670
it it's got crazy number of cores on

1377
01:09:53,579 --> 01:10:01,269
this machine anyway if we just

1378
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:03,399
I'm sorry not 16 cores 12 cores if we

1379
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:04,810
something if we just took exactly thing

1380
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,549
and broke the screen up into twelve

1381
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:10,719
regions it would run twelve times faster

1382
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:13,020
right so we can already just by by

1383
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:15,340
having a separate thread render each

1384
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:17,680
tile on the screen we would we would

1385
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:22,510
basically get you know something like 12

1386
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:25,210
times faster and so I I feel like we're

1387
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:26,949
probably actually gonna be able to do a

1388
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:29,439
software renderer for this game that you

1389
01:10:26,948 --> 01:10:30,179
could actually play which is kind of

1390
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:32,559
hilarious

1391
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:34,390
even though we were only really doing it

1392
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,949
for educational purposes I feel like we

1393
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:37,690
may actually it could actually be

1394
01:10:35,948 --> 01:10:40,210
something that was you could chip I

1395
01:10:37,689 --> 01:10:42,099
don't think we want to because the

1396
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:43,779
resolution will be lower right yeah you

1397
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,610
know you'll want you'll want to run it

1398
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:49,899
on a Jeep on the GPU path because you'll

1399
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:54,519
get a higher res plays screen but you

1400
01:10:49,899 --> 01:10:55,988
know and me below this is not this is

1401
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,670
completely honest entually

1402
01:10:55,988 --> 01:10:59,259
the only optimization that that this is

1403
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:04,539
going through is the compilers

1404
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:06,280
optimizations so like we will when we

1405
01:11:04,539 --> 01:11:09,310
Cindy eyes it we should get at least

1406
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:10,920
four times faster I should think well

1407
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:12,840
now at least four times faster

1408
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,369
I guess because this is this machine

1409
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:18,329
could only get four times faster consent

1410
01:11:14,369 --> 01:11:19,710
had the eight wide instructions but I'll

1411
01:11:18,329 --> 01:11:21,659
get four times faster on this machine

1412
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:23,909
potentially up to four times faster with

1413
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:26,219
that and also twelve times faster on top

1414
01:11:23,909 --> 01:11:28,829
of that from the threading so we've got

1415
01:11:26,219 --> 01:11:30,420
we got Headroom of you know somewhere in

1416
01:11:28,829 --> 01:11:39,390
the fifty times faster than we currently

1417
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:41,730
are yet I mean so yeah it's it's it's

1418
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:44,610
kind of crazy I feel like I feel like we

1419
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:46,019
may actually be able to do some we may

1420
01:11:44,609 --> 01:11:48,630
actually be able to have a suffer under

1421
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:58,320
this that's playable which I wasn't

1422
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:59,819
necessarily counting on right so Lori

1423
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:04,649
Boyd can know this is not threaded at

1424
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:06,630
all it's literally just completely

1425
01:12:04,649 --> 01:12:09,089
unthreaded unoptimized code which has

1426
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:12,029
compiler optimizations turned on but

1427
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:16,010
compiler optimizations aren't doing much

1428
01:12:12,029 --> 01:12:16,009
of the stuff that we would we would do

1429
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:30,988
all right

1430
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:35,920
so yeah I think that's a good place to

1431
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:40,119
let leave off I feel like where I feel

1432
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:41,670
like we're in pretty good shape here I'm

1433
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:46,269
really liking where this is going

1434
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:49,350
so let's kill it for today and I guess

1435
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:52,180
next week we will start on the path of

1436
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:54,280
we've got two major things to do before

1437
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:56,369
we can start to nail down the renderer

1438
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:58,420
one cleanup the coordinate systems and

1439
01:12:56,369 --> 01:13:01,449
get all of that stuff straightened out

1440
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:02,529
before we go any further and then the

1441
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:04,649
other thing we need to do is figure out

1442
01:13:02,529 --> 01:13:09,939
how we're gonna do that near field light

1443
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:11,589
basically this this the screen dude I do

1444
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:18,639
not know how we're gonna do the green

1445
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:29,500
dude the green dude is tough the green

1446
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:31,150
dude is tough yeah I don't know how

1447
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,680
we're gonna get the green dude but

1448
01:13:31,149 --> 01:13:37,000
basically what you know if you take a

1449
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:39,039
look at what we've got here right you

1450
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,979
can see that this will get us a nice we

1451
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:43,750
can basically put a nice sky reflections

1452
01:13:41,979 --> 01:13:45,159
or lighting from the sky can come in

1453
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:47,590
nicely here what we'll do is we'll do

1454
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:50,279
some blurring on these so that you know

1455
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:52,810
you can have like I said a glassy or

1456
01:13:50,279 --> 01:13:55,300
reflect like reflective - glossy to

1457
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:57,900
diffuse the lighting will work kind of

1458
01:13:55,300 --> 01:14:02,140
nicely there and it'll all be fine right

1459
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:04,238
but the real problem is what do we do to

1460
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:06,600
fill in in here so basically what that's

1461
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:09,669
for is not the ground and not the sky

1462
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,289
but the the near-field the light that's

1463
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:14,140
kind of coming from right around an

1464
01:14:11,289 --> 01:14:15,729
object and we won't really be able I

1465
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:19,210
don't think to do much in the way of

1466
01:14:15,729 --> 01:14:24,339
reflections for that I just don't think

1467
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:26,109
that's gonna be super practical but we

1468
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,819
can I think like what I'm gonna try and

1469
01:14:26,109 --> 01:14:32,049
do is get just just general lighting

1470
01:14:27,819 --> 01:14:34,238
right so get some some you know get get

1471
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:38,140
sort of blobby lights in there that are

1472
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:39,579
roughly correct so that it's still so

1473
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,829
that lighting kind of works for

1474
01:14:39,579 --> 01:14:44,519
really but like pure reflections we we

1475
01:14:41,829 --> 01:14:49,239
can't do I'm pretty sure that's not

1476
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:51,160
really possible for a number of reasons

1477
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:52,630
the most obvious being that we don't

1478
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:54,189
even actually have the data that we

1479
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:57,130
would need to know even if we did it

1480
01:14:54,189 --> 01:15:00,099
perfectly like for example we don't even

1481
01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:03,400
know like the artist is not necessarily

1482
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:06,130
even drawn stuff like the back part of a

1483
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:08,199
house so if you're behind the house if

1484
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:08,800
you put a ball to the left and behind

1485
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:10,569
the house

1486
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,199
it doesn't even know what to reflect

1487
01:15:10,569 --> 01:15:15,399
right so we'd end up with all kinds of

1488
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:19,750
problems if we were trying to actually

1489
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:22,839
reflect the near-field stuff so that

1490
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:24,640
probably won't happen but you know

1491
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:29,050
hopefully we'll be able to get some of

1492
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:31,570
the other things in there and TT BJM in

1493
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:33,489
terms of Fornell we could actually put

1494
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:35,079
real lighting terms in here if we want

1495
01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:36,849
to I think they may not make a whole lot

1496
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:39,729
of sense because since we're kind of

1497
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:43,930
doing interpretive 2d lighting I don't

1498
01:15:39,729 --> 01:15:47,709
know but it would go in here right when

1499
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:51,030
we actually are trying to determine how

1500
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:53,789
the reflection falls off based on the

1501
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:55,960
based on the angle and stuff like that

1502
01:15:53,789 --> 01:15:57,310
we would need to sort of just just

1503
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,109
figure out what we want our terms to be

1504
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:03,280
in here I don't know how much we want to

1505
01:15:59,109 --> 01:16:07,779
do of that though so like I said we'll

1506
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:09,399
we'll play with some tuning but I I

1507
01:16:07,779 --> 01:16:10,509
don't think we want to go down the rat

1508
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:12,250
hole of trying to do any kind of

1509
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:14,800
physically based lighting really because

1510
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:17,350
we don't have the correct incoming light

1511
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,630
field so pursuing physically based

1512
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:21,280
lighting is kind of just a waste of time

1513
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:24,369
what we want to be pursuing is

1514
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:25,719
artistically Pleasant lighting so we're

1515
01:16:24,369 --> 01:16:27,819
trying to figure out how to take the

1516
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,440
light fields we can generate in a 2-d

1517
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:32,590
game and put them together to make

1518
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:34,000
pleasing effects and so we will probably

1519
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:35,350
play with some lighting model

1520
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,909
computations here but they're probably

1521
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:43,150
not going to have a lot to do with

1522
01:16:36,909 --> 01:16:44,380
actual physics like you know like for

1523
01:16:43,149 --> 01:16:49,099
now

1524
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:51,440
so anyway let's wrap it up for today so

1525
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:54,050
everyone go out and party hard on Friday

1526
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:55,819
night as I know they are want to do

1527
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:57,170
thank you everyone for joining me for

1528
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:58,819
another episode of handmade hero it's

1529
01:16:57,170 --> 01:17:01,760
been a pleasure programming with you as

1530
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:03,439
always if you would like to follow along

1531
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,150
at home with a series you can always

1532
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:06,799
pre-order the game on handmade hero org

1533
01:17:05,149 --> 01:17:09,019
we've got a little pre-order button just

1534
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,850
for you and that comes with a source

1535
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,900
code so you can follow along and play

1536
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:13,400
around with it which is a good way to

1537
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:15,589
learn you just experiment with some

1538
01:17:13,399 --> 01:17:17,239
stuff and see how it works is a great

1539
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:18,500
way to learn from the series we also

1540
01:17:17,239 --> 01:17:20,119
have patreon page if you just want to

1541
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:23,989
support the video series because you are

1542
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:25,760
feeling like a very nice person or if

1543
01:17:23,989 --> 01:17:27,139
you want to ask questions and look at

1544
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,550
ports too Mac or Linux that sort of

1545
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:30,560
stuff we've got a forum site you can

1546
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:33,050
check out it's pretty cool and we also

1547
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,880
have a Twitter page and the Twitter page

1548
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:37,130
has the schedule posted and it also

1549
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,150
tweets updates to the schedule that's a

1550
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:40,369
great place to go if you're track it's

1551
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:43,009
the stream live the tweet bot can

1552
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:45,590
totally help you with that that's it for

1553
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:47,420
this week we will be back here on Monday

1554
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:48,739
again check the tweet bot for the

1555
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:50,569
schedule we'll be back here on Monday

1556
01:17:48,739 --> 01:17:52,010
and it'll be time to really go through

1557
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:53,420
and clean up our coordinate system stuff

1558
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:54,949
which is gonna feel really nice I think

1559
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:57,470
when we go through there cuz there will

1560
01:17:54,949 --> 01:17:59,210
be no more a hand-wavy unknown stuff

1561
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:00,619
that we haven't solidified so that's

1562
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:03,529
gonna be pretty nice I hope you'll join

1563
01:18:00,619 --> 01:18:06,970
me for that and have a great weekend in

1564
01:18:03,529 --> 01:18:06,969
the meantime take it easy and everyone
