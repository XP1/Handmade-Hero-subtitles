00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,599
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,320
hero show we code a complete game live

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:10,239
on stream last time we

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,320
were programming we

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,519
determined that in order to actually do

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,519
a nice

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,600
solve for our uh entity collisions

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,399
we actually do need to do

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,760
a

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,278
wider check

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,320
on like a wider voxel check

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:27,920
which

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,278
originally i'd considered and i was

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
seeing whether i could get away without

15
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,880
it but it doesn't really look like you

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,840
can

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
now

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,399
i don't know that that necessarily means

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,320
that you want to do a full

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,439
like

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,000
a full gridded check a priori but it

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,159
does kind of mean that we probably want

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,320
to

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,839
uh at least structure the collision

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,159
check to be more like the one in the

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,960
witness where we where we look at the

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,398
region first to see

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,840
uh

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:07,280
like what the voxel span is and then we

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,600
do checks on we remember

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,239
which vertices we have checked and check

32
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,679
new vertices as we need to in order to

33
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,000
figure out where

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,759
we're actually going to move through

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
um this solver is a lot easier than the

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,719
witness because it's just an open space

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
free 3d solver

38
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,599
um

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,400
the the witness has a really

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,359
uh the witness is the very hardest

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
version of the collision problem because

42
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,959
uh it

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,799
has the the

44
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,519
it it isn't

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,520
a

46
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,840
game where you move through 3d space and

47
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,078
are stopped by objects

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,280
it's that can happen but the primary

49
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,279
thing that happens in the witness

50
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,280
is that

51
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,039
the area you are allowed to walk is

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,079
actually the thing that the artist is

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,960
telling you

54
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:02,239
so first you have to solve to figure out

55
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:05,759
where the walkable surface actually is

56
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,438
and then you solve for any collisions

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,280
which is a totally different problem and

58
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,680
much harder

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,000
in our case we don't have that we are

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
just doing solves for things that are

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,919
saying

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,000
i want to move through 3d space

63
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,919
along this vector there's no need to

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,120
solve for any movable area or anything

65
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,559
like that because it's not something

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,480
that's specified

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,439
instead the only thing that's specified

68
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,159
is

69
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,400
where you like things that will stop you

70
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,318
from doing that motion

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
so that's all we have to worry about

72
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,359
which is definitely easier

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,280
so

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,080
this should be pretty easy

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,919
um

76
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,280
it's just a question of

77
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,399
writing the routine in a sensitive

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
enough way

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
that we aren't spending too much of our

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,200
time

81
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,840
testing points that we don't need to

82
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,199
test or storing too much information and

83
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
using more memory than we should and

84
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,119
things like that

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
uh but

86
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,039
you know on the on the whole it's

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
definitely an easier problem

88
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,479
so i'm going to go ahead and open up the

89
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,719
editor here i guess i'll just type cmd

90
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,719
there

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,280
and let's go ahead and

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,158
do a build

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,039
so

94
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,560
uh where we left off was we had been

95
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,000
drawing some stuff and

96
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,759
the drawing was so that we could

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,158
investigate our routine better and and

98
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,759
we kind of now we did investigating

99
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,598
better and we can sort of see what's

100
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,120
happening wrong here

101
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,119
uh and

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,400
what we determine the reason that you

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,599
know the thing that motivates this

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,680
particular uh change

105
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,878
is that you can see that like we never

106
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,480
really test these outside points

107
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,158
so we never learned that we could have

108
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,199
placed the sphere here and the reason

109
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,359
for that is that we weren't actually

110
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,359
we

111
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,599
we only use things from our side to

112
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,719
determine whether we could have gone

113
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:10,158
into there it's not like we we use the

114
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,919
the cube we're moving from

115
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,919
uh to determine whether we could have

116
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,359
gone in here or not and so for example

117
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,680
the fact that we could have moved into

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,439
this cell and then into this cell

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,079
and gotten closer

120
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,879
is never identified correctly by this

121
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,879
routine because the routine only looks

122
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,759
to see whether or not you could have

123
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:33,040
cleanly moved out of a cell directly

124
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,360
into another cell that is closer

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,600
and so that doesn't really help because

126
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,680
in cases where you're trying to move

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
around the edge of something which is

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,478
what's happening here

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,399
it will never correctly detect that you

130
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,439
that l shape that it could have moved

131
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,000
through

132
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,240
and so the solution to that problem uh

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,279
with this kind of a solver

134
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,319
is that we would need to check these

135
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,559
independently as a search

136
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,599
where we don't require intermediate

137
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,959
cells of the search to always be closer

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,759
right

139
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,439
so

140
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
you can think of this as being sort of

141
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,839
in the family

142
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,000
right now of like a star

143
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,719
without the ability

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,918
to

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,400
i mean it's not really in the family

146
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,000
based art so

147
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,679
there's lots of different things for you

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,279
know like for shortest path solving and

149
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,600
that sort of stuff you could think of

150
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,038
something like dijkstra's algorithm

151
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,960
and those are always guaranteed to get

152
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,079
the correct answer because they check

153
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,120
everything

154
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,639
right

155
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,160
then there's something like a star which

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,840
says look we're still going to check

157
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,439
everything but we're just going to

158
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,839
prioritize checking things that are

159
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,600
closer than where we already are so

160
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,119
because we'll find the path faster that

161
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
way right

162
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,079
you can think about this as the a star

163
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,160
without the actual prioritization and

164
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,279
rather we only check the things that get

165
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
closer

166
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,159
and while that oftentimes will find the

167
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,840
correct path it only finds the correct

168
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,600
path if you didn't have to go through

169
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,758
something further than where you are

170
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,319
first in order to get there

171
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,240
um so it's kind of like a star without

172
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,560
the backtracking and without the

173
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,400
backtracking a star won't find paths

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,399
sometimes that's just that's why there

175
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,560
is backtracking

176
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,599
in an algorithm like a star

177
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,680
so

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,160
what we need to do here is turn this

179
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,120
into more of a proper a star

180
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,840
style

181
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,680
search obviously this is not a star but

182
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,758
it's similar

183
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,319
um we need to turn this into a similar

184
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,800
kind of algorithm where we are checking

185
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,919
these nodes regardless of whether the

186
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,840
node actually gets you closer or further

187
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,680
we check them in a certain locus to

188
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,839
determine whether or not

189
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,319
you can get further than where you are

190
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:47,359
at the moment

191
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,520
and what we want to do is

192
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,160
if we do want to use a criteria such as

193
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,839
we check cells that are get you closer

194
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,919
to your target

195
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,159
if we do want to employ that criteria

196
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,719
that a criteria has to be employed as an

197
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,439
optimization so it doesn't have to

198
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,639
happen it's just optional that it

199
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,120
happens so that we are speeding up the

200
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,759
algorithm with that but not requiring

201
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,879
that that be true of the final path so

202
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,360
that we can still find the

203
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,038
paths around complex shapes like this

204
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,038
where there's like an l or something and

205
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,879
we want it to smoothly find

206
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:25,598
the route around it

207
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,719
so

208
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,719
what we need to do for that

209
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,918
if we go to the move entity function the

210
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,240
way you can see that it's working

211
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,279
currently is it just checks one voxel

212
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,079
cell at a time uh inside a loop and what

213
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,638
it does is it exits the loop when it

214
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,000
determines that it's tried where it

215
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,639
needs to go

216
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,399
um and we tried some like stuff in here

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,560
where it would look occasionally to go

218
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,000
to other places it this was all just you

219
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,079
know us trying to figure out if we could

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,319
get sort of a descent

221
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,560
a a direct descent kind of approach to

222
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,560
work

223
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,198
and i'm pretty convinced at this point

224
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,280
that it sort of doesn't

225
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,080
uh and so i want to switch to more of of

226
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,679
just the open field search uh and you

227
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,318
know i guess we'll start out with the

228
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,400
very slow version of this

229
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,080
first and then we'll

230
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,079
go you know we'll uh

231
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,879
we'll start with the very slow version

232
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,279
and then we'll see what kind of

233
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,639
optimizations we want to put on top of

234
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,079
it

235
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,360
now it may be the case that we don't

236
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,799
ever really care too much about

237
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,639
optimizations

238
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,559
because remember right now our routine

239
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,080
is extremely slow

240
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,439
for the reason that when it has to

241
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,360
actually test a collision it doesn't

242
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,039
have a spatial partition with which to

243
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,839
do that once you add the spatial

244
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,958
partition the checks will become

245
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,640
about eight thousand times faster right

246
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,799
um because rather than checking eight

247
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,799
thousand entities it's gonna check like

248
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,719
three right uh so not eight thousand

249
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,719
times faster two thousand times faster

250
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
so

251
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,079
uh

252
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,838
when you figure that into it

253
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,120
it may be the case that we don't care

254
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,120
that much but for large motion steps to

255
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,639
the i don't know how fast the fastest

256
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,519
things will be allowed to move in this

257
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,039
game

258
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,839
but for

259
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,838
larger steps it may still be the case

260
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,399
that you don't really want to check

261
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,720
uh all the voxels

262
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,720
you want to be more

263
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,759
judicious about

264
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,000
how you

265
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,679
you know process them or whatever it is

266
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
you're doing right

267
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,599
so i do think we need to be sort of

268
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,559
aware of that and we'll have to think

269
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,480
about how we want this to work uh

270
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,479
a little bit you know

271
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,080
more carefully as we go but i'm gonna

272
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
start with the stupidest possible

273
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,959
version

274
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,479
uh and we'll we'll sort of improve it as

275
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,278
we go

276
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,399
um

277
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:59,200
so like first of all let's let's

278
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,759
re-enable this part of this routine um

279
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,959
what we're gonna do here is rather than

280
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,039
doing this uh inside the loop we're

281
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,919
going to do it outside the loop

282
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,000
um and we're going to do

283
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,000
some yeah i mean this is going to be

284
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,559
expensive and i'm not going to care at

285
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,799
first right so we're going to do it

286
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,278
uh in the dumb way first and then we're

287
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,399
gonna do it in a smarter way uh after

288
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:23,759
that

289
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,639
the

290
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,439
diagram test here

291
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,278
uh

292
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,600
this is gonna be a little bit different

293
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:36,159
so we're gonna move this and i'm going

294
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,159
to put two diagrams in here so we have

295
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,319
one here and one here

296
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,278
something like this

297
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,600
so this way we have a diagram um for the

298
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,159
initial voxel testing

299
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,959
uh and then we have a diagram

300
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:02,719
for how we move through it and we can

301
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:05,278
kind of play with those uh separately

302
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,240
so here in the first collision voxel

303
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,399
part of things what i want to do is

304
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,240
again sort of change the notion of how

305
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,639
this is working exactly

306
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,639
you can see here that we have a 2p and a

307
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,639
from p for this vauxhall

308
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,359
uh and the problem that we're going to

309
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,399
have here is we do want to bound this

310
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,039
motion

311
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,958
uh to some kind of a maximum motion so

312
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,199
there's gonna be a little bit of that uh

313
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,838
happening as well

314
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,519
but i'm gonna probably do that in a

315
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,320
different way than

316
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,159
uh

317
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,760
i'm probably gonna do that slightly

318
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,199
differently as you'll see in a second

319
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,679
but the first thing we need to decide

320
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,240
here is what's the maximum

321
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:51,278
footprint that we're willing to test

322
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,919
uh for these voxels here right and for

323
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,039
starters we don't have to store uh

324
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,879
obviously

325
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:01,838
a b32 for that we could uh store

326
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,159
just a 8-bit value and so what i may do

327
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,680
here is just say yeah there is going to

328
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,958
be like a boolean for eights

329
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,638
right

330
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,559
um and

331
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,959
the boolean for eights

332
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,159
uh i guess would just yeah we don't

333
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,518
really need

334
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,360
to

335
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,679
do much else there

336
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,360
um would just be so that we don't

337
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,559
use a huge footprint for storing this

338
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,800
information

339
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,719
the voxel dimensions in this case

340
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,879
remember uh we're trying you know

341
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,480
assuming we want to keep this relatively

342
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,519
under control

343
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,120
um how much space do we want to

344
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,600
use for this sort of thing

345
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,639
you know if we were doing some kind of a

346
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,320
of a

347
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,320
you know for you know a 4k

348
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,719
like a thing that takes 4k to remember

349
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,639
stuff

350
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,879
is not a particularly huge deal so if we

351
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,799
wanted to we could do a 16

352
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:58,399
by 16 by 16

353
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,439
and then we have uh this voxel here that

354
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,200
is

355
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,839
stores its dimension

356
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,920
and this allows us to iterate over these

357
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,680
and uh produce you know useful

358
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,599
information here

359
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,359
we have a couple

360
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,720
things that are

361
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,759
difficult for us to deal with right

362
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,959
i

363
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,039
this

364
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,958
doing this interior part here we

365
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,559
probably want to delay right because we

366
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,759
only want to spend time looking at

367
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:31,039
voxels that we actually need to look at

368
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,639
um so we want to do something here and

369
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,838
we'll have to figure out uh what it

370
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,440
actually is and you know when i think

371
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,120
about it this b8 might not actually be

372
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,360
what we want we may actually need

373
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,720
something more like a u8 where we do

374
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,320
like

375
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,480
actual testing

376
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,399
um

377
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,560
where we set it to zero and then like

378
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,799
one is you can be there and two is you

379
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,879
can't because we need to know whether

380
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,559
we've tested particular areas or not

381
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,600
right uh so

382
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,599
you know there's that

383
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,839
um

384
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,679
well okay

385
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,480
you know what

386
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:14,159
let me say that differently

387
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,560
maybe what if we want to preserve this

388
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:20,159
maybe we don't have to do that maybe we

389
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,278
just do a b8 here for tested

390
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,198
right

391
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,838
um where we say

392
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,679
hey there's this voc this stuff is not

393
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,600
really a vox stem anymore this is just

394
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:35,039
the the local cell that you're in

395
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,600
um and we just say whether we've tested

396
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,000
this particular cell or not so that we

397
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,399
when we look and say should i move

398
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,240
should i try this

399
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,480
location

400
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,480
um

401
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,240
we just don't try ones we've already

402
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,480
been in

403
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,480
right

404
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,679
that to me seems better

405
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,600
uh because

406
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,958
that way we can preserve things like

407
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,360
testing

408
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:08,879
um for the field repulsion which we

409
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,600
needed to determine like what direction

410
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,639
uh we were supposed to move in

411
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,040
and we you know without the idea of like

412
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,560
way a way to push you out of things that

413
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,159
are colliding

414
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,479
we would have trouble

415
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,838
uh dealing with times when the game puts

416
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,360
two things in interpenetrating

417
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,959
right um

418
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,639
so i i

419
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,239
i'm just trying to like

420
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
figure out how i want to work with that

421
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,600
but that's one

422
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,599
you know that seems like one useful way

423
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,359
so in here where we've got uh

424
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,159
remembrance of the testing i think i'm

425
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,959
gonna change the the sort of meaning of

426
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,759
these

427
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,000
so what i might do here is say look vox

428
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,399
dim is gonna be this other thing that's

429
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,440
like the total dimension that the voxel

430
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,958
takes

431
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,120
uh

432
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,078
and then the individual cell testing

433
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,159
here

434
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,719
uh is just gonna be

435
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,719
you know this

436
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,360
it's it's just one cube always right

437
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,360
um and that way

438
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,919
we kind of don't still have this old

439
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,759
vestigial remain of vox dim

440
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,039
not actually meaning vox dim which is

441
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,600
just kind of something we backed into

442
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,439
because the way we're testing before

443
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,720
so if we have a thinking here where we

444
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,320
define what the voxel dimensions are uh

445
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,920
now we can actually say like okay

446
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,040
there's gonna be like a thing in here

447
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,278
that says

448
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,838
whether or not we've actually tested the

449
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,198
particular voxel

450
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,199
that we're in

451
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,958
and we have like this concept of a

452
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,599
location we

453
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,319
need to track now

454
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,240
uh this stuff in a different way

455
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,000
so you can see here like we've got this

456
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,440
like best min corner a rig corner and we

457
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,278
do like you know um this update best

458
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,560
sort of thing

459
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,879
and that's not i mean the good news is

460
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,119
that's not really gonna be necessary

461
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,798
anymore

462
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:12,038
because what we can do here is

463
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,038
we know

464
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,759
we know that we're going to be searching

465
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,160
through this

466
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,160
space

467
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,880
uh

468
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,279
and

469
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,880
really what we want to do is you know

470
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,480
the the

471
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,880
the most straightforward way to think

472
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,360
about the algorithm is imagine you test

473
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,679
all the voxels

474
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,279
and you know which of the cells you can

475
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,480
possibly

476
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,720
stay in

477
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,839
right it's any cell that has at least

478
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,759
one corner that's not colliding is a

479
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,000
cell you could stand in

480
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:54,000
right

481
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,000
well stand move in these things are

482
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,120
floating so they're not even standing

483
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,119
but you get the idea

484
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,319
you start out in one of those cells

485
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,240
and you can move to any cell

486
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:17,200
that has some common vertex with you

487
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,519
that is not colliding

488
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,160
so you can think of it as like a flood

489
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,000
fill starting from there you move out to

490
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,320
every uh

491
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,279
cell that you touch

492
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,839
adding

493
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,839
it on to the stack every time right

494
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,200
so what we really want to do here is say

495
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,880
okay

496
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,240
after we test

497
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,240
this stuff

498
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
um

499
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,440
we probably want to change this uh

500
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,759
we probably want to change the way this

501
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,320
works i'm not sure i'm not even really

502
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,879
sure why we are doing it this way

503
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,519
since this sends all of the occupied's

504
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,640
to false it's always going to not do any

505
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:12,480
of these so i don't know why these are

506
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,480
not just in the loop

507
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,120
um

508
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,919
i see why because basically all we

509
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,679
wanted to do here was say look proceed

510
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,240
as if you could move through anything

511
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,400
take the best point um but we're gonna

512
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,640
change where you're trying to get to

513
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,640
right

514
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,960
um and that seems

515
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,359
that seems reasonable i guess

516
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,440
uh so anyway

517
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,880
if we take a look at how this is going

518
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,440
right uh

519
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,160
what we want to do here is

520
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,840
move

521
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,640
we want to keep a stack

522
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,759
right and the stack is however

523
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,200
uh

524
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:03,599
many places we still need to try

525
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
so you can think about this as being the

526
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,879
thing that tells us whether or not we

527
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,960
can move into a space or not because

528
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,240
whether or not we've tested it we would

529
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,400
also need a thing that says which voxel

530
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,759
index we're actually looking at

531
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,759
and if you think about how we're going

532
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,000
to address this we probably want to

533
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,558
start thinking of it this way so that we

534
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,960
can just use a single integer to refer

535
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,879
to uh the point that we're actually

536
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,440
using so you know we can just do

537
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,159
something like this um

538
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,080
like uh voxel stack right

539
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,159
and you know however many of these we

540
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,639
want to actually be able to track this

541
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,080
is way more than we actually need uh but

542
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,080
it doesn't really matter

543
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,519
um and then we'll have a box of stack

544
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,480
depth right

545
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,798
and so what we want to do here is take

546
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,880
the initial position that you're in and

547
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,038
we want to push that onto the voxel

548
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,600
stack and then from there we want to

549
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,960
test that one and add the things onto

550
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,480
the stack

551
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,960
uh that are

552
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,720
like neighbors to it right so the first

553
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,840
thing we would do here is we would do

554
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,159
something like voxel stack

555
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,639
voxel stack depth equals

556
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,640
something

557
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,240
right um

558
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,360
we need a way

559
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,400
uh to look like so something like this

560
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,119
right

561
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,559
we have a position in the voxel and we

562
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,399
need to know what its index is

563
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,960
for tracking purposes

564
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:46,400
so we need to be able to say

565
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,640
uh okay produce a voxel stack value uh

566
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,679
from

567
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,880
you know from some positional value

568
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,240
and

569
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,240
it doesn't really look like

570
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,440
i i don't know that that makes a

571
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:09,599
tremendous amount of

572
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,600
sense the way i've got it now um

573
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,879
so i'm going to kind of think about this

574
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,200
a slightly different way but you know

575
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,159
there's going to be an initial

576
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,319
voxel position kind of thing right

577
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,720
um

578
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,720
current voxley

579
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,679
we'll do it like that

580
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,200
so we're starting on the stack uh we

581
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,159
pushed one on each time through this

582
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
loop

583
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,880
uh

584
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,480
right we're gonna basically say like

585
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,000
okay while the voxel stack that

586
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,240
is not zero

587
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,240
right

588
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,960
uh we're going to pull off one of these

589
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,719
indexes

590
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,159
so we're going to do

591
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,480
a voxel stack depth minus minus

592
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,480
um

593
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,119
and

594
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,919
probably something like this

595
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,038
so we'll pull a voxel index off the

596
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,679
stack we will have to compute it now

597
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,119
from this so this voxel min corner cell

598
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,519
dim thing

599
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,759
the voxelmen corner will have to be

600
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:29,798
determined from this

601
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,798
so it will basically be

602
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,079
something that looks like this right

603
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,038
like some way to to generate

604
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:47,199
a minimum corner from an index that we

605
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,599
store on the stack and we could make

606
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
this actually just store corners

607
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,879
um

608
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,038
but it would be more and you know maybe

609
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,520
i should do that first i don't know

610
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:00,319
uh because you know be less error-prone

611
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,158
and then we we convert to

612
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,278
something that generates indexes

613
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,840
separately

614
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:05,839
um

615
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,679
the problem is you have to go one way or

616
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,798
the other right so i'm not sure that

617
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,798
that really

618
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,319
matters much but

619
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:19,519
anyway

620
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,599
um so when we come through here i

621
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,960
suppose what we would probably say is

622
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,158
all right when we pull this off

623
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,840
uh

624
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,840
the current voxel index

625
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:36,879
value would also be an index into the

626
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,278
tested array so in other words you know

627
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,278
and we could

628
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,120
we could double check that um

629
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,440
but basically we would say look if we

630
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:56,000
have not tested this value

631
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,840
uh then we do whatever it is we're going

632
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,200
to do inside the voxel loop but if not

633
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,038
we just don't

634
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,000
right so we skip

635
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,839
any of these that we've already tested

636
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,919
um

637
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,918
because you know we don't need to test

638
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,919
them

639
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,720
okay so assuming that we haven't tested

640
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,038
it uh then we'll basically say that we

641
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,038
have

642
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,120
uh and then we'll go through and

643
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:34,400
actually do the testing so we produce

644
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,000
them in corner uh we test for the

645
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,038
occupying

646
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,200
uh whatever right

647
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:45,359
uh we then go and this stuff uh now

648
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,360
really doesn't have to happen

649
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,919
uh i don't think

650
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,078
so

651
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,079
[Music]

652
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,519
so i

653
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:07,278
i'm gonna have to think rocket bean

654
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,038
rocket rocket come here what are you

655
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,839
doing over there

656
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:11,839
what are you doing

657
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,880
we've got an intransigent plus we've got

658
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:17,679
a transfers and puss

659
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,159
um

660
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,320
all right so anyway uh

661
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,120
when

662
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:28,079
when we push these on the stack

663
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,719
i have to think it through but i believe

664
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,720
we will be able like i don't actually

665
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,319
think we will need to do any additional

666
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,480
work to

667
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:39,038
make it track through

668
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,720
the closest starting with the things

669
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,000
that are likely to be closest and ending

670
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,120
with the things that are likely to be

671
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,880
furthest

672
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,199
and i think

673
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,360
so i think the reason for that is that

674
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,360
if you just look at this code right here

675
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,400
um you should be able to just order the

676
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:00,000
order you push the voxels onto the stack

677
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,919
should just

678
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,480
as long as you do them in the order from

679
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,480
direction we're going to

680
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,000
opposite direction we're going as long

681
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,480
as you push them in that order you'll

682
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,960
automatically check the things that go

683
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,200
in the correct direction first

684
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,200
right

685
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:23,119
so i don't know that we really need too

686
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,679
much more than that um

687
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,158
but i could be wrong so you know we'll

688
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,159
we'll see

689
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,200
um so we don't really need update best

690
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,879
anymore uh

691
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,480
really all we need to do

692
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,440
is

693
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,159
to to have each of the things so

694
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,919
we still want effectively this

695
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,919
right uh it still is

696
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
um

697
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,079
it still is exactly this series of

698
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,479
things

699
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,278
it's just that instead of it being

700
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,880
having a best on here it's really just

701
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:03,679
going to do pushes onto this stack right

702
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,919
so uh

703
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,240
this is really gonna be like

704
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,240
um

705
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,319
push voxel

706
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,079
check or something right

707
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,759
so really all we're doing here is push

708
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,759
fox will check

709
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,839
on each of these

710
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,038
as we flood fill through the space of

711
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,199
things to look at and we're just going

712
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,558
to let four coder indent this wrong

713
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,080
if it does oh no it indented it

714
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:29,440
correctly

715
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,599
that was weird

716
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:36,399
oh wow so basically like if you

717
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,398
if you indent a block for a coder block

718
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,439
indents it correctly but if you

719
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,839
in a line it doesn't hm that's

720
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,480
all

721
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,918
right uh i should update probably to the

722
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,278
latest version of forecoder because my

723
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,399
understanding was that got fixed and i

724
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:52,960
guess i can see why because it looks

725
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:54,879
like it wasn't actually broken it's only

726
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,319
when you indent a single line that it

727
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,440
has that problem so it's probably just a

728
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,439
like a

729
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,038
a state bug some or something right

730
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,440
because when you do the block it it

731
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,679
doesn't screw it up

732
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,679
um

733
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,678
so yeah

734
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,038
so when we're doing this kind of flood

735
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,480
fill i think that these checks are

736
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,480
probably not

737
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,679
i i think that these checks are probably

738
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,759
not the kinds of checks exactly that we

739
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,640
want the the reason for that is i think

740
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,519
what we want to do is just use an or

741
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,960
right

742
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,639
so i think we want to do here is say

743
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,960
that look if you want to move from one

744
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,038
cell to the other if any vertex that

745
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,038
they shared wasn't was

746
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,839
um

747
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,519
if any verdict that they shared could

748
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,398
have been moved through then you can

749
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,158
move through it you know what i'm saying

750
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,839
so i think

751
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,399
you know these should really just be

752
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,959
ores like if because that means that

753
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:13,199
there was a place you could have stood

754
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,759
in between the two cells right so i

755
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,240
think it just means this right this is

756
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,319
what's actually happening here

757
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,278
uh so if you look at how this push voxel

758
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,119
check would work

759
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,398
you can see here that this is moving

760
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,239
through you got one two three four five

761
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,719
six seven

762
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,679
uh this is testing seven of the

763
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,278
neighboring cells of the voxel

764
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,200
and

765
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:42,079
you know how many should there be

766
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,000
ideally it would be

767
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,519
so there's nine

768
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,079
at the top

769
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,119
nine at the bottom is 18

770
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:54,079
and then the ones right around it it's

771
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,918
its own self doesn't count

772
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,839
so it's an additional eight so it would

773
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,880
be 26

774
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,959
right

775
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,960
is how many you should be able to move

776
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,960
into

777
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,798
is that right

778
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:18,480
um so this moves

779
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:20,798
one two three four five six seven

780
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,798
um

781
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,119
it seems weirdly low

782
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,119
because

783
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,479
so one two three four this is one of

784
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,558
those ones which probably just draw it

785
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,440
out so there's four on the top three on

786
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,759
the bottom is where the seven comes from

787
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,759
um

788
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,839
so you'd add another four

789
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,278
i guess that number checks out yeah okay

790
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,398
i guess that number checks out

791
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,880
um

792
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:17,678
so yeah so if we look at all of the the

793
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,480
possible motions here and

794
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,320
uh

795
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,798
we

796
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,798
assuming

797
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,679
um

798
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,640
i guess

799
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,798
yeah so

800
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,038
what i'm thinking here is

801
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,480
we probably just want to be able to

802
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,119
check

803
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,278
um so the the tried opposite stuff you

804
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,119
can sort of see us try you know

805
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,159
we're switching to each of we switch

806
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,158
each of these as we go

807
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,798
it's unclear whether we want to support

808
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,320
moving in directions i guess that's all

809
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:01,839
i'm saying it's unclear that we want to

810
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,839
support moving in directions that are

811
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,959
literally like directly away from where

812
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,798
we're going

813
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,319
that might not be something we actually

814
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,319
want it to do and i don't know

815
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,519
but if you look at how many of these

816
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,519
pushes we're doing here

817
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,039
i'm trying to think if there's any way

818
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,038
to do this in a more efficient way

819
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,278
because you're just gonna end up doing a

820
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,200
lot of unnecessary checking as you step

821
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,720
through here right you you really don't

822
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,798
want to

823
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,038
have to do quite so many checks as you

824
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,038
flood fill

825
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,000
you know what so i think here's the

826
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,359
thing since we are now searching the

827
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,319
space

828
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,119
i guess we don't actually need to do

829
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,480
this

830
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,879
we can literally just check

831
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,798
up down left just the six

832
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,120
main directions

833
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:01,119
right

834
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,359
yeah

835
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,119
so we can literally just check the six

836
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,519
main directions

837
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,679
because if you can move

838
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,759
if you could move if if you could have

839
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,878
moved through a corner you will now

840
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,720
detect that case by moving first into

841
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,639
what you know by moving around the

842
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,398
corner by cubes because each one of them

843
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,639
is connected by one vertex

844
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,638
so i think that's all we actually need

845
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,760
and that'll be much better

846
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,960
so basically this is all we actually

847
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,200
need just the two versions of this i

848
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,639
should first change that to best it's

849
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,598
actually going to be like something like

850
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,599
stack right

851
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,320
um

852
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,398
so yeah it's really just pushing these

853
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,480
on and in fact we can have the compiler

854
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,159
do this for us hopefully

855
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,280
famous last words

856
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,240
um

857
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,599
by just doing like a negation right i

858
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:05,479
don't know if it'll actually do this for

859
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:05,480
us or not but um you know

860
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,559
so hopefully we can get the compiler to

861
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,240
do this

862
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,920
for us

863
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,598
it's always annoying to even have to

864
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,358
think about that

865
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,119
it's yet another reason why like you

866
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:35,598
should just be able to

867
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,640
have had in c just like

868
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,280
that

869
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,440
and it would just do it

870
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,359
like it's like it's not an option like

871
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,280
you don't get to decide whether you

872
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,598
unroll this loop like you will on you

873
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,760
will unroll the loop

874
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,720
um i think clang has like a directive

875
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,839
for that you could pass but it should

876
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,838
have been in the language

877
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,280
um

878
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,240
so anyway in here where we do these push

879
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,400
checks uh then all we're gonna do is say

880
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:07,759
uh and in fact

881
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,838
um

882
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,560
i suppose

883
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,559
i could do something like this

884
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,759
i and so that way we can just do like oh

885
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:29,279
yeah we'll test

886
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,560
you know we'll test the directions that

887
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,560
are but because we want it to kind of be

888
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,440
yes you really want it to be this where

889
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,800
you chest the positive direction first

890
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,320
right

891
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,320
and the negative direction second

892
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,319
like that's really what we want right

893
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,240
um and so

894
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,239
you know uh

895
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,039
in here where we do these sides then

896
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,759
it's just like uh oh well you know what

897
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:09,480
no we could let's just do this

898
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,480
original way was fine

899
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,559
really we just want this to be

900
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,559
[Music]

901
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,320
i feel like i'm getting too fancy

902
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,440
i was trying to figure out a way to

903
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,440
write that

904
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,838
you know fancier but i think i'm just

905
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,838
not gonna

906
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,358
uh so in here

907
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,960
we

908
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:46,960
maybe just do something like this

909
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,559
and just look it up directly

910
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,680
and that just seems that just seems more

911
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,838
sane to me

912
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:04,000
so in here we have like the side z

913
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:06,320
whatever nonsense so in here we just say

914
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,679
look the side z

915
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,160
equals

916
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,039
side.z or whatever and we just say

917
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,480
either

918
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,719
use it or don't depending on

919
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,599
which one you're doing so if you're on

920
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,239
zero

921
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,760
you use the original if you're on one

922
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:23,199
you use the negative

923
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,440
and that's all there is

924
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:25,439
you know

925
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,119
and this is just to get the compiler to

926
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,880
generate these checks for us

927
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,119
and so then we don't

928
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,079
need any of this we just say

929
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,079
okay

930
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,079
if

931
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:51,279
uh

932
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,440
i suppose this is going to be easier

933
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,200
said than done but yeah because now that

934
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,639
i think about it like we gotta we got a

935
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,000
bit of a brain bender if we want to

936
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,519
actually have the compiler generate this

937
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,960
for us but

938
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,039
um

939
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,679
you know for each of these

940
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:08,000
we're going to want to negate

941
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,000
uh

942
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,880
yeah okay never mind

943
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,079
like if we were really going to do this

944
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,519
we could actually try to make that

945
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,119
generate out of the iteration but then i

946
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:26,119
was like ah that's that's a bridge too

947
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,119
far

948
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,319
so what we've actually got is this

949
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,799
uh where we

950
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,960
we want to test each of these

951
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,480
uh where we say okay

952
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,720
you know like

953
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,240
here's our if statement assuming that

954
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,159
this passes does this mean i can get

955
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,358
this indentable yeah that's really weird

956
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,480
okay

957
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,679
um

958
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,679
so here's our

959
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,920
here's our actual uh checks and for each

960
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,719
of these we're just going to do

961
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,079
the

962
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,078
the manual check and

963
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,118
negate each one

964
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:11,358
and since we're only going to talk about

965
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,199
two of these i don't even know why i'm

966
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:14,960
bothered with these extra ones because

967
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,719
we can just actually flip them all

968
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,440
because we're multiplying the loop by

969
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,799
three right by having the interior

970
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,838
um so really we just need one like

971
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,839
flip check

972
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:31,170
[Music]

973
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,480
and we test the negative direction when

974
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,480
we do the flip check

975
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,920
so

976
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,839
uh after testing each of those

977
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,880
we know that we would push this

978
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:48,078
particular voxel um

979
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,838
you know onto the stack so using code uh

980
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,960
similar to that

981
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:55,920
and we probably we would also need some

982
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,240
way of preventing uh the stack

983
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,240
from

984
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,000
from growing like

985
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:06,239
too large

986
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,920
so we would need an assertion

987
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,959
at some point here

988
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,960
that's like hey

989
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,280
right and we need to

990
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,039
do a computation where we determine like

991
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,319
what is the largest

992
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:23,920
uh

993
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,679
you know what's the what's the largest

994
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,680
that this thing

995
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,679
can practically be so that we make sure

996
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,239
that the stack is large enough to handle

997
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,719
the largest possible search given though

998
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,239
you know it'll be some

999
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,959
proportion

1000
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,959
of the total

1001
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,400
it would probably be like

1002
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:48,159
16 times 16 times 4 would be my guess

1003
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,160
so it'd probably be like 10 24 or

1004
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,000
something like that honestly which would

1005
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:55,199
be really bad right which is what you

1006
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,159
know maybe this is arguably like too

1007
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,960
large

1008
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:59,920
um

1009
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,960
and it should be smaller that's totally

1010
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,519
uh

1011
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,760
that's a totally plausible

1012
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,759
um

1013
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:12,318
it might actually be times six too

1014
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,119
yeah i mean it's just it's quite large

1015
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:15,039
uh

1016
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,640
is the problem but anyway

1017
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,559
uh the reason i say that is because in

1018
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,239
theory if you're flood filling the space

1019
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:21,838
you know you you're going to you're

1020
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,759
never going to actually have to push on

1021
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,519
everything that's in the volume but you

1022
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,839
would have to push on something

1023
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,880
proportional to the total surface area

1024
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:34,078
of the volume right um

1025
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,200
and so if you imagine a 16 by 16 by 16

1026
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,280
cube

1027
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:40,159
um the total surface area is going to be

1028
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,480
16 times 16

1029
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:46,399
roughly times six one for each face and

1030
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,760
it's not counting the shared

1031
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,760
uh pieces around but you know

1032
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:54,239
so

1033
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,240
yeah that's quite a bit

1034
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,960
uh which is why maybe this is

1035
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,838
a bit much

1036
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,119
you know what i'm saying um but again

1037
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:04,400
you know we'll we'll cross that bridge

1038
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,559
when we come to it

1039
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,400
or or we won't

1040
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:13,639
so when we actually do these tests to

1041
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,639
figure out

1042
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:19,358
uh what we're pushing on

1043
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,719
then we

1044
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:24,799
why

1045
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,799
why is that an illegal size of operand

1046
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,838
oh

1047
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,989
um

1048
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,199
so

1049
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:42,000
[Music]

1050
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,838
i think now mostly the problem we have

1051
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,838
is we don't have the way to actually

1052
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:49,279
produce these voxel indexes but this is

1053
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,279
roughly what the routine would look like

1054
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,639
uh each time through

1055
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,318
and we need also to produce uh the

1056
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,519
closest point

1057
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,759
here

1058
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,759
for each of these so um

1059
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:09,759
this part is going to be uh an

1060
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,079
interesting question depending on

1061
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,079
um

1062
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:21,040
how accurate of a guess we want

1063
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,440
if we want a extremely accurate guess we

1064
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,800
would need to use some kind of a root

1065
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,000
find

1066
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,000
so we we would call

1067
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,159
refine voxel placement

1068
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,159
on each

1069
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,358
on each cell to see what the closest

1070
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,960
point

1071
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,159
would be

1072
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,480
i don't think we actually want to do

1073
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:48,159
that we probably only want to do refined

1074
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,440
voxel placement when we finish

1075
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,799
um

1076
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,679
so that'll be

1077
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,680
you know this

1078
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,599
uh

1079
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,519
this will be sort of a different

1080
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,680
yeah a different point

1081
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,440
so we'll probably just call get closest

1082
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,279
point um

1083
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,599
inbox conservative

1084
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,599
right

1085
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,039
and

1086
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,838
and honestly i'm

1087
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,838
so this is not really very good either

1088
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,000
um so i don't think this refinement step

1089
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,159
would actually work anymore

1090
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,039
we would need to have some kind of an

1091
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:05,039
understanding of like where we which

1092
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,480
cell we came from

1093
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,318
um

1094
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,719
in order to do it that way

1095
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:12,480
so how we actually do the refinement

1096
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:14,159
step at the end

1097
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,199
is

1098
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,719
more of an open question

1099
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:20,719
um

1100
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,039
and probably has to take into account

1101
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:26,399
that voxel information so

1102
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,759
we're gonna have to do some

1103
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,039
we're gonna have to do some fancier

1104
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,040
footwork in here for sure

1105
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,358
uh yeah so the problem here again yeah

1106
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,199
is like

1107
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:40,960
the pushing this stuff on the voxel

1108
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,199
um

1109
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,159
we need to determine

1110
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,639
what these new voxel points are

1111
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,920
we probably also need to do

1112
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:54,078
uh some testing here to determine

1113
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,039
whether or not we can actually put

1114
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,440
anything in here um

1115
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,838
because we're gonna have problems of

1116
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,880
stepping outside the voxel

1117
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,119
so

1118
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,280
when we push things in they would have

1119
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,838
to get rejected in that way

1120
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,839
right um

1121
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,119
so

1122
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,599
encoding these into a 32-bit number is

1123
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,839
pretty trivial i don't know that we

1124
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,079
really need to do it i could just use a

1125
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:07,759
v3s to start with and have the x y and z

1126
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:11,119
just stored in there

1127
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,440
uh and that might be a better way to go

1128
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,720
at first just to make sure we don't add

1129
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,960
additional things

1130
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:21,318
meaning something like this

1131
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,318
would be a better thing to do

1132
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:39,279
and you know we don't really have

1133
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,880
anything like this currently but you

1134
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:45,079
know this is the kind of thing that i

1135
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,079
would see doing like a

1136
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:50,959
something like this for because i think

1137
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,280
we're just going to have too much stuff

1138
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,079
to track here so i'm going to go ahead

1139
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,079
and say something like this

1140
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,400
and

1141
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:26,399
this way i can

1142
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:31,000
[Music]

1143
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,000
use helper functions too

1144
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,480
right

1145
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,000
and you can create one of these voxel

1146
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,358
stacks and

1147
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,280
it will

1148
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:40,799
uh you know we can make some helper

1149
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,760
functions right

1150
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,760
so we can and you know uh this will also

1151
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,720
prevent us from pushing things on and

1152
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,119
it'll get rid of this basically right so

1153
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,879
this call we won't need to do anymore we

1154
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,800
can just have the

1155
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,519
the thing that does the push does the

1156
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:02,000
check which is better right

1157
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:04,480
so we can do push box stack we

1158
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,480
pass in

1159
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,759
um

1160
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:11,598
the index

1161
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,359
and here we can do a bunch of testing on

1162
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,359
the index where we say

1163
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,880
for now i guess i can even just do this

1164
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:29,199
where we say

1165
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,200
the depth

1166
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,400
uh will not get pushed

1167
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:42,159
unless all of the checks passed first

1168
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,160
so basically like uh

1169
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:53,480
i don't know if we've got an actual so

1170
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,480
we have a voxel grid

1171
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,760
you know we could actually just use the

1172
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,759
voxel grid that we have

1173
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,879
um

1174
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:12,879
so like

1175
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,599
this

1176
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,440
right

1177
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,318
um we could actually do that and the

1178
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,960
cell count we would just set to be you

1179
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:27,199
know whatever this is

1180
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,199
um

1181
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:33,039
that seems plausible vaguely

1182
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,079
yeah

1183
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:37,199
i can see that being a thing

1184
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,720
um

1185
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,000
so we could do something like that and

1186
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:45,719
then in here we would just say look uh

1187
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,719
if it's in the bounds

1188
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:55,679
uh then that's great

1189
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:00,719
um

1190
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,960
we also need to assert that we've got

1191
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:02,959
room

1192
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:07,318
because like i said i don't know

1193
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,800
and then we will push it

1194
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,079
um

1195
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,239
so in here we're basically saying all

1196
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,599
right we've got this voxel stack uh it's

1197
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:35,598
going to use the voxel grid thing so

1198
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,240
that we can use that for testing

1199
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,160
uh we will uh

1200
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:41,838
uh check to see whether it's in the in

1201
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,480
the grid and then assuming that it's

1202
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:49,519
inbounds that means we can

1203
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,519
uh check for tested right

1204
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,599
so we can say if we haven't already

1205
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:56,959
pushed this on

1206
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,039
right

1207
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,720
um and what i might do is change this to

1208
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,639
like pushed

1209
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,959
so that we just say look as soon as you

1210
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:04,960
push

1211
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,519
we remember that

1212
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,838
so we will only let you push something

1213
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,800
on if that something has never been

1214
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:16,799
pushed on before

1215
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:22,480
so that seems like a good push voxel

1216
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,039
stack

1217
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,480
right that will work okay

1218
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:27,838
uh and that way we just like throw

1219
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,280
things on there and we know that it's

1220
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,358
only going to add things that we haven't

1221
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,800
tested yet

1222
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:37,799
and that way in here we just do

1223
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,800
uh

1224
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,800
so so yeah so this

1225
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:51,039
is it's not really negative right

1226
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,519
because it's zero or one

1227
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,519
so it's it's really just not

1228
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:58,239
right if it was zero it becomes one if

1229
00:53:55,519 --> 00:54:00,559
it was one it becomes zero

1230
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:00,558
um

1231
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:05,838
as as we add through here

1232
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,960
right

1233
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:11,519
so at some point here we've got

1234
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,720
like a current voxel eye

1235
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:13,519
um

1236
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:15,199
and

1237
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:18,400
here we go like

1238
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:18,399
pop voxel stack

1239
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,039
right

1240
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,039
none of this happens anymore

1241
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,119
so

1242
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,000
there's going to be the pop box the

1243
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,559
stack call and that will get us uh

1244
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,239
whatever our you know our

1245
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,240
box corner is out of here

1246
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:43,759
and so then in order to push these

1247
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,760
it's just going to be like

1248
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,400
for each of those sides

1249
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,400
um

1250
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:07,480
we should probably push zeon last

1251
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:07,479
as well

1252
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,559
uh for each of these sides

1253
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,960
we want to push on the

1254
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,318
the correct step whichever direction

1255
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,599
that is

1256
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:37,358
you know

1257
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:40,000
and it's gonna be like

1258
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:44,639
zero or one has to translate to like

1259
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,639
zero to like negative one or one

1260
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,720
so when we look at what voxel has to get

1261
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:53,280
pushed on here it's like

1262
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,159
you know there's a next voxel eye

1263
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,920
right

1264
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:57,920
and it's current voxel eye

1265
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:04,078
but then

1266
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,599
whichever one of these we're stepping

1267
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,720
along so like in this case x

1268
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,079
um

1269
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:11,039
has to be

1270
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,400
like

1271
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:19,119
added to by either one or negative one

1272
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:21,838
so if the direction we were going here

1273
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,760
uh if it was zero then we need to go

1274
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:28,078
backwards if it was

1275
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,079
one we need to go forwards right

1276
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,798
what is it booba

1277
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:34,798
oh how you doing

1278
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:37,838
did you need tummy kisses you need tummy

1279
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:37,838
kisses yes you do

1280
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,480
because you're a big tiny tiger

1281
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:45,280
you're just a tiny tiger at the end of

1282
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:48,079
the day

1283
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,079
the puss arrive

1284
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,440
um

1285
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,680
why did the twitch track go away

1286
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,680
nobody knows

1287
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:58,679
um

1288
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,200
this is the puss

1289
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:37,759
uh yes so the reason that sphere

1290
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,760
collision geometries help sliding around

1291
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:43,359
corners with search and p is because the

1292
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,119
points that will be included in the

1293
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:45,920
movement are different

1294
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,519
right

1295
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,079
so if you imagine

1296
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:53,519
the corner

1297
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,280
if you're in a voxel search and you are

1298
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:58,000
knocking out points

1299
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,040
using a radius like a sphere

1300
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,639
that's

1301
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,719
rounded

1302
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:05,039
the corners will tend to have voxels you

1303
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:07,199
can move around whereas if it's hard

1304
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,838
edge they won't

1305
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:09,838
you know what i mean

1306
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,440
um

1307
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:15,599
so it re but

1308
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,440
in the case of um

1309
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,519
where we're searching to uh where we're

1310
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,440
switching to the full search and not the

1311
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:23,358
parcel search like we need before

1312
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,920
it probably won't matter

1313
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:28,159
um because now we're actually going to

1314
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,079
search wide so the search and p should

1315
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:33,598
be able to find

1316
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,599
should be able to find that motion

1317
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,319
if this if you widen the search space

1318
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,318
enough

1319
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,640
right

1320
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,639
um

1321
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,519
and i don't know i don't know what

1322
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,519
that'll end up looking like

1323
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,519
uh but yeah in theory like in theory we

1324
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,440
could turn off spheres

1325
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,519
if the search space is wide enough and

1326
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,720
it would find it would find it without

1327
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:03,719
you don't need the sphere anymore right

1328
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:03,719
um

1329
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:09,759
it would still it would still find it

1330
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,719
the motion would be

1331
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,720
like

1332
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,798
it would be an l-shaped motion instead

1333
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:18,118
of a curved motion but it would still

1334
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,119
find it

1335
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:35,279
okay

1336
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,280
so

1337
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,599
here's us moving around the vox oops

1338
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,598
around the voxel

1339
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,838
um

1340
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,960
and

1341
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,200
i

1342
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:11,199
think

1343
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:16,480
uh that's all we need for that part of

1344
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,480
the code

1345
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,760
um we need the pop function

1346
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,400
um and there's a couple different ways

1347
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,358
we could do this uh my guess is it would

1348
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,400
maybe

1349
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:43,400
make

1350
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,400
um

1351
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,519
so

1352
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,559
there's one other thing that we need to

1353
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,839
do

1354
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,839
as an optimization

1355
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,279
we don't have to do it yet

1356
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,838
um

1357
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,838
so there's something that we have to

1358
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,359
also take a look at here which is that

1359
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:02,558
at some point

1360
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:04,318
you know you can terminate this routine

1361
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:07,760
because you've searched all of the

1362
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:09,599
places that you could have put

1363
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,880
that that could have generated a closer

1364
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,480
point

1365
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,079
and that's kind of a tough one um

1366
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,400
to think through so that's going to be

1367
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,359
another thing right because

1368
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,838
you know

1369
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:25,679
if you've already tested all of the

1370
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:27,358
space around immediately surrounding the

1371
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:29,919
destination point like where you're

1372
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:29,920
trying to go

1373
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:35,038
um

1374
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:37,440
then you don't really need to

1375
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,039
test any more cubes right if you've

1376
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,159
already tested all of them and found the

1377
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:44,240
closest point among that set of cubes

1378
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:46,078
and you know you could go there you

1379
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:47,759
don't need to test anything that's like

1380
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,559
further away from that anymore because

1381
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,640
there's no way to get a better result

1382
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:54,880
so we need to kind of like work through

1383
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:58,920
that part as well but we're you know one

1384
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,920
step at a time right

1385
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,279
all right so

1386
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:22,919
let's see

1387
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:36,159
okay

1388
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,679
so we're going to call this cell i and

1389
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:39,519
we're going to call this depth just so

1390
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:41,519
it's clear what's going on here uh we're

1391
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:46,880
going to push one of these on each time

1392
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:46,880
then we're going to take the cell i here

1393
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:54,480
and do the pop

1394
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:01,118
we're also going to do an assertion

1395
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:04,239
that the stack depth

1396
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:06,160
is greater than zero

1397
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:08,639
and i'm going to have a function

1398
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:08,639
called

1399
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,000
uh

1400
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,240
not empty

1401
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,239
right

1402
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,358
uh and that's going to be

1403
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,559
this

1404
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,318
all right

1405
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,839
um

1406
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:41,838
so we can then do our loop our loop is

1407
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:41,838
just while the stack is not empty

1408
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:59,759
and we'll have a push voxel stack here

1409
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:01,759
uh that does a

1410
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,000
push onto the stack with the initial vox

1411
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,000
lie

1412
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,599
um and because we need to do a

1413
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,880
conditional push here i'm going to have

1414
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,200
like a

1415
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,480
condition that you tack on

1416
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:15,838
and so we'll just see like if the

1417
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,760
condition is true

1418
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:18,558
that you pass in

1419
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,400
um

1420
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,480
because you know

1421
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,400
uh

1422
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,719
well okay so we have the if statement

1423
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,599
here yeah maybe this if statement just

1424
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:30,239
goes

1425
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,240
on the end

1426
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:36,480
right i think i liked that better

1427
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:39,760
um

1428
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:42,798
well you know but then again

1429
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,160
why make it more complicated

1430
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:45,440
since i already did that i guess that's

1431
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:46,558
fine

1432
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,240
uh okay

1433
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:52,640
so i think that's everything there

1434
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:54,159
so we push something on to the stack

1435
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,318
initially

1436
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,318
we

1437
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,160
uh we need to compute what that actually

1438
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:02,558
is that's fine we

1439
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:03,440
loop while the stack has something on it

1440
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,720
we

1441
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,400
pop uh stuff off of the stack to as we

1442
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,919
go right

1443
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,680
um and

1444
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,880
we actually know

1445
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:16,480
now because we have one of these we can

1446
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,039
produce the

1447
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,358
point for like the center or the minimum

1448
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,520
or whatever uh

1449
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:25,038
like cells you know get cell bounds or

1450
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,960
whatever

1451
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,000
we can produce that

1452
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,440
uh

1453
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,440
directly so i think we can just do

1454
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:37,280
get cell bounds now

1455
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,280
where we do like stack grid

1456
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:46,359
uh and then the index

1457
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,359
so i think that just works

1458
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:55,038
right off the bat now because we can

1459
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:57,199
just use that code we already had

1460
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,599
um we have a

1461
01:06:57,199 --> 01:07:01,038
this stuff is irrelevant now

1462
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,318
and we've got some other things we've

1463
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,640
got to look at

1464
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:06,000
as we go

1465
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,798
and

1466
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,440
so yeah like

1467
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:13,679
we have the problem with embedding

1468
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,280
and i don't really know what we want to

1469
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:17,199
do about that you can see here we've got

1470
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:20,160
sort of this notion that like if you are

1471
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:22,000
embedded in this particular voxel

1472
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:25,440
um then there's a question of like how

1473
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,440
do you get out of it right

1474
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:32,880
and my assumption here is that that sort

1475
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:35,880
of wants to be something that we do

1476
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,880
um

1477
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:53,598
like like i'm not sure how the what the

1478
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:56,480
best way is to

1479
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,798
to handle embedding in here

1480
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,798
you know

1481
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:02,838
um

1482
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:21,399
yeah it's tough call

1483
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:27,678
uh

1484
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:30,880
i'm gonna leave it the way it is now i'm

1485
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:33,119
just not entirely sure like exactly how

1486
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,119
uh

1487
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:43,319
yeah how we want to do that uh anyway

1488
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,319
so

1489
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:56,960
so really mostly what we're looking at

1490
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,319
here

1491
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,640
is this

1492
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,640
um

1493
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:07,838
the get closest point in box

1494
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,838
conservative

1495
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,158
i think will just work

1496
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,838
so i think this is almost the entire

1497
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,640
loop all we really need to do now is

1498
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:32,158
just say all right this is just going to

1499
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,159
track the best voxel

1500
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:38,279
um

1501
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:40,880
and then the only thing i'm not clear

1502
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:42,719
about uh because you can see sort of how

1503
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,400
this is gonna work right

1504
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,679
so we don't

1505
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:47,358
need like

1506
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:50,000
like none of this stuff

1507
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:52,159
is a thing anymore

1508
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,039
right like that's not

1509
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:56,238
we don't actually need any of that

1510
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:59,760
um

1511
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:04,639
so that goes away and

1512
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,640
we don't need any of this anymore either

1513
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:14,839
so the only question now is

1514
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,840
first of all we have to be able to

1515
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,279
produce the correct index for the

1516
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,600
starting point in the voxel and the

1517
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:26,960
voxel bounds so we got to do that as a

1518
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,159
separate thing we'll deal with that in a

1519
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,840
second

1520
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:31,519
uh but then we've got this problem of

1521
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,119
like okay so

1522
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,360
in terms of like

1523
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:35,359
the

1524
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,119
in terms of how we like accept motion

1525
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,679
here

1526
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:44,800
we need to start off by saying

1527
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:46,319
that there is like a best cell

1528
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,679
that we found

1529
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:50,719
and presumably that's like

1530
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,719
you know

1531
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,640
initialized to like

1532
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,399
whatever the starting cell is like the

1533
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,280
best cell is just wherever we are right

1534
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:01,039
now if we haven't found anything better

1535
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:02,319
um and then there's probably a best

1536
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:04,960
distance

1537
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:06,799
which is like whatever that

1538
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:10,158
was so

1539
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:13,119
this cell's closest point

1540
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:15,439
like is gonna be the best one

1541
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:15,439
um

1542
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,640
actually no you know what i think it's

1543
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:26,639
just gonna be this

1544
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,239
so the reason for that is if we start

1545
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,880
out embedded we don't want to consider

1546
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:33,599
that to be a legitimate place to put the

1547
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,239
player so we're going to ignore that

1548
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:39,199
so then what i'd say is all right we you

1549
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:41,279
know we check this distance squared

1550
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:43,279
right um and this is the best distance

1551
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:46,158
squared probably too

1552
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:50,479
uh we figure out what we think that is

1553
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:51,359
by testing the cell uh against it right

1554
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:54,399
so

1555
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:59,799
the 2p thing like where we're actually

1556
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:59,799
going is probably more like this

1557
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,800
um and then

1558
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:23,199
uh we're going to

1559
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:25,120
see how far away we get

1560
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:26,639
when we try to place ourselves inside

1561
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:28,158
this box as close to that point as

1562
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,039
possible

1563
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:33,119
what would the closest possible point be

1564
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:34,399
we use that distance squared here which

1565
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:35,599
is only an approximation because we

1566
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:37,359
don't actually know exactly where we

1567
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,679
could have placed it

1568
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:39,679
um

1569
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:50,198
and then assuming that this distance is

1570
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:50,198
better

1571
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,440
then we would accept that move

1572
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:05,440
so this best cell i here right

1573
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:07,519
best cell i is going to be equal to the

1574
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:09,839
current voxel i

1575
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,840
um

1576
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,439
probably should just be best cell

1577
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:24,079
okay

1578
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,079
so

1579
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,480
we step through the cells we ex we try

1580
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:31,679
to track which one of them is going to

1581
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:34,959
be best

1582
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:38,158
so this is how we do that

1583
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:41,039
we test all of the neighboring voxels

1584
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:43,519
by pushing them onto the stack

1585
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:45,279
and we walk the stack as we go

1586
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,320
as it is currently this will always test

1587
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:51,599
the entire voxel which will be very slow

1588
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:51,599
but again we're just starting there

1589
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:57,279
the minimum corner

1590
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:59,279
equals best min corner thing is not a

1591
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:02,479
thing anymore

1592
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:05,198
that will come from the stack walk

1593
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:07,919
the best cell we can now do

1594
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:13,639
the get cell bounds call here

1595
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:13,640
so we can just say like the best cell is

1596
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:23,359
uh generated this way and i don't know

1597
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:24,559
what best cell is used for

1598
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:28,359
uh

1599
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,360
looks like it's up here

1600
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:38,079
so it's really the starting cell

1601
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,079
um

1602
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,359
so that that doesn't really make a whole

1603
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,800
lot of sense uh there so i'm gonna

1604
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:47,519
actually change the way that works and

1605
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,520
just make this be

1606
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,920
something that looks like that

1607
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:57,198
yeah

1608
01:14:55,359 --> 01:15:00,158
um

1609
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:01,439
so we have a problem here

1610
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:02,238
which is

1611
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:05,279
that

1612
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:07,198
this is not really very good

1613
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:10,079
the reason it's not very good is because

1614
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:11,119
it presupposes that you moved along the

1615
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:12,640
line

1616
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,880
from the from

1617
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,199
from the starting point to the final

1618
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,199
point

1619
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,039
and we don't really have any reason to

1620
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:26,480
believe that that's what you actually

1621
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:28,880
did so that line as a probe is not

1622
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:28,879
useful

1623
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:34,800
what would be useful however is not

1624
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,799
clear

1625
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:39,840
you kind of need to know

1626
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:47,639
like how you got here

1627
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,079
so that that's a tough one

1628
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,600
so i'm going to leave it like this

1629
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,840
for now

1630
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,840
but

1631
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,000
so

1632
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:35,920
you know

1633
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,158
like i said i i really just don't know

1634
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,158
um

1635
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,400
if you came in like from the side to

1636
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,000
this cell

1637
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:45,519
which is allowed now

1638
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,279
putting yourself

1639
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,560
at the point where like you would hit

1640
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:49,920
the from the front p might be like

1641
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,360
really wrong

1642
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,480
you know

1643
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:54,399
um

1644
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:57,959
and so you know we may want to try and

1645
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:57,960
do better than that

1646
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:10,198
hmm

1647
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:26,320
so

1648
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,319
yeah

1649
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:34,559
i think we're almost done with this

1650
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,560
part

1651
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,880
i don't know why this is here

1652
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,840
um

1653
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,238
all right

1654
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:54,399
so

1655
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:56,839
um this is still like very wasteful

1656
01:17:54,399 --> 01:18:01,119
we could cache these checks

1657
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,119
um cash these checks

1658
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,000
is there

1659
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:21,079
right

1660
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:35,519
i i mean i don't know like if there's a

1661
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:39,480
saying along those lines

1662
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,480
um from top gun

1663
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:50,879
maybe

1664
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:55,399
me i

1665
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,479
anyone

1666
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,719
anyway

1667
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,440
so

1668
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,880
that all seems fine

1669
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:15,119
uh

1670
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:18,159
so let's work on the startup

1671
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:21,399
so here we go ahead and we produce like

1672
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:21,399
some nonsense

1673
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,000
or whatever

1674
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:32,479
uh if you

1675
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:35,880
assume that that's the minimum corner

1676
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:35,879
for this voxel

1677
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:41,920
and we produce the direction

1678
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:41,919
constant

1679
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,400
uh then that's really all you need

1680
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,840
to

1681
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:52,879
create the voxel stack so

1682
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,760
if you then create the voxel stack

1683
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:57,000
um

1684
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,000
the grid

1685
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,920
which is here

1686
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,920
um

1687
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,960
we want to make by setting the cell

1688
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:27,760
count and the cell dimension

1689
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:30,079
so we know what the cell dimension is

1690
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,079
because it's right here

1691
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:33,079
um

1692
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:40,158
and we know what the cell count is uh

1693
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,440
because it's

1694
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:44,679
like

1695
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:44,678
this thing

1696
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,480
and so really the question that we then

1697
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:06,479
have is what's the minimum corner now

1698
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:09,039
this is obviously the minimum corner

1699
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:10,799
because it's called minimum corner

1700
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:13,198
but what we'll actually find if we try

1701
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:15,119
to use that is no it's not

1702
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:17,279
what we meant by minimum corner here is

1703
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:19,039
it's the minimum corner of the cell that

1704
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:21,279
you start in

1705
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:23,840
but because we don't actually look and

1706
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:25,759
see which direction you're going it may

1707
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,319
actually be that any of these that were

1708
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,400
negative would have moved you backward

1709
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:32,319
right

1710
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:34,960
so what we actually need to do here to

1711
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:37,679
produce the minimum corner

1712
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:39,920
is we need to actually like

1713
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:39,920
uh

1714
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,840
go in that direction

1715
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:52,079
for as many steps as the voxel goes

1716
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:54,319
and then we bound it there right

1717
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,399
so we need to do like a

1718
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:59,039
corner a

1719
01:21:56,399 --> 01:21:59,039
corner b

1720
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,760
so this is really the voxel starting

1721
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,800
corner

1722
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,800
is the way to think about it

1723
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:14,960
um

1724
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:14,960
and we then need to add

1725
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:29,679
uh the cell dim

1726
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,679
uh times the direction

1727
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,159
right

1728
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:35,439
so we know we're gonna start here

1729
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:37,599
and we're gonna go

1730
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:39,919
you know

1731
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:43,360
we're gonna go that many steps at

1732
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:46,239
maximum like 16 steps at maximum

1733
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:48,079
in whatever direction we're trying to go

1734
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:50,319
you know in this solve

1735
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:50,319
right

1736
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:58,639
um

1737
01:22:53,039 --> 01:23:01,439
and so after that the voxel min corner

1738
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:05,319
is like the element minimum

1739
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:05,319
do we have an element minimum

1740
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:21,839
i guess we

1741
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:21,839
do or don't

1742
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:25,920
nobody knows

1743
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:30,679
how many min functions do we have

1744
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:42,238
so it's it's just the element minimum of

1745
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,239
those two right so it's this

1746
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:47,279
that's the minimum corner

1747
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:51,119
um

1748
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:53,759
because this is the furthest we could go

1749
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:54,960
along the direction

1750
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,760
um

1751
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,399
is there no how do you

1752
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,920
convert this

1753
01:24:00,399 --> 01:24:04,158
surely there's a way to convert this

1754
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,158
right

1755
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,159
it's right there

1756
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:19,599
oh

1757
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,158
that was dumb it was already of e3

1758
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:25,920
um

1759
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:28,000
so that should just work

1760
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,399
right then we have the question of like

1761
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,719
what is the initial cell location but

1762
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:36,638
now that we actually have a voxel grid

1763
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,639
um we should be able to just

1764
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:42,880
use the functions there

1765
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:45,119
to get the voxel index

1766
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,440
for whatever the placement

1767
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:48,319
of the person is

1768
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:52,158
right

1769
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:55,119
so the initial cell index

1770
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:58,960
is just whatever the

1771
01:24:55,119 --> 01:25:00,880
voxel grid now says it is right the

1772
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,119
starting location

1773
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,199
we can just get

1774
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:09,399
and

1775
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:09,399
use our helper functions for that

1776
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:15,359
okay

1777
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:16,719
so that's compiling now and i think

1778
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:19,439
we're out of time

1779
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,399
uh we'll debug it next weekend

1780
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:21,279
but

1781
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:22,719
that's

1782
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:24,880
that's the start of

1783
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,800
of the full search routine

1784
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,239
and mostly what it will be right now is

1785
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,600
very slow

1786
01:25:28,238 --> 01:25:32,559
once we get the once we remove the bugs

1787
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,159
from it

1788
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,159
it'll be very slow because it's going to

1789
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:37,359
test literally

1790
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:39,759
uh

1791
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:41,198
4096

1792
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,560
cells

1793
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:46,238
every time

1794
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:48,480
because it never will like early out

1795
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:49,839
right

1796
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:51,759
um

1797
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,239
so it's going to test them all even the

1798
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:57,039
ones that are obviously very bad and

1799
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:58,158
could not possibly be helpful

1800
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:00,158
so

1801
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:02,719
that part we have to fix

1802
01:26:00,158 --> 01:26:06,599
also we don't need the other thing we

1803
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:06,600
should put here is like

1804
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,880
i think the other thing we should do

1805
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:32,319
here is we want to change the voxel to

1806
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,239
only be

1807
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:36,399
the size that it actually needs to be to

1808
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:39,599
encompass the size of the move and then

1809
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:41,359
we can clamp that

1810
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,520
um

1811
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:45,920
to be less but

1812
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,080
you know if it was too big but we don't

1813
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,158
want to create things that are larger

1814
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:52,079
for no reason right which is the other

1815
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:54,399
problem we were doing here if that makes

1816
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:54,399
sense

1817
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,760
all right let's do some q a

1818
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:08,079
maybe i should actually write that code

1819
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:10,158
in here instead of q a just real quick

1820
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:13,359
because it's not much code

1821
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:13,739
so if you imagine this is the actual

1822
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:16,858
um

1823
01:27:13,739 --> 01:27:16,858
[Music]

1824
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,000
span

1825
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,519
so this is the span that the voxel is

1826
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,520
the voxel gonna span the entire thing it

1827
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,800
would be this

1828
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,800
um

1829
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,800
so

1830
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:38,960
if we take the minimum of these two

1831
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,199
and then we take the maximum of these

1832
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,198
two

1833
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,840
uh and then we do

1834
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:50,000
the floor right you can see

1835
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:52,480
uh the voxel starting corner here part

1836
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,039
where we do the like floor to get these

1837
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:57,678
to the right um

1838
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:57,679
locations

1839
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:04,719
so in order to find that span you know

1840
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,719
it's it's weird that we don't have

1841
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,520
this already

1842
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:14,279
you know what i mean

1843
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:14,279
um but

1844
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,000
but we don't

1845
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:20,238
um

1846
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,279
so that's how how you know much space we

1847
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:23,279
would actually need

1848
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:30,479
um

1849
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:30,479
to encompass uh

1850
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,600
well actually you know what i maybe i

1851
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:38,000
don't even really need to do that so

1852
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,000
this

1853
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:47,440
uh this right here

1854
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,439
would probably be sufficient right

1855
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:54,600
so when we produce this minimum corner

1856
01:28:56,238 --> 01:29:01,279
uh

1857
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:04,000
we can also produce the maximum corner

1858
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:04,000
of those two

1859
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,158
uh and then we can produce the

1860
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,159
total expected span

1861
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,480
by taking the difference between those

1862
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:20,479
two

1863
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,479
and dividing by the cell dimension right

1864
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:34,719
uh so that's the optimal span

1865
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,800
when we then go to make the voxel grid

1866
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:41,840
we can just say

1867
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:41,840
that there is a max voxel span

1868
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:52,359
and

1869
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:00,000
when we then create the actual dim we

1870
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:01,600
can just say that the voxel dim is just

1871
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,840
the optimal dim

1872
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,840
right

1873
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:07,840
clamped against the maximum dim

1874
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:14,479
that that is that's it

1875
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:18,399
right so we can just say look

1876
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,399
whichever one of these is smallest

1877
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,639
is the one you use

1878
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:27,319
you know i'm saying

1879
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,039
so i think that's right

1880
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:47,279
um

1881
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:47,279
this is a little bit

1882
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:52,760
uh tricky here because

1883
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:52,759
that's good

1884
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:11,519
uh so this is a little bit nasty because

1885
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,239
looks like we have floor but not ceiling

1886
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:22,559
right

1887
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:22,559
um

1888
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:26,559
which is weird

1889
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:30,800
but you can see here like we've got this

1890
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:32,319
issue where we're dividing by the cell

1891
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,560
dim

1892
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:34,559
um

1893
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:45,759
and we want to make sure that we include

1894
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:48,239
the largest part like the furthest part

1895
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,920
so we want a ceiling that

1896
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:52,158
value to get what the actual index would

1897
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,000
be there

1898
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:57,359
and

1899
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,840
it's not gonna do that right

1900
01:31:57,359 --> 01:31:59,839
um

1901
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:06,719
so i don't know i mean it's probably

1902
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,199
this

1903
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:11,198
at that point which is not really what

1904
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:13,839
you want to do

1905
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:13,839
um

1906
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:19,759
uh

1907
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,760
but

1908
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:26,198
i i mean it seems like that's roughly

1909
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:26,198
what you're gonna have to do

1910
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:40,359
what's the problem here um

1911
01:32:37,359 --> 01:32:40,359
v3s

1912
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:46,719
is there no way to like

1913
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:48,158
how do i produce

1914
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:51,198
an actual

1915
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:53,439
dimension value from these

1916
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:56,719
like there has to be

1917
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:56,719
a way to floor this

1918
01:32:57,119 --> 01:32:59,359
to

1919
01:33:20,399 --> 01:33:25,198
so it looks like this one yeah doesn't

1920
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:29,439
quite so you know we could still use the

1921
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:29,439
other way of doing the minimum

1922
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:39,920
like there's no min for v3s's here

1923
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,440
which kind of kind of sucks

1924
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:44,440
because we would like to be able to do

1925
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:44,439
that

1926
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:09,799
maybe we'll do this

1927
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:23,599
which is not great

1928
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:26,600
um but at least its thing

1929
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,600
so

1930
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:36,079
don't ask me why

1931
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:40,480
we have two different words for that but

1932
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:40,479
we do

1933
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:49,520
it looks like we used the phrase voxel

1934
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,520
dim here

1935
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:57,559
of course that doesn't really matter so

1936
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:57,559
maybe we'll just put that over here

1937
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,800
okay

1938
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:13,439
so i think that's all right and again

1939
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:15,199
all right so now i will literally i will

1940
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:16,238
really for reals go to the q a but i

1941
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:19,198
just wanted to throw that in there

1942
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:21,519
because i think we want to do that

1943
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:21,519
um

1944
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:25,118
so that if you're just talking about a

1945
01:35:23,118 --> 01:35:27,198
little tiny motion you're not going to

1946
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:28,399
search this large grid for no reason is

1947
01:35:27,198 --> 01:35:29,839
also or you're not even going to

1948
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:30,960
initialize it to a large grid for no

1949
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,520
reason

1950
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,520
seems also good

1951
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:08,960
does your in-house editor cache tokens

1952
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:11,118
for a buffer and keep them around i have

1953
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,960
my incremental tokenization for but the

1954
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:14,960
memory overhead

1955
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,560
is pretty gross and unnecessary i'm

1956
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,600
thinking of just fully caching the

1957
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,360
states

1958
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,560
like whether you're in a block comment

1959
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:25,198
or not

1960
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:27,280
and then caching only n lines of tokens

1961
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:28,719
with lru eviction or something i have

1962
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:31,039
especially i'm just over complicating

1963
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:31,039
things

1964
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:39,839
pushbox has a typo let me look at that

1965
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:39,839
let me i'll answer that question but

1966
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:44,718
thank you

1967
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,920
um

1968
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:50,159
i guess

1969
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,279
what i would say about what your

1970
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:53,198
what you're talking about with the

1971
01:36:51,279 --> 01:36:55,439
tokens is

1972
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:57,359
what are you trying to do

1973
01:36:55,439 --> 01:37:00,879
like it's important to try and think

1974
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:00,880
about what you're actually doing

1975
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:05,279
and what problem you're trying to solve

1976
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,039
because the answer to what you do

1977
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:10,079
usually is very dependent on what

1978
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:10,079
problem you're trying to solve

1979
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,480
so if you

1980
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:20,079
if you are talking about small files so

1981
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:22,879
like the size of the files that we use

1982
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:24,000
on like handmade hero

1983
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,560
then

1984
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,359
honestly like just a very fast parser

1985
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:31,199
that you run every time the user hits a

1986
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:32,559
key would be fine

1987
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:34,799
right

1988
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:36,800
and storing a bunch of state

1989
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,639
is probably actually going to end up

1990
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:40,960
costing more

1991
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:43,840
than just running it because you know

1992
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,840
like if you look

1993
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:49,440
um at the size of the cpp files on here

1994
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,840
uh

1995
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:53,439
they're like you know like 64k

1996
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:56,400
is like

1997
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:58,000
the size of a file you know

1998
01:37:56,399 --> 01:38:00,960
and so if you're talking about files

1999
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,639
that are 64k i mean you just don't you

2000
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,480
don't want to do anything incremental

2001
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:06,079
you just want to parse it from start to

2002
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:07,519
finish as fast as you can every time

2003
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:08,399
when the user hits a key you just parse

2004
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,400
it again

2005
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:11,839
right

2006
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:14,079
um

2007
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,079
so

2008
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:19,600
at some point if you want to handle

2009
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:22,079
large files

2010
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:23,520
there is a crossover where now it

2011
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:27,359
becomes

2012
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,880
uh beneficial for you to do caching

2013
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:31,839
where you don't want to re-parse the

2014
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,840
entire file

2015
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:36,800
my suspicion

2016
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:38,560
and i could be wrong about this but my

2017
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:42,079
suspicion is that when you want to do

2018
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:45,280
that you probably still want to do

2019
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:46,800
parsing of entire blocks at once with no

2020
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:48,880
caching

2021
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,760
and so mostly what you probably want to

2022
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,359
do

2023
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,800
i think is sort of what you said but i'm

2024
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:55,679
not sure

2025
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:58,639
of exactly what what you meant

2026
01:38:55,679 --> 01:39:00,880
but you probably just want to cache okay

2027
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:02,880
what state affects

2028
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,840
the

2029
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,760
you know

2030
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,239
save the parser state at various

2031
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:10,639
sequence points throughout the file

2032
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:12,638
and you just restart from there when you

2033
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:14,880
touch something that's inside the file

2034
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:14,880
right

2035
01:39:16,079 --> 01:39:21,920
um in general i would say all of this is

2036
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:24,159
a giant waste of time um

2037
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:26,480
text parsing is dumb

2038
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:28,000
it shouldn't be done anymore if you want

2039
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:29,519
to look at something that's actually

2040
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,560
doing things the way it should be done

2041
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,320
you probably want to look at something

2042
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,600
more like dion

2043
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:36,559
right

2044
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:38,560
that ryan and alan are doing

2045
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:40,239
d parsing text is stupid i don't know

2046
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,760
why it's still happening there shouldn't

2047
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:43,519
be such a thing as a text editor anymore

2048
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:46,560
the fact that there is is just a good

2049
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,520
example of just exactly how dumb

2050
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,400
uh

2051
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:53,400
this entire process is

2052
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:53,399
so

2053
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:12,879
what do you think about using search and

2054
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:14,799
pen games this movement that should feel

2055
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,639
physically correct like gravity jumping

2056
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:18,000
etc is there an extension of your work

2057
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:19,679
on the witness that would work well

2058
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,800
there or would you go with a classical

2059
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:23,760
approach like gjcare npr

2060
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,360
um

2061
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,600
so there's really

2062
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:29,679
those are like conflating two separate

2063
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,400
things i guess is what i would say

2064
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,560
so

2065
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:33,679
search in p doesn't have anything to do

2066
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,360
with how you're doing collision

2067
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:36,880
detection

2068
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:37,920
in at all

2069
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:40,639
right

2070
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:43,199
it's how you are using the results of

2071
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:45,600
your collision detection so search and p

2072
01:40:43,198 --> 01:40:47,039
can still be used with gjk

2073
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,840
right

2074
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:50,880
um

2075
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:52,159
you just use a gjk solver to determine

2076
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:54,639
the

2077
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:56,960
uh to ask the questions

2078
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:58,880
about the placement of your thing so

2079
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,480
like even inside the handmade hero one

2080
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:02,159
which is search and b right now you can

2081
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,479
see

2082
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:07,439
uh that's exactly how it works

2083
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:09,039
you call a function called collides at p

2084
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:09,839
and this

2085
01:41:09,039 --> 01:41:12,880
is

2086
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:14,239
unrelated to the search and p right it's

2087
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:16,480
just a thing that does a collision

2088
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:17,678
detection path you could put gjk right

2089
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:18,799
here

2090
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:20,880
and this

2091
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:24,320
would it would change nothing about the

2092
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,319
outer routine right

2093
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:30,079
so

2094
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:33,439
there really isn't a difference between

2095
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:35,840
search and p and search in t in terms of

2096
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:37,519
what collision detectors you might use

2097
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,239
to produce

2098
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,239
the output

2099
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:44,158
um

2100
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:45,198
so search np just works fine even with

2101
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:46,719
physical

2102
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:47,079
stuff it's fine

2103
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:48,800
um

2104
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:50,960
[Music]

2105
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,560
there there really isn't any difference

2106
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,960
between the two they're just

2107
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:57,520
search np is more expensive but more

2108
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,520
robust

2109
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,199
right

2110
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:04,239
um

2111
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:07,279
so it's really more about expense

2112
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:09,519
than it is about

2113
01:42:07,279 --> 01:42:09,519
uh

2114
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,719
it's more about

2115
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:17,439
surgeon p is more expensive

2116
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:19,520
to be more reliable

2117
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:22,319
it doesn't really change what you can

2118
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:22,320
and can't do

2119
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:28,800
it changes the cost

2120
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:33,039
so search in t is much less expensive

2121
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,039
because you're only sampling one route

2122
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:38,158
and the cost

2123
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:39,279
is in robustness because you have no

2124
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:42,559
idea

2125
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:44,960
whether that that path is reversible

2126
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,920
it could have just been numerical

2127
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,319
luck

2128
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:51,520
that you were able to do it and you will

2129
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:54,479
have no idea if you can do it in reverse

2130
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:58,560
so the player can just get stuck

2131
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:58,559
and and that's it right

2132
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,520
um so search and p and search and t

2133
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:06,079
don't have different really don't really

2134
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,080
have different

2135
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:15,119
um they aren't

2136
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:17,440
changing what the player could do

2137
01:43:15,118 --> 01:43:19,118
there or how you're testing what the

2138
01:43:17,439 --> 01:43:20,879
player can do

2139
01:43:19,118 --> 01:43:22,960
they just change

2140
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:26,239
how you are looking at the results of

2141
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:28,719
that information and deciding yes or no

2142
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:28,718
you know

2143
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,359
and

2144
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,359
you can't

2145
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:41,439
i mean maybe if i started working more

2146
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:44,479
on search np and spent another year just

2147
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:47,039
like looking at that as a technique

2148
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:49,198
i would figure out ways of making it

2149
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:50,800
be as cheap or close to as cheap as

2150
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:53,279
search and t and then it's just like

2151
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:56,800
yeah you could always just use it

2152
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:58,158
but really the more important part

2153
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,039
of

2154
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:00,799
that

2155
01:43:59,039 --> 01:44:02,319
to look at it has nothing to do with

2156
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,840
what kind of game you're making or what

2157
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:04,840
you're trying to enable

2158
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,719
it's just

2159
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,079
cost

2160
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:09,439
so the collision director on the witness

2161
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:11,198
is expensive

2162
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:12,479
you couldn't just

2163
01:44:11,198 --> 01:44:14,799
use it

2164
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:14,799
for

2165
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:20,400
a thousand entities

2166
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:21,199
all moving around at once right

2167
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:23,279
so

2168
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:25,198
you have to take that cost into account

2169
01:44:23,279 --> 01:44:28,158
and say can we afford it on this

2170
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:30,319
particular game is it important in this

2171
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:34,920
particular game if it's not important

2172
01:44:30,319 --> 01:44:34,920
we're just wasting time right

2173
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,920
you

2174
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:26,479
yeah so the sandwich maker

2175
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:28,079
like

2176
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:29,279
uh

2177
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:31,118
i would say

2178
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:33,599
if you're trying to open really large

2179
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:35,759
files then you're you're really just

2180
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:38,079
going to have to deal with

2181
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,079
um

2182
01:45:39,198 --> 01:45:42,399
with caching parser state i mean there

2183
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:44,639
really isn't

2184
01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:45,920
so one of the reasons text files there

2185
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:47,279
are so many reasons text files are

2186
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,039
stupid and no one should be using them

2187
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:51,840
for anything even though everyone is

2188
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:53,679
using them for everything

2189
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:56,000
one of the reasons is that they're a

2190
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,520
giant

2191
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,319
dependency chain

2192
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:01,920
they start with the first character

2193
01:46:00,319 --> 01:46:04,399
the next character is dependent on that

2194
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:07,118
character and every character thereafter

2195
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:08,238
is dependent on all previous characters

2196
01:46:07,118 --> 01:46:10,799
right

2197
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:13,519
it's the dumbest freaking possible thing

2198
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:15,440
you could ever have created and nobody

2199
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,800
should ever have used them the only

2200
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:18,799
reason they were used even at the

2201
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,239
beginning was because computers were

2202
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:22,239
probably too simple to compliment

2203
01:46:20,238 --> 01:46:23,118
contemplate using anything else

2204
01:46:22,238 --> 01:46:26,238
they

2205
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:29,519
since like 1990 we should not have been

2206
01:46:26,238 --> 01:46:30,799
using text files they are absolutely

2207
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,560
stupid

2208
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,239
and the fact that we continue to build

2209
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,840
the backbone of computing on text files

2210
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:40,118
is absurd

2211
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:40,119
it's absolutely ridiculous

2212
01:46:41,198 --> 01:46:44,238
so

2213
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:45,599
i guess i would just say

2214
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:47,678
like

2215
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:50,079
the concept of text files for storing

2216
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:51,520
things that are not a giant series of

2217
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:53,198
linearly

2218
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,119
dependent

2219
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:56,719
if you're not storing one giant single

2220
01:46:55,118 --> 01:47:00,799
dependency chain in a text file then you

2221
01:46:56,719 --> 01:47:02,399
picked the wrong file format period

2222
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:05,039
and that's really the end of it

2223
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:06,799
there's nothing else to say

2224
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:08,800
so people can have fun all day long

2225
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,480
creating their new fast text editors or

2226
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,000
whatever the heck they're still going to

2227
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:13,279
suck

2228
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,800
as long as you're adding a text file

2229
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:16,158
it's going to suck and that's the end

2230
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:19,159
that's beginning middle and end of the

2231
01:47:16,158 --> 01:47:19,158
story

2232
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,840
all right

2233
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:13,198
oh is john streaming today i think maybe

2234
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:13,199
what we will do is raid john then

2235
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:20,159
let's rage on

2236
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,159
low

2237
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:24,559
all right i'm gonna close this out

2238
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:31,959
don't store text

2239
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:39,599
it's not how would one store text it's

2240
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:39,599
don't store text it's not text

2241
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:46,880
right look at this this is not text

2242
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:49,920
these are individual functions they

2243
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:53,118
don't depend on each other right

2244
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,920
so don't store them as if they are

2245
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:56,079
as

2246
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:58,399
a text file is a one-dimensional

2247
01:48:56,079 --> 01:49:01,840
dependency chain that goes in a

2248
01:48:58,399 --> 01:49:01,839
direction right

2249
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:06,158
these two things are completely

2250
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:08,560
independent they should not be stored

2251
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:10,319
as if they are

2252
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,520
dependent on each other

2253
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:14,799
this doesn't go after

2254
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:16,080
this

2255
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,840
right

2256
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:20,960
it's just dumb

2257
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:24,480
like all of these languages text files

2258
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:27,599
parsers compilers they are all stupid

2259
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:29,839
it's all a bad idea that people keep

2260
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:29,840
doing

2261
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:35,199
for

2262
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:36,479
i don't know what the reason is

2263
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:38,479
i don't know what it is they have no

2264
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:40,799
imagination they haven't thought about

2265
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:42,479
it they are too much of a slave to the

2266
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:43,599
current ecosystem to see what's actually

2267
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:44,479
important

2268
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:46,719
they

2269
01:49:44,479 --> 01:49:48,319
don't want to actually do the work of

2270
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:51,118
coming up with a new file format i don't

2271
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:53,118
know i have no idea what it is

2272
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:55,519
right

2273
01:49:53,118 --> 01:49:57,920
but like the notion that people

2274
01:49:55,520 --> 01:50:00,480
keep using this is just

2275
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,480
crazy

2276
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:06,560
no books aren't text either

2277
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:10,880
they're not

2278
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,719
like the fact that you

2279
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,400
the fact that you can take a book and

2280
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:16,399
open it up to an arbitrary page and

2281
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:18,879
start reading means that it is not a

2282
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:20,960
serial dependency right

2283
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:22,960
nobody forces you to read chapter one of

2284
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:25,198
a book before chapter two

2285
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:28,639
so the concept that you would store it

2286
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:30,559
as just a giant linear dependency chain

2287
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:33,440
doesn't make any sense you would store

2288
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:36,960
it broken down by first chapter then

2289
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:40,479
paragraph then sentence then word then

2290
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,480
letter right

2291
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,560
so so like

2292
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:51,118
none of this makes sense there's almost

2293
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:54,239
nothing humans have ever created that it

2294
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:55,759
makes sense to store as literally a

2295
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:57,839
sequence of

2296
01:50:55,760 --> 01:51:00,639
individual letters

2297
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,360
with no idea of how they go together it

2298
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:05,679
is absolutely ridiculous there are no

2299
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:08,000
things i can think of

2300
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:09,760
that we've ever made where that is a

2301
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
reasonable file format

2302
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:13,280
it makes no sense

2303
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,118
right

2304
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:18,359
you would never store anything that way

2305
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:18,359
on purpose

2306
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:24,158
you know not books

2307
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:26,479
not

2308
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:28,799
code

2309
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:31,439
not web pages none of the stuff that we

2310
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:33,360
currently store as text is textual in

2311
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:36,319
that way in the way that we define a

2312
01:51:33,359 --> 01:51:36,319
text file format

2313
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:43,198
no compression makes it worse

2314
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:44,639
compression means that now not only do

2315
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:47,039
you not have any idea what any of the

2316
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:48,639
characters are but you can't even ask

2317
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:50,560
what the characters are without knowing

2318
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:53,279
what all the previous characters are so

2319
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:56,000
compressing a text file is like doubling

2320
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:57,920
down on sucking

2321
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,399
now you're sucking even harder than you

2322
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:01,399
were sucking previously

2323
01:52:22,238 --> 01:52:27,198
the alternative to text is actually

2324
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:27,199
store the thing you're storing

2325
01:52:27,279 --> 01:52:30,719
right

2326
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:32,559
so if you're trying to store code store

2327
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:34,719
a thing that's like here is a list of

2328
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,039
functions inside each function here is a

2329
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:39,920
list of scopes inside each scope here's

2330
01:52:37,039 --> 01:52:42,238
a list of statements

2331
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,239
right

2332
01:52:42,399 --> 01:52:48,158
like you store the thing in the format

2333
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:48,159
that it actually is

2334
01:52:55,359 --> 01:52:58,719
like

2335
01:52:56,399 --> 01:53:01,198
think of it this way

2336
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:04,000
nobody stores anything that you actually

2337
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:08,479
need to operate on in this format like

2338
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:10,319
if you go look at like how you know like

2339
01:53:08,479 --> 01:53:12,319
pick anything you want

2340
01:53:10,319 --> 01:53:14,479
how google stores your email or

2341
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:16,799
something right

2342
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:19,598
they may store the body of the email

2343
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:22,079
text as text because that's what email

2344
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:24,239
was stupidly defined to be

2345
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:26,079
but the actual structure of like what's

2346
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:28,559
in which mailbox and what it is it's a

2347
01:53:26,079 --> 01:53:31,359
database right it's a thing that

2348
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,360
actually has

2349
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:37,679
like indexes over actual tables that say

2350
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:40,679
what the crap is you know what i'm

2351
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:40,679
saying

2352
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:45,199
so you always have

2353
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:47,359
data should be organized in the

2354
01:53:45,198 --> 01:53:49,279
structure that it actually is because

2355
01:53:47,359 --> 01:53:50,479
otherwise you get the problems all the

2356
01:53:49,279 --> 01:53:53,519
problems that you're currently talking

2357
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:55,678
about which is that in order to display

2358
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:57,760
like there will never be a text file

2359
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:59,760
that can display files quickly

2360
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:01,119
ever in the history of mankind it will

2361
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,360
never be written

2362
01:54:01,118 --> 01:54:05,118
the reason for that is i can always pick

2363
01:54:03,359 --> 01:54:08,079
a problem that makes it basically

2364
01:54:05,118 --> 01:54:10,399
impossible okay here's a one terabyte

2365
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:12,960
text file and i would like to see the

2366
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:16,319
syntax highlighted version

2367
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:16,319
of the last line

2368
01:54:16,479 --> 01:54:21,598
it's not possible right you would

2369
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:24,319
literally have to load and parse the

2370
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:26,239
entire one terabyte source code file to

2371
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:27,759
determine what the highlighting is on

2372
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:30,158
the last line

2373
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:32,159
it's a stupid idea

2374
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:34,238
right

2375
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:36,319
the actual work necessary to produce the

2376
01:54:34,238 --> 01:54:38,238
correct answer there is very simple

2377
01:54:36,319 --> 01:54:39,519
because code is actually not that

2378
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:41,919
complicated when you get right down to

2379
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:43,440
it there is probably it was probably the

2380
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,199
start of a function just a few lines

2381
01:54:43,439 --> 01:54:46,879
before it so you probably only need to

2382
01:54:45,198 --> 01:54:48,719
look at a few things to know what the

2383
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,400
syntax highlighting would be but you'd

2384
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:52,319
never know that

2385
01:54:50,399 --> 01:54:54,559
because that one terabyte text file

2386
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:57,279
could have pound defines in it or who

2387
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:59,760
knows what right all this other stuff

2388
01:54:57,279 --> 01:55:01,279
because the way we've defined storing

2389
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:03,440
the code

2390
01:55:01,279 --> 01:55:05,599
is just broken

2391
01:55:03,439 --> 01:55:08,719
it doesn't map

2392
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:11,119
to the storage format and the thing

2393
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:12,319
don't work together

2394
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:15,279
right

2395
01:55:12,319 --> 01:55:15,279
they don't work together

2396
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:20,239
so just stop doing that store code in a

2397
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,480
database

2398
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:25,479
and store it based on what it actually

2399
01:55:22,479 --> 01:55:25,479
is

2400
01:55:49,039 --> 01:55:53,519
yeah i mean an example of an interim

2401
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:55,198
step would be a cc plus file where you

2402
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:57,119
just have functions

2403
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:58,799
are each stored

2404
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:01,598
separately

2405
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:03,679
and that way at least in order to create

2406
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:05,760
a pathological scenario you would have

2407
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:07,920
to create a function that was like a

2408
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,360
terabyte long which is absurd because

2409
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,719
compiler won't be able to handle it

2410
01:56:09,359 --> 01:56:14,238
right

2411
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:15,599
so at that point you're pretty much okay

2412
01:56:14,238 --> 01:56:16,959
you know

2413
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:18,560
i mean you should still go further than

2414
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:20,158
that and actually just have the code

2415
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:22,000
saved as an ast because that's what the

2416
01:56:20,158 --> 01:56:24,158
parser is actually going to do why

2417
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,399
bother having that step

2418
01:56:24,158 --> 01:56:26,399
right

2419
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:30,320
so that's all

2420
01:56:40,158 --> 01:56:43,920
yeah if you're gonna have things like

2421
01:56:42,158 --> 01:56:45,759
pound defines right

2422
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,920
then they're going to be in the database

2423
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:49,679
as a specific thing right and they're

2424
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:50,960
going to have like regions to which they

2425
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:53,039
apply

2426
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,960
so the way that you would parse code is

2427
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:56,719
you go okay this is the code block that

2428
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:57,760
i'm asked to look at

2429
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:00,399
right

2430
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:02,320
i look up into the pound define table to

2431
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:04,079
see which pound defines are active

2432
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:05,920
within this block

2433
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:07,840
and i apply them

2434
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:10,840
and then i display the text

2435
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:10,840
right

2436
01:57:37,359 --> 01:57:46,719
so json is

2437
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:49,678
not great but it's not as bad as like

2438
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:52,079
as like ce or something right because it

2439
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:55,359
doesn't have any ability like you can

2440
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:56,960
syntax highlight json

2441
01:57:55,359 --> 01:57:58,079
more easily

2442
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:00,239
um

2443
01:57:58,079 --> 01:58:01,679
it's still bad though

2444
01:58:00,238 --> 01:58:03,118
like even just knowing whether or not

2445
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:04,719
you're inside

2446
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:06,079
a quote

2447
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:08,000
requires parsing from the beginning of

2448
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:09,439
the file

2449
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:13,359
right

2450
01:58:09,439 --> 01:58:14,719
um because it's a parody thing

2451
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:17,359
unless i'm missing something i'm pretty

2452
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:17,359
sure that's right

2453
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:21,119
um

2454
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:23,039
but there's a lot of reasons json's a

2455
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:24,238
bad format i mean

2456
01:58:23,039 --> 01:58:25,599
they did some things right and some

2457
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:28,319
things wrong i guess is what i would say

2458
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:30,159
for a text format it's not that bad

2459
01:58:28,319 --> 01:58:33,158
but it's still text which is generally

2460
01:58:30,158 --> 01:58:33,158
bad

2461
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:54,159
i'm not sure you would need

2462
01:58:51,439 --> 01:58:56,559
like specific software though

2463
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:57,759
if we had just moved to asts to begin

2464
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:59,920
with you would probably just have

2465
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:02,719
generic ast editors

2466
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:05,920
where like the definition of a language

2467
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:07,118
is you put in the ast node types

2468
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:09,359
right

2469
01:59:07,118 --> 01:59:11,598
and then files are just

2470
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:14,000
are just those

2471
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:15,440
you know what i'm saying

2472
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,719
and then you wouldn't even have parsers

2473
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:19,279
anymore

2474
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:21,520
compilers would just take asc files

2475
01:59:19,279 --> 01:59:21,519
right

2476
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:26,359
and that'd be that

2477
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:46,960
i should get the new remedy you're right

2478
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:49,359
there's fixes in there that i actually

2479
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:51,920
asked for myself um so i'm looking

2480
01:59:49,359 --> 01:59:53,679
forward to it the new remedy is

2481
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:56,960
um

2482
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:56,960
it has a lot of good stuff

2483
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:01,599
um

2484
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:05,520
so so i wholeheartedly agree i'm on

2485
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:08,319
three five i think there's a three six

2486
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:08,320
that just came out

2487
02:00:11,359 --> 02:00:13,839
i want to say

2488
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,800
yeah

2489
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:22,079
um so yes i will i will go download it

2490
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,199
i'm not logged in to itch on this

2491
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:26,920
machine

2492
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:26,919
um but

2493
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:31,679
yeah 3.6

2494
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:33,039
has a lot of good stuff i haven't

2495
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:34,239
downloaded it yet i need to download it

2496
02:00:33,039 --> 02:00:36,079
i need to put it on my work machine as

2497
02:00:34,238 --> 02:00:39,079
well

2498
02:00:36,079 --> 02:00:39,079
um

2499
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:49,920
uh oh

2500
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:54,119
remedy36 is pretty crashy for you

2501
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:54,118
sandwich maker that's a bad sign

2502
02:00:57,279 --> 02:01:01,279
we should report him though because like

2503
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:03,118
i definitely want to be able to use 3.6

2504
02:01:01,279 --> 02:01:05,759
so if there's if it's crashy we should

2505
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:05,759
report him

2506
02:01:07,198 --> 02:01:12,678
um

2507
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,679
right

2508
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:28,799
are there any editors or programming

2509
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:32,479
languages that don't use text and can

2510
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:33,599
highlight gigabyte files currently

2511
02:01:32,479 --> 02:01:34,799
well

2512
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:36,239
i don't know that there's any

2513
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:38,560
programming languages that don't use

2514
02:01:36,238 --> 02:01:38,559
text

2515
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,840
at all

2516
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,760
so ignore the gigabyte file part i don't

2517
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:47,199
think there are any

2518
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:49,900
uh

2519
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:53,099
maybe there are

2520
02:01:49,899 --> 02:01:53,099
[Music]

2521
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:59,118
but like i don't know

2522
02:01:56,479 --> 02:02:01,359
as for editors that can

2523
02:01:59,118 --> 02:02:03,118
highlight a gigabyte file

2524
02:02:01,359 --> 02:02:05,439
well i guess i don't know what you mean

2525
02:02:03,118 --> 02:02:07,359
by gigabyte

2526
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:10,158
but like sure

2527
02:02:07,359 --> 02:02:12,639
in terms of if you pick some other kind

2528
02:02:10,158 --> 02:02:14,000
if something that actually uses

2529
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:16,639
non-text

2530
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,840
i mean you can load multi-gigabyte files

2531
02:02:16,639 --> 02:02:19,920
in

2532
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:21,599
zbrush

2533
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:24,480
right

2534
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:24,480
and it just works

2535
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:31,719
um so so i'm not sure what you mean

2536
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:31,719
but

2537
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:37,199
what happened to rad game tools did epic

2538
02:02:35,198 --> 02:02:39,598
by the company yes

2539
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:43,919
epic bought them

2540
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:45,360
um as you probably know epic games has

2541
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:47,679
insane amounts of money now because

2542
02:02:45,359 --> 02:02:49,279
fortnight is so successful

2543
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:51,199
so they wanted to

2544
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:53,359
well not they wanted to they have been

2545
02:02:51,198 --> 02:02:55,759
acquiring

2546
02:02:53,359 --> 02:02:57,920
lots of game technology companies you

2547
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:59,199
can go look at all the requests there's

2548
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,118
several

2549
02:02:59,198 --> 02:03:04,399
and rad was one of the companies they

2550
02:03:01,118 --> 02:03:07,598
wanted to acquire for game technology

2551
02:03:04,399 --> 02:03:10,158
so along with a bunch of other game

2552
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:10,159
companies

2553
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:14,480
the

2554
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:17,359
game technology companies they were they

2555
02:03:14,479 --> 02:03:22,519
are now rolled into epic and you know

2556
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:22,519
their tech is part of unreal engine now

2557
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:43,760
if i still worked at rad would i get a

2558
02:03:40,158 --> 02:03:49,039
massive bag of cash um

2559
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:49,039
possibly i don't i don't know i think so

2560
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:54,239
like i mean it probably depends on

2561
02:03:52,158 --> 02:03:55,759
you know how long you'd been at rad and

2562
02:03:54,238 --> 02:03:57,839
stuff like that i mean i don't i don't

2563
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:57,840
know

2564
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:02,158
i would assume that people got paid out

2565
02:04:00,078 --> 02:04:05,279
quite differently depending on you know

2566
02:04:02,158 --> 02:04:05,279
what what they were doing

2567
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:10,559
uh for the company but you know

2568
02:04:09,198 --> 02:04:12,399
i'm sure you would get you would get a

2569
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,920
good payout yeah

2570
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:15,439
it's just like any other acquisition

2571
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:18,000
right i mean you get a bunch of money

2572
02:04:15,439 --> 02:04:21,039
for an acquisition usually

2573
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:23,198
especially one of these which is

2574
02:04:21,039 --> 02:04:24,560
uh you know they want the developers too

2575
02:04:23,198 --> 02:04:26,078
so they're you know they're purdue

2576
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:29,760
presumably

2577
02:04:26,078 --> 02:04:32,158
they want to give developers like

2578
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:34,320
payouts from epic that will you know if

2579
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:36,879
they stay for five years they get

2580
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:38,960
money that kind of stuff right because

2581
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:40,560
you don't want everyone to leave

2582
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:42,239
so so usually when you're talking about

2583
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,520
acquisitions where you care about the

2584
02:04:42,238 --> 02:04:44,879
people who are actually working there

2585
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:45,920
because you want them to come work on

2586
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:47,359
your

2587
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,239
tech

2588
02:04:47,359 --> 02:04:49,679
uh

2589
02:04:48,238 --> 02:04:51,359
you know

2590
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:53,359
i don't know the specifics of the way

2591
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:54,880
the compensation was for this particular

2592
02:04:53,359 --> 02:04:56,799
deal and i'm sure i couldn't talk about

2593
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:58,239
it even if i did right

2594
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:00,639
but

2595
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:02,000
they tend to want to pay people out over

2596
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:04,078
a few years

2597
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,520
so that they don't leave i mean what you

2598
02:05:04,078 --> 02:05:07,679
know you you want them to be encouraged

2599
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:08,560
to like go contribute to epic aft you

2600
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:10,399
know

2601
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:12,000
after they're acquired you don't want

2602
02:05:10,399 --> 02:05:14,238
people to just be like i'm out of here

2603
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,238
right

2604
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:17,639
um

2605
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:29,119
so

2606
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:30,319
in other acquisitions that may not

2607
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:32,719
necessarily be the case right you can

2608
02:05:30,319 --> 02:05:35,118
imagine some cases where you've

2609
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:37,439
got acquisitions where they you know rad

2610
02:05:35,118 --> 02:05:38,559
is a small number of very talented

2611
02:05:37,439 --> 02:05:39,598
programmers

2612
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:41,599
right

2613
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:43,279
so when you acquire them you want to

2614
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:44,960
bring all of those people on and put

2615
02:05:43,279 --> 02:05:46,960
them onto things that are valuable to

2616
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:48,880
you

2617
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:50,639
if you acquire a company it's just kind

2618
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:51,840
of whatever crap

2619
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:52,880
right

2620
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,360
um

2621
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:57,679
and and you don't really care that much

2622
02:05:55,359 --> 02:05:59,920
then those those payouts are going to be

2623
02:05:57,679 --> 02:06:01,840
like more about certain maybe key

2624
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:04,000
individuals but you're not going to go

2625
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:05,599
out of your way to like be paying off

2626
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,198
random people

2627
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:08,560
in like the accounting department or

2628
02:06:07,198 --> 02:06:10,078
whatever that you don't really care

2629
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:12,400
about you know what i mean

2630
02:06:10,078 --> 02:06:14,559
so i think in the case of rad i would

2631
02:06:12,399 --> 02:06:15,920
assume that most people depending you

2632
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:17,199
know on how long they've been there

2633
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:19,039
maybe

2634
02:06:17,198 --> 02:06:20,319
and how crucial they had been you know

2635
02:06:19,039 --> 02:06:22,800
we're probably getting different amounts

2636
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:24,719
of payout but i imagine everyone got

2637
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:26,480
something because

2638
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:28,480
there aren't that many people at rad and

2639
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:30,319
they're all people that presumably you

2640
02:06:28,479 --> 02:06:31,759
wanted to keep because they're you know

2641
02:06:30,319 --> 02:06:33,039
they were a very select group of

2642
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:34,079
programmers they're not just random

2643
02:06:33,039 --> 02:06:35,760
people

2644
02:06:34,078 --> 02:06:38,238
and a lot of them are people who you

2645
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:40,880
probably you know would find something

2646
02:06:38,238 --> 02:06:42,799
important at on fortnite or unreal

2647
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:44,639
engine or whatever

2648
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:47,119
there'd be stuff that you'd want them to

2649
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:51,159
go do you don't want them to leave and

2650
02:06:47,118 --> 02:06:51,158
go somewhere else right

2651
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:09,279
how still platform for svg progressing

2652
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:11,599
um it's pretty good it's harder than

2653
02:07:09,279 --> 02:07:12,800
i would like

2654
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:16,000
because

2655
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:17,520
i just after like i had hoped that i

2656
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,760
wouldn't have to deal with payment

2657
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:21,599
processing stuff much

2658
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:23,760
but having looked through the payment

2659
02:07:21,599 --> 02:07:25,520
processing stuff they are just very

2660
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:26,719
untrustworthy

2661
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:28,079
like

2662
02:07:26,719 --> 02:07:30,800
you know stripe

2663
02:07:28,078 --> 02:07:34,158
and paypal and such they're just very

2664
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:34,159
untrustworthy companies

2665
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:38,400
they do not provide you with any

2666
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:42,078
guarantees that they will actually

2667
02:07:38,399 --> 02:07:44,719
continue to process your payments

2668
02:07:42,078 --> 02:07:44,719
and so

2669
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:50,479
it would be a much easier problem if you

2670
02:07:47,679 --> 02:07:53,118
could just use a single payment

2671
02:07:50,479 --> 02:07:55,118
processor and trust that company but you

2672
02:07:53,118 --> 02:07:56,319
really can't

2673
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:59,679
and so

2674
02:07:56,319 --> 02:08:02,799
having to do the part where you

2675
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:04,880
assume that at any time

2676
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:07,119
one of your payment processors or a

2677
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:09,679
payment processor

2678
02:08:07,118 --> 02:08:11,279
will just cut you off

2679
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:12,639
which as far as i can tell is the only

2680
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:13,759
sane way to do business currently

2681
02:08:12,639 --> 02:08:15,920
because these

2682
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:18,079
to say payment processors are the least

2683
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:21,279
trustworthy companies in the world that

2684
02:08:18,078 --> 02:08:23,920
i can find like i don't know of any kind

2685
02:08:21,279 --> 02:08:25,920
of company short of like drug cartel

2686
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:27,118
that is less trustworthy than payment

2687
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:30,800
processor

2688
02:08:27,118 --> 02:08:32,078
it's like drug cartel payment processor

2689
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:34,400
other

2690
02:08:32,078 --> 02:08:34,399
right

2691
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:40,480
um and so because of that

2692
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:43,198
you're in this problem of you have a

2693
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:46,879
service you have to rely on

2694
02:08:43,198 --> 02:08:48,479
um which is payment processing

2695
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:51,599
and you

2696
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:52,479
then have to

2697
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:54,480
take

2698
02:08:52,479 --> 02:08:56,799
what is a real what is a service that

2699
02:08:54,479 --> 02:08:58,799
must be reliable

2700
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:01,599
and

2701
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:04,639
write the part of your code that works

2702
02:09:01,599 --> 02:09:06,639
with that and the the infrastructure to

2703
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:07,920
assume it is unreliable

2704
02:09:06,639 --> 02:09:10,239
so you have to take something that has

2705
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:13,520
to be reliable and write it

2706
02:09:10,238 --> 02:09:16,078
based on unreliable services

2707
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:18,639
so it basically introduces an entire

2708
02:09:16,078 --> 02:09:19,519
fault tolerant engineering problem

2709
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:20,639
on

2710
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:21,520
that

2711
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:23,760
layer

2712
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:23,760
right

2713
02:09:24,479 --> 02:09:32,238
um and so i really just don't know

2714
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:35,199
it's the same story over and over again

2715
02:09:32,238 --> 02:09:38,319
right it's a hard problem

2716
02:09:35,198 --> 02:09:40,719
for no reason other than

2717
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:42,639
the world is mostly

2718
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:44,319
made up of people who have no idea what

2719
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:45,199
they're doing and don't care

2720
02:09:44,319 --> 02:09:47,519
right

2721
02:09:45,198 --> 02:09:49,039
like the notion that payment processors

2722
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:50,639
can stop working with you because they

2723
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:52,238
don't like you

2724
02:09:50,639 --> 02:09:55,679
or because the government doesn't like

2725
02:09:52,238 --> 02:09:58,678
you is so bad for society it's just nuts

2726
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:58,679
right

2727
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:06,880
what john no you can't raid me i'm done

2728
02:10:04,479 --> 02:10:10,759
i'm leaving

2729
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:10,760
we were gonna read you

2730
02:10:17,039 --> 02:10:20,639
this is not acceptable

2731
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:25,280
oh dude

2732
02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:27,440
you guys freaking ask me about the

2733
02:10:25,279 --> 02:10:29,840
payment processing thing

2734
02:10:27,439 --> 02:10:30,799
and you got me on the stream just long

2735
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:32,719
enough

2736
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:34,719
that john was able to rate us instead of

2737
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:37,719
us rating john i blame all of you for

2738
02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:37,719
that

2739
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:51,760
john was just saying on the stream the

2740
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:53,839
other day that he didn't he hasn't done

2741
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:56,639
a lot of modern

2742
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:59,039
uh high thread count

2743
02:10:56,639 --> 02:11:01,679
multi-thread programming and this is

2744
02:10:59,039 --> 02:11:01,679
what happens

2745
02:11:02,078 --> 02:11:05,759
right

2746
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,719
this is what happens

2747
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,520
when

2748
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:08,800
you

2749
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:11,199
transfer

2750
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:13,599
you now are blocking on a thread that

2751
02:11:11,198 --> 02:11:15,198
itself was about to go to sleep

2752
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:17,360
right

2753
02:11:15,198 --> 02:11:19,919
look look what you did you've you've

2754
02:11:17,359 --> 02:11:22,000
ruined everything

2755
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:24,078
now the entire internet will deadlock

2756
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:27,078
and everyone will have to stop using the

2757
02:11:24,078 --> 02:11:27,078
internet

2758
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:53,118
um so anyway i don't really have much

2759
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:55,118
else to say about that other like than

2760
02:11:53,118 --> 02:11:57,839
what i said before so the the payment

2761
02:11:55,118 --> 02:11:58,960
processing is a huge problem

2762
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:02,239
um

2763
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:03,118
it is it is by far

2764
02:12:02,238 --> 02:12:04,718
uh

2765
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:08,078
the

2766
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:09,439
it is by far the most

2767
02:12:08,078 --> 02:12:11,840
uh

2768
02:12:09,439 --> 02:12:14,158
so let me put it this way

2769
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:16,319
if you want to write your own e-commerce

2770
02:12:14,158 --> 02:12:18,879
server and you know

2771
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:20,719
that the payment processor is a

2772
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:22,960
trustworthy company

2773
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:24,158
it is not very hard

2774
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:26,639
like there are

2775
02:12:24,158 --> 02:12:27,759
you shouldn't be a novice because

2776
02:12:26,639 --> 02:12:29,118
you know well you should never be a

2777
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:30,880
novice if you're writing something real

2778
02:12:29,118 --> 02:12:32,839
anyway you should you know get good

2779
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:36,159
first or

2780
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,159
whatever but

2781
02:12:36,399 --> 02:12:41,039
it's not like a large engineering

2782
02:12:39,039 --> 02:12:44,399
problem to write an e-commerce server if

2783
02:12:41,039 --> 02:12:47,599
the payment processor is trustworthy

2784
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:48,399
it's fairly straightforward

2785
02:12:47,599 --> 02:12:51,440
and

2786
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:53,759
really it depends on the api of the

2787
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:55,759
payment processor that you select how

2788
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:57,199
easy but it might be like embarrassingly

2789
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:59,599
easy

2790
02:12:57,198 --> 02:13:00,719
um like it can be like an extremely thin

2791
02:12:59,599 --> 02:13:04,078
layer

2792
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:06,719
over the top of the payment processor

2793
02:13:04,078 --> 02:13:08,158
uh especially if they were allow like

2794
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:10,239
user

2795
02:13:08,158 --> 02:13:11,519
provided data queries of some kind you

2796
02:13:10,238 --> 02:13:14,000
can almost just use the payment

2797
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:15,920
processor as the database like there's

2798
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:18,960
really not much to do if the payment

2799
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:18,960
processor is reliable

2800
02:13:20,399 --> 02:13:24,559
if

2801
02:13:22,238 --> 02:13:25,519
if the payment processor is unreliable

2802
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:27,440
which is

2803
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:28,960
is true so currently there are no

2804
02:13:27,439 --> 02:13:30,879
reliable payment processors as far as i

2805
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:32,158
know so

2806
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:34,078
if you

2807
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:36,559
assume that the payment processor is

2808
02:13:34,078 --> 02:13:38,078
unreliable now

2809
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:40,880
you're basically writing a complete

2810
02:13:38,078 --> 02:13:44,639
fault tolerant distributed system

2811
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:48,319
so you've gone from easy problem to

2812
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:51,520
you know serious engineering problem

2813
02:13:48,319 --> 02:13:51,519
and that is just like

2814
02:13:53,439 --> 02:13:57,519
that's

2815
02:13:55,279 --> 02:13:59,920
it's that literally that difference

2816
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:02,400
so if there was a reliable payment

2817
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:04,399
processor who you could actually count

2818
02:14:02,399 --> 02:14:06,319
on you would you would have a very easy

2819
02:14:04,399 --> 02:14:07,359
time that that doesn't exist so now

2820
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:09,679
you're

2821
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:09,679
you know

2822
02:14:10,319 --> 02:14:15,118
you're basically just doing doing the

2823
02:14:12,639 --> 02:14:15,118
full work

2824
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,880
and that's all there is

2825
02:14:25,039 --> 02:14:28,960
how do you test your code against an

2826
02:14:26,399 --> 02:14:30,638
unreliable payment processor well i mean

2827
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:32,880
you just have to

2828
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:34,639
uh

2829
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:36,239
so if you assume that payment processors

2830
02:14:34,639 --> 02:14:38,719
are unreliable they can go down at any

2831
02:14:36,238 --> 02:14:40,638
time they can just cut you off right and

2832
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:41,679
you can lose access to whatever was over

2833
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:44,800
there

2834
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:46,078
what that means is that any time that

2835
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:49,119
something happens with a payment

2836
02:14:46,078 --> 02:14:52,000
processor your system has to also know

2837
02:14:49,118 --> 02:14:53,519
what the result should have been right

2838
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:57,118
so

2839
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:59,119
you have to know whether someone

2840
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:01,198
previously had paid for something and

2841
02:14:59,118 --> 02:15:02,799
was in good standing you need to track

2842
02:15:01,198 --> 02:15:05,118
all that yourself

2843
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,119
right

2844
02:15:05,359 --> 02:15:06,839
um

2845
02:15:05,609 --> 02:15:10,719
[Music]

2846
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:12,319
and and you have to track it

2847
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:14,158
in a fault tolerant way like you can't

2848
02:15:12,319 --> 02:15:16,319
lose that data right so it has to be

2849
02:15:14,158 --> 02:15:18,000
stored redundantly you have to have good

2850
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:19,118
ways of synchronizing it and knowing if

2851
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,960
things are out of sync and all that

2852
02:15:19,118 --> 02:15:24,078
stuff

2853
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:26,158
um so pretty much

2854
02:15:24,078 --> 02:15:27,679
testing against a unreliable payment

2855
02:15:26,158 --> 02:15:29,118
processor it's really not so much that

2856
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:31,279
you're testing against an earlier

2857
02:15:29,118 --> 02:15:32,799
payment processor so much as you have to

2858
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:34,158
have all of the stuff that the payment

2859
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:37,119
processor could have possibly done

2860
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:38,960
yourself do it yourself and when you

2861
02:15:37,118 --> 02:15:40,078
actually go to issue payment processing

2862
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:41,679
requests

2863
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:44,719
you have to just assume that they might

2864
02:15:41,679 --> 02:15:45,840
come back that you've been cut off

2865
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:47,599
and you have to switch to a different

2866
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:51,840
one and your system just has to be able

2867
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:51,840
to handle that right at any time

2868
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:56,159
um you have to be able to just assume

2869
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:57,439
that stripes stop processing your

2870
02:15:56,158 --> 02:15:59,359
payments so you're gonna have to switch

2871
02:15:57,439 --> 02:16:00,960
to paypal now or paypal stop processor

2872
02:15:59,359 --> 02:16:04,158
payments you have to switch to fat

2873
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:06,880
merchant or whatever the heck right so

2874
02:16:04,158 --> 02:16:09,118
you're just gonna have to assume

2875
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:10,319
right that at any time your payment

2876
02:16:09,118 --> 02:16:12,399
processor

2877
02:16:10,319 --> 02:16:14,799
may

2878
02:16:12,399 --> 02:16:15,679
shut you off

2879
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:17,440
and

2880
02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:18,960
you basically need to be your own

2881
02:16:17,439 --> 02:16:20,559
payment processor right up to the point

2882
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:22,560
where you actually run the credit card

2883
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:24,480
so that at any time you can just switch

2884
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:29,400
to anybody

2885
02:16:24,479 --> 02:16:29,399
and that's a much much harder problem

2886
02:16:44,558 --> 02:16:49,840
yeah

2887
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:50,880
um so yeah like cryptocurrency

2888
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:52,799
uh

2889
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:56,478
the problem with cryptocurrency is of

2890
02:16:52,799 --> 02:16:57,478
course that it's a it's a catch-22 right

2891
02:16:56,478 --> 02:16:59,438
so

2892
02:16:57,478 --> 02:17:01,279
cryptocurrency

2893
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:03,760
will be able to get around these

2894
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:03,760
problems

2895
02:17:04,398 --> 02:17:09,920
for as long as nobody's using it which

2896
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:12,639
is the current situation right

2897
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:14,799
so if you don't care that you can't

2898
02:17:12,638 --> 02:17:17,920
sell to most consumers because most

2899
02:17:14,799 --> 02:17:19,358
consumers don't use cryptocurrency

2900
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,599
it will work

2901
02:17:19,359 --> 02:17:25,519
because it is decentralized and the

2902
02:17:21,599 --> 02:17:25,519
government is not involved right

2903
02:17:25,599 --> 02:17:31,359
as soon as the market for cryptocurrency

2904
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:33,840
broadens to include

2905
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:35,040
the actual majority of customers

2906
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:37,920
the government will be involved

2907
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:38,960
immediately and it will immediately

2908
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:40,960
change

2909
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:42,879
over the course of a year or two

2910
02:17:40,959 --> 02:17:44,318
into the exact same situation you have

2911
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:45,679
right now with all other payment

2912
02:17:44,318 --> 02:17:46,638
processors

2913
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:47,760
and

2914
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:51,358
um

2915
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:51,359
it will be identical to mastercard

2916
02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:55,679
i don't know why people don't understand

2917
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:57,679
that it's so clear

2918
02:17:55,679 --> 02:18:00,879
because

2919
02:17:57,679 --> 02:18:04,239
they have an army

2920
02:18:00,879 --> 02:18:05,518
what are you gonna do like

2921
02:18:04,239 --> 02:18:07,280
i don't know why people think

2922
02:18:05,519 --> 02:18:09,040
cryptocurrency solves this problem the

2923
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:10,719
people with the army decide what you can

2924
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:14,160
do with your currency it doesn't matter

2925
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:16,558
who stores it or how centralized it is

2926
02:18:14,159 --> 02:18:18,638
the government doesn't have any control

2927
02:18:16,558 --> 02:18:20,959
over cash like you hold cash in your

2928
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:23,279
hands it's completely decentralized

2929
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:25,759
right you can go pay for drugs on the

2930
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:27,840
street corner with a wad of cash and the

2931
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:30,000
government doesn't know anything about

2932
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:33,679
that transaction guess what

2933
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:35,439
they deploy literal people in body armor

2934
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:37,439
with guns

2935
02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:40,639
to stop you

2936
02:18:37,439 --> 02:18:42,800
what is the bitcoin going to do

2937
02:18:40,638 --> 02:18:43,759
right they will just come into your

2938
02:18:42,799 --> 02:18:46,879
house

2939
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:48,120
and take you it doesn't matter that it

2940
02:18:46,879 --> 02:18:50,638
was

2941
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:52,399
cryptocurrency so

2942
02:18:50,638 --> 02:18:55,920
it's just it's such a freaking pipe

2943
02:18:52,398 --> 02:18:58,879
dream it's just so stupid right like

2944
02:18:55,920 --> 02:19:01,679
cryptocurrency solves nothing it is only

2945
02:18:58,879 --> 02:19:03,199
able to evade

2946
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:05,599
uh

2947
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:07,599
legal control over its use

2948
02:19:05,599 --> 02:19:09,920
while it is unpopular as soon as it

2949
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:12,239
gains enough popularity the laws will be

2950
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:14,478
placed such as to render it

2951
02:19:12,239 --> 02:19:16,638
no different than any other currency and

2952
02:19:14,478 --> 02:19:18,159
at that point the entire endeavor was a

2953
02:19:16,638 --> 02:19:20,159
waste of everyone's time and more

2954
02:19:18,159 --> 02:19:22,079
importantly a gigantic waste of actual

2955
02:19:20,159 --> 02:19:25,879
energy that we had to actually pay for

2956
02:19:22,079 --> 02:19:25,879
by burning coal or something

2957
02:19:38,638 --> 02:19:42,718
yeah it's so ridiculous like like

2958
02:19:40,239 --> 02:19:43,679
imagine imagine the post-apocalyptic

2959
02:19:42,718 --> 02:19:44,959
world

2960
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:46,799
like anyone's going to use

2961
02:19:44,959 --> 02:19:48,079
cryptocurrency

2962
02:19:46,799 --> 02:19:50,559
where are they even going to get the

2963
02:19:48,079 --> 02:19:54,159
electricity to run the gpus

2964
02:19:50,559 --> 02:19:54,159
right it doesn't even make sense

2965
02:19:54,799 --> 02:19:59,119
crypto is totally useless it it's it is

2966
02:19:58,159 --> 02:20:01,920
a

2967
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:04,640
solution to a problem we've never had

2968
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:06,719
and still don't have

2969
02:20:04,639 --> 02:20:08,879
right it's it's a literal

2970
02:20:06,719 --> 02:20:12,760
it is a solution to a problem that

2971
02:20:08,879 --> 02:20:12,759
nobody needed solved

2972
02:20:34,478 --> 02:20:38,879
can i make my camera bigger i can except

2973
02:20:36,719 --> 02:20:41,039
i was supposed to be done this was not

2974
02:20:38,879 --> 02:20:42,719
supposed to be

2975
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:44,560
i was supposed to be done we weren't

2976
02:20:42,719 --> 02:20:48,000
supposed to still be talking when i make

2977
02:20:44,559 --> 02:20:48,000
the camera bigger it looks like this

2978
02:20:48,478 --> 02:20:54,119
oh this was a little too close to the

2979
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:54,120
frame wasn't it there we go

2980
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:08,640
i mean nfts are

2981
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:10,000
i don't i mean they're just a ponzi

2982
02:21:08,639 --> 02:21:11,680
scheme there's not much to rant about

2983
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,780
there because i don't know that anyone's

2984
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:13,920
been like promising

2985
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:16,399
[Music]

2986
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:16,398
i don't know

2987
02:21:18,719 --> 02:21:22,879
an nft is sort of like a certificate of

2988
02:21:20,639 --> 02:21:24,159
authenticity you know

2989
02:21:22,879 --> 02:21:27,039
um

2990
02:21:24,159 --> 02:21:29,119
it matters to people who

2991
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:31,200
are trying to determine whether a

2992
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:34,880
particular item is

2993
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:34,880
is the actual item or not

2994
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:40,000
why we care about those things i don't

2995
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:42,000
know because they only matter to rich

2996
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,159
people who want to buy things like art

2997
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:46,239
at an auction there's otherwise no value

2998
02:21:44,159 --> 02:21:47,680
to a certificate of authenticity at all

2999
02:21:46,239 --> 02:21:49,359
because

3000
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:52,479
if you think about the actual

3001
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:54,318
utilitarian value of any given item

3002
02:21:52,478 --> 02:21:56,079
if i think something looks like the mona

3003
02:21:54,318 --> 02:21:57,920
lisa to me when i hang it on my wall

3004
02:21:56,079 --> 02:21:59,760
that was as good as the actual mona lisa

3005
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:02,879
in practice right

3006
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:05,120
so nfts also solve a problem that no one

3007
02:22:02,879 --> 02:22:08,478
has except you might consider them

3008
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:10,880
solving a problem that no one we care

3009
02:22:08,478 --> 02:22:12,559
about has which is specifically

3010
02:22:10,879 --> 02:22:13,759
extremely rich people

3011
02:22:12,559 --> 02:22:14,559
buying

3012
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:15,520
like

3013
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:17,519
art

3014
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:20,159
on the internet

3015
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:22,720
is the only pr like so it solves a

3016
02:22:20,159 --> 02:22:24,639
problem that society definitely doesn't

3017
02:22:22,719 --> 02:22:28,438
have but that a small niche of people

3018
02:22:24,639 --> 02:22:28,439
maybe do i don't know

3019
02:22:38,799 --> 02:22:44,079
and yeah demonics i would tend to agree

3020
02:22:40,398 --> 02:22:45,680
like i'm not sure that the nft actually

3021
02:22:44,079 --> 02:22:47,920
so when i say solves that problem what i

3022
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:50,559
mean is it serves the same purpose as a

3023
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:52,159
certificate of authenticity meaning that

3024
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:53,680
much like a certain authenticity it

3025
02:22:52,159 --> 02:22:54,959
could be wrong

3026
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:56,159
you know what i'm saying

3027
02:22:54,959 --> 02:22:57,759
like when you get a cervical

3028
02:22:56,159 --> 02:23:00,719
authenticity that this is actually the

3029
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:02,960
mona lisa all your really all you know

3030
02:23:00,719 --> 02:23:05,279
about it is that some experts who

3031
02:23:02,959 --> 02:23:07,039
examined the item believe

3032
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:09,040
that it is the mona lisa you don't

3033
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:11,680
actually know because

3034
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:14,160
you can't actually prove anything about

3035
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:14,159
it right

3036
02:23:14,239 --> 02:23:18,879
and nfts are the same way you know that

3037
02:23:16,398 --> 02:23:20,959
somebody signed it and you might even

3038
02:23:18,879 --> 02:23:23,199
know that the person who claims to have

3039
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:25,358
made the work has signed it and that's

3040
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:26,640
maybe something but you don't know that

3041
02:23:25,359 --> 02:23:28,399
the person who claims to make the work

3042
02:23:26,639 --> 02:23:31,119
has actually made the work you don't

3043
02:23:28,398 --> 02:23:33,358
know whether that key ever got stolen

3044
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:35,280
or forged especially not in the case of

3045
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:38,280
the mona lisa the person's dead

3046
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:38,280
right

3047
02:23:55,760 --> 02:24:00,318
so yeah so i i wouldn't say that nfts

3048
02:23:58,398 --> 02:24:02,318
can't serve some purpose they just don't

3049
02:24:00,318 --> 02:24:03,199
serve a purpose anyone should care about

3050
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:04,639
right

3051
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:06,240
they serve the same purpose as a

3052
02:24:04,639 --> 02:24:08,079
certificate of authenticity but a

3053
02:24:06,239 --> 02:24:10,159
certificate of authenticity itself is

3054
02:24:08,079 --> 02:24:12,478
useless to almost everybody it's only a

3055
02:24:10,159 --> 02:24:14,639
very small group of people who will ever

3056
02:24:12,478 --> 02:24:17,119
care about that and so much like

3057
02:24:14,639 --> 02:24:18,559
cryptocurrency i don't see why anyone

3058
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:21,040
really cares

3059
02:24:18,559 --> 02:24:21,039
about it

3060
02:24:22,318 --> 02:24:26,959
and the bottom line is that for the

3061
02:24:24,398 --> 02:24:29,199
average citizen in an average

3062
02:24:26,959 --> 02:24:31,519
situation in society

3063
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:33,840
they care about mass-produced art like

3064
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:35,520
like we care about being able to go and

3065
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:39,600
and watch you know

3066
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:42,079
uh avengers end game or something nobody

3067
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:45,439
nobody asked when they walked into the

3068
02:24:42,079 --> 02:24:48,239
theater to see proof that the avengers

3069
02:24:45,439 --> 02:24:51,359
end game they were watching was actually

3070
02:24:48,239 --> 02:24:53,439
the one that disney made because nobody

3071
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:55,280
would bother to forge it it doesn't even

3072
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:57,920
make sense right

3073
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:58,880
so to the average citizen consuming

3074
02:24:57,920 --> 02:25:01,359
something

3075
02:24:58,879 --> 02:25:04,318
they almost never care about the

3076
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:08,079
authenticity of that thing because it is

3077
02:25:04,318 --> 02:25:11,279
societally verified already right like

3078
02:25:08,079 --> 02:25:13,680
like i don't need netflix to prove to me

3079
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:16,479
that the second episode of mine hunter

3080
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:18,639
was signed by david fincher

3081
02:25:16,478 --> 02:25:20,639
like i've never asked for that in any

3082
02:25:18,639 --> 02:25:22,719
context nor have i ever even thought of

3083
02:25:20,639 --> 02:25:24,478
a reason why i would need that

3084
02:25:22,719 --> 02:25:26,719
it just doesn't make sense

3085
02:25:24,478 --> 02:25:26,719
right

3086
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:31,520
um

3087
02:25:28,318 --> 02:25:33,760
so nfts again they're they're they're

3088
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:36,880
not really for anything we care about

3089
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:39,840
um they're they're basically to like

3090
02:25:36,879 --> 02:25:43,358
you know to continue propagating a kind

3091
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:45,760
of stupid model which was like niche

3092
02:25:43,359 --> 02:25:47,200
singular artworks for rich people who

3093
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:48,719
buy them at auction like i don't know

3094
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:50,240
why we care about that i don't know why

3095
02:25:48,719 --> 02:25:51,358
we'll ever care about that i certainly

3096
02:25:50,239 --> 02:25:53,039
don't care about it now and i can't

3097
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:55,600
imagine carry on in the future

3098
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:59,560
so nfts

3099
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:59,559
no idea why they're important

3100
02:26:38,478 --> 02:26:43,920
jazz rabbit no art has value to the

3101
02:26:40,959 --> 02:26:45,839
person who bought it in an open commerce

3102
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:49,040
duplicated setting right when i buy a

3103
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:50,079
painting to hang in my room i shouldn't

3104
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,160
care

3105
02:26:50,079 --> 02:26:54,719
for the purposes of seeing it in my room

3106
02:26:52,159 --> 02:26:56,478
whether it was authentic

3107
02:26:54,719 --> 02:26:58,478
because what does that mean

3108
02:26:56,478 --> 02:27:00,719
i should just care that it looks nice

3109
02:26:58,478 --> 02:27:03,279
above my sofa right

3110
02:27:00,719 --> 02:27:04,959
that's what art does this is what i'm

3111
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:08,560
trying to say with like avengers end

3112
02:27:04,959 --> 02:27:09,519
game like it wouldn't be a better movie

3113
02:27:08,559 --> 02:27:11,600
i mean first of all i didn't like the

3114
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:13,359
movie but let's suppose you cared

3115
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:15,600
it's not a better movie if i know that

3116
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:19,120
i'm seeing the like

3117
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:20,399
first print of it right it's a niche

3118
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:24,479
weird

3119
02:27:20,398 --> 02:27:25,920
fetishistic space of overvaluing objects

3120
02:27:24,478 --> 02:27:28,079
for some

3121
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:29,359
reason unrelated to the actual act of

3122
02:27:28,079 --> 02:27:30,478
looking at them

3123
02:27:29,359 --> 02:27:32,960
if i

3124
02:27:30,478 --> 02:27:35,199
can't tell by looking at it whether

3125
02:27:32,959 --> 02:27:37,358
something is the actual mona lisa or a

3126
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:39,680
forgery of the mona lisa the value is

3127
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:41,920
the same to me

3128
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:41,920
right

3129
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:45,840
period

3130
02:27:54,398 --> 02:27:58,719
and we know this is true nobody cares

3131
02:27:56,559 --> 02:28:00,318
about these things like

3132
02:27:58,719 --> 02:28:01,920
the things that people spend all their

3133
02:28:00,318 --> 02:28:04,159
money on like someone's bringing up the

3134
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:06,398
the example of the louvre like no

3135
02:28:04,159 --> 02:28:08,318
the amount of money spent at the louvre

3136
02:28:06,398 --> 02:28:10,879
compared to the amount of money spent on

3137
02:28:08,318 --> 02:28:13,279
avengers endgame is is a joke

3138
02:28:10,879 --> 02:28:15,358
right like

3139
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:18,000
the world cares about just regular

3140
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:21,520
consumable art they do not care about

3141
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:21,520
what's hanging in the louvre

3142
02:28:22,639 --> 02:28:26,639
like full stop

3143
02:28:24,318 --> 02:28:30,239
it's a tourist destination people go

3144
02:28:26,639 --> 02:28:30,239
there to have something to do

3145
02:28:32,719 --> 02:28:36,079
furthermore if you replaced all of those

3146
02:28:34,559 --> 02:28:38,000
paintings with forgeries tomorrow people

3147
02:28:36,079 --> 02:28:38,799
would still go there and say the same

3148
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,359
thing

3149
02:28:38,799 --> 02:28:43,358
they wouldn't even know

3150
02:28:41,359 --> 02:28:45,280
they would have no idea

3151
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:47,280
right you replace the mona lisa with a

3152
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:48,399
good forgery tomorrow not a single

3153
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:52,840
person who goes through that gallery

3154
02:28:48,398 --> 02:28:52,840
would have any idea you did that

3155
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:00,239
and you know what that's not even

3156
02:28:58,318 --> 02:29:02,398
hypothetical i think there's literally

3157
02:29:00,239 --> 02:29:03,920
been times when there have been

3158
02:29:02,398 --> 02:29:07,239
forgeries hanging in these galleries and

3159
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,239
nobody knew

3160
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:43,120
is that true john do they really hang

3161
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:45,840
fake ones a lot of the time so that they

3162
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:47,680
don't get damaged by flash photography

3163
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:50,000
i mean i'm not surprised

3164
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:50,800
because like nobody knows it it's you

3165
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,478
can't

3166
02:29:50,799 --> 02:29:54,000
not only that but

3167
02:29:52,478 --> 02:29:56,159
if you were the kind of person there's

3168
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:57,359
some people who can probably tell

3169
02:29:56,159 --> 02:29:59,200
like like like the difference between

3170
02:29:57,359 --> 02:30:00,960
the you know the real mona lisa and a

3171
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:02,560
fake there's maybe

3172
02:30:00,959 --> 02:30:04,159
you're not allowed to get close enough

3173
02:30:02,559 --> 02:30:06,398
to a lot of these images there's like a

3174
02:30:04,159 --> 02:30:08,000
little cordon around it you can't even

3175
02:30:06,398 --> 02:30:10,239
get that close to it

3176
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:12,318
right so it's not like you're up there

3177
02:30:10,239 --> 02:30:14,959
with your face like pressed into the

3178
02:30:12,318 --> 02:30:18,478
mona lisa looking at the little like

3179
02:30:14,959 --> 02:30:21,199
brushstrokes and going ah

3180
02:30:18,478 --> 02:30:24,159
i noticed a difference i think this is

3181
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:26,079
the like that's not how you can't even

3182
02:30:24,159 --> 02:30:27,920
like a poster of the mona lisa would

3183
02:30:26,079 --> 02:30:32,120
look like the mona lisa from how close

3184
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:32,120
you're allowed to get to this thing

3185
02:30:42,559 --> 02:30:45,680
the mona lisa does seem shockingly small

3186
02:30:44,318 --> 02:30:48,318
i've never seen it in person but when

3187
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:50,079
you look at like a wider shot of like

3188
02:30:48,318 --> 02:30:53,079
the place where it's hanging it is very

3189
02:30:50,079 --> 02:30:53,079
tiny

3190
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:18,000
it's not the original piece that's

3191
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:19,439
valuable though it's just the thing that

3192
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,120
is

3193
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:22,800
like

3194
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:25,600
in your example

3195
02:31:22,799 --> 02:31:26,959
people still buy that game two years

3196
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:28,960
after

3197
02:31:26,959 --> 02:31:31,119
and it's just a duplicate it's it's

3198
02:31:28,959 --> 02:31:33,599
right it's just a duplicate copy it's

3199
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:35,359
not the original copy

3200
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:36,559
there's like a fetishism around the

3201
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:38,318
original

3202
02:31:36,559 --> 02:31:40,318
copy of things you see this even in

3203
02:31:38,318 --> 02:31:42,159
cases where they're non-differentiated

3204
02:31:40,318 --> 02:31:43,760
the first printing of a book for

3205
02:31:42,159 --> 02:31:46,079
collectors is more valuable than the

3206
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:50,239
second printing of a book why there is

3207
02:31:46,079 --> 02:31:52,639
no reason it's just arbitrary right

3208
02:31:50,239 --> 02:31:54,639
it's like an arbitrary rule people made

3209
02:31:52,639 --> 02:31:56,478
up so that they could sell and collect

3210
02:31:54,639 --> 02:31:59,199
things for more money

3211
02:31:56,478 --> 02:31:59,199
and that's it

3212
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:04,398
it's pure arbitrariness and so that's

3213
02:32:02,318 --> 02:32:07,039
what nfts are they're a way to bring

3214
02:32:04,398 --> 02:32:08,159
that pure arbitrariness into the digital

3215
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:10,399
age

3216
02:32:08,159 --> 02:32:12,000
so and to that extent i have no problem

3217
02:32:10,398 --> 02:32:14,000
with them

3218
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:15,520
i think it's stupid just like i think

3219
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:17,920
auctioning off

3220
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:19,920
like those items are stupid

3221
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:20,960
because i don't think it should matter

3222
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:22,239
right

3223
02:32:20,959 --> 02:32:25,039
um

3224
02:32:22,239 --> 02:32:27,359
but there's nothing more stupid about it

3225
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:30,479
right there's nothing more stupid about

3226
02:32:27,359 --> 02:32:32,399
nfts than about us than about wanting

3227
02:32:30,478 --> 02:32:34,559
specifically the original mona lisa

3228
02:32:32,398 --> 02:32:36,799
instead of another mona lisa even though

3229
02:32:34,559 --> 02:32:38,639
you can't tell the difference

3230
02:32:36,799 --> 02:32:40,959
right

3231
02:32:38,639 --> 02:32:40,959
um

3232
02:32:42,159 --> 02:32:47,039
and as for like producing excess co2

3233
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:49,840
that's kind of separate so you can

3234
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:50,880
criticize the implementation of certain

3235
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:53,200
things

3236
02:32:50,879 --> 02:32:54,318
and you know that's fine

3237
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:56,560
uh

3238
02:32:54,318 --> 02:32:56,559
but

3239
02:32:56,799 --> 02:33:00,639
the

3240
02:32:58,559 --> 02:33:01,920
the idea if you could solve that problem

3241
02:33:00,639 --> 02:33:04,799
produce them with solar energy or

3242
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:06,318
whatever then again they they become the

3243
02:33:04,799 --> 02:33:08,079
same as a certificate of authenticity i

3244
02:33:06,318 --> 02:33:08,959
don't have a problem with that

3245
02:33:08,079 --> 02:33:09,950
but

3246
02:33:08,959 --> 02:33:11,839
it does seem

3247
02:33:09,950 --> 02:33:13,280
[Music]

3248
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:15,600
it all just still seems like a waste of

3249
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:15,600
time

3250
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:19,000
right

3251
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:29,280
i don't see how nfts

3252
02:33:26,959 --> 02:33:32,000
help you support an artist when we

3253
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:35,680
already have ways of doing that right

3254
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:38,318
like we already had kickstarter so

3255
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:40,639
we already we already have patreon we

3256
02:33:38,318 --> 02:33:43,279
already have the ability to mass produce

3257
02:33:40,639 --> 02:33:45,358
and sell games on like steam like what

3258
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:50,479
is the point of the nft

3259
02:33:45,359 --> 02:33:52,318
it seems to me to be trying to overvalue

3260
02:33:50,478 --> 02:33:54,079
a work of art

3261
02:33:52,318 --> 02:33:57,359
to try and get more money out of it than

3262
02:33:54,079 --> 02:33:58,239
its actual societal value produced

3263
02:33:57,359 --> 02:34:02,040
right

3264
02:33:58,239 --> 02:34:02,039
that's what it seems like

3265
02:34:12,478 --> 02:34:15,279
we're not using an nft for creating a

3266
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:16,799
digital use market but digital used

3267
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:17,680
markets are bad

3268
02:34:16,799 --> 02:34:19,679
right

3269
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:21,760
the problem with the digital used market

3270
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:24,159
is now that means that the price of the

3271
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:26,318
original games increases

3272
02:34:24,159 --> 02:34:27,520
by not having a digital used market it

3273
02:34:26,318 --> 02:34:29,680
means that the price of the games

3274
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:33,439
decreases why you have so many games now

3275
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:34,800
that sell for 5.99 9.99 15.99 instead of

3276
02:34:33,439 --> 02:34:36,720
60

3277
02:34:34,799 --> 02:34:38,000
right it's because they can't be sold

3278
02:34:36,719 --> 02:34:40,079
used

3279
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,920
so instead of selling

3280
02:34:40,079 --> 02:34:44,478
you know a third the number of copies

3281
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:45,920
because people buy them used you just

3282
02:34:44,478 --> 02:34:47,039
sell the actual number of copies and the

3283
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:48,639
price goes down by a third which is

3284
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:51,640
exactly what should happen

3285
02:34:48,639 --> 02:34:51,639
right

3286
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:13,920
you

3287
02:35:34,398 --> 02:35:37,358
the idea to want to be close to the

3288
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:39,680
actual thing that da vinci touched with

3289
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:41,040
his hands is somewhat relatable not

3290
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:44,159
important for you but it's certainly not

3291
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:46,080
arbitrary it's pretty freaking arbitrary

3292
02:35:44,159 --> 02:35:48,000
do would you apply that to all the other

3293
02:35:46,079 --> 02:35:50,719
things that da vinci touched

3294
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,840
like oh yeah like you know he probably

3295
02:35:50,719 --> 02:35:55,358
touched this toilet

3296
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:57,200
handle or this wouldn't be a toilet

3297
02:35:55,359 --> 02:35:58,399
handle it would probably i don't even

3298
02:35:57,200 --> 02:36:00,479
know if they had

3299
02:35:58,398 --> 02:36:02,959
um

3300
02:36:00,478 --> 02:36:05,039
functional toilets for davinci so

3301
02:36:02,959 --> 02:36:06,639
uh this chamber pot

3302
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:09,359
right

3303
02:36:06,639 --> 02:36:10,959
like oh i gotta i gotta touch this

3304
02:36:09,359 --> 02:36:14,079
this

3305
02:36:10,959 --> 02:36:14,079
you know chamber pot

3306
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:20,560
it's just romanticizing things

3307
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:21,680
arbitrarily it's totally arbitrary

3308
02:36:20,559 --> 02:36:22,559
right

3309
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:25,600
like

3310
02:36:22,559 --> 02:36:27,279
some of da vinci's dna is in some

3311
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:31,120
descendants somewhere do you go like

3312
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:34,520
touch them do you like touch their face

3313
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:34,520
with your hand

3314
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:42,960
i don't disagree that this exists

3315
02:36:40,079 --> 02:36:44,719
right it totally exists it's still

3316
02:36:42,959 --> 02:36:46,559
arbitrary

3317
02:36:44,719 --> 02:36:48,478
it doesn't serve

3318
02:36:46,559 --> 02:36:51,119
an actual purpose

3319
02:36:48,478 --> 02:36:54,159
to allocate resources

3320
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:56,399
towards things that people actually use

3321
02:36:54,159 --> 02:36:56,398
right

3322
02:36:58,239 --> 02:37:00,239
so

3323
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:01,600
that's why i don't see it being

3324
02:37:00,239 --> 02:37:04,000
particularly important

3325
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:06,000
if you look like so you look at things

3326
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:09,040
and like the reasons i say avengers

3327
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:11,200
endgame versus nfts

3328
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:12,479
avengers end game is things lots and

3329
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:15,840
lots of people

3330
02:37:12,478 --> 02:37:17,599
wanted to go do for some reason

3331
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:19,200
right

3332
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:21,520
um

3333
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:24,000
that means that putting the money

3334
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:27,040
towards that was useful to society

3335
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:30,000
because it actually has

3336
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:32,240
value for a humongous transfer society

3337
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,159
like

3338
02:37:32,239 --> 02:37:37,439
300 million people

3339
02:37:34,159 --> 02:37:37,439
or whoever right

3340
02:37:38,478 --> 02:37:42,879
the people who care about a pixelated

3341
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:45,120
whale

3342
02:37:42,879 --> 02:37:46,719
being certified as authentic

3343
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:47,840
via nft

3344
02:37:46,719 --> 02:37:50,159
is like

3345
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:50,159
three

3346
02:37:50,559 --> 02:37:54,799
it's not a good way to allocate money it

3347
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:57,359
does not produce

3348
02:37:54,799 --> 02:38:00,159
a lot of value to society

3349
02:37:57,359 --> 02:38:01,200
to allocate money towards the pixel

3350
02:38:00,159 --> 02:38:02,879
whale

3351
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:04,800
right

3352
02:38:02,879 --> 02:38:08,239
and the same is true of certificates of

3353
02:38:04,799 --> 02:38:10,959
authenticity it doesn't actually produce

3354
02:38:08,239 --> 02:38:13,280
hardly any useful value to society to

3355
02:38:10,959 --> 02:38:15,519
know which mona lisa is the actual mona

3356
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:17,040
lisa it doesn't

3357
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:18,720
right

3358
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:21,760
it's a waste

3359
02:38:18,719 --> 02:38:23,679
of actual resources to

3360
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:25,840
have these auction houses to have

3361
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:28,079
experts who can identify the actual mona

3362
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:29,840
lisa from the real one if they even can

3363
02:38:28,079 --> 02:38:31,760
to have security guards guarding the

3364
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:33,439
mona lisa because it's the actual mona

3365
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:35,439
lisa and not another one and therefore

3366
02:38:33,439 --> 02:38:37,439
worth a tremendous amount of money to

3367
02:38:35,439 --> 02:38:38,479
have to maintain a museum to keep it

3368
02:38:37,439 --> 02:38:40,800
there like

3369
02:38:38,478 --> 02:38:44,478
none of that is producing useful value

3370
02:38:40,799 --> 02:38:44,478
it's all a waste of time

3371
02:38:44,799 --> 02:38:48,398
right

3372
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:51,040
like like there is an actual thing that

3373
02:38:48,398 --> 02:38:53,199
we have to do which is to take the money

3374
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:55,600
and spend it on something

3375
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:59,120
and you can either spend it on something

3376
02:38:55,600 --> 02:39:00,800
that tons of people actually go to do

3377
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:04,079
and get value from

3378
02:39:00,799 --> 02:39:06,799
or you can create an entire arbitrary

3379
02:39:04,079 --> 02:39:08,639
useless system that produces nothing

3380
02:39:06,799 --> 02:39:11,358
like literally it's actually the

3381
02:39:08,639 --> 02:39:15,840
opposite it's a system for preventing

3382
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:15,840
you from producing more monalisas

3383
02:39:16,959 --> 02:39:19,199
why

3384
02:39:20,799 --> 02:39:23,840
right

3385
02:39:22,318 --> 02:39:26,959
that's why i call it arbitrary because

3386
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:30,639
it's like we just made it up

3387
02:39:26,959 --> 02:39:30,639
we totally freaking made it up

3388
02:39:32,159 --> 02:39:36,079
and it's basically only rich people no

3389
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:38,079
one else is doing this right because

3390
02:39:36,079 --> 02:39:40,079
it's not like other people just buy a

3391
02:39:38,079 --> 02:39:42,000
print of the mona lisa

3392
02:39:40,079 --> 02:39:45,000
and it's worth like 20 bucks

3393
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:45,000
right

3394
02:39:56,079 --> 02:40:00,719
so by arbitrary what i mean is that it

3395
02:39:58,398 --> 02:40:03,680
doesn't actually use money to create

3396
02:40:00,719 --> 02:40:07,840
something anyone wanted

3397
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:10,720
right it's just we created a arbitrary

3398
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:14,079
thing to make money

3399
02:40:10,719 --> 02:40:16,000
that doesn't actually produce anything

3400
02:40:14,079 --> 02:40:17,359
arbitrary is probably the wrong word

3401
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:20,159
fictional

3402
02:40:17,359 --> 02:40:21,840
like fictional value would probably be

3403
02:40:20,159 --> 02:40:24,079
the right term

3404
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:24,079
right

3405
02:40:25,279 --> 02:40:29,439
so real value

3406
02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:33,120
is when you don't need a certificate of

3407
02:40:29,439 --> 02:40:36,398
authenticity because the act of using or

3408
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:38,720
experiencing the thing is it's of itself

3409
02:40:36,398 --> 02:40:41,119
it is the value

3410
02:40:38,719 --> 02:40:42,879
the certificate of authenticity

3411
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:46,160
means that that thing didn't have the

3412
02:40:42,879 --> 02:40:48,000
value because the person experiencing it

3413
02:40:46,159 --> 02:40:50,159
obviously can't tell otherwise they

3414
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:53,439
wouldn't need the certificate

3415
02:40:50,159 --> 02:40:54,559
right so it's completely arbitrary it's

3416
02:40:53,439 --> 02:40:57,040
creating

3417
02:40:54,559 --> 02:40:59,039
arbitrary value that doesn't actually

3418
02:40:57,040 --> 02:41:00,960
exist because no one can actually

3419
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:02,399
determine

3420
02:41:00,959 --> 02:41:03,759
the difference

3421
02:41:02,398 --> 02:41:06,398
but

3422
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:08,159
we created an arbitrary value there by

3423
02:41:06,398 --> 02:41:10,959
just claiming

3424
02:41:08,159 --> 02:41:12,639
that there is a difference between

3425
02:41:10,959 --> 02:41:15,519
one of the things and all the rest of

3426
02:41:12,639 --> 02:41:17,840
the things even though no one can tell

3427
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:17,840
right

3428
02:41:18,318 --> 02:41:22,318
that's what i mean by arbitrary but

3429
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:24,719
really maybe i should say is fictional

3430
02:41:22,318 --> 02:41:27,199
it's fictional value it's value that

3431
02:41:24,719 --> 02:41:28,799
definitely doesn't exist because if you

3432
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:31,920
remove the certificate of varsity no one

3433
02:41:28,799 --> 02:41:34,000
would be able to tell right

3434
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:35,840
now there is a difference for example

3435
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:38,159
between a crappy reproduction of the

3436
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:40,398
mona lisa and a good one that's actual

3437
02:41:38,159 --> 02:41:41,920
value if someone actually looks the mona

3438
02:41:40,398 --> 02:41:44,318
lisa and says oh this one looks much

3439
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:45,600
nicer than this other one it's like a

3440
02:41:44,318 --> 02:41:48,478
crappy copy

3441
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:50,479
that's actual value

3442
02:41:48,478 --> 02:41:52,398
because someone actually might prefer

3443
02:41:50,478 --> 02:41:56,639
one over the other they might pay you

3444
02:41:52,398 --> 02:41:58,318
more for the better one right for real

3445
02:41:56,639 --> 02:41:59,760
you don't need to convince them of

3446
02:41:58,318 --> 02:42:03,079
something like this one's original and

3447
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:03,079
that one isn't

3448
02:42:39,439 --> 02:42:42,639
and i don't think it's the right

3449
02:42:40,879 --> 02:42:44,398
question to say does art create value

3450
02:42:42,639 --> 02:42:45,840
decider or not that's not really what's

3451
02:42:44,398 --> 02:42:48,079
important right because if you think

3452
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:50,880
about society and economic systems as

3453
02:42:48,079 --> 02:42:51,840
ways of people deciding what has value

3454
02:42:50,879 --> 02:42:52,799
to them

3455
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:55,120
right

3456
02:42:52,799 --> 02:42:57,840
then this all works just fine

3457
02:42:55,120 --> 02:43:00,800
my point is simply saying that if a

3458
02:42:57,840 --> 02:43:02,719
certificate of authenticity is what

3459
02:43:00,799 --> 02:43:04,879
switches something from being worth

3460
02:43:02,719 --> 02:43:07,438
almost nothing to be worthy to be worth

3461
02:43:04,879 --> 02:43:09,839
a fortune right

3462
02:43:07,439 --> 02:43:12,318
that is a fictional value

3463
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:13,279
because it doesn't actually allocate

3464
02:43:12,318 --> 02:43:15,760
money

3465
02:43:13,279 --> 02:43:17,920
to any particular place

3466
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:20,000
right it doesn't actually allocate funds

3467
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:21,680
towards doing something useful it

3468
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:23,359
allocates funds towards something

3469
02:43:21,680 --> 02:43:26,800
arbitrary

3470
02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:29,120
which is a certification system

3471
02:43:26,799 --> 02:43:29,119
right

3472
02:43:30,639 --> 02:43:34,318
again obviously people do care about

3473
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:37,279
this

3474
02:43:34,318 --> 02:43:38,559
how do we know that because they do it

3475
02:43:37,279 --> 02:43:40,079
right

3476
02:43:38,559 --> 02:43:42,159
so

3477
02:43:40,079 --> 02:43:43,840
it's not like i'm saying this doesn't

3478
02:43:42,159 --> 02:43:45,039
exist as a system of course it does we

3479
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:47,120
can see that certificate of

3480
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:49,040
authenticities already exist what i'm

3481
02:43:47,120 --> 02:43:51,040
saying is it's a useless system it

3482
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:53,359
doesn't allocate money towards actually

3483
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:55,520
ever making anything it allocates money

3484
02:43:53,359 --> 02:43:58,079
towards not making something

3485
02:43:55,520 --> 02:44:01,279
right and that to me

3486
02:43:58,079 --> 02:44:02,799
is a very fictional unproductive way of

3487
02:44:01,279 --> 02:44:05,800
structuring anything

3488
02:44:02,799 --> 02:44:05,799
right

3489
02:44:30,559 --> 02:44:34,559
so i think the question so uh jaz rabbit

3490
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:36,079
your question of what should be the

3491
02:44:34,559 --> 02:44:37,439
price of the mona lisa every copy of the

3492
02:44:36,079 --> 02:44:38,719
malaysia should be one million or wait

3493
02:44:37,439 --> 02:44:39,600
well let me just let's use the first

3494
02:44:38,719 --> 02:44:42,318
part someone probably need what should

3495
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:43,920
be the price of alisa

3496
02:44:42,318 --> 02:44:45,199
this gets to the actual reason that i'm

3497
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:47,760
talking about this

3498
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:49,600
so in the real world when you ask what

3499
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:51,040
should be the price of the mona lisa

3500
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:52,720
then you get into the problem of like

3501
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:54,479
well okay

3502
02:44:52,719 --> 02:44:55,438
you can see why you created authenticity

3503
02:44:54,478 --> 02:44:57,199
and all these sorts of things because

3504
02:44:55,439 --> 02:44:58,479
it's like we wanted to have a market for

3505
02:44:57,200 --> 02:44:59,840
this thing

3506
02:44:58,478 --> 02:45:01,278
so that you can pay for it or whatever

3507
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:02,880
right because

3508
02:45:01,279 --> 02:45:05,040
in theory

3509
02:45:02,879 --> 02:45:06,799
there will always be a difference

3510
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:08,800
between the original mona lisa and a

3511
02:45:06,799 --> 02:45:09,840
copy of the mona lisa there is a

3512
02:45:08,799 --> 02:45:12,159
difference

3513
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:12,159
right

3514
02:45:12,239 --> 02:45:14,639
so

3515
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:16,319
we then get swept up in this whole

3516
02:45:14,639 --> 02:45:17,119
discussion about like how do you value

3517
02:45:16,318 --> 02:45:18,318
the fact that there is a difference

3518
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:20,000
between these two things and all that

3519
02:45:18,318 --> 02:45:21,278
other stuff right

3520
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:24,478
the reason that i brought this up with

3521
02:45:21,279 --> 02:45:26,319
nfts is because nfts don't have that

3522
02:45:24,478 --> 02:45:27,760
there's literally zero difference

3523
02:45:26,318 --> 02:45:29,519
between the original mona lisa and a

3524
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:31,439
copy of the mona lisa in nft land

3525
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:35,120
because it's digital

3526
02:45:31,439 --> 02:45:37,520
so that's why they make

3527
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:39,279
this system makes even less sense right

3528
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:40,720
if you will once you start to think

3529
02:45:39,279 --> 02:45:41,600
about the fact that there's literally no

3530
02:45:40,719 --> 02:45:43,519
difference between those things because

3531
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:45,600
someone could still argue

3532
02:45:43,520 --> 02:45:47,200
that even the best forgery of the mona

3533
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:48,640
lisa is somewhat different than the

3534
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:50,399
original

3535
02:45:48,639 --> 02:45:53,439
am i right

3536
02:45:50,398 --> 02:45:56,959
look maybe we can't really just like

3537
02:45:53,439 --> 02:45:59,120
totally reproduce it to within human

3538
02:45:56,959 --> 02:46:00,879
perception

3539
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:03,279
you know

3540
02:46:00,879 --> 02:46:05,358
with nfts that's totally gone you know

3541
02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:07,920
it's exactly the same so now we are

3542
02:46:05,359 --> 02:46:09,600
literally just trying to make up a

3543
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:10,398
reason why we can sell this thing for

3544
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:12,399
more

3545
02:46:10,398 --> 02:46:14,719
than what it's actually worth in its

3546
02:46:12,398 --> 02:46:16,159
duplicated state

3547
02:46:14,719 --> 02:46:17,599
and i just don't think that leads to

3548
02:46:16,159 --> 02:46:18,719
good outcomes

3549
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:20,559
right

3550
02:46:18,719 --> 02:46:21,920
it seems like outcomes should be based

3551
02:46:20,559 --> 02:46:23,680
on

3552
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:25,920
allocating money based on the fact that

3553
02:46:23,680 --> 02:46:28,920
we know that digital goods are exactly

3554
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:28,920
reproducible

3555
02:47:00,879 --> 02:47:05,199
well my assumption is nfts are a bubble

3556
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:07,520
i can't imagine anyone will ever really

3557
02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:11,040
cause again when you go to the mona lisa

3558
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:11,840
thing at least the romantic idea

3559
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:13,760
of

3560
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:17,279
the original mona lisa is at least

3561
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:17,279
slightly different than a forgery

3562
02:47:18,239 --> 02:47:20,799
that

3563
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:22,720
or like what someone said before like da

3564
02:47:20,799 --> 02:47:24,559
vinci's hands touch this

3565
02:47:22,719 --> 02:47:25,760
right

3566
02:47:24,559 --> 02:47:28,559
those things don't exist at all in the

3567
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:30,960
nft market it's just bits

3568
02:47:28,559 --> 02:47:32,799
the the person didn't touch them

3569
02:47:30,959 --> 02:47:34,879
right they were just copied inside a

3570
02:47:32,799 --> 02:47:35,599
computer there's no romantic notion at

3571
02:47:34,879 --> 02:47:37,358
all

3572
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:41,200
it's exactly the same

3573
02:47:37,359 --> 02:47:41,200
no one ever touched it right

3574
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:46,840
it's it's the same

3575
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:48,559
so it'd be really hard to sustain that

3576
02:47:46,840 --> 02:47:50,639
ruse

3577
02:47:48,559 --> 02:47:54,840
everyone knows it everyone knows it's

3578
02:47:50,639 --> 02:47:54,840
exactly the same right

3579
02:48:16,478 --> 02:48:20,318
yeah you have to but yeah do you think

3580
02:48:18,159 --> 02:48:25,079
davinci would would have rage quit

3581
02:48:20,318 --> 02:48:25,079
because wacom tablets are so crappy now

3582
02:48:36,398 --> 02:48:39,840
also so here's another question

3583
02:48:38,398 --> 02:48:43,439
so

3584
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:45,120
assuming that the great masters

3585
02:48:43,439 --> 02:48:47,520
all used

3586
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:49,680
an ipad pro

3587
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:51,840
to do their painting

3588
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:53,040
would they all have been arrested by the

3589
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:56,880
fbi

3590
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:59,920
when apple sent their pictures as child

3591
02:48:56,879 --> 02:49:02,398
porn to the fbi because they all paint

3592
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:04,239
little naked babies all the time

3593
02:49:02,398 --> 02:49:05,920
like if you go look at like the sistine

3594
02:49:04,239 --> 02:49:07,760
chapel there's like naked babies

3595
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:11,439
everywhere right

3596
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:13,040
like like 90 of the stuff covering like

3597
02:49:11,439 --> 02:49:14,559
all these services are little like

3598
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:17,040
cherubs

3599
02:49:14,559 --> 02:49:19,840
that are obviously babies and they're

3600
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:21,200
obviously naked so would apple just flag

3601
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:23,600
all that like

3602
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:25,439
does apple just flag rome

3603
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:28,800
as the fbi

3604
02:49:25,439 --> 02:49:31,120
has to go there and arrest everybody

3605
02:49:28,799 --> 02:49:31,119
right

3606
02:49:32,318 --> 02:49:36,398
they're like rome is under arrest

3607
02:49:37,439 --> 02:49:40,479
of course actually as i'm saying that

3608
02:49:38,799 --> 02:49:42,239
too like it's the catholic church so

3609
02:49:40,478 --> 02:49:43,599
actually if they had sent the fbi there

3610
02:49:42,239 --> 02:49:45,119
and arrested everybody they'd probably

3611
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:47,200
just be ahead of the game because that's

3612
02:49:45,120 --> 02:49:49,520
what the fbi had to eventually do anyway

3613
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:52,520
so maybe i take that back but point

3614
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:52,520
being

3615
02:49:54,799 --> 02:49:57,119
you know

3616
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:04,760
i i i feel like there's there's maybe a

3617
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:04,760
problem there

3618
02:50:08,159 --> 02:50:11,760
but but yeah i mean as i said that out

3619
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:13,680
loud i was like wait a minute

3620
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:15,840
actually

3621
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:17,680
you know the sistine chapel is maybe the

3622
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:19,279
one place where if apple had sent them

3623
02:50:17,680 --> 02:50:20,840
to arrest everybody they probably would

3624
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:25,159
have just been fine because that's

3625
02:50:20,840 --> 02:50:25,159
probably you know

3626
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:58,559
if the value of art is arbitrarily

3627
02:50:56,879 --> 02:51:00,959
decided by people why can't originality

3628
02:50:58,559 --> 02:51:02,719
be arbitrarily chosen as value it can

3629
02:51:00,959 --> 02:51:04,478
and it is

3630
02:51:02,719 --> 02:51:05,760
right i mean it has been that's why i

3631
02:51:04,478 --> 02:51:08,719
was saying like certificate says the

3632
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:10,639
original mona lisa right it has been

3633
02:51:08,719 --> 02:51:11,760
what i'm saying is that it was a bad

3634
02:51:10,639 --> 02:51:15,119
idea

3635
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:17,600
right that was a bad arbitrary decision

3636
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:19,600
um because it doesn't actually involve

3637
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:21,439
people paying money towards something

3638
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:23,680
they actually need

3639
02:51:21,439 --> 02:51:23,680
right

3640
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:28,880
it's the same problem as a million

3641
02:51:26,879 --> 02:51:31,759
dollar car

3642
02:51:28,879 --> 02:51:34,639
there really isn't any use for it right

3643
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:36,559
it doesn't really do anything for us

3644
02:51:34,639 --> 02:51:38,239
that there are all these people working

3645
02:51:36,559 --> 02:51:41,039
on making this

3646
02:51:38,239 --> 02:51:43,359
really really expensive car

3647
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:45,680
it doesn't really even lead to new

3648
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:47,439
information in the same way that say the

3649
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:48,800
moon landing did or something like that

3650
02:51:47,439 --> 02:51:50,239
right

3651
02:51:48,799 --> 02:51:52,639
so you just have to look at how you

3652
02:51:50,239 --> 02:51:55,520
allocate money as a society extreme

3653
02:51:52,639 --> 02:51:57,039
luxury items tend not to be very useful

3654
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:58,720
to society

3655
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:00,319
they're basically just like a thing for

3656
02:51:58,719 --> 02:52:03,519
rich people to do that don't actually

3657
02:52:00,318 --> 02:52:05,680
have many that don't actually allocate

3658
02:52:03,520 --> 02:52:09,920
the work towards things that are

3659
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:09,920
generally benefit people you know

3660
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:13,920
so like a hundred thousand dollar car

3661
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:16,159
maybe make some sense a million dollar

3662
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:19,120
car now you're up at the place where

3663
02:52:16,159 --> 02:52:20,719
it's not about hey this is where we work

3664
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:23,040
on new technology

3665
02:52:20,719 --> 02:52:24,478
it's really just about us trying to

3666
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:25,840
figure out ways to make this car be

3667
02:52:24,478 --> 02:52:28,719
worth a million dollars for no reason

3668
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:31,760
like gold plating it or

3669
02:52:28,719 --> 02:52:34,000
doing weird by hand stitching of all of

3670
02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:35,840
the things around it or like just stuff

3671
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:38,079
that is completely useless but just like

3672
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:40,000
we had to come up with ways to make this

3673
02:52:38,079 --> 02:52:41,840
car be worth a million dollars right

3674
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:43,920
that's the original mona lisa that's all

3675
02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:47,120
this stuff it's ways of coming up with

3676
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:49,120
making things be worth a million dollars

3677
02:52:47,120 --> 02:52:50,800
for no reason

3678
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:52,079
just because you know there are people

3679
02:52:50,799 --> 02:52:54,559
out there who will pay the million

3680
02:52:52,079 --> 02:52:55,680
dollars the sealed mario

3681
02:52:54,559 --> 02:52:58,239
cartridge

3682
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:59,920
that was like a 1.5 million dollars

3683
02:52:58,239 --> 02:53:02,079
that's like the dumbest thing i've ever

3684
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:03,680
heard right

3685
02:53:02,079 --> 02:53:06,559
but that's all these things are they're

3686
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:09,200
just ways of trying to manufacture

3687
02:53:06,559 --> 02:53:12,799
value in a place where it doesn't really

3688
02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:14,880
need to be and by putting money there

3689
02:53:12,799 --> 02:53:17,519
it doesn't disappear right that money

3690
02:53:14,879 --> 02:53:20,318
doesn't just go into thin air

3691
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:22,560
that money goes into the infrastructure

3692
02:53:20,318 --> 02:53:25,199
necessary to support that

3693
02:53:22,559 --> 02:53:27,760
that infrastructure is useless auction

3694
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:30,560
houses are useless

3695
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:34,478
authentic authenticity verification is

3696
02:53:30,559 --> 02:53:37,199
useless it doesn't provide any new

3697
02:53:34,478 --> 02:53:38,719
things for a society right

3698
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:41,200
so it's just

3699
02:53:38,719 --> 02:53:41,199
waste

3700
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:46,800
that's the point where it's creating

3701
02:53:45,359 --> 02:53:49,920
waste

3702
02:53:46,799 --> 02:53:51,599
nobody else benefits from it it's all of

3703
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:53,520
this infrastructure

3704
02:53:51,600 --> 02:53:55,439
all of those people who were doing all

3705
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:57,200
of that stuff

3706
02:53:55,439 --> 02:53:58,639
would have been better employed doing

3707
02:53:57,200 --> 02:53:59,520
something else

3708
02:53:58,639 --> 02:54:03,318
right

3709
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:03,319
so you're right

3710
02:54:06,799 --> 02:54:12,318
i mean that's that's economics right

3711
02:54:08,478 --> 02:54:14,159
economics is how do you allocate labor

3712
02:54:12,318 --> 02:54:15,039
that's what economics is

3713
02:54:14,159 --> 02:54:16,799
right

3714
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:19,680
and you look at these things and you say

3715
02:54:16,799 --> 02:54:22,959
are nfts a good way to allocate labor

3716
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:24,479
the answer is absolutely not like i defy

3717
02:54:22,959 --> 02:54:27,358
anyone to show me

3718
02:54:24,478 --> 02:54:29,599
some economic model under which an nft

3719
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:31,920
increases the accuracy of labor

3720
02:54:29,600 --> 02:54:34,479
allocation like it just doesn't happen

3721
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:38,398
priceless art is exactly the same way it

3722
02:54:34,478 --> 02:54:41,599
does not allocate any useful work

3723
02:54:38,398 --> 02:54:41,599
it's all wasted work

3724
02:54:44,239 --> 02:54:48,879
yes video games are very productive

3725
02:54:46,879 --> 02:54:51,039
right so if all the people who were

3726
02:54:48,879 --> 02:54:52,879
curating and verifying priceless art

3727
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:54,560
were making video games that'd be great

3728
02:54:52,879 --> 02:54:56,879
because everyone can play those video

3729
02:54:54,559 --> 02:54:56,879
games

3730
02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:00,159
right the the

3731
02:54:58,719 --> 02:55:01,438
billion people in the world who play

3732
02:55:00,159 --> 02:55:03,840
video games

3733
02:55:01,439 --> 02:55:05,920
are benefited right

3734
02:55:03,840 --> 02:55:07,200
by more people making more video games

3735
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:10,478
they have better selection they have

3736
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:10,479
better quality that right

3737
02:55:10,719 --> 02:55:14,478
so you said that as a joke but no that's

3738
02:55:12,398 --> 02:55:17,358
what i'm saying

3739
02:55:14,478 --> 02:55:20,879
making things that other people can use

3740
02:55:17,359 --> 02:55:24,399
that the average person can use

3741
02:55:20,879 --> 02:55:24,398
that is creating value

3742
02:55:24,478 --> 02:55:30,000
spending time doing something that is

3743
02:55:26,959 --> 02:55:31,278
literally useless i'm just verifying

3744
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:33,600
this thing

3745
02:55:31,279 --> 02:55:33,600
right

3746
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:38,960
nothing came of that that person's labor

3747
02:55:36,318 --> 02:55:38,959
disappeared

3748
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:47,760
remove the phrase arbitrary think

3749
02:55:46,639 --> 02:55:51,599
permanent

3750
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:53,359
did the labor create something permanent

3751
02:55:51,600 --> 02:55:55,840
verifying the authenticity running an

3752
02:55:53,359 --> 02:55:59,840
auction sorry it creates nothing

3753
02:55:55,840 --> 02:55:59,840
it's completely wasted right

3754
02:56:00,639 --> 02:56:04,000
if those people had instead been doing

3755
02:56:02,318 --> 02:56:05,600
something that created something for

3756
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:07,920
society that would definitely have been

3757
02:56:05,600 --> 02:56:07,920
a win

3758
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:15,520
yeah permanent or consumable right like

3759
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:19,399
something that someone can eat might be

3760
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:19,399
considered fine too right

3761
02:56:26,799 --> 02:56:33,920
even pyramids would be better

3762
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:36,560
right because at least it was something

3763
02:56:33,920 --> 02:56:38,398
at least it existed

3764
02:56:36,559 --> 02:56:39,920
but i agree i don't know that you want

3765
02:56:38,398 --> 02:56:43,599
to optimize for building useless

3766
02:56:39,920 --> 02:56:46,398
structures it seems similar to nfts

3767
02:56:43,600 --> 02:56:48,479
um but at least it's permanent you could

3768
02:56:46,398 --> 02:56:49,680
use it for a living space

3769
02:56:48,478 --> 02:56:51,119
i mean you could do something with it

3770
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:54,920
eventually at the minute it's just a

3771
02:56:51,120 --> 02:56:54,920
tourist trap but

3772
02:57:12,799 --> 02:57:16,079
all right i'm tired of talking to me

3773
02:57:14,478 --> 02:57:17,679
this stuff is kind of just obvious like

3774
02:57:16,079 --> 02:57:18,398
i'm not sure why i'm even talking about

3775
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:21,398
it

3776
02:57:18,398 --> 02:57:21,398
like

3777
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:26,880
there are so many things that need doing

3778
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,318
um

3779
02:57:26,879 --> 02:57:30,318
that i just don't know why you would

3780
02:57:28,318 --> 02:57:32,719
spend time creating

3781
02:57:30,318 --> 02:57:34,799
things that don't need to be done right

3782
02:57:32,719 --> 02:57:37,358
which is basically what we're doing

3783
02:57:34,799 --> 02:57:39,438
with both crypto and nfts

3784
02:57:37,359 --> 02:57:40,720
it's just things that nobody needed

3785
02:57:39,439 --> 02:57:42,159
and you're just creating them for no

3786
02:57:40,719 --> 02:57:44,639
reason

3787
02:57:42,159 --> 02:57:47,520
and and they don't actually exist right

3788
02:57:44,639 --> 02:57:50,639
they're just fictional constructs

3789
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:52,960
and it's like all of that energy all of

3790
02:57:50,639 --> 02:57:55,278
the work all of that stuff could have

3791
02:57:52,959 --> 02:57:56,398
gone into something else

3792
02:57:55,279 --> 02:58:00,560
something that someone could actually

3793
02:57:56,398 --> 02:58:01,760
use a video game a you know better web

3794
02:58:00,559 --> 02:58:03,439
browser

3795
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:05,040
you know

3796
02:58:03,439 --> 02:58:07,439
better chip designs whatever those

3797
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:08,160
people could have been doing

3798
02:58:07,439 --> 02:58:10,239
i

3799
02:58:08,159 --> 02:58:12,719
it all would have been better than nfts

3800
02:58:10,239 --> 02:58:14,159
or crypto right and especially when you

3801
02:58:12,719 --> 02:58:15,519
think about the fact that nfts and

3802
02:58:14,159 --> 02:58:17,959
crypto are actually they're somewhat

3803
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:20,640
complicated so it's not like these are

3804
02:58:17,959 --> 02:58:23,039
completely you know useless employees

3805
02:58:20,639 --> 02:58:24,559
who couldn't have done anything else

3806
02:58:23,040 --> 02:58:26,000
they're people who probably had some

3807
02:58:24,559 --> 02:58:27,519
capabilities

3808
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:29,840
right

3809
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:29,840
um

3810
02:58:30,559 --> 02:58:34,799
like like this is work that could have

3811
02:58:32,159 --> 02:58:36,079
been allocated better and and i i i

3812
02:58:34,799 --> 02:58:37,519
don't know how people are actually

3813
02:58:36,079 --> 02:58:38,318
arguing that on the chat if you really

3814
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:40,239
think

3815
02:58:38,318 --> 02:58:42,239
that nfts and crypto were like good

3816
02:58:40,239 --> 02:58:44,478
allocations of money

3817
02:58:42,239 --> 02:58:44,478
um

3818
02:58:44,799 --> 02:58:48,398
like or labor is really the thing

3819
02:58:46,478 --> 02:58:49,519
because the money is just a proxy right

3820
02:58:48,398 --> 02:58:51,039
so if you think there were good

3821
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:52,640
allocations of labor that's what labor

3822
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:54,560
should be spent on

3823
02:58:52,639 --> 02:58:55,439
i really don't know what to say

3824
02:58:54,559 --> 02:58:58,439
um

3825
02:58:55,439 --> 02:58:58,439
but

3826
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:15,920
you

3827
02:59:54,159 --> 02:59:58,879
so the anti-bank anti-government

3828
02:59:56,719 --> 03:00:00,239
ideological strain of crypto is actually

3829
02:59:58,879 --> 03:00:02,239
fine

3830
03:00:00,239 --> 03:00:04,079
um the problem is they're not solving

3831
03:00:02,239 --> 03:00:06,159
those problems that's really my

3832
03:00:04,079 --> 03:00:07,359
complaint with it right like i like the

3833
03:00:06,159 --> 03:00:09,920
idea

3834
03:00:07,359 --> 03:00:12,479
that you could have like a libertarian

3835
03:00:09,920 --> 03:00:15,439
currency because we see so many problems

3836
03:00:12,478 --> 03:00:17,278
like things like with payment processors

3837
03:00:15,439 --> 03:00:18,559
you know shutting people off and

3838
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:20,479
whatever

3839
03:00:18,559 --> 03:00:22,079
um you saw that with with the only fans

3840
03:00:20,478 --> 03:00:22,879
thing just recently

3841
03:00:22,079 --> 03:00:25,840
um

3842
03:00:22,879 --> 03:00:25,839
for example

3843
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:28,478
the problem is

3844
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:30,239
i don't

3845
03:00:28,478 --> 03:00:32,559
the cryptocurrency doesn't solve that

3846
03:00:30,239 --> 03:00:34,879
problem right the government will still

3847
03:00:32,559 --> 03:00:36,559
be able to regulate it any way they want

3848
03:00:34,879 --> 03:00:38,398
because they have the army

3849
03:00:36,559 --> 03:00:40,318
um and they can just come to your house

3850
03:00:38,398 --> 03:00:43,119
and arrest you right

3851
03:00:40,318 --> 03:00:45,199
so it doesn't really help and so

3852
03:00:43,120 --> 03:00:47,040
really my complaint about crypto is not

3853
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:49,359
that i don't want to solve the same

3854
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:51,520
problems that they claim to be solving

3855
03:00:49,359 --> 03:00:54,000
because i would love a solution to that

3856
03:00:51,520 --> 03:00:55,520
problem it's more that i don't see how

3857
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:57,279
any of the things they're making

3858
03:00:55,520 --> 03:00:59,279
actually solve this problem that's the

3859
03:00:57,279 --> 03:01:01,920
problem like if someone could figure out

3860
03:00:59,279 --> 03:01:05,760
how to make the

3861
03:01:01,920 --> 03:01:06,639
universal distributed governments then

3862
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:08,318
great

3863
03:01:06,639 --> 03:01:10,398
what does that even mean that sounds

3864
03:01:08,318 --> 03:01:11,760
terrible like mob rule is the only thing

3865
03:01:10,398 --> 03:01:12,959
i can think of that sort of is that and

3866
03:01:11,760 --> 03:01:14,639
we kind of have that on twitter it's

3867
03:01:12,959 --> 03:01:17,119
terrible right

3868
03:01:14,639 --> 03:01:18,959
so i don't see

3869
03:01:17,120 --> 03:01:22,640
the solution

3870
03:01:18,959 --> 03:01:22,639
right um

3871
03:01:22,799 --> 03:01:26,079
i don't see the solution

3872
03:01:31,200 --> 03:01:33,359
the payment processors aren't the

3873
03:01:32,398 --> 03:01:34,959
government though they're a private

3874
03:01:33,359 --> 03:01:36,880
institution who don't own a military and

3875
03:01:34,959 --> 03:01:38,079
couldn't stop selling crypto uh no they

3876
03:01:36,879 --> 03:01:40,398
can right

3877
03:01:38,079 --> 03:01:43,279
so um

3878
03:01:40,398 --> 03:01:43,278
think of it this way

3879
03:01:43,359 --> 03:01:47,520
whoever are the people who are running

3880
03:01:45,439 --> 03:01:50,079
the bitcoin mining

3881
03:01:47,520 --> 03:01:51,760
they're the new payment processors

3882
03:01:50,079 --> 03:01:53,520
they will just be pressured by the

3883
03:01:51,760 --> 03:01:54,960
government

3884
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:56,800
in exactly the same way the current

3885
03:01:54,959 --> 03:01:59,438
payment processors are and they will

3886
03:01:56,799 --> 03:02:00,799
enact the exact same sets of

3887
03:01:59,439 --> 03:02:03,680
limitations

3888
03:02:00,799 --> 03:02:07,199
for the exact same reasons

3889
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:07,200
it literally solves nothing

3890
03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:15,760
midnight son i don't think i know what

3891
03:02:14,398 --> 03:02:18,239
the i'm sorry i don't understand the

3892
03:02:15,760 --> 03:02:18,239
argument

3893
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:27,279
i don't really think it has anything to

3894
03:02:25,279 --> 03:02:28,399
do with the password because a password

3895
03:02:27,279 --> 03:02:30,800
is something

3896
03:02:28,398 --> 03:02:33,119
that only you know

3897
03:02:30,799 --> 03:02:33,119
right

3898
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:38,559
so it's useful in that sense

3899
03:02:36,239 --> 03:02:41,600
crypto does not have that property if

3900
03:02:38,559 --> 03:02:43,840
you want to conduct a transaction

3901
03:02:41,600 --> 03:02:45,520
the transaction has to be able to be

3902
03:02:43,840 --> 03:02:47,680
backed up by a court of law and a

3903
03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:49,760
government if it doesn't the person can

3904
03:02:47,680 --> 03:02:51,439
simply not honor the transaction i go to

3905
03:02:49,760 --> 03:02:54,559
the grocery store

3906
03:02:51,439 --> 03:02:56,559
and i use my crypto to buy um a

3907
03:02:54,559 --> 03:02:58,559
grapefruit and as i walk out of the

3908
03:02:56,559 --> 03:03:01,760
store the person says oh you can't have

3909
03:02:58,559 --> 03:03:01,760
that you stole that grapefruit

3910
03:03:02,318 --> 03:03:06,079
what prevents that from being a real

3911
03:03:04,318 --> 03:03:08,318
problem in society is the fact there are

3912
03:03:06,079 --> 03:03:10,079
courts they look at evidence

3913
03:03:08,318 --> 03:03:12,159
the government has police

3914
03:03:10,079 --> 03:03:13,520
they enforce that law and the result of

3915
03:03:12,159 --> 03:03:15,680
what happened in that court that's how

3916
03:03:13,520 --> 03:03:17,600
society functions crypto doesn't have

3917
03:03:15,680 --> 03:03:20,000
any answers for any of those things

3918
03:03:17,600 --> 03:03:21,359
that's the problem right

3919
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:25,120
and so

3920
03:03:21,359 --> 03:03:26,399
crypto needs that it needs courts

3921
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:28,960
police

3922
03:03:26,398 --> 03:03:30,398
law right that is what makes a currency

3923
03:03:28,959 --> 03:03:31,919
actually work

3924
03:03:30,398 --> 03:03:33,519
not that you can track an integer

3925
03:03:31,920 --> 03:03:35,760
tracking an integer doesn't do anything

3926
03:03:33,520 --> 03:03:36,800
for you we can track integers with just

3927
03:03:35,760 --> 03:03:37,840
a server

3928
03:03:36,799 --> 03:03:39,358
right

3929
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:41,359
the problem is what do you have what

3930
03:03:39,359 --> 03:03:43,279
happens when people disagree

3931
03:03:41,359 --> 03:03:46,318
about whether someone who agreed to do

3932
03:03:43,279 --> 03:03:48,159
something for that integer doesn't do it

3933
03:03:46,318 --> 03:03:49,840
right

3934
03:03:48,159 --> 03:03:51,760
i took two grapefruits but i only paid

3935
03:03:49,840 --> 03:03:54,760
for one

3936
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:54,760
eh

3937
03:04:32,398 --> 03:04:35,680
well my point is just yeah that in

3938
03:04:33,840 --> 03:04:38,000
general broadly speaking the government

3939
03:04:35,680 --> 03:04:39,600
has the police power so they're the ones

3940
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:41,120
who can say what will happen and won't

3941
03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:42,159
happen and that's pretty much the end of

3942
03:04:41,120 --> 03:04:44,560
it

3943
03:04:42,159 --> 03:04:45,920
and the reason that payment processors

3944
03:04:44,559 --> 03:04:47,680
do what they do is because of the

3945
03:04:45,920 --> 03:04:49,680
government regulations payment

3946
03:04:47,680 --> 03:04:51,840
processors don't care

3947
03:04:49,680 --> 03:04:51,840
right

3948
03:05:00,719 --> 03:05:03,879
all right

3949
03:05:08,318 --> 03:05:10,959
couldn't decide to decide that we

3950
03:05:09,680 --> 03:05:13,359
switched to crypto for our currency and

3951
03:05:10,959 --> 03:05:14,239
change lodge accordingly um

3952
03:05:13,359 --> 03:05:15,680
so

3953
03:05:14,239 --> 03:05:17,920
you could

3954
03:05:15,680 --> 03:05:20,159
but if you could do that you don't need

3955
03:05:17,920 --> 03:05:21,840
to switch to crypto

3956
03:05:20,159 --> 03:05:24,318
like if we just passed a law tomorrow

3957
03:05:21,840 --> 03:05:25,200
that said that everyone had to accept

3958
03:05:24,318 --> 03:05:26,959
you know

3959
03:05:25,200 --> 03:05:28,159
transactions from everybody

3960
03:05:26,959 --> 03:05:30,799
that would solve the problem you don't

3961
03:05:28,159 --> 03:05:30,799
need the crypto

3962
03:05:31,279 --> 03:05:36,560
right so if you have this is why i say

3963
03:05:34,639 --> 03:05:38,639
crypto is worthless because if you have

3964
03:05:36,559 --> 03:05:41,439
the political will

3965
03:05:38,639 --> 03:05:43,278
to create the laws that you actually

3966
03:05:41,439 --> 03:05:44,960
wanted you could have created them

3967
03:05:43,279 --> 03:05:47,840
without crypto you could have just said

3968
03:05:44,959 --> 03:05:47,839
that for dollars

3969
03:05:48,239 --> 03:05:51,039
there can be no discrimination in

3970
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:53,600
charges you have to process charges from

3971
03:05:51,040 --> 03:05:55,200
anyone for any reason always

3972
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:56,800
right

3973
03:05:55,200 --> 03:05:58,479
and number two

3974
03:05:56,799 --> 03:05:59,599
you um

3975
03:05:58,478 --> 03:06:00,799
what's the other thing that crypto

3976
03:05:59,600 --> 03:06:02,960
claims to solve i don't know what they

3977
03:06:00,799 --> 03:06:02,959
do

3978
03:06:09,520 --> 03:06:14,960
oh and that no one can ask

3979
03:06:12,079 --> 03:06:17,200
right

3980
03:06:14,959 --> 03:06:21,438
no one no one can ask no one can

3981
03:06:17,200 --> 03:06:21,439
subpoena your transaction records

3982
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:25,040
right you pass those two laws you're

3983
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:25,920
done

3984
03:06:25,040 --> 03:06:29,840
now you've got everything that

3985
03:06:25,920 --> 03:06:29,840
cryptocurrency ever ever promised

3986
03:06:30,398 --> 03:06:35,719
right

3987
03:06:32,478 --> 03:06:35,719
that's it

3988
03:07:04,799 --> 03:07:09,438
yeah and okay so so the non-subpoenaing

3989
03:07:07,439 --> 03:07:11,359
part is giving crypto the benefit of the

3990
03:07:09,439 --> 03:07:14,159
dart i doubt i do realize that in

3991
03:07:11,359 --> 03:07:15,760
actuality i think most cryptocurrencies

3992
03:07:14,159 --> 03:07:18,239
yeah they haven't actually solved the

3993
03:07:15,760 --> 03:07:20,478
problem of privacy

3994
03:07:18,239 --> 03:07:20,478
um

3995
03:07:20,719 --> 03:07:25,199
so

3996
03:07:21,920 --> 03:07:27,680
but let's suppose someday they did

3997
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:27,680
somehow

3998
03:07:33,600 --> 03:07:36,600
so

3999
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,799
all right

4000
03:07:41,279 --> 03:07:45,279
that's it

4001
03:07:42,799 --> 03:07:49,239
this is all very stupid

4002
03:07:45,279 --> 03:07:49,239
i'll see you folks next time
