00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,870
okay hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,030
handmade Hero the show recode a complete

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,740
game live on twitch no engines no

4
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:13,289
libraries we do absolutely everything

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,539
ourselves and that's both educational

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,939
and for entertainment purposes let's be

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:19,140
honest I kind of think it's fun if you

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,580
want to follow along with today's

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,469
episode and you have pre-ordered the

10
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,768
game on handmade hero org using the

11
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:27,629
little nifty pre-order button you can

12
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:29,399
download the source code and be advised

13
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,919
there are now two source code zip files

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,659
one for the first hundred days and one

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,800
for the that we're in currently make

16
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,078
sure you download the latest one and

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,759
unzip day 100 source code because that's

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,429
what we're using to start with here on

19
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:45,058
day 100 so that's what you want to get

20
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:47,878
on in terms of synchronizing with what

21
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:50,399
I'm about to do with what I am about to

22
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,049
do now we left off yesterday we had

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,719
basically finished everything but we

24
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:57,058
hadn't debugged it so we're running and

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,980
we're doing all the things roughly that

26
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,198
we need to do but we have some things

27
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:04,829
that are either definitely or probably

28
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,239
bugs and so like it kind of said at the

29
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:07,590
end of last episode it's like all right

30
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,899
it's a little late now to start the

31
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,689
debugging process so tomorrow we'll just

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,359
spend the time to step through and debug

33
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:17,938
it and if you remember we had a couple

34
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,069
different things that were bugs first of

35
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,769
all we weren't transforming our normals

36
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,989
right and so if things rotate it's not

37
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,899
correct so we have to take a look at

38
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:29,969
that we were fairly certain when we were

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,159
using the sphere normal map that it

40
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,359
isn't seem to be bending the correct way

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,189
that we think it should so we think

42
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,140
we've probably got a little bit of a bug

43
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,839
there so we're getting close to having

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,420
normal maps working properly we just

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,859
don't have sort of the fine details

46
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,478
nailed down so what I'd like to do first

47
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,040
is let's just go ahead and start

48
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,420
thinking about how we're gonna fix this

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,100
transform problem since we're already

50
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,629
set up to do it we can see that we're

51
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:57,809
rotating and yet we're always still

52
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,339
pointing essentially up and down as we

53
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,759
rotate our bitmap which is not at all

54
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:08,149
what we actually wanted it to do so if

55
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:11,060
we come in to here to our Emacs and

56
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,530
I don't have an Emacs open do I know it

57
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,209
seems like I've got a lot of things open

58
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,709
why this week things

59
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:23,120
what have some things open all right I

60
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:27,829
come over here to Emacs and there we go

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,930
and I open up our renderer so when we

62
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:35,299
actually grab that normal out right

63
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:37,340
we've we've done the work of grabbing

64
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:39,230
that normal layout and what we want to

65
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,620
do here is we want to be able to

66
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:44,030
transform our normal but you know we

67
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,680
want to be able to rotate it we've got

68
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,318
it to do in here rotate normals based on

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,750
X Y axis we want to be able to spin it

70
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,310
so that the normals are facing the

71
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,479
correct way that they would be facing if

72
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,979
the bitmap is being spun now if the

73
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,408
bitmap isn't spinning it's no big deal

74
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:01,280
but you know and because then the

75
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:02,929
normals are all facing the correct

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,039
direction and so probably will want to

77
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,810
have a fast path in here eventually

78
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:08,269
because there's a lot of things that we

79
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,889
simply wouldn't need to do in all cases

80
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:11,450
because a lot of times we just have

81
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,799
bitmaps that are blip that that don't

82
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:16,818
rotate right they're just in one

83
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,799
stationary forum without any rotation so

84
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:21,078
it's kind of a waste of time to do some

85
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,489
of these things but in order to support

86
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,780
them all we at least have to first make

87
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,060
a path that does everything and then we

88
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,189
can sort of work on boiling that down

89
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:32,120
into the cases that we actually need and

90
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:39,079
can optimize so if we want to rotate the

91
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:40,579
normals right where is the pen that is a

92
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:42,500
problem I don't actually know where the

93
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:45,500
pen is for our blackboard there it is

94
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,878
it got slid up when we were when I was

95
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,859
fussing with having to change the

96
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:53,239
keyboard in the beginning of the stream

97
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:54,379
so if we go over to the blackboard for a

98
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,609
second and just think about what this

99
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:58,668
means it's it's pretty straight forward

100
00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:00,650
if we but we kind of just have to make

101
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:02,449
sure that we we you know work out the

102
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,680
math right right it's a pretty

103
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:05,989
straightforward thing that we're trying

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,209
to do basically all we're seeing is that

105
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,949
we've got a map right and in it it's

106
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,180
essentially got some vectors that are

107
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,769
embedded in it right it's got

108
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,169
information in there where there's

109
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:18,108
vectors and when we read those vectors

110
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:20,478
out of the map we're treating them as if

111
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:21,500
they're just as if the map was just just

112
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,079
right-side up like

113
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,389
right and so we have you know an X and a

114
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,829
y-axis or something like that you know

115
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,500
here's our y-axis here it's our x-axis

116
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:33,409
we have this X and y-axis and even if

117
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,170
those those axes end up being rotated

118
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,750
that's like so right

119
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,230
we are still grabbing when we grab this

120
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,899
out

121
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,879
right the texels in here still have the

122
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:45,919
same direction so when we grab out this

123
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,189
Texel it's still going to be pointing

124
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,960
like that even though we've rotated like

125
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:54,500
45 degrees and it should have been

126
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,259
pointing like that right and so what we

127
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,970
need to do is we need to use these axes

128
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:04,490
to rotate our normals as well now if we

129
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,830
if we're doing non-uniform scaling right

130
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,110
meaning the the the X and the y are

131
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:11,599
gonna get scaled non-uniformly

132
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:16,129
which we're currently allowing this gets

133
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,689
a little bit hairy and the reason it

134
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:20,000
gets a little bit hairy is because you

135
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:24,230
have to sort of consider what actually

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,240
happens with normals in that case right

137
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,160
like you know if you imagine that this

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,579
is a is a vector that goes between two

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,950
things if I was to scale up the Y right

140
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:36,889
you kind of have to imagine that the

141
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:38,750
normal there is gonna stretch kind of

142
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,519
like this right you know like it's it's

143
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,930
gonna end up being well I guess if I use

144
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,279
to draw it exactly correctly it'd be

145
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,699
something like this if I was to scale up

146
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,978
the y axis right my normal is gonna

147
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,569
scale up in that in that fashion just as

148
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:52,250
if it were kind of a point that would be

149
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:57,500
it would that was being scaled up right

150
00:05:52,250 --> 00:06:01,100
and the question is is that actually

151
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,470
what we would want to happen if we took

152
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:08,120
the surface that was being represented

153
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:10,760
here and did a similar scale right and

154
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,129
so what I want to sort of draw for you

155
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,379
first is just to sort of you know if I

156
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:19,969
can get you thinking about this let's

157
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:23,329
say so pretend we have let's let's

158
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,060
pretend we have something that's maybe

159
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:26,599
like a shape that looks kind of like

160
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,538
this

161
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,419
maybe it's the edge of like a gem or

162
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:35,329
something like that right and so you

163
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:38,029
know the normal is pointing let's say at

164
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:42,829
kind of a 45-degree angle here right the

165
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:45,709
normals pointing off like that okay and

166
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:49,519
what I want to show you here is that if

167
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:52,848
I were to take the y-axis right if I

168
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:55,639
were to take the y-axis and scale the

169
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:59,300
y-axis up right so if I were to increase

170
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,650
that then the shape that the normals are

171
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,810
coming from that the normals supposed to

172
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,938
be representing is going to elongate

173
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,709
right so I'm basically going to get

174
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:08,210
something that looks like this right I'm

175
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:11,598
gonna get well it's gonna shear

176
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:14,959
essentially so it's gonna be like draw a

177
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:17,360
little bit better version here right so

178
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,529
you know imagine this is getting scaled

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,810
up a bit

180
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:23,089
and you know so it's gonna elongate this

181
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,360
piece here as the whole thing scales up

182
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:28,668
right well if I was to scale the normals

183
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,009
by that same amount right you can

184
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:33,918
actually see that what'll happen is the

185
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:36,979
normal will also scale in that same way

186
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,049
if I was to use the same axes right but

187
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:42,800
if you look at what the surface did

188
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:46,250
really the surface is implying a normal

189
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,180
that would do the opposite thing as that

190
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,579
right

191
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,129
meaning the normal to this surface will

192
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:54,019
actually point this way more it'll

193
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:58,218
actually point more down this way as

194
00:07:54,019 --> 00:08:00,740
this surface you long gates so really if

195
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:02,149
we are to support non-uniform scaling if

196
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,879
we actually want to do the normals

197
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,728
correct it's not simply the case that we

198
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:12,259
can just scale our normals by the same

199
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:16,189
thing as we scale our our regular images

200
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:18,830
by right and that's because you know

201
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,449
this is one of those places where if you

202
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:22,490
happen to have a lot of linear algebra

203
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:29,750
knowledge it it's helpful because this

204
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:31,788
would be obvious to you but if you don't

205
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,198
it's not and so I'll try to kind of give

206
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:35,509
a little bit of the background here

207
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:37,399
again not a mathematician so I can't

208
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:39,769
give you kind of the full deal but I can

209
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,979
sort of give you a a window into what's

210
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:48,759
going on here right so the deal is that

211
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:53,120
actually vectors are not all the same

212
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:54,860
okay and there's a lot of reasons why

213
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,870
vectors might not be the same obviously

214
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,389
you know you could think of things like

215
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,459
okay well if I have an RGB color value

216
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:04,938
or or let me give you a more specific

217
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:07,869
example if I have an RGB a color value

218
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:10,610
right and this is premultiplied alpha

219
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:14,299
you've already seen that it operates

220
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,938
differently than if I had an RGB a thing

221
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:18,769
and it was non pre multiplied right we

222
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:20,299
know that this one will allow us to do

223
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:24,230
linear operations on and it works

224
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:26,929
whereas this one it doesn't right and so

225
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,300
we've kind of already seen that vectors

226
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:33,049
are a way of bundling numbers together

227
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:34,729
at their most fundamental level they we

228
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:36,889
treat them as sort of a way of working

229
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,499
on numbers together but that's a very

230
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:42,198
mechanical notion of vector which is not

231
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:44,389
the same as the theoretical notion of a

232
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:45,859
vector that might exist depending on

233
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:47,269
what kind of operations you're doing and

234
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,909
we kind of can see that difference here

235
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:51,769
like premultiplied alpha is a proper

236
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:53,419
linear conceptually linear vector that

237
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:55,578
does the things they might want to do

238
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:57,679
and non P bolts Y Delta is not that way

239
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:59,750
it's a different thing it's sort of a

240
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,508
different object in a sense mathematical

241
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,919
object not programming object and so you

242
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,778
really do have to understand that

243
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,729
vectors behave differently and in this

244
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:11,419
case that's sort of what we have the

245
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:14,509
points that make up this shape are one

246
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:16,068
kind of vector or one kind of point you

247
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:17,990
might say but one kind of vector that

248
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:19,789
goes from the origin to that point right

249
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,049
that's one kind of vector and behaves

250
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:23,058
one way when the coordinate system

251
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:25,818
changes but these normals are a

252
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:28,610
different type of vector and there's

253
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:33,789
actually a terms for this I believe it's

254
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:38,629
their covariant and I want to say

255
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:40,639
contravariant is that right I don't

256
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:41,750
really remember the exact analogy so I'm

257
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,178
not going to write it on the blackboard

258
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,678
I don't want to be able to be wrong but

259
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:48,289
basically there's different types of

260
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:50,659
vectors when you talk about having a

261
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:53,178
transform that you're passing them

262
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:55,100
through and so if I have some transform

263
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:57,769
like we have this elongation we'll call

264
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,778
that F right when I put one of our

265
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,879
points through this F and we get out a

266
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:06,200
new point

267
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:08,600
if I want our normals to come out so

268
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,820
that they obey the same properties that

269
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,100
the normals want want to obey it's not

270
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,230
the same transform right it's not X

271
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,690
anymore it's actually a different

272
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:25,430
transform that you would have to push

273
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:31,220
the normals through now again if I

274
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:32,509
remember correctly what happens and you

275
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,240
know what we should do we should ask

276
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,919
pseudonym 73 for these terms he will he

277
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,690
will know these terms for sure they're

278
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,729
very standard linear algebra math terms

279
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,980
and it's just been so long I used to

280
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,509
know them even that's that's how common

281
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,110
linear algebra they were is I used to

282
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:51,259
know them but I've long since forgotten

283
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:53,240
but basically normals and and the points

284
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:55,970
in the plane are treated differently and

285
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,220
you actually see this in linear algebra

286
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,339
you see it actually written differently

287
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,379
even where as you will often see vectors

288
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:05,690
that are these like sort of point like

289
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:09,439
things they are often written as column

290
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:12,350
vectors so you might have px py PZ right

291
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,240
but normals are not normals are actually

292
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,269
written this way they're written as row

293
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,360
vectors right they're actually not even

294
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:24,889
the same shape in the math they are

295
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:28,669
transposed as as compared to to these

296
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:31,399
guys and the rule for how covariant

297
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:33,159
train have orient or well I guess we'd I

298
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:37,339
don't want to use the term how normals

299
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:40,759
are transformed is that if you have a

300
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:42,529
transform that operates on your points

301
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,528
there's actually something called the

302
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:47,629
inverse transpose that operates on your

303
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:50,179
normals and in order to sort of get into

304
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:52,009
how this actually works we'll probably

305
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:53,299
have to open up matrices a little and I

306
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:55,068
don't know if this is a good idea for

307
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:57,229
today it seems like we may be going down

308
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:58,039
a little bit of a math hole but

309
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,899
sometimes you have to go out in the

310
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,818
manhole so maybe we'll introduce this

311
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:06,409
concept and we'll think about it a

312
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:08,719
little bit okay so what was I doing

313
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:11,328
before right in terms of constructing

314
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,699
these these P vectors right well we had

315
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:14,489
stuff that was in 2d right so I had a px

316
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:16,889
and a py

317
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,870
right these were points in space and

318
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,909
what I wanted to do was I wanted to

319
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,070
start treating these points as if they

320
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:25,019
were in some coordinate system right and

321
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,420
so what we did is we constructed a thing

322
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:30,000
where we would say okay the point that

323
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,379
we actually want in on the screen right

324
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,539
or I guess we could call this the screen

325
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,399
space point or something right what we

326
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:37,259
ended up doing is we took the two

327
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,449
components of this thing that we were

328
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:42,179
describing and we would multiply them by

329
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,740
like an x-axis vector and a y-axis

330
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:45,479
vector and remember this was our

331
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,539
coordinate system test thing that we

332
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,200
made where these are you know they vary

333
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:55,019
right these two things are vectors 2d

334
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,700
vectors that vary and they were what

335
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,559
allowed us to do like rotation stuff we

336
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,220
would rotate these vectors and then all

337
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,000
of the point values would

338
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,080
correspondingly move with them right

339
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,850
remember we had that little grid that

340
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,259
was moving around and everything and we

341
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,360
could scale it we could rotate it and

342
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,490
that was the basis that formed the like

343
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,649
basis both literally and figuratively of

344
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,940
what we were doing with getting rotation

345
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,809
and scaling to work for our texture

346
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,210
mapping ok well this we can actually

347
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:24,899
write this in matrix form and we haven't

348
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:26,670
really done much with matrices yet but

349
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,620
now might be a reasonable time to do

350
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:31,110
that and so if we think about writing

351
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,149
this in matrix form we have to just kind

352
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,980
of go back and review how matrix

353
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:36,539
multiplication works so that we're all

354
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,620
on the same page there cuz like we

355
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:39,149
haven't done it very much and I don't

356
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,009
want to spring that on you without

357
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:44,309
giving you a little bit of a background

358
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:48,659
on it so let's say I have a matrix that

359
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:50,309
is you know a 2 by 2 matrix and matrices

360
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,789
and vectors are basically cut from the

361
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:52,649
same cloth

362
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,909
right they are arrays if you're a

363
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:56,159
programmer you can think of them as a

364
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:59,759
raise of numbers that go together right

365
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:03,629
and so if I have a vector here and I

366
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,809
have a matrix well you remember how we

367
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:08,340
sort of we did one extremely similar

368
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:09,509
example to this when we did the dot

369
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,670
product right when we did the dot

370
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:14,700
product we had something where we did

371
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:16,979
like an 1 X Y and 1 you know we did we

372
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,870
did 1 vector times another vector and we

373
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,320
did the dot product right and we said

374
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,700
that that was whatever this vector is I

375
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,710
guess I don't know call that v-0 and

376
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,528
we'll call this v1 right we said that

377
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:31,649
that was v-0 transpose V 1 right

378
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:35,818
in fact I just do this here v-0

379
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:37,289
transpose V one right and we wrote it

380
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:38,938
that way for our dot product and

381
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:41,009
remember we wrote it that way because we

382
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,629
were turning this vector on its side and

383
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:44,850
that's what the transpose operator does

384
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:46,139
right it turns things on their side and

385
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,360
we're gonna see that a little bit more

386
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,698
more explicitly what that means for

387
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,528
bigger shapes than than just vectors in

388
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:54,088
a second here but that's how we wrote it

389
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:55,679
and then when we did our multiplication

390
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:59,220
remember all we had to do was just go

391
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:01,198
okay we just add the terms and we line

392
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,569
up multiplication right so we start with

393
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,789
the first one in each we multiply to get

394
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:07,620
a X and then we add we start with the

395
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:09,149
next one down we multiply and then we

396
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,318
add and we would just keep going no

397
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,350
matter how long the vectors are and

398
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:15,120
that's what produces that dot product

399
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,339
well a matrix multiply is no different

400
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,568
right or I should say a matrix times a

401
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,529
vector multiply is no different but

402
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:20,818
really none of these are different

403
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:23,519
matrix times matrix would be no

404
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:25,318
different either all you do is you start

405
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,778
with the column and the row the first

406
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,028
common row and you do that dot product

407
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,870
you take the first term right and you

408
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:32,669
multiply them together

409
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,828
you take the next term you multiply them

410
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:36,838
together an ad right and you would keep

411
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,399
going if you had more when you're done

412
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:44,220
with that you go on to the next one

413
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:47,278
right next row column so it's CX plus dy

414
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,949
right so really what we have here is two

415
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:53,159
dot products right we have two dot

416
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:56,099
products we have this dotted with this

417
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:59,188
and we have this dotted with that okay

418
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,569
now you may ask well I don't understand

419
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:02,458
why you're telling us that because this

420
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:04,379
is not dot products what what are you

421
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:07,288
doing like what how are these related I

422
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,789
don't understand right and that's true

423
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:11,189
it's a little opaque what's happening

424
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:13,078
here and that's because this is just one

425
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:14,819
way of breaking up the terms you can see

426
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,188
those dot products there right and this

427
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,928
is the conceptualization if you were

428
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:23,038
thinking about it in terms of dot

429
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:26,220
products or inner products right these

430
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,199
are the same thing same term right so

431
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,640
this is the inner product view but

432
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,190
there's another way to look at this

433
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,240
right because if you take a look at

434
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,000
what's happening here

435
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,909
right you can actually see that there's

436
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,599
another way we could break up what's

437
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:45,990
going on in this particular

438
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:49,529
equation right because if you sliced it

439
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:51,720
this way instead right you could imagine

440
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:55,170
this as being the sum of two different

441
00:17:51,720 --> 00:18:00,809
vectors right this is also just reading

442
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:03,480
it off the sum of ax C X right plus B Y

443
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:05,429
dy do you see how I did that I just

444
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,380
grabbed these and I grabbed these and I

445
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,450
broke them out into two vectors write

446
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,460
this if we added them together would

447
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,259
also produce the same thing right so

448
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,850
this this product that we did British by

449
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,379
using the matrix multiplication rules we

450
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:18,899
can also see it would work the same way

451
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,390
here and what we also see is each of

452
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,240
these vectors has a common term in them

453
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:30,530
so if we wanted to factor it further we

454
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:32,339
could say this was X AC right plus y BD

455
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:34,139
right by just pulling that out because

456
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:35,549
remember scalars multiply into a vector

457
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,180
they just multiply straight on in there

458
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:41,639
right so this is actually another way of

459
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:45,690
looking at this matrix multiplication

460
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:49,530
which means that this if you imagine

461
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:53,250
this was an x axis here and this was a y

462
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:57,359
axis here right it essentially means

463
00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:01,559
that the columns of this matrix are the

464
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:04,500
axes right of our transform format that

465
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,779
we have been using so we could just

466
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,910
trivially if we wanted to start thinking

467
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,730
in terms of matrices just purely by

468
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:14,430
packing our X and y axis into a matrix

469
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,190
all we would do is create the matrix

470
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:20,340
that has our x axis as X at the top our

471
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,220
x axis is y at the bottom our y axis is

472
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:25,980
X in the the next column over and our y

473
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:30,000
axis is y underneath this is the

474
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:33,809
fundamental transform for rotation and

475
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,460
scaling for our 2d that's that's what it

476
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:38,129
is right that's what that allows us to

477
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:41,309
do and so here's our x axis here's our y

478
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,870
axis here's our matrix okay and so

479
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:44,909
really this whole time we have been

480
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:48,209
doing matrix math by writing this

481
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,740
manually but we didn't have to we could

482
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,960
have been doing it in matrix form if we

483
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,329
wanted to now you may ask why would we

484
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,890
do it in matrix form and the reason is

485
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,449
because if you start thinking about the

486
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,940
in terms of matrix form where I just say

487
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,380
okay I've got a matrix and here it is

488
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,170
you can actually start writing matrix

489
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,120
math which is much like what we did with

490
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,009
vectors we could have done all of the

491
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,019
work that we did with vectors in scalar

492
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:11,849
but we chose not to because once we

493
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:14,250
elevate up to vectors it's much easier

494
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:16,619
for us to build up sort of a grammar of

495
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,660
what we are saying we want to do that

496
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,669
just operates on the vectors and that

497
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,080
allows us a break free from having to

498
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,029
micromanage all of these scalar

499
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,279
quantities and the same thing is true of

500
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:28,500
matrices right that's exactly the same

501
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:30,389
thing that happens with matrices we can

502
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,339
build up the transforms for example

503
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,680
there is operations which multiply

504
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:38,129
matrices together so if we were to have

505
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,350
one set of Trant of rotation and scaling

506
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,300
that we wanted to represent and we did

507
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:44,039
it this way if we then made another one

508
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:46,529
right so we've got another one here

509
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,329
that's got some I'll just put dot dot

510
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:51,809
dot there that's got some other set of

511
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:54,119
axes if we wanted to know what a Zane it

512
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:57,690
system would look like transformed by B

513
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,639
we can actually just make another matrix

514
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,590
which is these two multiplied together

515
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,270
and then this one will represent the

516
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:04,980
combined transform without having to

517
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:06,599
store any more numbers it still only

518
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,730
stores a two by two but it encapsulates

519
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,579
everything that was happening with these

520
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,230
two matrices furthermore matrices in

521
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:15,750
addition to having multiplication they

522
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,259
also have inverse if I wanted to say the

523
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:22,920
opposite of the transform that happens

524
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:24,569
with a I can do a inverse and and they

525
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,820
also have you know other things like

526
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:27,960
addition and so on but we probably won't

527
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,369
really be able to do much with those

528
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:36,329
those are usually for more for numerical

529
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:37,379
solving and stuff like that inversion is

530
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:40,649
something that's pretty tricky we'll

531
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,510
talk about that in a second but if you

532
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,040
take a look at matrix multiplication

533
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,720
that is actually trivial I've already

534
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,369
taught you how to do it all you do is

535
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,460
literally do the exact same thing I just

536
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:53,219
sort of harped on up here this process

537
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:57,059
if you do that is exactly the same with

538
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:01,170
matrices if I was to say have you know a

539
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:04,349
b c d and then i wanted another matrix

540
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:07,890
here which is just going to be you know

541
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:11,159
you V w-why or something I don't even

542
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:13,410
know why I picked those you do exactly

543
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,970
the same thing and you know what I might

544
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,830
do I might spread this out a little bit

545
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:20,788
just to make it a little easier for us

546
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:22,349
to see it so let's call that UV W X

547
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:25,109
let's say all right there we go

548
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:28,500
so if we were to do this again you are

549
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:31,500
trying to form four different products

550
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,390
because you know and I guess I haven't

551
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,919
mentioned this yet but whenever you do

552
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:37,080
matrix multiplication and you line them

553
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:40,110
up like this you get as many rows as you

554
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:42,389
have on the on the the first term side

555
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,949
and as many columns as you have on the

556
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,000
second term side because you just line

557
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,480
them up like this and you could actually

558
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,119
see right where they go right when you

559
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,829
do that multiplication you can really

560
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,029
just do it mechanically when you want to

561
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,928
solve for one of the terms you know

562
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:56,908
you're gonna have a two by two when you

563
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:59,130
want to know what that that term is you

564
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:05,130
just read it off you take the the terms

565
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:06,780
right au plus BW right that's my first

566
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,340
term just that straight dot product

567
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,000
exactly how I would do it you want to do

568
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:14,399
the next one

569
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,890
same exact thing V a and V X and B right

570
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,970
go down to the next row same thing UW

571
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:24,200
and CD no problem see you + WD you want

572
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:27,690
to do final one here no problem CV plus

573
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,130
DX right and that's how you do much mate

574
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,409
republication there's literally nothing

575
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:34,020
to it it's just a series of these dot

576
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:36,000
products which you could do totally by

577
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:37,408
rote nothing fancy so if you just write

578
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,750
it in this tabular form it's pretty easy

579
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:41,400
to see exactly how it works and that is

580
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,169
all you need to start compositing

581
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,150
transforms now we don't have a lot of

582
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:46,650
need to composite transforms which is

583
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,360
why I haven't done me of this yet

584
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:52,230
because we really just don't have a lot

585
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:55,579
to do with that but now when we're tired

586
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,750
of talking about these these covariant

587
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:59,668
the different types of vectors and stuff

588
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,869
um how they transform it becomes handy

589
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:03,179
to start talking about it in a more

590
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:05,219
linear algebra sense and the reason for

591
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:07,080
that is just because a lot of these

592
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:11,279
things yeah a lot of these things become

593
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:13,139
clearer if you can start talking about

594
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,308
something as the inverse and we all know

595
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,870
what that actually means conceptually

596
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:16,889
rather than having to sort of go through

597
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:19,649
and

598
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,300
arrived it so if we actually want to

599
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,580
talk about the two operations that I

600
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:26,730
mentioned so we have two operations a

601
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:30,629
transpose ranked and we have a inverse

602
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:33,329
so we have this is the inverse and this

603
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,800
is the transpose now you've already seen

604
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:38,339
what the transpose does it lays things

605
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,559
on the side right we we did that here

606
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:42,089
right so here's what the transpose does

607
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,379
the transpose lacings outside well what

608
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:45,449
does that mean for a matrix well

609
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,370
actually what it's really doing is it's

610
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,519
actually sort of doing a mirror around

611
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:52,769
the diagonal so the transpose is an

612
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,619
operation is a thing where if you have

613
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:57,779
this right and you want to transpose it

614
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,699
what you actually end up with is you

615
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:01,349
draw that diagonal you imagine that

616
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,350
diagonal going straight down the matrix

617
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:06,299
0 0 1 1 2 2 and so on for the

618
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:09,089
coordinates in the matrix right you

619
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:11,549
leave that untouched because everything

620
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:14,579
flips around it but all other things

621
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:16,889
they exchange around the diagonal they

622
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,419
mirror so the B would come down here and

623
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,000
the C would go there right they would

624
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,710
flip that's the transpose and that's

625
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,990
true no matter how big this matrix got

626
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:28,470
if I had more values here right so if I

627
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,880
had stuff like this basically these two

628
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,500
would have exchanged these two would

629
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,090
have exchanged just like these 2 did and

630
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,849
you can keep going it doesn't matter how

631
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:37,169
big it is however big the matrix is you

632
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:40,019
still are doing that exact same thing

633
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,150
everything on the side of that diagonal

634
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,420
it flips right so every single thing

635
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:47,880
flips right that's the transpose

636
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,800
operator very very simple to understand

637
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,240
we'll get to why it's important in a

638
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,940
second but it's extremely easy to

639
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,920
produce because in some sense you don't

640
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,799
even really need to do anything it's

641
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,210
it's literally just a reordering of the

642
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,009
things in the matrix and often times you

643
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,970
actually do do the reordering because

644
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:04,200
you're trying to make it flow through

645
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,529
properly but you could almost imagine

646
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,019
Swizzle the indices on a matrix would be

647
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:11,190
you know how one way to do a transpose

648
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:12,569
on you could almost just have a flag

649
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,890
that Swizzle be interested in the C's

650
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:15,539
that would do it if for some reason it

651
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,730
was expensive because they were big

652
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:20,430
matrices or something right so that's

653
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:23,009
how transpose works now inverse on the

654
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:25,380
other hand is more complicated if you

655
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:27,839
have the inverse of a matrix the inverse

656
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,720
of a matrix is defined as whatever the

657
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:33,149
matrix it's x you know

658
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,420
in fact I guess I could draw this out a

659
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:39,840
little bit bigger so if I have a matrix

660
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:42,920
here like so the inverse is defined as

661
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:47,339
the matrix where if I was to multiply it

662
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:50,300
by the original matrix right I would get

663
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,449
ones in the diagonal and zeros elsewhere

664
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:54,059
okay

665
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,470
and this is a special matrix which is

666
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:58,529
actually usually called the identity

667
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,120
matrix right the identity matrix is the

668
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:02,430
one that does absolutely nothing to the

669
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,649
things that come into it right and you

670
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,480
can see why that would be if you imagine

671
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,450
multiplying a vector by one of these

672
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,829
guys right you can see what happens when

673
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,559
we actually do the math that I was

674
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:16,079
saying incomes the vector it's going to

675
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,519
multiply XY times 1 0 well that's just

676
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,199
going to pick out the x coordinate right

677
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,599
and the Y is going to get multiplied to

678
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,220
0 so there's no additional term same

679
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,049
thing if we do the math here right it's

680
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,150
going to know if the X is going to drop

681
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:29,940
out Camilla flobiz 0 and the y is going

682
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,160
to be right there right so we end up

683
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,750
with just getting the same thing in as

684
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,220
out and the same thing would be true if

685
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,019
we stacked a matrix up here we get the

686
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,130
same thing so an identity matrix is just

687
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:40,859
something that does literally nothing

688
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:43,290
it's completely inert it has no effect

689
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,699
on anything that multiplies by it now

690
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:49,889
technically this is the multiplicative

691
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:53,450
identity right and furthermore it's the

692
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:56,009
multiplicative identity on the right

693
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,690
right because technically we're

694
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,309
multiplying it we're multiplying it on

695
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,950
the right side of this term if this was

696
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:03,029
a and this was a inverse we're talking

697
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,890
about the one that comes on the right

698
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:06,299
now that's not something you really have

699
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,670
to think about in anything that we're

700
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:11,369
going to do but technically there's left

701
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,620
and right inverses and matrices when you

702
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:16,589
start getting into matrices that are not

703
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:22,469
in the same kinds as we're doing so I'm

704
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:25,709
not even to touch that but suffice to

705
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,089
say technically this is like I don't

706
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,680
know if this is the right term for it

707
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:30,269
but these are the properties it's the

708
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,900
multiplicative identity it's the one on

709
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:35,190
the right but furthermore the reason

710
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,440
that I said that multiplicative identity

711
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,549
is because it's a multiply it's saying

712
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,009
it's the identity in terms of

713
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:44,658
multiplication you could imagine the

714
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:47,250
additive right identity

715
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:48,899
the additive identity would not be that

716
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,849
if I was gonna add make sure together

717
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:52,768
adding matrices is exactly the same as

718
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:54,959
you do with vectors you just add each

719
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:57,870
component right if I was to add I would

720
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,970
end up with a plus one BCD plus one

721
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:02,038
which is not the same matrix right so

722
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,960
the additive identity is just all zeros

723
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:05,548
is a matrix with all zeros right and

724
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,590
that's the same on the right or the left

725
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:10,440
but that's a that's a separate issue

726
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:12,178
right so again additive identity

727
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,558
none of this stuff we care about at all

728
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,850
I'm just pointing it out so that if you

729
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:18,028
want to go read linear algebra you're

730
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:19,319
not totally left in the dark and we'll

731
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:22,409
get back to the stuff that we actually

732
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:24,450
care about so the inverse is the matrix

733
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:28,409
that would go here such that we could

734
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,389
produce the identity right and so if you

735
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:33,059
think about it we know what this this

736
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:35,699
matrix multiplied out to be right we

737
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:38,190
produced it here right here's what it is

738
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,980
and so we can think about how we would

739
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,230
get an identity matrix out of this you

740
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,599
know out of how would we make this these

741
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:48,480
UV W and X what would we make those

742
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:52,888
values if we wanted this to come out to

743
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:57,569
be equals 1 equals 0 equals 1 equals oh

744
00:29:52,888 --> 00:30:00,599
sorry equals 0 equals 1 well the answer

745
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:02,460
obviously is you've got a system of four

746
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,500
equations and four unknowns you could

747
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,250
just solve them right we don't know you

748
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:12,000
V or W or X we do know ABC and D and we

749
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:13,740
know four equations using uvw X so all

750
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,710
we would have to do to produce @nd is

751
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:26,970
solve the four equations and that would

752
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:28,710
produce what we want right now that's a

753
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,149
pain in the butt I'm sure everyone

754
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,069
thinks it's a pain in the butt because

755
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:33,989
honestly as soon as I see something like

756
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:37,859
solve four simultaneous equations I'm

757
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:39,899
like hell's no right because I don't

758
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:41,278
even want to I don't even want to go

759
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,648
down that route right I don't want to

760
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:46,769
solve two simultaneous equations let

761
00:30:43,648 --> 00:30:48,959
alone four it's just an invitation for

762
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:52,798
me to make careless errors in the math

763
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,038
right but fortunately I feel like that

764
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:58,450
is where Gao steps in right and Gauss

765
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:02,500
who is also known as like you know

766
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:07,720
arguably greatest mathematician of all

767
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:09,609
time I don't know if pseudonym 73 wants

768
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,490
to step in here and and comment on that

769
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:16,209
but you know just in terms of this of

770
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:19,120
sheer quantity of stuff that the dude

771
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:22,840
figured out by himself I feel like he's

772
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:24,750
probably that guy there might be one or

773
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:28,179
two other people who could be

774
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:30,640
competitors but like Gauss is pretty

775
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,289
insane and like I said I think an

776
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,790
earlier stream he even invented stuff

777
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,470
that other people had their names on

778
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:38,019
like the Fourier transform I think was

779
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,250
actually him he just didn't publish it

780
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:41,230
or something but he actually got it

781
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,019
first right so it would be called the

782
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:46,360
Gauss transform if he had bothered to

783
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:48,789
like put it out there right so he's

784
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:51,129
crazy but point being he didn't want to

785
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:52,359
do this either because he was just like

786
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,130
why am I going through all these steps

787
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:55,779
there's got to be a better way at least

788
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,950
I'm putting words his mouth you probably

789
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:59,289
didn't say anything like that honestly

790
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:03,370
but point being we have a thing called

791
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:05,710
Gaussian elimination which actually is a

792
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:08,199
pretty easy way to deal with situations

793
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,569
like this where you want to solve

794
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,190
equations and and invert matrices and

795
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:14,529
that sort of stuff this is actually a

796
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:16,840
pretty easy way to produce those

797
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:18,789
inverses when you have small matrices

798
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:20,259
and you're not super worried about a lot

799
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:22,180
of numerical Finnick enos now

800
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:25,059
Gaussian elimination is not something

801
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:27,970
that you actually use to invert or solve

802
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:29,799
large matrix systems in the real world

803
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,940
where the matrices are huge I mean a lot

804
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,720
of times scientific computing you're

805
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,890
talking about maybe sheaves with

806
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,240
hundreds or thousands or tens of

807
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,370
thousands or millions even if you're

808
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,230
really unlucky of elements and there's

809
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:40,349
just no that's not on the table Gaussian

810
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,610
elimination I believe is an O n cubed

811
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:45,069
algorithm so I'm pretty sure you're not

812
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:46,419
gonna run that on anything large so they

813
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,919
use other things and furthermore it's

814
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,350
numerically unstable in a lot of

815
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,850
situations so there's other things that

816
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:53,049
are better for when you're dealing with

817
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:56,139
floating point numbers and that sort of

818
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:57,609
stuff so this is not a power tool that

819
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,340
you would be using if you really cared

820
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:01,779
about matrix math but we don't actually

821
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:05,439
we're talking about very simple things

822
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:07,750
very simplistic two-by-two matrices that

823
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,430
are well-formed they don't require any

824
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,900
special handling and so if we want to

825
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,610
think through how we can solve one we

826
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,310
can actually use Gaussian eliminate

827
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:17,379
fairly easier so what is gas elimination

828
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:21,129
well it turns out that matrices well

829
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:29,770
surprise surprise matrices actually

830
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:32,230
weren't invented for computer graphics I

831
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:34,450
know it's talking but they actually

832
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:36,880
weren't they were they were actually

833
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,710
invented to solve systems of equations

834
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,260
that's what they actually were so

835
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,750
typically what you do you went you know

836
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:45,099
the reason that people created matrix

837
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,710
math in the first place is they had a

838
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:49,659
lot of stuff that looked like this they

839
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:55,690
were like well I've got you know some

840
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:58,269
stuff that looks like that e^x + FY plus

841
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,549
GZ dot dot and they would just have

842
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:06,579
these systems of equations where they

843
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:08,650
just had tons of tons of equations and

844
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:10,480
tons of unknowns and they're like you

845
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:12,190
know what this is all the process of

846
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,690
solving these is all very mechanical and

847
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,190
we're doing the same thing every time we

848
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,970
should come up with a more

849
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:21,159
straightforward tabular way of solving

850
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,809
these that's more regular and when I say

851
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,280
they I guess I should say Gauss because

852
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:26,139
I guess he's the one who invented it and

853
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,710
what they realized was well if you've

854
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:31,989
got equations right and you've got you

855
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,579
know these sort of common you've got

856
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:36,639
them all in a bunch of unknowns that

857
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:40,750
you're trying to solve for and whatever

858
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,148
you can actually put them into a matrix

859
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:49,059
just put the coefficients into a matrix

860
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:52,089
write a b c e f g h i j don't know why

861
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:53,860
we skipped d there but we did you can

862
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,600
actually just put those into a matrix

863
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,840
and consider the matrix to be the

864
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,309
coefficients of the equations that

865
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,570
you're looking at and there's some other

866
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:03,159
steps that you would go through here

867
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,400
normally you do a thing where you've got

868
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:09,730
you know you've got this you would put x

869
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,130
y&amp;z into a vector of unknowns and you

870
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:14,139
would say ok we've got some product here

871
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,450
and then we've got equals whatever was

872
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:18,069
on the other side of this equation would

873
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,599
be out here and something called a BF

874
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,309
vector and you'd end up with something

875
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,199
called ax equals b which is the standard

876
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:24,820
matrix problem we don't care about that

877
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,279
at all right now I'm skipping it point

878
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,590
being

879
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,830
what happens here is if you think about

880
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:34,119
the way that you actually would solve

881
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:37,750
equations in multiple unknowns so let's

882
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:39,760
say that we just had a b c e f g h i j

883
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:43,659
here and we were working with those

884
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,040
right so what we wanted to do is we

885
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:48,489
wanted to start solving for these well

886
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:51,009
what you do is you first try to knock

887
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:52,239
out terms right you you know how you do

888
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:54,310
this when you solve right you start

889
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,829
eliminating terms so you get down to one

890
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:59,320
term which is like you know this last

891
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:00,789
term equals something you then divide by

892
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,910
the coefficient and you get Z equals

893
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:06,880
something you can then plug Z back into

894
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:09,129
other things and you can back solve for

895
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,530
each thing going you know going upwards

896
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:14,079
and so on so what they did is they sort

897
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:16,240
of regularized that process what they

898
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,819
realized is that well since any

899
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:24,250
equations right any equations that we

900
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:26,170
have we know that if we take and this I

901
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,059
guess for people who are not aware with

902
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,530
math I guess I'm blowing through so much

903
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:32,380
math this is turning into just a giant

904
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:34,570
math episode sometimes that happens on

905
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,890
handmade hero sometimes it happens you

906
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,480
sometimes you end up going down the math

907
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:39,009
hole and you're in the math hole so I'm

908
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,480
sorry that's where it's at we're just on

909
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,230
the main the math well today nothing

910
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,690
else is gonna happen

911
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:48,059
we're just entirely in the math hole

912
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:50,440
alright so in the math hole so if you

913
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:55,059
what was I about to say applying these

914
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,440
things into into into the matrix I

915
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:57,789
totally lost my train of thought by

916
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:02,309
thinking about the math hole I don't

917
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:02,309
even yeah it's a strange term I like it

918
00:37:02,608 --> 00:37:07,598
hmm that's a bit word all right I don't

919
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,369
know what I was going to say so I'm just

920
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,480
gonna skip it and go back to talking

921
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:12,070
about what I was talking about and

922
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,829
presumably I'll just end up saying it

923
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:21,070
again when I come to that point again

924
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:22,929
alright so anyway what they realized is

925
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,369
all right if we if we are to build one

926
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:27,730
of these things right if we're to build

927
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:29,710
sort of the the the matrix out of just

928
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:31,329
the coefficients of the unknown of the

929
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,269
that are on the unknowns that we wanted

930
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:36,909
to solve for what we could do is we can

931
00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:38,199
oh that's what I was about to say I knew

932
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:39,309
I would get to it because I have to

933
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,869
describe it I'm like I wouldn't

934
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:42,849
scribing if it wasn't a prerequisite for

935
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:44,829
what we're about to do so if you have

936
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:46,329
two equations right if you have an

937
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,590
equation you know here's the left-hand

938
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:49,029
side of an equation and here is the

939
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,579
right-hand side right and these are

940
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:54,580
whatever you want all I know is just an

941
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:59,259
equation well if I have one equation and

942
00:37:54,579 --> 00:38:01,960
I have a second equation right what I

943
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,790
know is I know that these two terms are

944
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,090
equal and that these two terms are equal

945
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:08,800
so if I wanted to it's totally legal for

946
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:12,700
me to just add these two things together

947
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,320
right I mean I can just add anything I

948
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:16,179
want to both sides of an equation as

949
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,460
long as I add the same thing to both

950
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:20,849
sides so since I know these are the same

951
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:25,929
thing they're equal I can just add right

952
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:28,900
lhs2 and I can add RHS too because I

953
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:31,569
know that LHS - and RHS - are the same

954
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:34,840
value they're equal right so what this

955
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:40,960
means is you can add any two equations

956
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:42,460
right for free right yes you can totally

957
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,690
fine you didn't violate anything by

958
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,199
doing that you can do that name all day

959
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,639
long

960
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,219
furthermore you know you can multiply

961
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:52,599
these by anything you want right if I

962
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:52,959
was to say add 2 LHS and to RHS to both

963
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,969
sides

964
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,050
totally legal - right because as long as

965
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:58,329
I multiply them by the same value

966
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,400
they're still the same value on either

967
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:03,309
side right I'm still adding the same

968
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,660
amount to both sides so since I can do

969
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:05,980
that what they were saying is well ok

970
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:07,239
now that we've tabulated these what we

971
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,949
can do is just think in terms of

972
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:14,169
operations on the rows and columns of

973
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:16,539
this matrix right and we can regularize

974
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:20,650
it right so what we can do is we can say

975
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:23,980
oh okay right if I take this top row

976
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,570
here right I take this ABC row and what

977
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,630
I want to do is start knocking out this

978
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:30,309
bottom row like the hij right what I can

979
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,519
do is say well if I wanted to eliminate

980
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:39,029
H all I would have to do is say well

981
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:42,280
what is H divided by a right what is

982
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:46,480
what is the amount of a I would have to

983
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:50,380
add to get me to get it to be equal to H

984
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,869
right I'm not sure I'm explaining this

985
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,670
in a particularly good way you know

986
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:56,170
let me do it let me do it with a number

987
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,369
so you can see because otherwise it

988
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,139
might be a little pretend we're not

989
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:01,239
talking about letters right now let's

990
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:05,409
just say we were talking about numbers

991
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:08,798
right so I've got five two three one

992
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:12,009
seven six and then like ten four nine

993
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:13,690
right and I want to knock out values

994
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:15,940
here I want to eliminate right

995
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:18,429
essentially eliminate terms right so I

996
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,710
want to luminate this term so what I can

997
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:22,778
do is I can say well how many of a would

998
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:26,289
I had to have to add to this right H

999
00:40:22,778 --> 00:40:28,329
over a tells me how much I would have to

1000
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:30,700
add of a to knock out two if i were

1001
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:32,140
subtracting it to knock out the 10 right

1002
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:34,748
and in this case you can see that that

1003
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:37,838
would be 2 right so what I can do is I

1004
00:40:34,748 --> 00:40:40,598
can take this row multiply it by 2 and

1005
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:44,588
subtract it from this room right so that

1006
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:46,588
would give me 10 for 6 right and now I

1007
00:40:44,588 --> 00:40:51,308
can subtract it from here and that

1008
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:52,778
totally eliminates this this term it

1009
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:54,249
actually happens to also eliminate this

1010
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:57,219
term I didn't actually mean to do that

1011
00:40:54,248 --> 00:41:00,429
but that's what happened right so then

1012
00:40:57,219 --> 00:41:02,739
instead of this row I would now have a 0

1013
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:05,199
right I would have another 0 and then I

1014
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:06,940
would have a 3 right so now I have

1015
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:09,218
accidentally eliminated two terms I only

1016
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,960
meant to eliminate one term my bad

1017
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:13,659
but now I've eliminated two of two of

1018
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,278
the of the three terms and now I have

1019
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:18,129
just one term left and that would

1020
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:20,619
correspond right to just having like

1021
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:22,450
this this JZ term here right I don't

1022
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:25,239
know jay-z's a rapper I believe but this

1023
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:28,989
is not his term this is our term so

1024
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:32,170
anyway if you are to do this process you

1025
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:34,349
can then divide this this last remaining

1026
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,489
term the 3 right and instead of actually

1027
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:38,410
bothering to eliminate or I could

1028
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:40,568
actually go ahead and actually eliminate

1029
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:42,429
it by using one of my other things but

1030
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:44,259
that's not that that's not productive

1031
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:46,748
right because I don't know if you can

1032
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:48,519
see how this would work here but if I

1033
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:50,858
was actually to do that I would it would

1034
00:41:48,518 --> 00:41:53,228
be hard for me to eliminate this without

1035
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:56,318
adding in quantities to these things

1036
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:57,998
here right so six of one half dozen

1037
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:00,338
either but point being once you've

1038
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:02,618
eliminated things you can then divide

1039
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:03,969
this by whatever the target is that you

1040
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:06,130
were working with over here and you can

1041
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:06,608
eventually produce what you want to end

1042
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,369
up produce

1043
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:10,630
is that identity matrix right now

1044
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:11,798
there's more steps involved here so I

1045
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,999
kind of have to go a little bit deeper I

1046
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:15,969
just want to make sure you understand

1047
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:18,548
this one process right here which is the

1048
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:20,998
ability to add rows to other rows right

1049
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:23,380
the ability to sort of say I'm taking

1050
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:24,879
one of the rows of the matrix and adding

1051
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,009
some it multiplied by something our

1052
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,390
since a subtracting or multiplying by a

1053
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:29,829
negative and then adding whichever way

1054
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:32,558
you want to think of it I'm basically

1055
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:35,109
using a row of the matrix to eliminate

1056
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:39,278
members of another row of the matrix

1057
00:42:35,108 --> 00:42:41,108
right okay so that's kind of very handy

1058
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:42,759
in what you can sort of see shaping up

1059
00:42:41,108 --> 00:42:45,159
here is this is much more computer

1060
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:46,690
friendly right like thinking about how

1061
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:47,980
to solve linear equations think about

1062
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,659
how to solve this may be a little

1063
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,980
confusing as to how do I have a computer

1064
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:52,629
do this do I have to start making like a

1065
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,179
symbolic algebra thing or something like

1066
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:56,619
that but this is a bag of numbers and

1067
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:58,989
that operation is something we could all

1068
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,818
right very easily right so you can start

1069
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:02,679
to see why might be possible to program

1070
00:43:00,818 --> 00:43:04,179
something like Gaussian elimination into

1071
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:05,828
the computer alright so let's take it a

1072
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:08,348
little bit one step further and talk

1073
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:12,009
about a little bit more explicitly how

1074
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:14,230
this would work right so what we want to

1075
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:15,900
see right what we want to actually have

1076
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:19,568
here as I was saying before us we have

1077
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:21,970
ABCD right and we want to produce

1078
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:23,889
something which when we multiply it

1079
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:26,169
together right we're going to end up

1080
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:29,400
with this right so we want like

1081
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:32,920
something up here and we want to produce

1082
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,749
this you know this this this matrix

1083
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,599
right so we want to be able to multiply

1084
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:42,899
by terms that are going to result in us

1085
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,900
getting a one zero zero one right

1086
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:54,329
so another way that we could think about

1087
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,510
this I'm trying to think if there's a

1088
00:43:54,329 --> 00:43:59,340
good man it's been a long time since I

1089
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:04,170
didn't done this I feel like there's a

1090
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:07,650
good way to motivate you can actually do

1091
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:09,960
a very simple trickier that makes it a

1092
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:11,280
lot easier to conceptualize how to do

1093
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,920
Gaussian elimination to produce the

1094
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,440
inverse basically you do the Gaussian

1095
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,119
elimination on this but I'm trying to

1096
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,849
think of how I would explain why that

1097
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:23,069
works it's been a long time since I well

1098
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:26,569
I'll just keep I'll just explain out the

1099
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:29,760
full thing and then we can

1100
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:31,859
see if I can think of the the other way

1101
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,349
the simple way to do it maybe I can go

1102
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:35,838
look in a book tonight or something in

1103
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:41,309
then and show it on tomorrow screen

1104
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:42,779
so anyway play being so we got two

1105
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:43,769
things her in fact I'm out and you know

1106
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,420
what I'll do we won't even talk about

1107
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:46,739
the inverse yet because maybe I can I

1108
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,240
can go look up what that nice trick is

1109
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:50,279
and that'll be an easier way to sort of

1110
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,879
explain it more easily let me talk about

1111
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,109
the regular solution form first right so

1112
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,730
the thing we were talking about before

1113
00:44:55,108 --> 00:45:01,469
we'll just make it absolutely explicit

1114
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:06,440
so we know what this produces right we

1115
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:08,699
know that this produces this and right

1116
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:13,309
we know that that's what that multiplies

1117
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:16,829
out to and here we go let's say right

1118
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:20,309
that we have some values that we want

1119
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:21,869
here right so let's say because here's a

1120
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:23,789
system right we know that this is how we

1121
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:25,380
would do this multiplication of vector x

1122
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:26,820
matrix right that's what we're doing

1123
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,559
vector x matrix we know what it would

1124
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,510
produce we would know how to do it

1125
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,159
forward if we had to do it forward

1126
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,320
meaning if I gave you this matrix if I

1127
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,210
gave you a matrix a and I gave you a

1128
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,559
vector we'll call the vector X even

1129
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:40,019
though I already put an X in there that

1130
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:42,750
was probably unwise and we'll call the

1131
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:46,019
speed right if I wanted you to produce

1132
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:48,358
the quantity ax I showed you how to do

1133
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:50,280
that if you know what X is right you

1134
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:53,369
know that you just multiply it like so

1135
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,280
and here's the result right this is ax

1136
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:57,780
right we've done that but the question

1137
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,700
now and the place for all this

1138
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,980
elimination and such as and so forth

1139
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:03,929
comes in is what would happen if you

1140
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,579
didn't know these so that's the case

1141
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:07,079
that we're talking about here you have

1142
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:08,909
the coefficients of your matrix but you

1143
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:11,608
don't know what these values are and you

1144
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:14,039
want to solve for them so I have some UV

1145
00:46:11,608 --> 00:46:17,369
over here I have some values I know B

1146
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:18,838
right let's say I know the result so

1147
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:20,490
instead of trying to find this result I

1148
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:23,400
know the result I know what this

1149
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:25,259
evaluates to what I don't know is what

1150
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,070
are the values I would plug in to make

1151
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,109
that happen

1152
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:30,000
it's the classic solve so this would be

1153
00:46:28,108 --> 00:46:35,489
a solution of two equations in two

1154
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,088
unknowns right and so that is where we

1155
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:40,109
kind of get into this is that is where

1156
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,519
we get in

1157
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,530
to how we could do the Gaussian

1158
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:46,289
elimination again remember these are

1159
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:48,210
just equations right so if I want to I

1160
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:54,900
can just write this and say okay this is

1161
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:56,670
just my ABCD right my XY equals UV right

1162
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:00,119
that's that's all we're doing here and

1163
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:03,090
if I want I can actually do the Gaussian

1164
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,929
elimination on the entire thing at once

1165
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,579
right

1166
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:07,199
because again these are just equations

1167
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:09,659
it's you can you can think of these as

1168
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:12,539
two different equations written in two

1169
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:14,069
rows right so if I want to I can just go

1170
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:16,349
ahead and straight up do the first step

1171
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:18,570
of the Gaussian elimination right I can

1172
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:21,000
say I've got my a I've got my see I want

1173
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:24,080
to knock out that C so that I can solve

1174
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,190
for y right and so if I want to do that

1175
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,840
it's pretty easy and you know what I'm

1176
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,920
gonna throw something in here because

1177
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,240
maybe this is a good way to introduce

1178
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,090
the trick but I'm not throw something in

1179
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:35,099
I'm gonna throw a little phantom guy I'm

1180
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:38,820
on the side here I'm gonna throw a

1181
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:41,789
little phantom mmm oops

1182
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:43,170
I wrote him wrong pretend he's not here

1183
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:44,670
he's just hanging out he's just hanging

1184
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:46,190
out over there right that's not part of

1185
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:48,869
the equation we're gonna leave him there

1186
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:50,519
so let's say I want to do that right how

1187
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,079
do I do that well the first thing I need

1188
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:54,389
to do is I need to knock out that C and

1189
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,489
I we already said if I take C divided by

1190
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:57,989
a that'll tell me how much I would need

1191
00:47:56,489 --> 00:48:00,179
to knock to knock it out how much I

1192
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:02,819
would need to add this robot right so

1193
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:05,099
that means I want to take this row and I

1194
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:07,470
want to multiply it by negative C over a

1195
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:09,599
right then I want to add it in and

1196
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:12,899
that's gonna knock out that C term it's

1197
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,369
gonna turn that C term to zero right so

1198
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,990
let me just do that let me just rewrite

1199
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:18,589
it that way with that added in there

1200
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:22,979
right so I've got a B I've got my x

1201
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:25,590
equals right I've got my you come on

1202
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,659
over here got my one my zero but now

1203
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:30,090
this next line I'm gonna add the top

1204
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:33,179
times negative C a to what we've got

1205
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:39,720
here right and so obviously in here well

1206
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:42,779
if I have negative C over a times a plus

1207
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:44,369
C right you can see that what happens

1208
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,290
there is the a is canceled out and the

1209
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:47,969
C's cancel out which gives me the zero

1210
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:51,000
right which is exactly what I thought so

1211
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:53,259
that's the zero then in the D term we

1212
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,130
just have D right

1213
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:59,680
and then minus CB over a right so that's

1214
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,269
just adding those together we're not

1215
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,710
going to actually bother figuring out

1216
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:04,059
what this guy is right now because these

1217
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,230
are the unknowns anyway so we don't

1218
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:07,119
really we don't really care about those

1219
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:09,400
guys the moment we're going to be the

1220
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:12,159
same thing to our to our UV over here

1221
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,980
we're gonna do that same ad right so we

1222
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,670
would take our V and we would add two

1223
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:19,570
I'm sorry

1224
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:21,789
it's subtract from it see you over a and

1225
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:24,550
now while we're at it I'm going to just

1226
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:26,230
go ahead and do the same thing to this

1227
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,420
make this identity matrix over here

1228
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:32,199
right and so I'm gonna take my zero

1229
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:34,599
right and I'm gonna add I'm sorry

1230
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:37,960
negative CA times the top so that's just

1231
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:39,940
a negative CA there right because it's a

1232
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,889
one right sourcing of CA and the same

1233
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:43,389
thing here I'm going to add negative CA

1234
00:49:41,889 --> 00:49:44,500
times this to this guy which would still

1235
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:46,449
just be one right because there's

1236
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:53,320
nothing there's nothing in there right

1237
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:58,359
and so that produces now for me this is

1238
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:59,740
called an upper triangular matrix it

1239
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,230
produces for me a matrix which has

1240
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:03,969
nothing no valid values below the

1241
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:04,990
diagonal right I've got my zero in there

1242
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:08,739
my zero is just kind of sitting there

1243
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:13,599
right but it's not quite done yet

1244
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:16,599
because while I actually do now know the

1245
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,190
answer for one of my unknowns right

1246
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:19,779
I could actually solve for one of my

1247
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:22,510
unknowns now if I wanted to write I've

1248
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:25,890
got this right I've got D minus C B over

1249
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:28,450
a and I've got V minus C u over a right

1250
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:30,190
so if you think about what this meant

1251
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:32,469
right in the in terms of the actual

1252
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:35,889
equations I actually do have one

1253
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:40,629
straight across equivalence that I could

1254
00:50:35,889 --> 00:50:47,139
write right i could say D minus CB over

1255
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:50,260
a y equals V minus C you oops see you

1256
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:52,929
over a right and I could solve that if I

1257
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:55,090
wanted to for y I could just and that's

1258
00:50:52,929 --> 00:50:56,559
actually looks like that sorry I could

1259
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:58,180
solve that for y by just dividing this

1260
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,659
over to the other side right I just have

1261
00:50:58,179 --> 00:51:05,679
the D minus CB over a right and so I

1262
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:06,909
would just have my y equal to this term

1263
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:10,328
so I now know

1264
00:51:06,909 --> 00:51:13,149
what why actually is right but although

1265
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:15,460
I can read off the why from the tab from

1266
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:19,030
this tabular result right I can't

1267
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:22,119
actually read off what the X is because

1268
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:26,170
the equation on the top still has ax

1269
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:28,000
plus B y equals u right so it turns out

1270
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:30,460
we can eliminate this one further

1271
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,489
because now that we have a row that's 0

1272
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,929
and one value here right we can just do

1273
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:37,838
it the same thing we were doing before

1274
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:40,659
to knock out the value above it because

1275
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,940
now that it's got a 0 here we can use it

1276
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:46,629
to eliminate things without touching the

1277
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:50,139
other column right so if I now take B

1278
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:52,750
and I divide B by this value and

1279
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:57,909
subtract that I would finish eliminating

1280
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:59,679
right I would end up with a 0 because

1281
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:02,379
this is not going to get touched and if

1282
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:04,328
I just divide if I take B over this

1283
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,740
value and add it to be I end up with the

1284
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:08,318
exact same cancellation that we have

1285
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:14,019
here so I'd have a 0 right and I have D

1286
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:16,900
minus C B over a down here don't care

1287
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:19,989
about the unknowns for the moment and so

1288
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:23,048
then if I come out here and say ok do

1289
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:25,419
the same thing to it I have to do that

1290
00:52:23,048 --> 00:52:29,500
same multiplication so I have to take

1291
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:31,028
again B over D minus C B over a that was

1292
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:33,130
the the coefficient that we were using

1293
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:36,309
right negative that I have to take that

1294
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:38,079
and add it up here so I would end up

1295
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:42,640
with and it's a little bit ridiculous

1296
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:48,309
right but I would end up with u minus B

1297
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:52,480
over D minus C B over a write times V

1298
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:55,930
minus C u over a right that's what I

1299
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,608
would end up with and again this this

1300
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:59,739
term would be the same down here right

1301
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:01,440
so that's the solve right but don't

1302
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:04,269
forget I wanted to do the same thing up

1303
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,429
to this sort of phantom matrix so if we

1304
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:09,338
keep the phantom matrix going right we'd

1305
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:11,409
have 1 we'd have that negative C over a

1306
00:53:09,338 --> 00:53:12,670
although actually now I think about it

1307
00:53:11,409 --> 00:53:14,500
that would actually get multiplied up

1308
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:16,150
right that would actually come up so

1309
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,960
what we actually have here is a little

1310
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:21,740
more complicated right

1311
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:23,809
we have one and now here's our I'm a

1312
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:25,479
little further negative B I need I

1313
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:28,279
almost need oh you know what I need

1314
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:32,150
look at that that was awesome

1315
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,530
all right so I have to take this and I

1316
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:36,380
have to multiply it by that and add it

1317
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:39,140
up to the top row right so I would have

1318
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,570
this one I would have a plus because

1319
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:44,659
this is two negatives so these are

1320
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:51,470
actually gonna cancel out there I would

1321
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:55,819
have C over a times B over D minus C B

1322
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:58,189
over a right I would have negative C a

1323
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:01,580
still in the bottom right I would have

1324
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:04,280
still my one down there and then when I

1325
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:06,349
up in the top here I would have just

1326
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,760
this term times the one that I'd be I'd

1327
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:12,769
be subtracting up so I'd end up with my

1328
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:14,390
mega to be D minus C B over a right now

1329
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:16,130
the chances that I did all that without

1330
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:18,319
making a careless error somewhere are

1331
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,840
like zero percent right so there's a

1332
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,360
zero percent chance that that's correct

1333
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:25,070
but there's like a 100 percent chance

1334
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,840
that that was a reasonable approximation

1335
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,880
of how goths the elimination works

1336
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:32,180
mechanically meaning if you had not done

1337
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,250
it incorrectly right and then what you

1338
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:35,629
end up with is just a system of solved

1339
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,820
equations right you know that this

1340
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:40,130
equals this and you know that this I'm

1341
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:42,440
sorry I should say this times this

1342
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:46,250
equals this and you know that this times

1343
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:48,679
this equals that right so finally if you

1344
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:52,599
wanted to you could simplify the whole

1345
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:57,289
thing by just dividing the top by a and

1346
00:54:52,599 --> 00:55:00,079
dividing the bottom by D minus C B over

1347
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:02,360
a right because it's free for me to do

1348
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,279
so and in fact probably what I should

1349
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,050
have done again if I was smart if I was

1350
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,810
gasps because I'm sure Gauss would have

1351
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:10,550
done this but I'm not when you got down

1352
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:11,420
to here you'd do the divide first in

1353
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:14,060
fact that's how Gauss elimination

1354
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:15,230
normally works I over complicated things

1355
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:16,789
you could think of

1356
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:19,300
you could you could ignore this step if

1357
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:23,710
you wanted to and say oh okay right here

1358
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:26,030
divide you know this guy divide

1359
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:27,470
everything in this row by this and then

1360
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:28,850
it would just be a 1 in there and that

1361
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:32,619
that makes things a little simpler but

1362
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:34,880
the reason I didn't do it that way

1363
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:37,190
doing it this way is because we're

1364
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,780
working with equations not numbers when

1365
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:40,519
you're working with numbers it's free

1366
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:42,560
for you to do that divide there because

1367
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:43,699
the numbers just do it whereas it just

1368
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,369
gets even more complicated if you

1369
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:47,989
actually do the divide right so anyway

1370
00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:50,449
six of one half dozen of the other you

1371
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:52,939
can totally see how that Gauss

1372
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:56,239
elimination works out and what's kind of

1373
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:58,880
cool about it is if you keep the Fantom

1374
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:00,019
matrix on the other side now we didn't

1375
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,280
quite we haven't finished because we

1376
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:03,980
have to divide we have to divide by a

1377
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,900
math that divided by d cv but if we were

1378
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:08,119
to do that to these two rows this

1379
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:10,280
phantom matrix actually becomes the

1380
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:12,739
inverse which is kind of interesting and

1381
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:17,170
again I don't actually remember the

1382
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:21,829
motivation for why that's actually true

1383
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:23,990
I'm just not sure what the reason is why

1384
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:25,699
it's a neat trick you can do where you

1385
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:26,539
can actually solve for inverses while

1386
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:29,419
you do it

1387
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:31,400
by putting it there but point being so

1388
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,789
if you see how this sort of all works

1389
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,349
out

1390
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:38,360
that's the Gaussian elimination pattern

1391
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:40,789
that allows us to actually sort of do

1392
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,260
that solving on matrices when we want to

1393
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:44,630
do it now what we would probably want to

1394
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:47,330
do is actually do the divide out finish

1395
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:50,329
it here and just bake it down so that we

1396
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:54,889
can actually just not have to even worry

1397
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:56,840
about actually solving this ever right

1398
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:59,569
because we would we would just be

1399
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,130
wanting to produce inverse matrices but

1400
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:02,030
I kind of wanted to show you how it

1401
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:05,510
works through for Gauss elimination

1402
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:08,720
anyway don't ask me why I guess now that

1403
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:11,480
I think about it I suppose we probably

1404
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,949
don't really need to do solutions like

1405
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,539
this and I mean here oh I don't even

1406
00:57:12,949 --> 00:57:17,980
know I'm trying to think if we're ever

1407
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:17,980
actually going to have to do that

1408
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:23,889
yeah I don't know point being I got a

1409
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:25,119
little overexcited there but I wanted to

1410
00:57:23,889 --> 00:57:28,269
show you how that works and so that is

1411
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:29,859
how that works and you know that's a way

1412
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:31,329
that you can actually solve arbitrarily

1413
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,740
large matrices as well it's just it

1414
00:57:31,329 --> 00:57:34,599
turns out to not be particularly good

1415
00:57:32,739 --> 00:57:37,329
once you get up to very kind of like

1416
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:39,159
ill-conditioned very sizable matrices

1417
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:40,869
you usually have to switch to something

1418
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:43,269
that's not going to be exact because

1419
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:45,789
Gauss elimination is like an exact non

1420
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:47,289
iterative scheme and you typically end

1421
00:57:45,789 --> 00:57:49,389
up switching to something that is an

1422
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:51,550
iterative like a convergence based

1423
00:57:49,389 --> 00:57:53,170
scheme that kind of like converges on

1424
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:56,470
the right result rather than trying to

1425
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:58,180
solve for a result using what I just did

1426
00:57:56,469 --> 00:58:01,119
where you're kind of looking at it like

1427
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:02,859
you know solving for you're actually

1428
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:07,599
basically doing the mechanics of solving

1429
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:11,579
for an equation yourself right solving

1430
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:13,420
the actual terms separately so anyway

1431
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:15,130
unfortunately we're out of time because

1432
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:17,680
I just spent too much time down the math

1433
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:20,289
hole and we didn't quite get to what I

1434
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:24,039
wanted to get to which is this guy the

1435
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:25,750
inverse transpose basically I was trying

1436
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:27,429
to lead up to what the inverse is we'll

1437
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,989
sort of have to finish that up tomorrow

1438
00:58:27,429 --> 00:58:31,269
I guess and then we can talk about what

1439
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:32,769
this is I told you what the transpose

1440
00:58:31,269 --> 00:58:38,079
where is we're sort of trying to see

1441
00:58:32,769 --> 00:58:39,699
what the inverse is the inverse and now

1442
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,309
that we've sort of almost got it over

1443
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:44,019
here as well the inverse like I said is

1444
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:46,269
the thing where if you were to multiply

1445
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:47,590
a matrix by its own inverse it's the

1446
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:51,250
thing that gets you that identity back

1447
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:55,300
right and it's also if you think about

1448
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:57,789
it the thing that allows you to talk

1449
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:00,400
about solving equations that involved

1450
00:58:57,789 --> 00:59:03,730
whatever that thing was right and so if

1451
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,039
I had some kind of an unknowns thing

1452
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:08,320
like I was talking about ax equals B as

1453
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:10,329
a problem where normally the way we've

1454
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,059
been doing it is we've been focusing on

1455
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:15,279
we are given X we are given a and we're

1456
00:59:13,059 --> 00:59:17,650
producing B right and we've done this a

1457
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,940
bunch of times now right this is this is

1458
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:21,099
the thing that we've basically always

1459
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,679
been doing it's the it's the PX times

1460
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:26,319
the x axis py times the y axis thing

1461
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:28,059
that's basically this so we've been

1462
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,778
doing the forward thing we've been we've

1463
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:34,038
been basically doing ax produces be

1464
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:38,130
a bunch what we haven't been doing is

1465
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:40,979
given a b and an a how do you produce

1466
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:43,979
the x right and so what you could see

1467
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:46,379
from this equation is if you had a

1468
00:59:43,978 --> 00:59:47,938
inverse if you knew what a inverse was

1469
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,429
right which was what we were building up

1470
00:59:47,938 --> 00:59:51,658
to there you could multiply both sides

1471
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:55,499
because remember you can multiply both

1472
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:58,349
sides by the same thing you could

1473
00:59:55,498 --> 01:00:00,778
multiply both sides by that inverse and

1474
00:59:58,349 --> 01:00:03,329
you would solve the equation right

1475
01:00:00,778 --> 01:00:07,108
there's the equation in terms of x so

1476
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:08,849
the inverse of something times b is what

1477
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:10,949
gives you which x you would use to

1478
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:13,949
produce be under that transform so you

1479
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:16,469
can see this quite literally if you had

1480
01:00:13,949 --> 01:00:17,429
a situation where let's say in exactly

1481
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:19,798
the sort of thing that we were talking

1482
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:22,528
about before where we have an x-axis

1483
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:24,900
know how many times I'm gonna do that an

1484
01:00:22,528 --> 01:00:27,358
x-axis and a y-axis right we've got them

1485
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:29,219
and typically what we've been doing is

1486
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:32,608
you've been saying okay here's our

1487
01:00:29,219 --> 01:00:34,650
actual our coordinate system and we've

1488
01:00:32,608 --> 01:00:37,498
got some point that's relative to this

1489
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:39,838
axis system produced the point in this

1490
01:00:37,498 --> 01:00:41,908
outer axis system right and we've been

1491
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:44,009
doing that by essentially if this is a

1492
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:46,559
if this was transform a we've been

1493
01:00:44,009 --> 01:00:48,119
producing a P right we've been saying P

1494
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,819
prime equals ap that's what we've been

1495
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:53,039
doing right and we've been doing that

1496
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:55,438
you know we've been writing it out like

1497
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,789
PX times the x axis plus py times the y

1498
01:00:55,438 --> 01:00:58,108
axis but like I showed earlier in this

1499
01:00:56,789 --> 01:01:00,269
episode you can just write it that way

1500
01:00:58,108 --> 01:01:02,248
as well if you wanted to write well the

1501
01:01:00,268 --> 01:01:05,728
inverse thing solves the opposite

1502
01:01:02,248 --> 01:01:08,759
question if I was to say all right let's

1503
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:10,768
say that P was actually not described in

1504
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:14,458
this space at all it was described in

1505
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:19,828
this space right so it's P prime now

1506
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:22,828
it's this given this a tell me what is P

1507
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:24,869
inside a I want to map it back into the

1508
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:27,059
coordinate system that it was coming out

1509
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:31,108
of before right I want to do that that

1510
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:34,140
thing that is this salt right here right

1511
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:36,088
that is instead of ax produces B that is

1512
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:37,650
we have the a we have the B right this

1513
01:01:36,088 --> 01:01:39,838
is the P prime here and this is the P

1514
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:41,608
instead of being given the P and

1515
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,498
producing the P prime we want to go the

1516
01:01:41,608 --> 01:01:44,279
other direction and that's exactly what

1517
01:01:43,498 --> 01:01:46,349
that inverse allow

1518
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:49,200
to do we would allow it would allow us

1519
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:52,769
to multiply both sides and produce the

1520
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:54,239
vector that we actually want right so

1521
01:01:52,769 --> 01:01:56,639
we're not quite there yet unfortunately

1522
01:01:54,239 --> 01:02:00,089
we ran out of time largely because my

1523
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:02,940
Gaussian elimination is slow but I will

1524
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:04,650
will try to pick it up tomorrow and I'll

1525
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:07,139
pick up where we left off here about how

1526
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:10,860
you produce the inverse and then we can

1527
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:12,210
sort of see how we would how we would

1528
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,190
produce this and why we might care about

1529
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:16,139
a inverse transpose hopefully you can

1530
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:18,090
see why you would already care about a

1531
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:19,829
inverse up here but we have another

1532
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:21,600
thing to talk about which is when a

1533
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:22,860
inverse equals a transpose which is a

1534
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:28,289
separate thing as well but that's not

1535
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:31,230
the case here anyway all right that is

1536
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:32,730
the end of the math hole for today I'm

1537
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,990
sorry I sprung it on you I would have

1538
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:36,630
prepared people had I know and I was

1539
01:02:33,989 --> 01:02:40,649
going down the math well I didn't but it

1540
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:43,349
is time for Q and a it is time for Q and

1541
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:45,769
a if anyone liked to ask questions as

1542
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:48,480
long as that question is why are we not

1543
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:52,409
why are we in the math hole I can

1544
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:54,210
probably answer it this I like the fact

1545
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:59,779
that this thing has been in here the

1546
01:02:54,210 --> 01:03:02,780
whole time right it's been doing that

1547
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,780
multitasking

1548
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,879
for inverting two-by-two matrices a

1549
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:14,739
simple cofactor equation is quite

1550
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:17,030
efficient a simple cofactor equation

1551
01:03:14,739 --> 01:03:27,169
okay you have a link there but I can't

1552
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:28,640
really read the thing now mr. forts

1553
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:31,130
vendor sets all the steps in elimination

1554
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:32,900
can be represented as a matrix starting

1555
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:35,420
with M and multiplied by all those

1556
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,920
matrices you get the identity so those

1557
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,780
matrices multiplied together are the

1558
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:40,130
inverse multiplying them all about the

1559
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:42,500
identity gives you the inverse is that

1560
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:45,079
the trick you are alluding to yeah you

1561
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:46,940
know what I think that was it's been so

1562
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:50,900
long since I've done any linear algebra

1563
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:52,460
I mean like crazy long it's easy for me

1564
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,800
to forget but I think you might be right

1565
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,909
about that I think that's the that is

1566
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,210
exactly how you do it

1567
01:03:55,909 --> 01:04:01,699
so if you think about what I was doing

1568
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:03,019
here right let's take this very first

1569
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:03,949
step and thank you mister fourth

1570
01:04:03,019 --> 01:04:05,269
dimension for saying that because I

1571
01:04:03,949 --> 01:04:06,409
believe that is exactly what I would

1572
01:04:05,269 --> 01:04:09,500
have had to go look up and now I don't

1573
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:11,659
have to look at it so the trick here

1574
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:15,650
right is if you imagine having this this

1575
01:04:11,659 --> 01:04:18,079
guy right so I start with this this dude

1576
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:20,180
right here and I wanted to do this

1577
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,449
operation on it right I wanted to do

1578
01:04:20,179 --> 01:04:25,309
this operation where I did negative CA

1579
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:28,339
times the top row and added it to the

1580
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:30,710
bottom row well actually I could do that

1581
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:34,039
just I could create a matrix that

1582
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:38,139
actually did exactly that right and the

1583
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:38,139
matrix that did that does exactly that

1584
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:43,519
the matrix that does exactly that is

1585
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:47,440
just the one that produces this result

1586
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:51,349
right so if I take the that a B right

1587
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:55,130
I'm gonna do it this way right if I take

1588
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:56,839
that a B I need whatever the result is

1589
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:58,430
here to still produce a and there's only

1590
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,500
one way to do that right which would be

1591
01:04:58,429 --> 01:05:02,809
1 0 right that would still produce a

1592
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:06,050
here which is what I need right and in

1593
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:12,529
terms of what would produce B in this

1594
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:14,600
slot I would need wait how does this

1595
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:17,180
work again what am I missing here did I

1596
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:17,940
do that right 1 0 because this has to be

1597
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:25,489
the negative

1598
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:28,619
see a version wait a minute

1599
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:31,409
because this needs to be a this still

1600
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:37,068
needs to be B this needs to produce zero

1601
01:05:31,409 --> 01:05:41,670
and this needs to produce D - C B over a

1602
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:50,550
or rather negative C a times B so that

1603
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:53,700
negative C a has to has to yeah I guess

1604
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:54,900
we'd have to come in I'm not sure you

1605
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:56,608
know what I'm gonna hold off on that

1606
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,139
it's been too long so I've done this I'm

1607
01:05:56,608 --> 01:05:59,940
I'm just totally doing this wrong

1608
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:02,670
because I'm trying to think of how you

1609
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:07,050
actually do the matrix that produces

1610
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:08,460
that elimination and it seems like you

1611
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:10,740
would still have to end up in order to

1612
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:15,420
produce a B on that row you still have

1613
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:19,108
to produce you'd still have to produce a

1614
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:20,309
0 a 1 0 at the top which doesn't seem

1615
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:24,358
right to me

1616
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:27,989
because once you do this guy right you

1617
01:06:24,358 --> 01:06:35,130
need to you need to reduce a different

1618
01:06:27,989 --> 01:06:39,838
vector here right yeah I'm not I'm not

1619
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:41,068
sure I remember how to do that let's

1620
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:44,068
think about it for a second let's not

1621
01:06:41,068 --> 01:06:48,269
give up quite so easily because yeah

1622
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:50,639
you're suppose that do the permutations

1623
01:06:48,269 --> 01:06:54,809
on this matrix that eliminated

1624
01:06:50,639 --> 01:07:00,539
eventually but I don't remember what

1625
01:06:54,809 --> 01:07:03,299
exactly they are because it seems tricky

1626
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:08,369
to produce this so if I just wanted to

1627
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:10,650
add negative C a right time if I just

1628
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:15,059
wanted to add negative C a to this row

1629
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:16,500
right I would have to produce I guess

1630
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:23,699
you could almost imagine as producing

1631
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:30,929
negative C here right and so this

1632
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:33,029
no I don't know how I would do that I do

1633
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:40,799
not know how I would do that in a way

1634
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:42,240
that still produces the a there yeah

1635
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,300
that's too much for my math brain right

1636
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:44,299
now

1637
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:52,170
robot chocolate dyno to find the inverse

1638
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,150
matrix couldn't we just rotate by the

1639
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:55,619
negative angle and scale by one over the

1640
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:58,139
amount that we scaled by originally yes

1641
01:07:55,619 --> 01:08:00,300
that is how you could construct the

1642
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:02,098
inverse matrix and oftentimes you will

1643
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,539
do that in graphics because it's easier

1644
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:06,630
than inverting the matrix potentially

1645
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:07,769
depending on the circumstances but I

1646
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:09,599
wanted to talk about it a little more

1647
01:08:07,769 --> 01:08:12,480
generally because you don't always know

1648
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,700
where your matrix came from right that's

1649
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,838
only if you happen to know and so to be

1650
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:19,460
more explicit about what happens there

1651
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:23,039
right if you know that your matrix right

1652
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:25,109
happens to be a scale times a rotation

1653
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:28,229
and you know what that scale and that

1654
01:08:25,109 --> 01:08:31,109
rotation was right then instead of

1655
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:33,419
computing a inverse right you can

1656
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:36,750
instead just go oh well if I wanted to

1657
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:40,980
compute a inverse I could instead just

1658
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:42,270
take the inverse of SR right and this is

1659
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:45,659
a little more than I probably wanted to

1660
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:47,969
get into but basically that's the same

1661
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:50,639
as this and if you look at what these

1662
01:08:47,969 --> 01:08:53,789
guys are right the inverse rotation and

1663
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,350
the inverse scale matrices are exactly

1664
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:57,750
what you just said if I have a scale

1665
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:59,430
matrix it looks like this right it's got

1666
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:00,779
an X scale and a Y scale and nothing

1667
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:04,020
else in it it's a diagonal matrix that

1668
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:08,180
looks like that right and hey lo and

1669
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:10,469
behold what would produce right

1670
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:13,140
what would produce the identity so if

1671
01:09:10,469 --> 01:09:16,619
this is my s what's my S inverse right

1672
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:18,838
well no surprise there right it's 1 over

1673
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:21,659
X because 1 over x times x equals 1

1674
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:23,338
right and 1 over Y with zeros on the

1675
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:25,588
thing that would produce the identity

1676
01:09:23,338 --> 01:09:27,180
right so that's exactly what you were

1677
01:09:25,588 --> 01:09:30,329
just suggesting of doing is that right

1678
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:32,400
there and the R inverse is whatever

1679
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:35,789
would rotate you back to where you were

1680
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:37,259
it's a little bit harder to show why

1681
01:09:35,789 --> 01:09:39,449
that works compared

1682
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:43,680
with this one but if you think about it

1683
01:09:39,449 --> 01:09:46,019
hmm it's actually not it's actually not

1684
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,369
too difficult we might be able to kind

1685
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:49,440
of show show how that works here so

1686
01:09:47,369 --> 01:09:50,909
let's say we have that rotation and like

1687
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:53,309
I said that was that's just those

1688
01:09:50,909 --> 01:09:55,889
rotation matrices like I said before are

1689
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:58,650
just putting in those the x axis and the

1690
01:09:55,890 --> 01:10:03,539
y axis right so if I have the x axis and

1691
01:09:58,649 --> 01:10:06,659
the y axis I have xx and XY and YX + YY

1692
01:10:03,539 --> 01:10:10,079
if I have that in my rotation matrix and

1693
01:10:06,659 --> 01:10:11,819
I want to know you know what times that

1694
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:14,880
is going to equal 2

1695
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:17,519
oops it's going to be equal to the

1696
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:21,029
identity then I'm what I'm looking for

1697
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:24,480
right is I'm looking for a vector here

1698
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:30,840
that when dotted with these two things

1699
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:33,929
when dotted with when dotted with X X X

1700
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:38,610
Y X and went on up with X y YY produces

1701
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:42,150
1 and 0 right and so what you can kind

1702
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:46,319
of see here if you take a look at what's

1703
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:50,189
happening right is you're trying to

1704
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:52,590
produce a vector here which is

1705
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:55,529
essentially the same as the vector here

1706
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:58,590
right because we know that if we take if

1707
01:10:55,529 --> 01:11:00,059
I have two vectors we know that all of

1708
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:03,110
these are unit length if it's just a

1709
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:05,670
rotation right then we know that the the

1710
01:11:03,109 --> 01:11:08,429
x-axis length is 1 and the y axis length

1711
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:11,039
is 1 right so what we know is that if we

1712
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:13,170
were to dot the x axis with itself we

1713
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:15,238
would get 1 and if we were dot the y

1714
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:17,369
axis with itself we'd also get 1 right

1715
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:19,979
we also know they're perpendicular so if

1716
01:11:17,369 --> 01:11:22,979
we were to dot the y axis with the x

1717
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:24,988
axis we would get 0 right similarly it's

1718
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:28,019
symmetric right so you know that the dot

1719
01:11:24,988 --> 01:11:31,289
product is is a is commutative that way

1720
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:35,190
so we get that right so what we're

1721
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:37,738
asking for here is okay what would the

1722
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:39,839
thing that would that would would

1723
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:43,738
multiply with these guys and produce a 1

1724
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:46,469
right well we sort of know that if we

1725
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:49,709
just were to take this guy we basically

1726
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:51,210
know if we were to take this guy and and

1727
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:52,829
dot him with himself we would get

1728
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:55,739
one right and if we were to take this

1729
01:11:52,829 --> 01:11:57,840
guy and dot him with the other vector we

1730
01:11:55,738 --> 01:12:00,738
would get a zero right so it turns out

1731
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:04,170
that when you actually produce the the

1732
01:12:00,738 --> 01:12:07,949
the inverse for our you literally get

1733
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:10,289
exactly what its transpose was right so

1734
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:14,789
you can actually see here like if I

1735
01:12:10,289 --> 01:12:16,859
finish it out XY y Y you can actually

1736
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:18,539
see that all this is is it's the same

1737
01:12:16,859 --> 01:12:21,599
matrix but with these two guys flipped

1738
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:23,640
and then when you do that math out you

1739
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,579
know you get x squared you get x squared

1740
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:29,910
plus y squared you get x x squared plus

1741
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:32,430
y x squared which equals 1 and you get X

1742
01:12:29,909 --> 01:12:36,210
Y squared plus y y squared which also

1743
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:39,420
equals one there right and the other two

1744
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:40,980
were zero and again the only reason that

1745
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:42,810
that's true is because all of these

1746
01:12:40,979 --> 01:12:45,619
things were also true so we know those

1747
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:48,719
relationships between the scalars but

1748
01:12:45,619 --> 01:12:50,670
yeah we should really go into that in

1749
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,840
more detail if you really wanted to be a

1750
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:55,500
little more explicit about it because

1751
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,180
it's hard to see why changing it's kind

1752
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:01,289
of hard to see why that actually works

1753
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:02,219
out the way that it does but try to

1754
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:06,149
think if there's another way I could

1755
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:10,140
sort of show you what was happening

1756
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:12,509
there because this vector is not the x

1757
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:15,360
axis right this is like half the x axis

1758
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:19,219
half the y axis right if you think about

1759
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:25,199
it it's the X components of both of them

1760
01:13:19,219 --> 01:13:27,180
so it's just a little bit it's it's a

1761
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,920
it's a it's a little bit confusing as to

1762
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:34,110
why that that works out the way that it

1763
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:36,840
does right so yeah but we can go into

1764
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:39,238
that in a little more detail maybe we

1765
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:41,039
should do a section on like rotation

1766
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:43,439
matrices and why they work that way but

1767
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:46,140
that's how that are in inverse works and

1768
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:49,229
that is just the opposite rotation right

1769
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:50,250
so in 2d you can almost I mean one way

1770
01:13:49,229 --> 01:13:52,829
to think about this is to remember the

1771
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:54,869
perp operator right where we did the

1772
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:56,399
serve of perpendiculars one way to think

1773
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:58,800
about it is that sort of what's going on

1774
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:01,859
here right remember what the perp was so

1775
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,520
if I have an a vector X Y and and that

1776
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:05,409
represents some something

1777
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,840
right so this is this is my vector right

1778
01:14:05,409 --> 01:14:09,699
here's my vector XY if I want to produce

1779
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,369
the perp to that right what we did is we

1780
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:14,920
did negative Y over an X right we

1781
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:18,489
swapped the order that they were in

1782
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:24,310
right and so you can kind of think of

1783
01:14:18,489 --> 01:14:27,300
the same sort of thing as as yeah this

1784
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:27,300
is not very good explanation either

1785
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:31,239
let's hold off on this I'll think about

1786
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:34,390
this a little bit to think about how I

1787
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:39,909
could more easily explain why this works

1788
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:41,079
out for transposing right because I want

1789
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,460
to be able to show that a little bit

1790
01:14:41,079 --> 01:14:44,739
better than I showed it I don't think I

1791
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:49,090
did a very good job there and so if you

1792
01:14:44,739 --> 01:14:52,479
have you know and an x-axis and a y-axis

1793
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:56,860
and the columns and then you go ahead

1794
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:59,259
and and want to produce that that

1795
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:02,889
identity matrix from that and you end up

1796
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:05,860
with the x-axis like in the right in the

1797
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:07,960
rows like that it's just kind of a

1798
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:10,599
little confusing to show it so I guess

1799
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,909
you know what so alright so this is a

1800
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,890
little cheesy but here's one way I could

1801
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:19,840
show it by doing it the opposite order

1802
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:21,730
right so let's suppose I have X which is

1803
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:25,360
our x-axis that we're using and I have Y

1804
01:15:21,729 --> 01:15:27,159
which is our y-axis right so let's

1805
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:30,099
suppose I just drew it the other way

1806
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:32,349
here's our rotation matrix right and we

1807
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:34,570
have the x-axis as a column and we have

1808
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:36,730
the y-axis as a column here this is a

1809
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:38,500
much easier way to show it so I

1810
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:40,659
apologize for not having an easy way to

1811
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:43,270
show it the other way but I just it's a

1812
01:15:40,659 --> 01:15:45,819
little bit more confusing right so if I

1813
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:48,430
want to construct the inverse here I've

1814
01:15:45,819 --> 01:15:50,529
got one yeah this is much easier if I if

1815
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:52,119
I if I put the inverse on the left side

1816
01:15:50,529 --> 01:15:53,229
even though they're equivalent putting

1817
01:15:52,119 --> 01:15:55,989
them there makes it much easier to show

1818
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:58,539
this right so what did I say

1819
01:15:55,989 --> 01:16:00,880
I said x transpose x equals 1 I said X

1820
01:15:58,539 --> 01:16:03,850
transpose y equals 0 I said Y transpose

1821
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:06,220
y equals 1 right why is that true well

1822
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:08,440
it's true because any unit vector dotted

1823
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:10,030
with itself is 1 and any unit vector

1824
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:11,769
dotted with a perpendicular is 0 we

1825
01:16:10,029 --> 01:16:13,149
covered that a you know in previous

1826
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:17,380
episode so we know that those are true

1827
01:16:13,149 --> 01:16:19,420
right so we want the x axis

1828
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:21,940
dotted with something to produce one

1829
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:24,190
well obviously that the x-axis dotted

1830
01:16:21,939 --> 01:16:26,019
with its own self is one and if I did

1831
01:16:24,189 --> 01:16:28,178
the x-axis dotted with the y-axis I'd

1832
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,949
get zero right that's just what I wrote

1833
01:16:28,179 --> 01:16:32,230
over here exactly right that's what I'd

1834
01:16:29,948 --> 01:16:33,789
get and similarly putting the y-axis in

1835
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:36,218
here does the exact same thing x-axis

1836
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:38,469
dotted with the Y is zero y-axis dotted

1837
01:16:36,219 --> 01:16:39,789
with the Y is one right so you put them

1838
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:41,439
in this order you can see really clearly

1839
01:16:39,789 --> 01:16:43,329
when you do the dot products why they

1840
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:45,039
come out to be the things they are doing

1841
01:16:43,329 --> 01:16:47,800
it the other order is harder to see

1842
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:49,479
because you're you're in the column

1843
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,880
picture of the matrix which is just

1844
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:53,559
harder to you have to then write it

1845
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,659
broken out and we could add it up the

1846
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,760
column way so I think the way I'd have

1847
01:16:55,658 --> 01:16:59,619
to do that was remember up here where I

1848
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,929
sort of broke things out in that other

1849
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:03,760
way I was like here's the other way

1850
01:17:01,929 --> 01:17:04,989
here's here's the other way we wrote it

1851
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,550
I think you'd have to actually do it

1852
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:09,009
that way and then you could see why it

1853
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:10,300
would work but that's it's much easier

1854
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:12,190
to show the dot product Christian cuz

1855
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,119
that was just as you saw from when I

1856
01:17:12,189 --> 01:17:14,649
just did that it's a really

1857
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:17,250
straightforward thing you can just read

1858
01:17:14,649 --> 01:17:17,250
it directly out

1859
01:17:28,448 --> 01:17:36,438
let's see Holly Holly I remember doing

1860
01:17:35,059 --> 01:17:37,489
this by putting the identity besides the

1861
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:39,949
original matrix in before and I need

1862
01:17:37,488 --> 01:17:41,029
step 2 performing each step to each yeah

1863
01:17:39,948 --> 01:17:42,799
that's what I did

1864
01:17:41,029 --> 01:17:46,188
and you that actually does produce if I

1865
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,510
don't remember why I don't remember the

1866
01:17:46,189 --> 01:17:57,320
explanation as to why that actually

1867
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:59,269
works right oh wait duh I know why yeah

1868
01:17:57,319 --> 01:18:00,828
it's just been a long time I'm sorry I'm

1869
01:17:59,269 --> 01:18:04,878
really rusty on my leg Roger bruh I

1870
01:18:00,828 --> 01:18:09,590
totally know why it's very simple if I

1871
01:18:04,878 --> 01:18:17,569
have a right as a matrix let's say I did

1872
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:18,828
AI equals AG right so I already said

1873
01:18:17,569 --> 01:18:20,628
that I is the multiplicative identity

1874
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:25,099
right this is the multiplicative

1875
01:18:20,628 --> 01:18:27,498
identity so I know that a time's the

1876
01:18:25,099 --> 01:18:30,378
identity matrix equals a right so I just

1877
01:18:27,498 --> 01:18:32,800
have ABCD there's my a matrix I have one

1878
01:18:30,378 --> 01:18:34,878
zero zero one and I have that equals

1879
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,550
ABCD I don't know why I couldn't think

1880
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:39,469
of this it was like yeah just been too

1881
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:41,208
long one of the nice things about the

1882
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:43,519
stream is I like have to remember all my

1883
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:45,878
math which is good I mean it's good to

1884
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:48,439
keep it active in the brain right so

1885
01:18:45,878 --> 01:18:50,238
this times this equals this we know

1886
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:51,889
that's true we already said that that's

1887
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:54,678
exactly what that is so a times the

1888
01:18:51,889 --> 01:18:57,288
identity equals a so then you just do

1889
01:18:54,679 --> 01:18:58,158
the elimination here right you do the

1890
01:18:57,288 --> 01:19:00,498
Gaussian elimination

1891
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:01,998
until this equals the identity right

1892
01:19:00,498 --> 01:19:04,698
like I was doing above you knock out the

1893
01:19:01,998 --> 01:19:07,010
terms and you divide once you are done

1894
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:12,678
with that you will end up with the

1895
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:14,869
identity right some matrix here right

1896
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:16,340
equals the identity on the other side

1897
01:19:14,868 --> 01:19:17,929
right because if you if you eliminated

1898
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:19,578
the terms here and this is the same

1899
01:19:17,929 --> 01:19:20,929
thing you would eliminate the terms here

1900
01:19:19,578 --> 01:19:25,458
what is this

1901
01:19:20,929 --> 01:19:28,939
right what is that that matrix that you

1902
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:35,828
would end up with sort of in the middle

1903
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:35,829
right oh wait no that doesn't quite work

1904
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:43,000
because you'll end up with the matrix

1905
01:19:40,569 --> 01:19:47,349
here but why would it still do the

1906
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:54,670
inversion all right never mind I'm still

1907
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:56,440
I'm still not sure about it because then

1908
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:57,460
you don't quite end up with the right

1909
01:19:56,439 --> 01:19:58,689
thing right

1910
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:00,899
you don't quite end up with the right

1911
01:19:58,689 --> 01:20:05,799
thing because you'll end up with AI

1912
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:09,250
something equals AI if you do it all to

1913
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:12,639
both sides which in theory means

1914
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:15,359
shouldn't this have to also be AI that's

1915
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,359
a little confusing

1916
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:29,860
this is confusing you know what I'm

1917
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:32,420
gonna say math is hard let's go shopping

1918
01:20:29,859 --> 01:20:33,710
I'm gonna have to study up I'm basically

1919
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,239
have to study up a why because now that

1920
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:39,319
I think about it yeah so this is just

1921
01:20:35,238 --> 01:20:41,539
this is just hard because I feel like

1922
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:43,250
you should be able to do the elimination

1923
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:44,689
with an identity matrix and then the

1924
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:46,579
identity matrix comes out to be the

1925
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:49,729
inverse which would leave you with a a

1926
01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:52,189
inverse equals I right you should end up

1927
01:20:49,729 --> 01:20:57,919
being able to do some elimination that

1928
01:20:52,189 --> 01:21:02,059
way where you do where you where you end

1929
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:05,230
up with swapping the two darn it I

1930
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:05,230
thought I had it don't have it

1931
01:21:24,269 --> 01:21:32,159
if you had a matrix such as int 2 2 with

1932
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:34,799
the example of ABCD as the variables in

1933
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:42,569
place couldn't you just swap a and D and

1934
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:44,940
make C and B negative you mean making

1935
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:48,509
the inverse well you can verify whether

1936
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:51,719
you can or not pretty easily right so

1937
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:56,039
what you just said was I'll pop me down

1938
01:21:51,719 --> 01:22:01,618
swap a and D so there's swapped a and D

1939
01:21:56,038 --> 01:22:01,979
and make C and B negative so there you

1940
01:22:01,618 --> 01:22:04,139
go

1941
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:07,558
so what happens if you multiply this out

1942
01:22:04,139 --> 01:22:12,239
well if I do the dot product I would get

1943
01:22:07,559 --> 01:22:13,829
ad minus CB so you can already see it's

1944
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:18,888
not the identity right because this

1945
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:18,889
should be equal to 1 and it's not right

1946
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:36,079
me blow I understood none of today's

1947
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:38,029
episode would you recommend that i

1948
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:40,789
rewatch it or do you think all may

1949
01:22:38,029 --> 01:22:43,909
become clear tomorrow I don't know it's

1950
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:47,479
fairly complicated stuff so I would say

1951
01:22:43,909 --> 01:22:50,630
watch tomorrow's episode and then

1952
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:52,939
possibly rewatched today's I will try to

1953
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:54,350
go find where the trick is for this just

1954
01:22:52,939 --> 01:22:56,299
so we can finish that up and then we'll

1955
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:58,900
go implement something that actually

1956
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,900
does the inverse

1957
01:23:31,609 --> 01:23:35,839
so naysayer 88 says here is the

1958
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:38,000
explanation for computing the inverse if

1959
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:43,880
you write a and then I next to each

1960
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:45,529
other okay and then apply which is what

1961
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:48,319
I was sort of doing or trying to do

1962
01:23:45,529 --> 01:23:50,719
there but okay if you write 89 next to

1963
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:54,019
each other and apply a bunch of

1964
01:23:50,720 --> 01:24:00,050
operations you're computing t3 t2 t1 a

1965
01:23:54,020 --> 01:24:11,330
and t3 t2 t1 I because you ended up at

1966
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:17,060
the identity t3 t2 t1 a equals I so t3

1967
01:24:11,329 --> 01:24:28,970
t2 t1 equals a inverse therefore T so

1968
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:30,500
that's hmm so that's interesting I guess

1969
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:32,119
I'm not I feel like there should be an

1970
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,699
equation there but maybe there isn't

1971
01:24:32,119 --> 01:24:37,069
so what John that was John below saying

1972
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:40,250
that what he was saying is well don't

1973
01:24:37,069 --> 01:24:41,449
worry about the fact that that this what

1974
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,739
you're about to do here don't worry

1975
01:24:41,449 --> 01:24:45,109
about the fact that you can't do it as

1976
01:24:42,739 --> 01:24:48,469
an equation just write a and I next to

1977
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:51,429
each other anyway and he said when you

1978
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:55,159
apply a bunch of things to both of them

1979
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:57,350
so if I have a and I have I when I apply

1980
01:24:55,159 --> 01:25:01,099
a bunch of things to both of them right

1981
01:24:57,350 --> 01:25:04,070
then whatever the thing is the steps are

1982
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:07,940
he was calling them t1 t2 t3 whatever

1983
01:25:04,069 --> 01:25:08,809
the steps are that reduce a and this

1984
01:25:07,939 --> 01:25:11,539
actually makes some sense

1985
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:14,150
whatever the steps are that reduce a to

1986
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:15,289
the identity right because we if we do

1987
01:25:14,149 --> 01:25:18,229
all these steps and we make a the

1988
01:25:15,289 --> 01:25:20,510
identity right then obviously they must

1989
01:25:18,229 --> 01:25:22,609
have been equal to a inverse because

1990
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:24,710
they produce the identity right so

1991
01:25:22,609 --> 01:25:27,019
whatever this is times this if we ended

1992
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:29,510
up with the identity right then this

1993
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:31,970
must have been a inverse so if I applied

1994
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:35,180
the same steps to the identity I would

1995
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:36,890
just get the inverse right because there

1996
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:41,300
is no anything else there would just be

1997
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:43,340
t1 t2 t3 so that's why that trick works

1998
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:45,230
right that's why you can Gaussian

1999
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:49,699
eliminate this neck

2000
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:51,379
- this right that's why you can do the

2001
01:25:49,699 --> 01:25:54,250
Gosselin Easter steps as long as you the

2002
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:57,890
same steps to this you end up with

2003
01:25:54,250 --> 01:26:00,800
basically the matrix you end up with the

2004
01:25:57,890 --> 01:26:03,079
identity matrix turning into the inverse

2005
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:07,010
when this turns into the identity right

2006
01:26:03,079 --> 01:26:11,809
so when this becomes I when when a

2007
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:13,159
becomes I I becomes a inverse and that's

2008
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:14,600
a pretty good way to explain it right

2009
01:26:13,159 --> 01:26:16,909
whatever the steps are that you applied

2010
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:20,000
to a they must have been the inverse if

2011
01:26:16,909 --> 01:26:23,809
they drove a to the identity and so you

2012
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,250
know if you wanted to if you wanted to

2013
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:27,110
apply those to an identity matrix you

2014
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:29,149
would end up with just the inverse so

2015
01:26:27,109 --> 01:26:31,609
that's a pretty good that's a pretty

2016
01:26:29,149 --> 01:26:33,819
good way of thinking about it thank you

2017
01:26:31,609 --> 01:26:33,819
John

2018
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:57,439
so I guess we're done actually with the

2019
01:26:53,239 --> 01:26:59,769
trick we can't actually go back here

2020
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:06,049
this is crazy how much math look at this

2021
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:09,440
look at that this was all where did we

2022
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:10,489
start where did we start on today it's

2023
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:12,769
crazy right

2024
01:27:10,489 --> 01:27:14,569
it was like here or something that's

2025
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:19,700
awesome I love zooming out on the

2026
01:27:14,569 --> 01:27:21,109
blackboard that's great so yeah okay so

2027
01:27:19,699 --> 01:27:22,579
we didn't quite get there

2028
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:24,589
but we almost got there and thanks to

2029
01:27:22,579 --> 01:27:26,000
John we also have an explanation of why

2030
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:28,909
the thing I was showing there would have

2031
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,779
worked or should work right which we did

2032
01:27:28,909 --> 01:27:32,180
not have before

2033
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:35,689
all right so we'll have to do is we'll

2034
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:37,780
have to postpone for day 102 we'll have

2035
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:42,789
to do we'll just leave it right here

2036
01:27:37,779 --> 01:27:52,569
we'll have to do inverse transpose oops

2037
01:27:42,789 --> 01:27:52,569
inverse transpose a inverse transpose

2038
01:27:54,199 --> 01:27:57,109
because we still have to talk about that

2039
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:58,759
now that we sort of know what this is

2040
01:27:57,109 --> 01:28:01,399
although I should all try to do a little

2041
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:04,310
bit better job quickly explaining a

2042
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:06,859
little bit more of that mm-hmm since we

2043
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:08,420
got a little bit bogged down today

2044
01:28:06,859 --> 01:28:10,759
I'll do try to do a little bit more

2045
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:12,260
concise job of talking about a inverse

2046
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:17,140
we already know what the transpose is

2047
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:23,920
and then we can talk about why normals

2048
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:30,020
are transformed by a inverse transpose

2049
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:34,819
not a and I sort of drew out why that

2050
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:38,260
was on the previous one okay I will go

2051
01:28:34,819 --> 01:28:45,199
ahead and save the mischeif blackboard

2052
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:46,100
close that down and this okay thank you

2053
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:47,539
everyone for joining me for another

2054
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:49,579
episode of hand made here it's been a

2055
01:28:47,539 --> 01:28:51,170
pleasure today going down the math hole

2056
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:55,519
with you it's always good to have other

2057
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:56,420
people in the math hole as always if you

2058
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,800
would like to follow along at home you

2059
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:59,630
can pre-order the game on hand me here

2060
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,590
org it comes to the source code so if

2061
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:02,690
you want to play around with a source

2062
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:03,890
code that's a good way to do that you

2063
01:29:02,689 --> 01:29:05,299
can also subscribe to the patriarchy you

2064
01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:07,130
want support the video series we've got

2065
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:09,500
one up there we also have forums that

2066
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:11,329
you can ask questions and get ports to

2067
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,529
Linux and Mac of the code base so that

2068
01:29:11,329 --> 01:29:13,850
you don't have to do that yourself you

2069
01:29:12,529 --> 01:29:18,079
want to follow along on other platforms

2070
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:19,130
and similarly it's got an tight episode

2071
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:21,289
guide up there if you want to catch up

2072
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:22,760
with previous episodes we also have a

2073
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:24,890
tweet bop a tweet the schedule so if you

2074
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:26,869
want to catch up with the episodes as

2075
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:28,340
they are aired you can always use the

2076
01:29:26,869 --> 01:29:30,019
Tweetbot to kind of figure out when

2077
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:31,010
those are happening so how do I

2078
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:33,620
recommend checking that off you're tryna

2079
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:36,980
catch the series live that is about it

2080
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:39,529
for today I will be back here again at 5

2081
01:29:36,979 --> 01:29:41,659
p.m. tomorrow if you would like to see

2082
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:43,489
the conclusion of how to do our normal

2083
01:29:41,659 --> 01:29:46,159
transform so that our normal Maps will

2084
01:29:43,489 --> 01:29:47,420
work properly you can go ahead and come

2085
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,939
back tomorrow 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard

2086
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:51,949
time same place or on Twitch and we will

2087
01:29:49,939 --> 01:29:55,779
do that hope see everyone tomorrow and

2088
01:29:51,949 --> 01:29:55,779
thanks for tuning in take me as everyone
