00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:05,789
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,429
hero the show recode a complete game

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,839
live on stream you know what I forgot

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,580
someone asked a question or the pre

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,919
stream and i forgot to close down the

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,649
windows so I apologize for that uh we

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,570
are finishing up some code changes that

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,579
we made we did the work yesterday

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,969
actually of finishing the concept of

10
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:26,879
brain code which is like essentially a

11
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:30,868
sort of self-organizing controllers for

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,909
our entities and we just need to kind of

13
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:35,729
finish porting some old code into that

14
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:38,039
structure and then we kind of need to

15
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,449
play with it some more and see if it

16
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,429
really does what we want because you

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,260
know we have one use case which is the

18
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,000
hero and we need to kind of build some

19
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,899
more use cases to see if it holds up

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,119
because you know we just we just don't

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,399
really know we're in that stage where

22
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,359
we're trying to sort of make sure we've

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,120
got a solid entity system so we're kind

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,859
of doing passes over it to sort of get

25
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,659
it into a state where we believe that

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,040
most of the things that we want to do

27
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:11,158
are well accounted for so yeah today is

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,618
day 2 89 if you are interested in flying

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,880
along at home unpacked a 288 source code

30
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:16,469
into a directory and that's what I'm

31
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,750
starting with now I'm going to go ahead

32
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:24,930
and load up our handmade project

33
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:29,310
handmade project I don't know what that

34
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,790
was supposed to be um let me see here

35
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,790
there we go

36
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,400
share adjustment as well so all right

37
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,170
here is our handmade project and we got

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,480
our brains actually working which is

39
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,849
kind of cool so we know that everything

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,280
was correct what we didn't do is finish

41
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:50,289
porting the hop controller but for

42
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,120
example the facing direction and stuff

43
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,800
like that is set properly now by the

44
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,750
brain and it sets it for both things

45
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,219
which is kind of cool and so now we

46
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,450
can't have to do is go through there and

47
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:01,659
now that we know that the structure of

48
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,950
the brain is as it is we need to start

49
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,599
cleaning out that code so that

50
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,890
everything else flows naturally from it

51
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:07,059
and the stuff that should be in the

52
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,289
brain is in the brain and the stuff that

53
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,789
shouldn't be in the brain is not on the

54
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:15,699
brain right which is kind of a good rule

55
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:21,939
of thumb for regular brains one might

56
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:32,919
argue so anyway let's take a look at

57
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:43,659
handmade world mode dot CPP ok so in

58
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:47,699
handmade world mode CPP we have we have

59
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:51,069
essentially three parts to this code and

60
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:53,259
we probably you know it stands to reason

61
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:57,939
that we might want to make these a

62
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:59,739
little more isolated as well so for

63
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:01,539
example we could pull out all the brains

64
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:04,120
into their own file so they're easier

65
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:06,219
for us to know where brains are and

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,840
similarly we could pull out you know

67
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,219
rendering or whatever that's our stuff

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,039
so we may want to start kind of pulling

69
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:15,639
these out so it's a little easier to see

70
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,750
and like a lot of people ask me we get

71
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,279
this question over and over how do I

72
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,049
decide when to make new files it's

73
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,180
literally just when I for visibility

74
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:24,610
like when I want to see two things at

75
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,079
once that kind of indicates to me that I

76
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,459
want them in separate files purely an

77
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,900
artifact of the way everything has to

78
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,539
happen has nothing to do with the

79
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,150
architecture of the game at all and

80
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:36,548
really just isn't very important but

81
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,709
that's you know it's it's entirely

82
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,019
personal preference and and you

83
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:44,109
shouldn't feel pressured to split files

84
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:45,759
in any particular way I would be very

85
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,780
suspicious of somebody who told you that

86
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,068
there is a right way in

87
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,860
wrong way to divide up your code into

88
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:53,318
files because that just kind of isn't

89
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:58,390
true so anyway I'm going to go ahead and

90
00:03:53,318 --> 00:04:01,919
make a new file here let's see I'm going

91
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:05,318
to make a new file for handmade brain

92
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:08,530
brains brain or brains brains brains

93
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,669
let's call it brain so I'm going to make

94
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,169
those and then I'm going to go ahead and

95
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:19,959
and open those up so oops code and made

96
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:23,409
brain alright and let me go ahead and

97
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,090
stick the little header in here case

98
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:31,080
people are using source code control and

99
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:31,079
want it labeled which I often do so okay

100
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:44,949
we go ok so now I've got my two brain

101
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,389
files and what I need to do now is I

102
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:49,990
need to start pulling some stuff out

103
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:53,829
into them right and so I have my entity

104
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,259
eh I could certainly put the brain stuff

105
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:57,879
in here probably without really causing

106
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,009
too much of a problem because the brain

107
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,649
stuff doesn't really rely so much on

108
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:05,500
anything else it's pretty isolated for

109
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:07,659
the most part and so I can sort of just

110
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,819
grab these and put them out here and say

111
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,080
here's what a brain is and really all it

112
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:12,399
needs to know is that there is such a

113
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,839
thing as an entity and you might point

114
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,538
to that entity but I don't know that we

115
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:20,829
really need anything else there so if i

116
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:25,659
go ahead and compile that what does this

117
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:27,969
thing oh let's see here yeah so i just

118
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:32,169
need to now go in and add that those

119
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:34,450
files in so that they can be so that

120
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:38,859
they can be accessed by the rest of the

121
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:40,589
code so handmade entity why isn't it

122
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,050
here oh it's here okay well that's fine

123
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:46,478
and made brain-dead H so we'll go ahead

124
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,189
and build that and then we also need

125
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:53,189
handmade brain dot CPP to be included

126
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:53,189
oops

127
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:03,159
so that's that's all there is to that

128
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:06,429
and now I can start pulling out brain

129
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,319
code into its own section so if i take

130
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,870
the world node code which is what we had

131
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,848
before and I pull it out into the brain

132
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,560
section what I should be able to do is

133
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:17,918
just kind of jump down to where that's

134
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,930
actually happening here let's see run

135
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:25,589
all brains right so in here where we've

136
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,819
got this sort of brain execution layer

137
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:30,728
what I should be able to do is just take

138
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:31,960
this switch statement out and I should

139
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:36,149
be able to dump the switch statement

140
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:39,339
just as a whole I think directly into

141
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,989
this file right so I should be able to

142
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:47,739
do a thing where this is just like an

143
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:49,210
execute brain and I don't know if the

144
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,620
compiler will actually in line this but

145
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,689
I hope it does because it's only ever

146
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,158
going to called in one place this is I'm

147
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:56,680
moving this out into file just so I can

148
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:59,649
see it more easily at the same time that

149
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,180
I look at the individual entity update

150
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:06,399
pieces of information right so this is

151
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,978
going to take a brain it probably also

152
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,718
needs a few other things as you can see

153
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:12,399
it needs like potentially access to the

154
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:14,978
input controllers it's going to need

155
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,478
access to the sim region as well so

156
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:20,199
there's some stuff in here that I also

157
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:25,000
need to do like sim region and then I

158
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:28,330
can go ahead and and make this go there

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,839
we go so we'll see what else it needs

160
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:36,008
i'm just we're now going to say execute

161
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:38,258
brain brain there's my sim region when I

162
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:45,129
build this you can see we need the game

163
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:49,979
state and it looks like mostly mostly

164
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:54,430
just those it's like the game states and

165
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:56,589
the controllers and I don't think I

166
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,240
don't think we really need much else so

167
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:00,939
we're also going to need it looks like

168
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,009
we need a DT so we need a DP value like

169
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:05,180
how much we're going to update by we

170
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,889
need that game state

171
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:12,560
and I don't know what we actually need

172
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:12,560
for I guess we just need the game input

173
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:19,829
and we could do something here where we

174
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:22,888
try to be a little clever and we

175
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:24,959
actually only do that input part if we

176
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:27,569
know it's one of the ones that takes

177
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,728
input I don't really care about that so

178
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:31,889
I'm not going to bother with that point

179
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:34,139
being once we've got that we can go back

180
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:43,049
to World mode and set that correctly so

181
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:44,399
here is X cube brain and i'm just going

182
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:51,088
to pass it the stuff that we know it

183
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:54,569
needs there we go so heroes exists is an

184
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:56,730
undeclared identifier which is true it

185
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,709
is an undeclared identifier the question

186
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,100
here is how we want to deal with that

187
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:03,269
and I've never been particularly good or

188
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,778
I shouldn't say feel good I know

189
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:09,329
perfectly happy with the way that code

190
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:12,539
has been working it's kind of janky and

191
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,490
what I would rather do is instead of the

192
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:17,028
heroes existing I'd rather have it so

193
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,549
that we have a notion a strong notion of

194
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:22,289
the world mode having been exited so I

195
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:24,509
think what I'd rather do is say down

196
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:28,439
here you know we get to throw to the end

197
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:30,659
of this situation and you can see here

198
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,640
we have a not heroes exist I think what

199
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:38,569
I would do is say something more like if

200
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:41,069
world mode exit or something like that

201
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:44,910
then we would do play title screen and

202
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,620
overwrite it so yeah I don't know

203
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:49,409
exactly what we want to do with that yet

204
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:53,940
but you know you get the idea so in here

205
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:59,969
we've got the play title screen a switch

206
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:02,640
essentially let me see what that's

207
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,089
actually going here exit seems

208
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,409
reasonable and we could do exit to title

209
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,980
just so it's clearer what it actually

210
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:13,649
means why is that it's not saving my

211
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,970
position in that file at some point I

212
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:16,799
have to look through for coder and find

213
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,509
out there's a lot of like stuff that

214
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,329
slows me down a lot which is

215
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:23,100
I can't switch between buffers very

216
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,020
quickly and for kodir it always puts me

217
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,399
in weird places or doesn't switch to the

218
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,889
last buffer I used your stuff like that

219
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,539
I need to like make that more solid at

220
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:32,519
some point I just haven't had a chance

221
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:35,039
to do so because I noticed that too

222
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:38,399
that's it's much slower for me to move

223
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,079
around than it used to be and it's one

224
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,519
of the things that I find like that an

225
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,680
indentation are the two things that have

226
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,779
been problematic so far and I think

227
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:53,549
indentation is already getting fixed or

228
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,779
partially fixed so it's mostly yet just

229
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:56,189
one of those little things that I feel

230
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,309
like I could probably fix on my own too

231
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:02,280
so all right heroes exists is not going

232
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:04,649
to be set to true anymore and then what

233
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,449
what I'm going to do is instead of

234
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:08,490
having that concept of it like a Deadman

235
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:13,259
switches kind of thing there when we do

236
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,659
an exit right what I would say is let's

237
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:19,529
just go ahead and keep track of how many

238
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:22,079
heroes there are in art right and and so

239
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:25,740
these brain IDs we could just say okay

240
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:29,580
any time we exit any time there's a hero

241
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,440
who leaves or you know I guess what we

242
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,120
could even do is just loop over and see

243
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,270
if none of the controller heroes have a

244
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,310
brain right we wouldn't even have to do

245
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,350
any more than that so we could do

246
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:44,719
something where we said okay you know

247
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:47,970
what we don't even need exit to title

248
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,430
all we really need to do is just say

249
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:59,220
that the heroes exist thing that we use

250
00:11:50,429 --> 00:12:02,120
the dues we'll just set it by looping

251
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,120
through the controllers

252
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:15,610
and so we can also look to see how that

253
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:17,948
did that see that's the thing right it

254
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,050
totally loses where my place is like I

255
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:22,528
used to be down at the bottom of the

256
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:29,349
file and now I'm I don't know where I am

257
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:31,688
I'm nowhere this is where I was so okay

258
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:37,300
so in here I've got handmade world mode

259
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:39,748
and I want to look at handmade H to see

260
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:47,128
where those con heroes are being stored

261
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:51,399
oops aah and they are getting stored in

262
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:53,860
here we go this I believe we can now

263
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:58,749
replace as well with Max controlled

264
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:01,558
controller count and so yeah and here i

265
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:07,449
can just use the array account of this

266
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:09,938
of games state-controlled heroes and for

267
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:14,678
each one of these i can say the controls

268
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:19,448
hero i guess i can even just do if game

269
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:31,028
state-controlled heroes con hero index

270
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:41,609
dot brain ID value here is exists equals

271
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:48,240
true break I heroes exists needs to get

272
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,240
this needs to get here quick Wes good

273
00:13:50,049 --> 00:14:14,659
does that do anything okay oops I think

274
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,889
we're all good now okay and this is

275
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:17,000
still running for some reason even

276
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:18,769
though I would have accepted the crash

277
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,200
because we change the data layout but I

278
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,490
guess it just wasn't because we just

279
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,210
added something in a place that it

280
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,519
didn't matter it was fine anyway so now

281
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,230
we kind of have the brains pulled out to

282
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,699
a separate file and here is that file

283
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,620
and you can kind of see that we've got

284
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:40,750
stuff in there that we need start

285
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:44,870
working on and then down here we have

286
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,210
what is now sort of becoming the physics

287
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,759
part of things so here's all of the

288
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,680
controller logic so this is like if we

289
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:56,090
have anything that's thoughtful at all

290
00:14:51,679 --> 00:15:00,409
so a monster or you know monster AI or

291
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:01,639
any of that stuff can run up in here so

292
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:06,289
we've got this we're going to run the

293
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:08,629
brains we can then say like okay you

294
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:10,009
know now we can come in and deal with

295
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:14,570
all the entities these entities should

296
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:19,700
have had stuff set on them and you know

297
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:21,680
we yeah you get the idea we have the

298
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,540
notion of updateable which we can still

299
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,949
avail though I think that might that

300
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:26,719
might be something we eventually can get

301
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:30,230
rid of now based on the fact that we're

302
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,840
room locked and not free scrolling

303
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,980
anymore we really just have to worry

304
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,210
about this one little part of the

305
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,250
boundary which we can talk about some

306
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,840
time later but assuming that entities

307
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,110
are updateable we can kind of see what's

308
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,490
supposed to happen here and so what we

309
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,560
want to start doing is cleaning up this

310
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,350
code into something that works reliably

311
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:52,069
for all entities that need to you know

312
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:54,050
be updated now here in this post physics

313
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,520
entity work side of things you can see

314
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:57,500
that all of this is actually just

315
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,539
rendering right like this is this switch

316
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,470
statement does nothing but render a dude

317
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:05,528
right that's all it does

318
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:07,540
and so I don't really know exactly how

319
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:09,519
we're going to handle that we're going

320
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:13,418
to have to look at that in a little more

321
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,159
detail very soon now but basically we're

322
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:19,418
going to have to start wondering about

323
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:21,278
how entities are how entities look and

324
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:24,119
that's going to have to be derived from

325
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,708
their properties in some ways that are

326
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:28,418
complicated right because like i said

327
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,399
before we kind of want to have the

328
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:32,078
ability for entities to be fairly free

329
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,269
form into kind of morph into various

330
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,088
things and that's going to put a bit of

331
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:39,009
a stress on the way that we match you

332
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:40,959
know figure out what bitmaps to draw

333
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:42,459
because obviously we only have a finite

334
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,649
number of bitmaps so we can't just

335
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,268
create bitmaps whole cloth if everything

336
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:49,058
was completely procedural we could but

337
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:50,470
that's not really feasible for the case

338
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:53,469
of a sort of hand-drawn look kind of

339
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:56,910
game like this maybe someday in the

340
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:01,239
distant future it will be but not today

341
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:02,558
so yeah so I don't know a lot a lot of

342
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:04,298
this stuff I don't really know if we

343
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:06,970
want much of this in here I feel like

344
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:09,269
this kind of needs to get moved out of

345
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:17,649
here so it's not bothering me anymore

346
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:20,318
see here put this damn in here yeah all

347
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:22,239
right and so we can kind of see how this

348
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,538
works all of this stuff is

349
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,720
simulation-based we and we have these

350
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:30,220
sort of separate waves and each wave

351
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,319
corresponds to something that we're

352
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,538
trying to do we have the brain phase

353
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,888
which goes through decides what to do we

354
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:37,179
then have like a physics phase which

355
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:41,648
moves things around and then we have an

356
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:43,659
entity phase and I don't know that I

357
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:45,548
care super much about this timing block

358
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,130
so I'm going to go ahead and flatten

359
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:49,298
this out again I'm just trying to

360
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:53,139
flatten this out and start to think

361
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:57,250
about how it's working and simplify

362
00:17:53,138 --> 00:18:00,069
things are possible so yeah so here

363
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,538
we've got run all the brains and I don't

364
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:06,609
really need this common anymore to be

365
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:09,179
quite so big if you run all brains and

366
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:09,178
this is

367
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:18,639
simulate all entities all right so now

368
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:21,789
what do I want to do here well this

369
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,790
stuff is sort of a mix right its a mix

370
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:26,170
of rendering and simulation you can see

371
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:28,389
that it does a switch on the entity type

372
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,880
here and it does the actual movement

373
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,380
code set up and then it does a switch on

374
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,600
what the movement type is and does the

375
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,370
movement sort of separate from it

376
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:37,779
doesn't matter what ND it is it'll do

377
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:40,179
the same movement code regardless and

378
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:42,099
then it comes down and finally does the

379
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,900
rendering right like essentially this

380
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:46,000
should not be called post physics entity

381
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,990
work it's really just rendering because

382
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,069
that's the only thing it does at the

383
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,120
moment right you can see if there's

384
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:53,139
really nothing else that's happening

385
00:18:49,119 --> 00:19:03,369
here besides that let me delete all this

386
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:05,530
we don't need this anymore yeah so this

387
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:07,539
rendering code is something that will

388
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:09,369
get to later so I guess I don't really

389
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:11,409
have to care about that too much at the

390
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:12,879
moment but we're gonna have to start

391
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,410
thinking about it soon so I'll leave

392
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,150
that for now and we'll just focus on

393
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:19,360
this will focus everything up to this

394
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:23,980
point ok here is the move entity code

395
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:25,809
does the code that gets called whenever

396
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,589
an entity has to actually go somewhere

397
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:31,149
or do something I don't really know if

398
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:32,709
we want this movable flag anymore i

399
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,030
suspect we probably don't want the

400
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,259
movable flag anymore and the reason i

401
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:38,289
suspect that we don't want the movable

402
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:39,879
flag anymore is because the way that

403
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,950
we're doing in an emotion now is much

404
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,630
more semantic and i suspect that pretty

405
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,170
much you could just have your movement

406
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,880
mode be set to on not moving and that is

407
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,310
good enough like we shouldn't need a

408
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,380
flag in addition to an enum that says

409
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:54,970
how you're moving one of the ways in

410
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,570
which you could be moving could be not

411
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,789
moving right so I suspect we could get

412
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:02,319
rid of this flag pretty soon as well and

413
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:04,359
that's something I'll probably be aiming

414
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,889
to do in a second here but what I'd like

415
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:07,089
to do is go back and take a look at some

416
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,970
more of these things and just make sure

417
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:11,829
that I kind of know what's going on here

418
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:14,890
so you can see that we've got DDT Bob

419
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:16,029
and we've also got a DDP or the two

420
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,920
things we're setting I'm going to go

421
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:19,809
ahead and say that this right here is a

422
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,720
paired thing it has to do with the head

423
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:24,339
distance from the body and so

424
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,620
in my mind this is a brain operation

425
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:30,519
right this is an operation that has to

426
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:32,739
do with things when when something's

427
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:35,980
planted stretching towards it's like

428
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,690
related entity right and so what I want

429
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,509
to do is say well if the movement mode

430
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,190
is planted and if there's a head then

431
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:44,650
we're going to sort of you know have

432
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:48,490
this this notion that this stuff is

433
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:50,679
going to occur right and the difference

434
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,019
here is that when we compute this DDT

435
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,610
Bob that's going to be the DDT dub for

436
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:59,048
the body we're going to write that into

437
00:20:54,609 --> 00:21:01,000
you know into the DDT okay because

438
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:06,000
otherwise we sort of we do have this

439
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,519
other notion of what the DDT bob is

440
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,409
right we have that being able to happen

441
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,619
in other ways right it can happen inside

442
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:17,470
one of these sort of hopping movement

443
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:21,428
things and so I'm just going to say that

444
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:24,250
that's something that that happens as an

445
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:27,370
accumulator right and then later we

446
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:33,179
apply what we need to apply to the DDT

447
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:35,649
Bob and and then we you know we would

448
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,850
zero that out on packing because it

449
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,610
would get it would go away during

450
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:41,139
packing right so essentially i'm doing

451
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:43,089
the same thing I did with DDP there's

452
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,500
now on the entity there's the notion of

453
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:46,029
acceleration stored on the entity but

454
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,220
only during the time when it's actually

455
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:50,200
stimulated we would never actually store

456
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:54,850
it right it's not something we would

457
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,409
store and keep around so here's my DDT

458
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,639
Bob and again this is probably not

459
00:21:56,409 --> 00:21:59,950
singing will keep but we just want to

460
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,270
we're going to have values like this and

461
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,548
we would have if probably just not

462
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:05,859
called DDT Bob but we would have this

463
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:07,359
notion that you know certain bones have

464
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:10,079
some springiness and other things like

465
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,079
that right

466
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:19,490
okay so what we need to do in additional

467
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:22,849
as an additional step here is things

468
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:26,120
that we don't want to pack right we want

469
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:29,959
those things to not persist to the next

470
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:31,399
round to the next update cycle so inside

471
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,769
world when we are actually packing

472
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,340
entities what I'd like to do is just you

473
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:39,109
know sort of prophylactically so that we

474
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:41,059
don't get in the habit of keeping them

475
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:43,669
around or aren't confused when they stay

476
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,919
around i'd like to go ahead and clear

477
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:51,410
the things that are not supposed to be

478
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:53,779
stored okay just to keep that going so

479
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,029
now in here yeah we don't really have to

480
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:57,980
worry about a lot of this stuff because

481
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:00,710
now we know we've got two things both

482
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,360
the head and the body so in this case

483
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,910
here i could say like if I've got the

484
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:08,599
head then I know that my head distance

485
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:14,420
is going to be that length and it's the

486
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:16,009
length between the head and the body and

487
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:19,370
that gets rid of all that complexity as

488
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:21,049
well okay so now I think we're still in

489
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:22,909
good shape again we haven't fixed our

490
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:24,470
GDP yet but we're starting to clean that

491
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,990
up so I think that's the last thing

492
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,660
we've got to do is actually get the DDP

493
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:33,200
part correctly which is what allows

494
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:36,290
enemies to move around and what we have

495
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,720
here is we have this notion of this

496
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:40,609
movement spec and while the movement

497
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,650
spec is not necessarily a bad idea i

498
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:44,299
think it is a bad idea that's not stored

499
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,620
on the entity and the reason that i

500
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:47,329
think that is because again much like

501
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:49,879
the DDP it's something that a bunch of

502
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:52,549
people may want to feed into and operate

503
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,960
on so what we want to do is we want to

504
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:56,779
have some notion of how this movement

505
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,299
mode stuff works and and so let's take a

506
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:02,059
look at that oops i'm actually up here

507
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:04,250
so you can see what used to happen when

508
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:06,079
we would set this these these movement

509
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,170
modes we had this movement spec that was

510
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:12,259
here it was getting is getting set this

511
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,850
way I strongly suspect that we want to

512
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,950
kind of clean up how this movement spec

513
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:18,769
thing works at all anyway like the speed

514
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,900
and the drag and this crap I don't know

515
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:24,230
that we want any of that anymore I

516
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,590
probably I would be shocked if we really

517
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,839
want

518
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:29,720
I this to work exactly the way that it

519
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:33,439
is working but you know that's all right

520
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:36,769
for now not a huge deal the point is

521
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,500
what I'd like to do is take a non packed

522
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:42,079
movement spec and add that to the entity

523
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,720
so the move spec here that we've got

524
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,220
where we do default moves back what I

525
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,798
want to do there is say okay the

526
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:55,480
movement spec on an entity you know

527
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:55,480
there's going to be one put it in here

528
00:24:55,569 --> 00:25:03,069
for now we'll just say there is a

529
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:05,959
movement spec it's not packed for now

530
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:08,089
and so what happens when we go to update

531
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,190
is instead of getting the movement spec

532
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,869
from here we're not going to do that at

533
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,240
all instead we're going to get the

534
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:16,009
movement spec out of the entity itself

535
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,278
and so later when we come down into the

536
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:20,509
movement stuff and we say let's go ahead

537
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:21,589
and move it what we actually are going

538
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:24,859
to do is we're going to get that out of

539
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:26,209
the entity so if I go back now and look

540
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,889
at where we were actually signing that

541
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,319
there were two places we were doing it

542
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:33,559
one was for the head one was for the

543
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:37,210
body oh well that's not true looks like

544
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:40,668
one was for the body where was the head

545
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:45,558
did we never do the head do we ever even

546
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:48,610
use this we don't use it i'm just not

547
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:48,609
even going to bother with it for now

548
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:55,509
because i don't care about the familiar

549
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,509
at all right now

550
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:14,898
hmm interesting so in here so I guess we

551
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,519
never really used it for for the head

552
00:26:14,898 --> 00:26:17,778
which doesn't make any sense because we

553
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,159
would have had to use it for the head in

554
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:20,659
order to make the movement work so i

555
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:23,028
must have just deleted the code that use

556
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:25,519
that or whatever anyway I don't really

557
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:32,959
care about that because I want to apply

558
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:35,028
the I want to I really don't want this

559
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:38,328
to be doing anything fancy anyway I

560
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:40,308
guess is the point so you know we'll use

561
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:43,908
this for the moment and we'll just say

562
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:46,278
okay here a body I don't care about but

563
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:50,929
hero head right so if there's a hero

564
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:53,690
head I want it to I want it to use

565
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:56,329
whatever this spec is let's say so we're

566
00:26:53,690 --> 00:27:01,278
just going to go ahead and say head like

567
00:26:56,328 --> 00:27:06,348
so I don't know where that actually gets

568
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:08,419
to find here it is but that's gonna I

569
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:10,189
think we're gonna I don't like that

570
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:13,069
system at all i don't really like that I

571
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,588
think it's not gonna scale well like

572
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:17,269
having this movement spec concept I

573
00:27:15,588 --> 00:27:19,278
think we want to make it a little more

574
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:21,679
of a functional thing I don't know maybe

575
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:25,068
I'm wrong maybe it'll be fine but I'm

576
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,469
not super not super confident in it

577
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:29,058
let's put that way alright so the

578
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:31,369
familiar I'm just going to throw this

579
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:34,548
out because we haven't we talked about

580
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:35,778
the familiar much all right so let's

581
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:38,598
take a look at what this is starting to

582
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:40,429
look like now and let's see if we can

583
00:27:38,598 --> 00:27:42,168
get so I'm not getting any DDP in there

584
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:44,629
let's see if we could figure out how to

585
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:52,639
start routing the DDP into it so here's

586
00:27:44,628 --> 00:27:54,948
the brain code and in the brain code you

587
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:57,348
can see me setting the DDP here right

588
00:27:54,949 --> 00:28:00,199
and that's sort of the controller's

589
00:27:57,348 --> 00:28:02,598
requested DDP we then take a look at

590
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:05,519
what that is and we were sort of we're

591
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:10,200
doing like some kind of a

592
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:12,329
the fussing on that I guess would be the

593
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,880
way to put it and then we're adding to

594
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:20,629
the heads velocity just just straight up

595
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:28,200
right the heads velocity is just kidding

596
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:31,500
getting added directly which is kind of

597
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,640
a little bit weird yeah this is what

598
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,869
happens when you have to make too many

599
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,340
code changes at once and you have to

600
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:36,689
spread them over weeks of time because

601
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,329
you only probably on our program an hour

602
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:44,789
today you kind of forget exactly why you

603
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:50,750
were ever doing something one way but

604
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:57,420
that's not it here another excuse me

605
00:28:50,750 --> 00:29:02,970
okay uh so if we're looking at if we're

606
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:06,539
looking at the hero head to me it looks

607
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,670
to me like since get closest reversible

608
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:11,819
will always work in the case that we're

609
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:14,100
looking at now it seems to me like the

610
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:17,700
DD the head DP should always actually

611
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:19,529
have a value added to it right and this

612
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,029
doesn't really look like what I would

613
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:22,500
have wanted to do so I feel like I'm

614
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:25,049
just going to stop this from happening

615
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:29,069
entirely because basically the heads DDP

616
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:30,690
should be equal to this acceleration

617
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:33,539
that's what we wanted to do is set an

618
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:36,870
acceleration for the head and that's

619
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:38,609
just what we're trying to do so now I

620
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:41,609
want to kind of figure out why are we

621
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:42,959
not getting any sort of movement here so

622
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:45,299
i just want to see what happens and i

623
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,230
should probably also come in here and

624
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:51,329
say let's put that in for now i want to

625
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,880
make some major changes to this code but

626
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:55,529
we don't have to do that right now and

627
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,660
so now when i'm pushing on things i want

628
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:59,970
to know why i'm not getting any any

629
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,650
actual acceleration there which is a

630
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:06,930
little bit harder to do so what I'm

631
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:09,330
going to maybe do here is maybe I'll

632
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,970
just add a force so that it's like

633
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:13,679
permanently pushing to one side so that

634
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,180
I don't have to try and hold down a key

635
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,690
and then hit a break point or something

636
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,690
like that right

637
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:28,059
i guess i can use was pressed ah i see

638
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,470
what the problem is for some reason we

639
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:35,230
have was pressed and that was down right

640
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:38,380
so we actually were using this as a

641
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:40,529
state thing we actually were storing the

642
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:43,900
controller state in the con here oh

643
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:46,899
right I forgot about this we were doing

644
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,730
some stuff to make it so that you it

645
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,759
would it would remember what the last

646
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:54,009
direction you had pushed was alright I

647
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,259
like that I felt like that made a good

648
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:57,250
difference when we were I felt like that

649
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:59,109
made a reason alone I'm sorry playing

650
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:02,920
around before so i think i may leave

651
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:06,309
that there if that makes sense i think i

652
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,660
may say like okay that's a reasonable

653
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:08,859
thing to keep in the controlled here was

654
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:13,690
like what the controller state was

655
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:17,049
supposed to be and so i guess maybe

656
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:20,259
we'll call this controller door or

657
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:23,859
something like that I don't know GDP

658
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:26,079
makes it easier to type even though

659
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:28,689
that's not quite what it is so I'll

660
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:38,379
delete this one here and I'll say dd p

661
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:40,750
equals clown hero GDP and we're gonna

662
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:45,550
have to figure out how we want to do

663
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:47,140
analog stick motion as well right

664
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:50,139
because I don't know if we want to use

665
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,880
some like some cross like make a nice

666
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,310
cross shaped dead zone pattern or

667
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,500
something so that you kind of its locks

668
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:59,500
into whichever one you're pressing more

669
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,269
into I'm not sure but something like

670
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,150
that probably has to happen at some

671
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:07,269
point if we want to support analog

672
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:10,000
sticks as opposed to just d pads so

673
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:16,200
let's see here so going through we've

674
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,200
got a length squared con hero DDP

675
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:30,809
and I think that's all we need oops what

676
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:33,159
happened I don't know what I just did oh

677
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:37,299
right I change the data layout so we got

678
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:40,050
to restart anyway all right so now what

679
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:43,930
I'm going to try doing is I want to I

680
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:46,629
want to make sort of a pass through the

681
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:49,480
code to find out exactly why we're not

682
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:51,220
getting the DDP I want to find it i want

683
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,620
to step through the code and see how the

684
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,180
DDP is ending up getting set and i just

685
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:56,679
want to do that before i start factoring

686
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,140
this code to make sure that we don't

687
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,340
have any other bugs well I'm almost

688
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,780
certain we do have other bug so I'm

689
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:05,439
saying get rid of those before I start

690
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:09,190
playing around with the code all right

691
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:17,230
so inside brain which is not here

692
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:19,660
unfortunately open-file brain does it to

693
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,860
be all right so what I'm going to do is

694
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,769
I'm just going to set a breakpoint on

695
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:27,339
move down or I you know what I'll do

696
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:30,549
move left all right so the x equals 1

697
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:33,490
the easiest case to look at so here we

698
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:35,289
are in that piece of code visual studios

699
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,640
thankfully picking up a key press that

700
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:37,960
went to another application and starting

701
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,070
to insert characters it's almost

702
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,240
certainly what you want the middle of a

703
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:48,309
breakpoint and here we go looking

704
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:50,589
through here looks like we don't really

705
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:53,919
have anything particular to care about

706
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:57,069
here but here is the code we actually do

707
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,490
care about where we're sort of looking

708
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:04,149
at this DDP okay so if we take a look at

709
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:06,309
the con hero GDP we see that it is x1

710
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,740
which is what we expect we come through

711
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:15,489
here and you know we should theory not 0

712
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:18,779
too much of it at our GDP too ah well

713
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,779
that explains that

714
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:32,849
because that's not correct at all our

715
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:37,169
GDP to never gets set here right and it

716
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:39,659
should so DDP to actually should be

717
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:43,049
equal to this directly I think is what

718
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,250
we should have been doing right because

719
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,159
we should have said it to what the

720
00:34:44,250 --> 00:35:04,820
acceleration is so I think that's the

721
00:34:47,159 --> 00:35:04,820
mistake or not

722
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:13,048
right because this is clipping out the

723
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:19,078
elements of it if you know when there's

724
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:20,880
no push happening but otherwise it's

725
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:25,289
passing it through which is what we want

726
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:28,108
it to go to head DDP right and we're

727
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:30,119
using that DDP are we not or are did I

728
00:35:28,108 --> 00:35:32,068
never do that either which would be yet

729
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,039
another thing that we didn't do when we

730
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:46,318
were fixing up the code yet we didn't do

731
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:49,528
that either that's got to go away so DDP

732
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:51,000
for any type familiar this can be the

733
00:35:49,528 --> 00:35:52,858
entities gdp for now we're going to

734
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,679
probably move the editing familiar code

735
00:35:52,858 --> 00:36:01,038
over to a brain though obviously right

736
00:35:54,679 --> 00:36:01,038
and so that'll be fine just ended a DDP

737
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,028
all right so we're not really in a

738
00:36:10,108 --> 00:36:14,068
correct state yet we still got a bunch

739
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:15,599
of stuff to do but at least now we're

740
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:20,579
back to being able to move our head

741
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:28,460
around in the way that I would have

742
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:31,410
expected so that's nice uh all right

743
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:34,470
sorry I've got itchy eye it's a bit

744
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:36,298
allergy ish in Seattle these days for me

745
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:37,949
i don't know why i don't think the

746
00:36:36,298 --> 00:36:44,960
allergy season is really that high at

747
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:44,960
the moment but plants all right

748
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:51,480
so now we need to do is start to kind of

749
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:53,789
clean up this code a little bit more you

750
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,429
can see that entity type is now starting

751
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:57,659
to get very spare which is what I wanted

752
00:36:56,429 --> 00:36:59,879
right because I don't really want

753
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:02,730
anything to have to do with the env type

754
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,579
anymore so one thing we could do is now

755
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:08,639
say that the hero familiar code moves

756
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:11,400
over here as well and so I don't know

757
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,808
that we really want anything in

758
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,579
particular to be called hero familiar

759
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:16,440
yet but I'm going to do that for now

760
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,720
just so we can sort of see that well

761
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,630
whatever it is that has that sort of

762
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:27,568
stuff related to it it's going to be

763
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:35,280
over here right so all of this stuff is

764
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:37,469
going to be over here and so now and

765
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,619
then in theory that floaty thing for now

766
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:42,298
code would I guess also be a break a

767
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:46,858
piece of brain code right that was like

768
00:37:42,298 --> 00:37:51,630
moving things around so even this would

769
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:53,489
be a brain floaty thing for now because

770
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,780
anything that's like a behavior is going

771
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:57,899
to move over here and they might not be

772
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:00,540
specifically brain IDs they may be like

773
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,730
it may be like the brain ideas like an

774
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:05,369
animated piece of scenery is the brain

775
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:07,500
type and then there's properties of the

776
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:10,798
entity that sort of tell it how it moves

777
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,929
render things like that if that makes

778
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:14,280
sense so now this this entity type stuff

779
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:22,169
is not going to be determining that

780
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:24,530
anymore and maybe we use this and maybe

781
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,530
we don't

782
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:38,929
and now this goes away and we really

783
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:40,760
just have the movement code right which

784
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:43,609
is have entities move and then the

785
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:53,060
rendering code I'm going to go ahead and

786
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:54,620
grab this and put it down here alright

787
00:38:53,059 --> 00:39:07,219
so now we've got to actually define

788
00:38:54,619 --> 00:39:12,380
those rains which is fine and then

789
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:14,449
anyone who was previously using the ND

790
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,950
stuff you know I should probably I need

791
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:17,779
to start keeping track of the four coder

792
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:22,039
things that we that we run into because

793
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:24,070
I don't ever keep track of them like

794
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:27,110
buffer position laws etc etc I got a

795
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:29,360
concert making notes things don't get

796
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:32,269
better if you don't make notes alright

797
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:34,700
so in here we've got this editing stuff

798
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:36,619
I'm not going to port the familiar just

799
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:46,179
yet although we probably do want to do

800
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:46,179
that soon see here all right

801
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:52,980
okay so let's go ahead now and start to

802
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,860
think about you know what I'd like to do

803
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,230
is before we clean up this this brain

804
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:02,460
code anymore what I'd like to do is

805
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:09,170
actually come over to the entity stuff

806
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:09,170
and see if we can now consider a way to

807
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:15,090
I'd like to figure out some way to get

808
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,380
rid of that entity type right cuz like I

809
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,420
said one of the big things I wanted to

810
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,039
do was not have entity type be a thing

811
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:26,789
anymore like I don't really want that

812
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:28,860
right and so I would rather have ways in

813
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:31,230
which an entity itself just says that

814
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,760
it's made up out of some pieces and so

815
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,170
when it's created it can just be made up

816
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,730
out of those pieces and then off you go

817
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:39,630
and there's really not much more to it

818
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:41,309
than that right and so you can see that

819
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,630
that wouldn't be probably that difficult

820
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:44,460
because you can see that all we're doing

821
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,769
here is like pushing bitmaps on for like

822
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,480
you know we're just doing some asset

823
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:49,800
matching and then pushing some bitmaps

824
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,789
on it so it seems to me that we should

825
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,700
be able to have a way to make that work

826
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:59,519
without a whole lot of you know of to do

827
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:01,139
about it and I feel like probably we

828
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,389
could say that you know in general

829
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:07,319
things are made up of a couple pieces

830
00:41:03,389 --> 00:41:08,819
and that those pieces you know have sort

831
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,830
of an own way they get rendered and that

832
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:16,370
we don't need to base it on the type at

833
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:19,259
all right that seems reasonable to me

834
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:22,440
stairwells are not a thing anymore those

835
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:25,940
just don't exist so I don't really want

836
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,829
that we can get rid of that entirely

837
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:33,320
Monstars are a thing that would exist

838
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:33,319
but they're going to be a brain probably

839
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:55,639
let's see here so we've got the Monstars

840
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:57,108
and a Monstars was really no different

841
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:59,088
than a regular hero but just with a

842
00:41:57,108 --> 00:42:01,338
torso that's all it was and presumably

843
00:41:59,088 --> 00:42:04,699
we'd have other stuff in their floors

844
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:06,798
and floaty things those are like just

845
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:08,659
solid pieces that are on the ground so

846
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:10,429
again I feel like all this stuff let's

847
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,690
just let's just do it let's do it i'm in

848
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:12,828
the mood to get rid of this i don't

849
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,460
really want any of this crap here

850
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:20,028
anymore so here this is just debug code

851
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:22,670
right so so this can just be anyone can

852
00:42:20,028 --> 00:42:24,889
have this drawn right anyone can draw

853
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:27,920
their traversable xin their collision

854
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:33,199
Rex so just let's just do that right

855
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,940
let's do that and so that just should be

856
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,608
like a bunch of yeah there's just few

857
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:40,460
bunch of squares on stuff right yeah

858
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:42,230
there you go and so we'll just make a

859
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,220
debug switch or something that controls

860
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:50,630
that and then we don't have to think

861
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:52,038
about it anymore right so that's fine so

862
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:55,608
now we don't care about any of these

863
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:59,089
entity types at all and then the rest of

864
00:42:55,608 --> 00:43:02,028
these like I say most of them are just

865
00:42:59,088 --> 00:43:05,000
like okay do I have a shadow and then

866
00:43:02,028 --> 00:43:06,588
I've got some luck do I have to any

867
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,068
springy parts that are sort of

868
00:43:06,588 --> 00:43:12,219
associated with each other it looks like

869
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:15,219
it shouldn't be that complicated to me

870
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:15,219
right

871
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:27,279
seems pretty straightforward

872
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:48,459
yeah alright so in here we've got I

873
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:50,289
don't know what why color I guess we

874
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,389
just have because we were doing some

875
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:54,760
kind of bouncy offsets for the heroes

876
00:43:52,389 --> 00:43:57,578
body so what I'd like to do is just

877
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,519
let's just take this code and just make

878
00:43:57,579 --> 00:44:05,260
a sort of a smush down version that

879
00:44:00,518 --> 00:44:07,118
every entity could use right and so the

880
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,940
enemy familiar where the head bobs up

881
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:13,269
and down right thats can still be the

882
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,358
same as as how like the as how the torso

883
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:18,429
Bob's up and down right those can all be

884
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:21,038
essentially the same because the torso

885
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:24,028
already has this notion of that it can

886
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:26,710
come up up and down I'm sorry the cape

887
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:29,710
can come up and down based on the tea

888
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:31,690
Bob so really these are the same if that

889
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:35,619
makes sense and we don't really need

890
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:37,659
them to be dealt with separately so for

891
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:39,160
you know if this was something that

892
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:40,449
we're going to be animated then that can

893
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:41,940
just be something that gets generically

894
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:45,009
animated and it's not really a big deal

895
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:47,349
so we'll figure out how to do that the

896
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:50,369
Mon star is completely the same that as

897
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:52,750
the hero just didn't have a head right

898
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:54,818
drawing hip point seems like something

899
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,170
that everyone could have happen and then

900
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:58,420
if they just don't have hip points then

901
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:59,740
we just don't draw it so I feel like

902
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,269
that's also something that could come

903
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:04,000
down here and we just make that a little

904
00:45:01,268 --> 00:45:05,798
bit smarter to just look to see whether

905
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,809
there's any hip points lots and if there

906
00:45:05,798 --> 00:45:09,880
are we don't draw them in fact it looks

907
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:11,200
like that already works right because if

908
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,000
you don't have hip points you don't draw

909
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:14,558
the hit points so now anything could

910
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,480
just get hit points all of a sudden if

911
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,400
it needed to and that would work which

912
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,199
again is more keeping with what I want I

913
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,759
don't really want things to have types

914
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:23,618
that define these things I just want

915
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:25,420
them either have it or they don't and

916
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:28,539
then not have really any cost to just

917
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:32,019
making something suddenly have them all

918
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:36,190
right so the hero head if I was to sort

919
00:45:32,018 --> 00:45:41,739
of add these together let me see what

920
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:43,599
happens here right the hero head again

921
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:46,419
could just be in place of one of these

922
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,829
guys so really this that concept of a

923
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:50,079
composite where we just have like a

924
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:51,530
shadow a thing and the thing on top of

925
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,470
it would draw everything

926
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:58,310
we have at the moment so we could just

927
00:45:54,469 --> 00:46:00,709
do that I don't know what this 2.5 so

928
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:03,429
these are the heights right so let's

929
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:08,150
just make this a property of the entity

930
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:11,089
so in here we've got them this entities

931
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:13,880
and you know maybe we've got sort of the

932
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:20,930
notion that each entity sort of has a

933
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:23,030
component right and I don't know what

934
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:31,639
we'd call this but like like a visible

935
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:35,570
piece right and this visible piece would

936
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:37,819
just be I've got you know essentially

937
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:40,210
the things that I use to call this

938
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:43,850
bitmap call is what I actually want

939
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:47,539
right I have like this sort of stuff so

940
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:52,849
I need to know what the asset type is

941
00:46:47,539 --> 00:47:01,519
like what is the asset type that I'm

942
00:46:52,849 --> 00:47:03,980
grabbing for this thing I need to know

943
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,929
like I suppose what the Alpha value is

944
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,659
for it and maybe I don't really want to

945
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:12,980
know that I'm not sure but you know

946
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:18,819
probably I do i need to know the scale

947
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:18,820
of it so how big it is probably right

948
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:27,940
just this way like height basically and

949
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:31,670
I guess we could just call that height

950
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:37,760
so I need to know the height and I need

951
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:43,000
to know the color I could just say v4

952
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,000
color right

953
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:55,630
and then I need some information about

954
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:58,999
how they're going to be matched right

955
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:01,068
because like I guess I could just put

956
00:47:58,998 --> 00:48:03,738
the direction facing direction in there

957
00:48:01,068 --> 00:48:06,858
and then you know well I guess that's

958
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:11,059
really all i would need is just to just

959
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:12,409
throw in that yeah i mean i don't know

960
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:14,359
that i really need to keep an entire

961
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:17,088
waiting vector in there I think we get

962
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:18,708
you to get by with this just for now and

963
00:48:17,088 --> 00:48:23,150
probably most of these things would work

964
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:24,588
ok right and so then you here I can just

965
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:35,119
say well I've got a few of these visible

966
00:48:24,588 --> 00:48:36,708
pieces right and you know at the moment

967
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,028
we're basically saying you know we can't

968
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:39,528
really have very many of those and I

969
00:48:38,028 --> 00:48:41,208
think I don't ever probably want to have

970
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:43,818
too many of those because you know

971
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:46,998
really this is just if just this is just

972
00:48:43,818 --> 00:48:49,248
for animation purposes if things were

973
00:48:46,998 --> 00:48:50,748
actually moving around very distinctly

974
00:48:49,248 --> 00:48:53,598
then they should be separate entities so

975
00:48:50,748 --> 00:48:58,518
this is only like four animation these

976
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:59,989
are animated pieces of this thing and so

977
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:03,379
for now it would just be something like

978
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:04,789
that right now possibly in the future we

979
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:08,239
may need to do something where these are

980
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:10,819
shared and in fact you know now I think

981
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,670
about that might be that might be

982
00:49:10,818 --> 00:49:15,829
something we would want to do in general

983
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:17,239
just because we don't really need to

984
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:21,949
store them if they're usually the same

985
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:30,409
but I don't know I i think i'm going to

986
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:32,959
leave it this way for the moment yeah I

987
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:38,899
think that's I think that's probably how

988
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:44,198
we're going to leave it all right um so

989
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:44,199
if we have these these visible pieces I

990
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,380
and then I'm going to draw them you know

991
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,740
I could basically turn this thing into a

992
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:54,680
loop that works that way right we've got

993
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:56,509
the entity x-axis the y-axis and the

994
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:58,909
floor display stand that stuff we can

995
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:02,690
essentially use this thing and just make

996
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:03,829
a loop that would look this way and we

997
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:07,309
would just need some extra information

998
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:10,489
how much time do I have not a whole lot

999
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:12,349
of time I really just need a little bit

1000
00:50:10,489 --> 00:50:14,269
of extra information to do some of these

1001
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:16,069
more advanced things so I'm going to

1002
00:50:14,269 --> 00:50:17,719
leave the hero body out of this for now

1003
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:20,780
and I'm going to do the rest of these

1004
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:22,669
because they're a lot simpler for me to

1005
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,960
start with and then once those are

1006
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:28,030
working we'll figure out how to back

1007
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:32,690
into making the other ones work right

1008
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:36,050
okay so let's start with the most the

1009
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:37,880
easiest one which is the wall so if we

1010
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,830
imagine how this is going to go I can

1011
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,050
just say ok there's a piece index equals

1012
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:45,829
zero peace index is less than your way

1013
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:47,720
account of the env pieces Peace Index oh

1014
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:50,299
wait no it's not I guess I can just say

1015
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:53,000
piece count because it has less than

1016
00:50:50,300 --> 00:51:01,400
that number often and then I have an

1017
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:03,139
enemy visible piece and I'm just going

1018
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:07,250
to do that that drawing so i'll do a

1019
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:15,559
push bitmap and i want to do a get Beth

1020
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:19,489
Matt a get best match here and so I'm

1021
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:27,320
going to do a get best get best match

1022
00:51:19,489 --> 00:51:30,049
for the bitmap ID when I do the get bet

1023
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:34,240
get massive get best matching bitmap I

1024
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:34,240
need to take the piece asset type

1025
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:47,318
man I can't actually get any more room

1026
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:49,140
can I that's unfortunate the asset type

1027
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:54,818
the match vector and the weight vector

1028
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:55,958
right once i have that bitmap ID that's

1029
00:51:54,818 --> 00:52:01,208
the one that i'm going to be passing

1030
00:51:55,958 --> 00:52:05,018
here i know that the piece height goes

1031
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:07,509
here i know that the the piece color

1032
00:52:05,018 --> 00:52:08,919
goes wait no this is the offset I guess

1033
00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:12,278
right which we haven't really done

1034
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:17,039
anything with yet so then I would have

1035
00:52:12,278 --> 00:52:24,369
here I'd have the piece color like so

1036
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:28,599
and that be the simple version right so

1037
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:30,849
that's pretty good so now I just need to

1038
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:33,699
actually set one of these and so for

1039
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:36,400
example for wall I could probably make

1040
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:42,759
this happen right now so if i go up here

1041
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:47,219
to where we would create a wall and add

1042
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:47,219
wall oops

1043
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:56,719
yeah I can go ahead and add the entity

1044
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:58,619
piece here that that correctly

1045
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:03,659
represents this thing that I'm trying to

1046
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:07,980
draw so here's me doing it first without

1047
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:15,179
that is asset type not known at this

1048
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:24,048
time somehow does any of you come before

1049
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:24,048
asset that seems weird but possibly true

1050
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:33,210
let's find out because file formats it

1051
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:39,828
would be in file formats right and

1052
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:45,720
entities way down here its asset type ID

1053
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:48,809
that's the problem so now when I run the

1054
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:50,308
game I'm not gonna see any walls right

1055
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:55,500
so I know they're there because their

1056
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:58,470
collision volumes are there right but I

1057
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:03,829
don't see them so what I need to do now

1058
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:07,108
is I need to actually get one of those

1059
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:09,420
and you actually make a piece for the

1060
00:54:07,108 --> 00:54:12,150
you know that says a tree has this one

1061
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:15,798
component that's the tree and you should

1062
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:19,230
draw it right so if i go to handmade

1063
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:20,909
robe mode us to BP and inside add well

1064
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,818
what i need to do is do an ad piece

1065
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:26,038
command which will create which

1066
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:30,058
basically says like hey it's going to be

1067
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:35,099
an asset tree it's going to be a 2.5

1068
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:37,319
tall and it's going to be well we don't

1069
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:39,568
have an offset yet I suppose I should

1070
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:42,210
have probably put an offset in there but

1071
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:49,288
it's just going to be white right it's

1072
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:50,250
not going to be tinted at all okay so

1073
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:51,599
hopefully you can see what I'm doing

1074
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:53,369
here I'm doing a very straightforward

1075
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,329
process to get this started I'm just

1076
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:58,858
saying ok let's make a sort of a data

1077
00:54:57,329 --> 00:55:01,109
layout that just mirrors what we were

1078
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:03,719
actually doing so that I can make it to

1079
00:55:01,108 --> 00:55:06,239
the entities prescribe in the actual

1080
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:07,919
the exactly what will happen when they

1081
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,629
go to be rendered so that each entity

1082
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,490
can have a unique way in which it gets

1083
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:13,800
rendered as sort of like it's only it's

1084
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:15,389
basically like taking and it's almost a

1085
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,500
mini scripting language kind of approach

1086
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:17,969
right when you do this sort of thing

1087
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,858
you're saying I'm going to add a bunch

1088
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:21,839
of Records which say the functions to

1089
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,848
use basically and they just happen to be

1090
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,950
based on very specific parameterization

1091
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:30,119
so it's a very limited way of scripting

1092
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:33,000
it right so you're basically compressing

1093
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:34,530
some some ideas about what code you

1094
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,409
could call into just a few parameters

1095
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:39,269
and then unpacking them that way all

1096
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:45,690
right so in the ad piece called you know

1097
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:49,800
right pretty easy how this works I just

1098
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:52,650
say alright I've got an entity the

1099
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:57,869
entity has an asset type ID I'm sorry

1100
00:55:52,650 --> 00:56:01,650
the piece has an asset type ID it's got

1101
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:03,960
a height and a static color and that's a

1102
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:06,480
simple way to add a piece we would

1103
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:10,849
assert of course that the entity piece

1104
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,849
count was not too full

1105
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:27,650
and then we would just say fill out

1106
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:32,379
exactly that piece so entity visible

1107
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:40,220
piece and then the pieces plus entity

1108
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:45,410
east count + + piece asset type ID

1109
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:53,959
that's a type ID at peace height equals

1110
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:56,659
height and peace color equals color so

1111
00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:00,528
that is all we need to do to add a piece

1112
00:56:56,659 --> 00:57:04,848
and in theory now also we probably can

1113
00:57:00,528 --> 00:57:07,179
render this right what is it it's not a

1114
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:07,180
member

1115
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:29,849
probably don't ed idea okay all right

1116
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:31,109
we're at the Q&amp;A but hey you can see

1117
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:33,420
that we've restored that functionality

1118
00:57:31,108 --> 00:57:35,730
so now we have trees and of course since

1119
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:40,588
we are now doing that it also means that

1120
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:43,619
if we wanted to write we can use the

1121
00:57:40,588 --> 00:57:47,219
world modes random series which I

1122
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:49,950
believe is in here right so we could use

1123
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:51,659
like effects entropy and I'm not really

1124
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:54,149
going to do this but you know you could

1125
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:57,929
imagine doing it right if we wanted the

1126
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:59,940
trees to have a random amount of red in

1127
00:57:57,929 --> 00:58:05,879
them right we could do random your

1128
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:07,500
lateral on the effects entropy and now

1129
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:14,720
every tree would be like a different

1130
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:14,719
color right at least they are or not I

1131
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:23,339
would have expected each tree to be a

1132
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:25,578
different color we are using that are we

1133
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:25,578
not

1134
00:58:28,059 --> 00:58:42,039
we might not be I think about it please

1135
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:43,659
can't now we are so we're passing the

1136
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:48,509
color here why are we not seeing that

1137
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:48,509
beat it oh because there's no red in it

1138
00:58:50,548 --> 00:58:58,469
yeah that's good point if there's no red

1139
00:58:54,579 --> 00:59:02,410
in the tree you won't see that so let's

1140
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:11,199
take that again and say a random amount

1141
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:22,058
of green in it that's probably a little

1142
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:25,059
bit more obvious oops yeah so um you

1143
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:27,699
know even just so you get some idea of

1144
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:29,739
what's going to happen there you can see

1145
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:31,420
why we might care about this just even

1146
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:33,130
right off the bat because we're going to

1147
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:34,688
want to have lots of different trees in

1148
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:37,959
the game but they don't have different

1149
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:40,088
entity types necessarily and so you know

1150
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:42,489
having the ability to just say like this

1151
00:59:40,088 --> 00:59:44,469
is what we're creating it in the here's

1152
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:46,329
how it behaves on what its stats are but

1153
00:59:44,469 --> 00:59:48,579
it's visible representation might be

1154
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:50,789
slightly varied just so that things look

1155
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:53,499
slightly different all the time right

1156
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:55,179
you can see why that might be important

1157
00:59:53,498 --> 00:59:56,649
and so there's a lot of things like that

1158
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:59,469
that we might want to do and this is

1159
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:03,880
just one step towards doing that and

1160
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:05,858
yeah so like I said just kind of a nice

1161
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,199
additional thing now I actually want to

1162
01:00:05,858 --> 01:00:12,389
do that right now but I just wanted to

1163
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:12,389
point out how that changes things

1164
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:28,858
alright let's go ahead and go to the QA

1165
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:30,449
uh that's funny it's like yeah it

1166
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:32,460
doesn't matter what the red channel is

1167
01:00:30,449 --> 01:00:35,460
on the trees there's literally no red in

1168
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,869
those trees so you can knock it all the

1169
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:40,190
way to zero and you're just removing

1170
01:00:36,869 --> 01:00:40,190
stuff that wasn't there

1171
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,039
any questions

1172
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:45,709
looks like Reno got no questions which

1173
01:01:36,289 --> 01:01:52,579
is okay if we don't have any questions

1174
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:56,329
then we will end the stream it's coming

1175
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:59,179
along pretty nicely I think there's only

1176
01:01:56,329 --> 01:02:00,769
one thing I'm slightly nervous about and

1177
01:01:59,179 --> 01:02:03,049
that is how we're going to do boundaries

1178
01:02:00,769 --> 01:02:07,570
of the simulation region everything else

1179
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:09,620
is pretty nice recently came across this

1180
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:11,980
read the abstract and tell me what you

1181
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:11,980
think

1182
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:22,579
programmer is hoping to achieve

1183
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:24,380
performance improvements often use

1184
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:26,090
custom memory allocators this in-depth

1185
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:27,680
study examines a top case to use custom

1186
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:28,460
allocators presently 46 SF because the

1187
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,969
state of the art general-purpose

1188
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:33,650
allocator the douglas allocator performs

1189
01:02:31,969 --> 01:02:35,000
as well or better than the custom

1190
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:36,590
allocators the two exceptions use

1191
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,840
regions which deliver higher performance

1192
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:42,680
proved us up to forty four percent well

1193
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:44,539
obviously I probably agree with the

1194
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:47,509
results because like handmade hero uses

1195
01:02:44,539 --> 01:02:48,679
regions regions also reduce / programmer

1196
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:51,470
burden and eliminate source of memory

1197
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:53,149
leaks exactly what I would say as well

1198
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:54,559
however we show that the inability of

1199
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,940
her mr. free individual obviously

1200
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,769
regions can lead to stantial increase in

1201
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:03,650
memory consumption that's generally true

1202
01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:05,358
if you you know depending on the type of

1203
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,980
application it is whereas this

1204
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:08,358
limitation precludes the use of regions

1205
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:09,980
for common programming idioms reducing

1206
01:03:08,358 --> 01:03:12,349
the usefulness that I don't know if I

1207
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:13,849
really agree with but ok for their

1208
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:15,920
generalization of general purpose in

1209
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:17,358
region based lectures we call reaps your

1210
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,980
star combination of regions and heaps

1211
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,389
providing a full range of region

1212
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:24,108
semantics with the addition of

1213
01:03:20,389 --> 01:03:25,699
individual object deletion we show that

1214
01:03:24,108 --> 01:03:27,349
our implementation of reaps provides

1215
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:29,239
high performance at performing other

1216
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:30,769
allocators of region like semantics we

1217
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:32,479
needa case study demonstrates the space

1218
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:33,889
advantages and software engineer

1219
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,389
benefits of reaps and practice our

1220
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:37,099
results in Kate the perimeters eating

1221
01:03:35,389 --> 01:03:38,269
fast region should use reaps and that

1222
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:43,368
most programmers Christian customers

1223
01:03:38,269 --> 01:03:44,869
should instead use the Lea allocator so

1224
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:47,920
I guess I'd have to read what their

1225
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:51,108
implementation of reaps quote-unquote is

1226
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:55,639
but for the most part I agree with the

1227
01:03:51,108 --> 01:03:57,469
abstract because in general like that is

1228
01:03:55,639 --> 01:04:00,049
why i use regions as well I find them to

1229
01:03:57,469 --> 01:04:01,519
be faster and less error prone than then

1230
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:04,519
allocating and freeing individual

1231
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:07,969
objects I find that I just use free

1232
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:10,280
lists when I need to recycle objects but

1233
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:13,009
certain applications that are not video

1234
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:15,980
games have more strenuous need to free

1235
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:18,020
things in that way and so it may be that

1236
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:20,150
they've done something interesting here

1237
01:04:18,019 --> 01:04:22,369
with how they do it or it may be that

1238
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:24,410
they're just doing something that's like

1239
01:04:22,369 --> 01:04:26,059
exactly what I would do or that is a

1240
01:04:24,409 --> 01:04:29,179
free list essentially and so I have to

1241
01:04:26,059 --> 01:04:31,650
like read to find out if it's something

1242
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:34,849
to talk about that second

1243
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,849
tournament does that help

1244
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:56,260
is there a limit to the colors you can

1245
01:04:50,619 --> 01:05:02,740
have uh well I guess that I'm not sure

1246
01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:08,800
what you mean by I'm not sure what you

1247
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:13,739
mean by limit there's not a limit to the

1248
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:13,740
colors you can have in terms of sending

1249
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:18,519
could you be more specific I guess is

1250
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:19,720
what I'd say because there's a number of

1251
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:21,400
ways I could answer that question and

1252
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:24,250
the answer is yes in some cases and no

1253
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,358
one in other cases and so I want to kind

1254
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,280
of understand what question you're

1255
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:29,079
trying to ask before I say things that

1256
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:34,000
may be further confusing maybe more

1257
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:36,730
confusing than than helpful long billion

1258
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,139
will you have to have an entity type at

1259
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:41,769
some level like when generating the

1260
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:46,059
world placing trees and whatnot I would

1261
01:05:41,769 --> 01:05:48,338
say that I don't know if we'll have an

1262
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:49,929
entity type per se but when we're

1263
01:05:48,338 --> 01:05:52,000
generating the world will definitely

1264
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:54,460
have ideas about what we're placing and

1265
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,050
that might come from a type but it may

1266
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:58,329
instead come from just the structure of

1267
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:59,920
the code right like this thing is going

1268
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:01,900
to go place trees and it calls the place

1269
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,639
tree routine which knows it's placing

1270
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:10,300
trees and so there was never may be a

1271
01:06:03,639 --> 01:06:12,789
need to have a phenom right um so I

1272
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:16,180
guess what I'd say about that is I don't

1273
01:06:12,789 --> 01:06:17,619
know whether we'll ever use those enums

1274
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:21,309
again we may delete them and then never

1275
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:22,780
come back or we could you know if they

1276
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:26,170
end up being something we do need to use

1277
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:27,760
in in the generator side then that's

1278
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:29,710
fine I don't mind them in the generator

1279
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,089
side right I just don't want them in the

1280
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:36,179
runtimes don't think they're the right

1281
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:36,179
level of control

1282
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:50,780
waiting for a clarification on that

1283
01:06:47,909 --> 01:06:52,889
limit to the number of colors question

1284
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:54,510
in the meantime I'm going to see if I

1285
01:06:52,889 --> 01:06:56,099
can quickly look at this reaped paper

1286
01:06:54,510 --> 01:07:01,340
and see if I see what what their

1287
01:06:56,099 --> 01:07:01,339
structure is for heaps

1288
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:25,469
oh wait um

1289
01:08:08,929 --> 01:08:14,759
so I guess what I would say is what

1290
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:16,738
they're describing in this paper does

1291
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:23,100
not sound all that different from how I

1292
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:24,599
structure things in like my code at work

1293
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,700
except for the fact that they seem to

1294
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:31,920
have added a lot more overhead than I

1295
01:08:26,699 --> 01:08:35,849
would then i think is warranted because

1296
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,649
i find that most of the time I feel like

1297
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:40,798
they were probably trying to target a

1298
01:08:37,649 --> 01:08:42,329
lot more oops key code than mine is and

1299
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:44,219
so they probably were trying to

1300
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:46,680
accelerate cases where people were doing

1301
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:48,710
a lot more malloc and free than I ever

1302
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:51,359
do in the course of a running program

1303
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:53,130
and so they were probably chasing after

1304
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,838
performance in areas where I just don't

1305
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,759
need it and so I feel like they add a

1306
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:58,350
lot of memory overhead here that I don't

1307
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:59,759
think is necessarily warranted now that

1308
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:01,529
said I haven't spent a lot of time

1309
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:05,460
optimizing memory performance in my code

1310
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:07,589
because it's almost never an issue so if

1311
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:09,600
someday I actually took some harder look

1312
01:09:07,588 --> 01:09:11,460
at that just because hey it'd be fun to

1313
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,430
try and get it more optimal just as an

1314
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:17,548
exercise I might have a little bit of a

1315
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:18,869
better idea as to whether i think that

1316
01:09:17,548 --> 01:09:22,789
level of overhead they're talking about

1317
01:09:18,869 --> 01:09:22,789
is warranted which I don't really know

1318
01:09:31,408 --> 01:09:38,259
okay so clarification was colors of the

1319
01:09:34,118 --> 01:09:39,578
trees the hero enemies etc again I

1320
01:09:38,259 --> 01:09:41,729
really just don't understand the

1321
01:09:39,578 --> 01:09:45,608
question like what do you mean to say is

1322
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:47,229
there a limited number of them do you

1323
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:49,599
mean does the game design have a limited

1324
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:54,458
number of colors the trees didn't heroes

1325
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:56,110
are supposed to be or i'm sorry i think

1326
01:09:54,458 --> 01:10:03,939
i'm missing like the sort of place

1327
01:09:56,109 --> 01:10:05,618
you're coming from ingeniero I've been a

1328
01:10:03,939 --> 01:10:07,359
little lost the last few days would you

1329
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:10,448
mind giving a brief recap of what you're

1330
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:13,779
trying to do to the entity system now uh

1331
01:10:10,448 --> 01:10:17,768
yeah so the the overall idea here is to

1332
01:10:13,779 --> 01:10:20,380
split out the parts the things that make

1333
01:10:17,769 --> 01:10:23,969
an entity actually appear on the screen

1334
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:28,208
and do stuff to split those out into

1335
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:33,969
reasonably separate elements that can be

1336
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:35,559
recombined very fluidly right and so

1337
01:10:33,969 --> 01:10:41,529
some things that I wanted to be able to

1338
01:10:35,559 --> 01:10:45,038
do for example I was say oh if I have

1339
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:46,420
like a hero head in a hero body I want

1340
01:10:45,038 --> 01:10:48,340
to be able to write some control code

1341
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:50,889
that can make the hero head and body

1342
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:52,958
move around but I don't want there to

1343
01:10:50,889 --> 01:10:54,940
have to be an understanding that heroes

1344
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:56,979
are always constructed of a head and a

1345
01:10:54,939 --> 01:10:59,078
body and furthermore I might want to be

1346
01:10:56,979 --> 01:11:01,530
able to like put different bodies on a

1347
01:10:59,078 --> 01:11:04,958
hero or you know do stuff like that

1348
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:06,698
dynamically without like having to sort

1349
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:08,439
of copy things between Andy I want to be

1350
01:11:06,698 --> 01:11:13,208
able to swap in a new piece and have it

1351
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:14,919
start working furthermore I'd like to be

1352
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:17,019
able to do things like cast a spell and

1353
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,609
make a hero behave a different way and

1354
01:11:17,019 --> 01:11:20,409
then later behave you know or whatever I

1355
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:22,799
want to sort of have a very rich way of

1356
01:11:20,408 --> 01:11:25,029
doing all that I don't want to have

1357
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,260
heroes always have to look the same way

1358
01:11:25,029 --> 01:11:27,578
I want to be able to have like different

1359
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:29,170
outfits on or stuff like that

1360
01:11:27,578 --> 01:11:32,288
potentially blah blah blah blah blah

1361
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:34,090
right and so the way that we implemented

1362
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,708
it in the beginning because we were just

1363
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:37,389
sort of getting things working and you

1364
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39,670
know we're coming back to revisit it now

1365
01:11:37,389 --> 01:11:41,618
and I'm trying to do the real version of

1366
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:43,158
everything the way the meat in the

1367
01:11:41,618 --> 01:11:45,018
beginning as we just said hey energies

1368
01:11:43,158 --> 01:11:46,518
a type and whatever the type is that's

1369
01:11:45,019 --> 01:11:48,650
what determines everything right and

1370
01:11:46,519 --> 01:11:49,639
that type there was basically just some

1371
01:11:48,649 --> 01:11:51,768
switch statements that were like

1372
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:53,418
whatever your type is that's what's

1373
01:11:51,769 --> 01:11:55,729
going to determine the code that we call

1374
01:11:53,418 --> 01:11:57,469
to control you it's what we're going to

1375
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:58,789
use to can determine how your rendered

1376
01:11:57,469 --> 01:12:00,260
it's what we're going to use to

1377
01:11:58,788 --> 01:12:03,228
determine how your physics operates

1378
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:05,780
right and so I'm just trying to get rid

1379
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:09,229
of all of that and say no there's just

1380
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:12,228
an entity and an entity has lots of

1381
01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:14,300
little pieces of information that sum up

1382
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:16,909
to reproduce all of that stuff that was

1383
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:20,059
previously hard-coded to an entity type

1384
01:12:16,908 --> 01:12:21,679
but now you can mix and match so if you

1385
01:12:20,059 --> 01:12:23,570
want something that's being controlled

1386
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:25,748
like a hero but that looks like a tree

1387
01:12:23,569 --> 01:12:28,578
and blah blah blah you can do that right

1388
01:12:25,748 --> 01:12:30,288
and be the reason I'm doing that is not

1389
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:32,149
because I think there's some inherent

1390
01:12:30,288 --> 01:12:33,800
important beauty in writing an entity

1391
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:36,168
system this way and if you have entity

1392
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:38,269
types then that's bad or something it's

1393
01:12:36,168 --> 01:12:42,578
more that this particular type of game

1394
01:12:38,269 --> 01:12:46,458
is sort of a generative sort of

1395
01:12:42,578 --> 01:12:48,889
exploration ille adventure a rogue kind

1396
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:51,349
of a thing and as you know from having

1397
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:53,868
played the good ones of those they're a

1398
01:12:51,349 --> 01:12:55,788
lot about having rich permutations and

1399
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:58,788
interactions between things and so I

1400
01:12:55,788 --> 01:13:01,340
really don't want to have hard edges in

1401
01:12:58,788 --> 01:13:03,050
that space where it's just like thing is

1402
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:05,269
either an A or a B I want like

1403
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:07,849
everything in between a and B to be fair

1404
01:13:05,269 --> 01:13:11,469
game and so that's sort of what we were

1405
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:11,469
trying to do there right

1406
01:13:23,988 --> 01:13:28,768
thoughts on avoiding denormalize

1407
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:34,859
floating point on console platforms do

1408
01:13:28,769 --> 01:13:40,679
they all have minus f fast math uh well

1409
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:41,969
uh so I guess what I would say is it

1410
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:44,819
depends on what you mean by console

1411
01:13:41,969 --> 01:13:49,559
platform but if what you mean is X bone

1412
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:52,139
in ps4 then an exponent a ps4 are x64 so

1413
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:54,090
they operate through the SSE unit for

1414
01:13:52,139 --> 01:13:56,609
doing math which means you can just not

1415
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:57,869
have D normals at all so don't really

1416
01:13:56,609 --> 01:14:00,029
have to avoid them they just won't

1417
01:13:57,868 --> 01:14:02,098
happen because you can always have the

1418
01:14:00,029 --> 01:14:06,929
SSE unit just never duty normals

1419
01:14:02,099 --> 01:14:10,469
handling to be honest I don't even know

1420
01:14:06,929 --> 01:14:14,550
if the SSE units on consoles do handle t

1421
01:14:10,469 --> 01:14:17,788
normals they may just always be normal

1422
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:23,550
to you normals go to zero I mean I've

1423
01:14:17,788 --> 01:14:27,149
never looked niche sir my apologies yes

1424
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:29,070
limits in the game design yeah so the

1425
01:14:27,149 --> 01:14:31,558
game design definitely will want to have

1426
01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:34,799
specific colors that mean certain things

1427
01:14:31,559 --> 01:14:37,079
obviously in various places but small

1428
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,248
variation in color will probably be

1429
01:14:37,078 --> 01:14:40,049
something that we would actually use

1430
01:14:38,248 --> 01:14:42,269
just to add a little more variety to

1431
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:43,860
things so we probably wouldn't limit

1432
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:46,909
that we would allow things to sort of

1433
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:46,908
have color variation

1434
01:15:01,368 --> 01:15:05,488
anonymous 519 can you explain the

1435
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:06,809
difference between how you manage memory

1436
01:15:05,488 --> 01:15:09,238
at work and how you're currently doing

1437
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:14,489
it in handmade hero uh not really

1438
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:15,779
because it's kind of a long story will

1439
01:15:14,488 --> 01:15:17,638
monsters and other things be able to

1440
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:19,019
attack each other like a witch

1441
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:23,190
accidentally shrinks a goblin or

1442
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:24,900
something yes probably to be honest I

1443
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:26,579
don't feel comfortable saying yes or no

1444
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:30,809
till we actually let it happen and see

1445
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:36,600
if it's too chaotic but I certainly

1446
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:38,190
would default to yes in that case would

1447
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:42,600
we do anything differently if we wanted

1448
01:15:38,189 --> 01:15:44,969
to have HDR capabilities in the game we

1449
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,760
would probably have to add a few values

1450
01:15:44,969 --> 01:15:52,770
in some places to allow colors to be

1451
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:54,980
more powerful than they currently are we

1452
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:57,360
could just say that colors can be set

1453
01:15:54,979 --> 01:16:00,059
more arbitrarily but typically you don't

1454
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:01,738
quite typically you might do things

1455
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:04,710
where you have like a power value and

1456
01:16:01,738 --> 01:16:06,509
then a color value so there's some

1457
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:08,069
things you might do but but not really

1458
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:10,800
no most of it would just be that the

1459
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:12,840
renderer would would be taking tone

1460
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,610
mapping would be doing tone mapping and

1461
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,789
taking that side of things more

1462
01:16:14,609 --> 01:16:16,789
seriously

1463
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:29,170
realest 01 can you answer our offended

1464
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:31,090
people would like to see your priest on

1465
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:33,908
YouTube I've answered that so many times

1466
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:34,960
by now but I'll answer it again the pre

1467
01:16:33,908 --> 01:16:39,698
streams are only for people who watch

1468
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:42,760
the string that's if you want free

1469
01:16:39,698 --> 01:16:47,609
streams you gotta watch the show they're

1470
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:47,610
they're not they're not for posterity

1471
01:16:54,329 --> 01:16:57,779
let's see

1472
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:14,828
now it was 519 the reason i ask is

1473
01:17:13,389 --> 01:17:16,750
because i really like the idea of

1474
01:17:14,828 --> 01:17:18,340
allocating upfront and managing all

1475
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:20,319
memory myself as in him a hero but i'm

1476
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:25,960
not sure if I'm just shooting myself in

1477
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:30,179
the foot by not using malloc and free so

1478
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:33,639
I guess what I would say about this is I

1479
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:39,789
you should be able to think this through

1480
01:17:33,639 --> 01:17:42,730
relatively straightforwardly right so in

1481
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:45,189
handmade hero you know that everywhere

1482
01:17:42,729 --> 01:17:47,529
that we're just doing a push and we

1483
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:49,149
don't have a free list there's no way

1484
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:51,069
you would ever want to use malloc and

1485
01:17:49,149 --> 01:17:53,170
free for that right because you never

1486
01:17:51,069 --> 01:17:54,429
it's never freed it just gets push push

1487
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:56,199
push push push push push push push push

1488
01:17:54,429 --> 01:17:57,880
push which is essentially an instant

1489
01:17:56,198 --> 01:18:00,158
operation that Malik can't even come

1490
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:02,920
close to being as fast as right because

1491
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:09,098
it doesn't do anything it just it's an

1492
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:11,440
ad right and then free just goes ok we

1493
01:18:09,099 --> 01:18:13,090
just reset the point so you know that

1494
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:14,979
anywhere that your stuff looks like that

1495
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:17,529
you would be crazy to use malloc and

1496
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:20,589
free because that is just clearly always

1497
01:18:17,529 --> 01:18:23,920
a win once you start having a free list

1498
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:26,889
so now you don't know right and I should

1499
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,569
add one caveat there typically what you

1500
01:18:26,889 --> 01:18:31,150
would do in a more general purpose

1501
01:18:28,569 --> 01:18:32,889
scheme is you don't allocate everything

1502
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:35,679
up front you just allocate when you

1503
01:18:32,889 --> 01:18:36,940
overflow so you just push push push push

1504
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:38,319
push push if you're about to go over the

1505
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:41,259
end you just get a new block and keep

1506
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:45,250
pushing right so that you don't use more

1507
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:47,199
memory than you need right so that's

1508
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:49,630
what you would do in the case where you

1509
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:51,939
have a free list it should be relatively

1510
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:53,789
easy for you to think through in the

1511
01:18:51,939 --> 01:18:56,439
places where you have a free list is

1512
01:18:53,789 --> 01:18:58,179
this faster with Malkin free or is it

1513
01:18:56,439 --> 01:19:00,638
faster doing the free list approach and

1514
01:18:58,179 --> 01:19:03,460
you know what don't hurt yourself

1515
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:05,319
thinking about it just do an f0 just put

1516
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:07,599
an ifdef in there make it so that you

1517
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:10,319
can call Malkin free or your free list

1518
01:19:07,599 --> 01:19:14,380
version and see which one's faster

1519
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:16,029
that's it right you won't have that many

1520
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:17,828
free lists in a program it's not that

1521
01:19:16,029 --> 01:19:18,368
hard to test you could even make a

1522
01:19:17,828 --> 01:19:20,558
central

1523
01:19:18,368 --> 01:19:22,478
thing part of your alligator could just

1524
01:19:20,559 --> 01:19:27,159
build in that switch and then just turn

1525
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:29,199
it on and off done deal right it's

1526
01:19:27,158 --> 01:19:32,378
always free to switch back to malloc and

1527
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:34,538
free right the only thing that's hard is

1528
01:19:32,378 --> 01:19:37,179
if you're counting on that region free

1529
01:19:34,538 --> 01:19:38,559
and I don't know how you really solve

1530
01:19:37,179 --> 01:19:40,239
that problem if you're counting on the

1531
01:19:38,559 --> 01:19:41,409
region free switching to Malik free as a

1532
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:43,478
little hard cuz you don't clean up but

1533
01:19:41,408 --> 01:19:44,679
you can still at least test it and then

1534
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:46,119
you don't get the freeing so you can't

1535
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:47,378
really run the thing indefinitely but

1536
01:19:46,118 --> 01:19:49,148
you could at least test it to see if you

1537
01:19:47,378 --> 01:19:51,158
got a performance win there and then if

1538
01:19:49,149 --> 01:19:52,479
you did get a performance with malloc

1539
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:54,219
and free that you thought was important

1540
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:55,809
you could then go back no okay how do I

1541
01:19:54,219 --> 01:19:58,948
deal with the fact that I've got it like

1542
01:19:55,809 --> 01:19:58,949
free this stuff manually now

1543
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:19,630
alright

1544
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:38,480
all right i am going to wrap it up all

1545
01:20:35,809 --> 01:20:39,409
right thanks everyone for joining me for

1546
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:40,729
another episode of Hamming here it's

1547
01:20:39,408 --> 01:20:43,429
been a pleasure coding with you as

1548
01:20:40,729 --> 01:20:47,328
always if you want to follow along at

1549
01:20:43,429 --> 01:20:49,069
home you can always peer to the game on

1550
01:20:47,328 --> 01:20:51,710
handmade hero org and it comes to source

1551
01:20:49,069 --> 01:20:54,649
code so you can do whatever it is that

1552
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:57,800
we're going to do so you can play around

1553
01:20:54,649 --> 01:21:01,969
with it basically and see if you you

1554
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:03,739
know anything that you want to try and

1555
01:21:01,969 --> 01:21:05,779
it kind of helps learn along with the

1556
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:07,308
series we have a forum site you can go

1557
01:21:05,779 --> 01:21:08,719
to ask questions we have a patreon page

1558
01:21:07,309 --> 01:21:11,449
you can go if you want support the video

1559
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:13,368
series we have a schedule bot that

1560
01:21:11,448 --> 01:21:14,629
tweets schedule when I remember to

1561
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:16,069
upload the schedule which I didn't do

1562
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:18,380
this weekend so I apologize for that

1563
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:20,328
it's a I did upload it yesterday so now

1564
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:21,739
it's correct and of course we got this

1565
01:21:20,328 --> 01:21:23,779
little countdown timer here that tells

1566
01:21:21,738 --> 01:21:27,198
you as well and then we have a past

1567
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:28,340
episode guide which you can use fun to

1568
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:30,529
catch up on old episodes it's pretty

1569
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:31,969
cool and our very own did blow has made

1570
01:21:30,529 --> 01:21:33,500
it so that it's got all kinds of time

1571
01:21:31,969 --> 01:21:35,000
links in it so you can jump around and

1572
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:37,270
like go where did-- case you talk about

1573
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:41,448
this thing or whatever it's pretty cool

1574
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:43,489
that's about it until tomorrow at five

1575
01:21:41,448 --> 01:21:46,879
p.m. pacific daylight time when i will

1576
01:21:43,488 --> 01:21:48,948
be probably finishing that sort of

1577
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,109
moving the rendering out to a more to

1578
01:21:48,948 --> 01:21:55,339
that sort of peace based creation time

1579
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:56,899
system until then have fun programming

1580
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:59,559
and i will see you guys on the internet

1581
01:21:56,899 --> 01:21:59,558
take it easy everyone
