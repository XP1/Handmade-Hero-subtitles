00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:06,389
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,379
hero this is the show where we code a

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:12,660
complete game live on stream I don't

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,109
really remember what I said I was gonna

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,289
do on Monday again yesterday was off but

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,560
I believe I believe what we were going

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,600
to do was start to sort of develop a

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,448
little bit more of the meta game

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,699
structure of handmade hero now handmade

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,349
hero is designed and this is just again

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,309
my own personal preference I am not a

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,960
game designer so handmade hero is mostly

13
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:40,738
designed by just putting in the things

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,950
that I prefer when I play a game and

15
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:45,328
trying to figure out things that can go

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,190
in the design that will force us to

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,020
tackle interesting programming problems

18
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,329
and show you how to do professional

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,530
quality programming so I'm not trying to

20
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,808
say that this is the correct way design

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,549
a game or anything like that but the way

22
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,250
that I prefer games is to have very very

23
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:03,419
little mini game I tend to like a game

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,609
to get right into it and I like as much

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,650
of the experience as possible to take

26
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,049
place in the game not in a series of

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,820
menus and so the more menus and stuff

28
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,520
that pop up in a game or the more

29
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:18,739
frontmatter there is in a game the less

30
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:21,329
pleased I typically am with that so

31
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:23,640
handmade hero is not designed to have

32
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,060
very much meta game but it needs at

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,069
least two pieces of metal game I think

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,579
in order to sort of have the field that

35
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:35,158
I would like it to have and that is that

36
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:37,978
when you boot the game I would like

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,259
there to be some way of playing an intro

38
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:43,920
sequence and the reason for that is I

39
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,200
would like there to be a sort of just a

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,450
little bit of context to the experience

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,579
and since handmade hero is very much a

42
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,840
direct action II kind of game I don't

43
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:55,139
really feel like that context should

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,909
come as minoo sort of embedded in the

45
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,070
game because the game should have a very

46
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,920
quick flow to it it shouldn't have a lot

47
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:04,459
of interstitial elements to the game and

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,368
so I would just like that to to take a

49
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:10,500
more traditional old-school approach to

50
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:12,509
it where there's just some kind of like

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,889
an attract mode where if you have not

52
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:15,539
indicated to the game that you

53
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,309
would like to start playing yet it will

54
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,599
show you a little bit of a story and so

55
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,550
that's why we implanted those cutscenes

56
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,459
those are kind of what I imagined be the

57
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,860
attract mode so I'd like to have the the

58
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,599
metagame consists primarily of just once

59
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,980
you start the game you are watching the

60
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,739
story and the story will just kind of

61
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:32,609
loop until you decide to begin the game

62
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,590
proper and when you begin the game

63
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,900
copper you will be placed into the game

64
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,400
experience and you will play and I don't

65
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,930
want to have a lot of other stuff so I

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,300
don't want to have a lot of things like

67
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,060
pick a save slot I don't want to have a

68
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,040
bunch of stuff like tune the options do

69
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,439
you want music like I don't want any of

70
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,799
that I just want it to be right and you

71
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:55,579
start and you play and the absolute

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,290
minimum amount of stuff should happen

73
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,410
otherwise there shouldn't be anything

74
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:02,909
else in there right and so right down to

75
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,370
the part where like if there were gonna

76
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,109
be options of some kind in the game I

77
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,250
would want you to basically hop the

78
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:14,310
character around to set them rather than

79
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,050
having something that pops up that's a

80
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,689
different experience I got like a menu

81
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,079
experience so that's kind of what I'm

82
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,939
thinking

83
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,920
and so really they'll only be two

84
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,109
primary modes to the game there's the

85
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,199
attract mode and then there's the game

86
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:31,739
mode but even just implementing that

87
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:33,899
that basic idea still requires you to

88
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,340
tackle essentially the entire meta game

89
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,849
problem which is to say that the game

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,209
has to understand that it can be in more

91
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:45,449
than one mode right and creating a more

92
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,340
complex meta game is really no different

93
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,679
it just means there are more modes right

94
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,819
there are more things that can happen

95
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,819
more variety like a broader variety of

96
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:58,579
interactive sort of vertical slices of

97
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,289
your game where it's gonna be like okay

98
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:02,969
here's the game one here's the option

99
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:05,449
menu here's the save game selection

100
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:08,129
there's this that the other thing right

101
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:09,949
and so you the programming is basically

102
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:13,680
the same as what we're gonna do here

103
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:15,268
there's just more of it and since I

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,400
don't like those things I'm not going to

105
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,569
do them I'm gonna skip those and we're

106
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,189
going to try to put everything that we

107
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:23,579
can into the actual game experience as

108
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:25,500
much as possible and if we find that we

109
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,930
need some kind of options or some kind

110
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,199
of other things like that we'll put them

111
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,840
that into the game as much as we can all

112
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:36,020
right so let's go ahead and and see

113
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,310
where we left off this is day 226 so if

114
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:40,519
you pre-ordered the game on handmade

115
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,978
hero org day 225 is really the one that

116
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,508
you want to go with you want to unpack

117
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:47,319
that source code and that way you'll be

118
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,470
in the same state that I am today and

119
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,930
oops

120
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,880
Enix I wonder if that's a good editor I

121
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,449
don't know what Enix is that sounds

122
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:59,029
wonderful so if I compile here I just

123
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:02,720
get myself set up let's go ahead and

124
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:04,579
start this guy the last thing that we

125
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,410
sort of did the last feature we did was

126
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,159
sort of the fade in and out oh and that

127
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,979
reminds me

128
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,900
looking at this another thing that we

129
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:14,449
never really knew was why our fade

130
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:15,978
appears to be highly nonlinear right

131
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:19,160
that was another thing that was kind of

132
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:21,079
a little bit confusing when we when we

133
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,169
tackled it right it didn't quite seem

134
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,879
right and it made me wonder do we have

135
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:28,189
some kind of a weird bug in the system

136
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,519
where we're not treating our colors as

137
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:33,139
gamma corrected properly you know or

138
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,959
something like this I don't really know

139
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:39,439
but the point is simply that there does

140
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:42,168
seem to be something that's that's not

141
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,908
happening correctly right so that fade

142
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:45,259
was also think I don't know that we want

143
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:47,060
to look at that now it's kind of off

144
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:50,689
topic but it's definitely something that

145
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,939
we should look into eventually so so

146
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:54,620
yeah so where we left things was this

147
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:57,740
this will play and then if I actually

148
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,939
start the game you know it does exactly

149
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,408
what you would think so I hit the

150
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:03,050
spacebar and you can kind of see that

151
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:05,538
you know I end up with my my hero again

152
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,699
and we're in there and I can also hit if

153
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:10,069
I want to I can hit escape and come out

154
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:11,810
and we're back to the the cutscene again

155
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,120
and if I had space I go back in right

156
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,408
but you can see that and of course

157
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,848
creates a new player in a lot stuff so

158
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,740
we didn't we don't even have that that

159
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:20,719
part of stuff working either right we

160
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,400
didn't do any of this stuff but

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,139
primarily the first thing that I want

162
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:28,609
tackle is just that notion that when I

163
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:30,439
return back here and now I'm in this

164
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,419
this mode where I'm watching the

165
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:34,759
cutscene what I want to do is when I

166
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:36,079
return to attract mode it should kind of

167
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,538
be aware of the fact that I have

168
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,699
returned to track mode to attract mode

169
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:42,829
it shouldn't just go back to where

170
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,389
we left off in the cutscene that's not

171
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,250
what I wanted to have happen I would

172
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:48,680
want to go back to like the main a track

173
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,079
screen and then do some kind of thing

174
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,629
where it started the cutscene all over

175
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:56,599
again regardless of where you exited and

176
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:58,969
so in order to do that I need to have

177
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,970
some way of understanding when a mode

178
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,410
transition has occurred and so that's

179
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,760
what we're gonna have to deal with now

180
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,020
I'm just gonna wait till Krampus comes

181
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,949
in because I like it when Krampus comes

182
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:16,000
in there he is

183
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:16,000
hello Krampus alright so let's go ahead

184
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:28,099
a little bit dry

185
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,439
I forgot my drink that's never a good

186
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,990
thing when I forget my drink alright so

187
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,540
let's take a look at where we are if you

188
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,860
remember we sort of had the notion of

189
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,240
the cutscene here we're inside the the

190
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,170
this state right here of the the game

191
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:48,710
state we created a plain cutscene and

192
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:50,350
the plain cutscene controls this code

193
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:53,209
that we did that plays cutscenes

194
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:55,550
so that if you initialize one and you

195
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:57,259
tell it what you want to do you can then

196
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,780
update it as frequently as you want and

197
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:03,289
it'll continue playing cutscene so we

198
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:05,709
did that that all works fine but all we

199
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,840
did for switching between the cutscene

200
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:13,310
and the game is we literally just check

201
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:16,819
to see whether any of the witty heroes

202
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:19,370
existed in the game that's it like

203
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:22,639
there's nothing else that we've done and

204
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,530
so what that means is again when a hero

205
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,079
gets created or when a hero gets

206
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,699
destroyed if the number of Heroes goes

207
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,349
down to zero then suddenly we'll be back

208
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,720
in the cutscene if the number of Heroes

209
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,940
goes above 0 to 1 then suddenly be in

210
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,830
the game but the game itself is never

211
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,280
explicitly aware of that transition

212
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,830
right we have no idea when we transition

213
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,720
from being in the state of having heroes

214
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,750
and playing the game and back that you

215
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,730
know or in the state of not having any

216
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:54,080
heroes and watching the cutscene and we

217
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:56,539
need to know what that actually you know

218
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,759
we have to have a way of detecting that

219
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:00,289
transition because if we don't detect

220
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,210
and respond to that transition we will

221
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:05,750
never know when we need to reset our

222
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,190
cutscene yes and so that's the part that

223
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,110
we need to make a little more formal

224
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,540
here and so that's the part that I'm

225
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:15,289
going to try to start formalizing as we

226
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:17,899
move forward okay so what I'd like to do

227
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:20,149
is say well you know maybe we've got

228
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,799
that handmade cutscene thing so maybe

229
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:24,049
what I really need to say is well you've

230
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:25,729
got handmade of track mode so I'm just

231
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:28,189
gonna consider there to be a handmade

232
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,960
attract mode right and we kind of know

233
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:34,910
what handmade a track mode is it's this

234
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,650
right it's this right here and I could I

235
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,909
suppose if I wanted to you know I guess

236
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,889
now I think about it there might not be

237
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:42,230
very much in that file I don't really

238
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:44,090
know so maybe we could sort of keep it

239
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,889
simpler and say that you know maybe that

240
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:49,009
just goes here in in handmade cut seeing

241
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:50,629
that H I'm not sure right so we could

242
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:52,850
say like okay you know maybe there's

243
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:57,889
just a thing that's like you know it's a

244
00:09:52,850 --> 00:10:00,230
tracked mode or whatever in in a tracked

245
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:02,330
mode or a track mode State it might be

246
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,279
the the best way to say it in a track

247
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,379
mode State we bundle up the sorts of

248
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,559
things that actually that we you know

249
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:12,169
need in order to play the attract mode

250
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:15,649
so there's one right we've got the the

251
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:17,959
cutscene that there might be there and

252
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:20,809
we also probably have something like if

253
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,960
we wanted a main menu and then um a menu

254
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:26,269
but so weird I'm looking for whatever

255
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,620
you want a title screen let's say so if

256
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,850
we you know we've got the cutscene that

257
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,529
place if we just want to think that's

258
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,600
like you know ham a hero

259
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,009
press Start to begin or press keyboard

260
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,259
or whatever you know if we want to that

261
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:38,539
screen that just sits there for about

262
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:41,750
you know 10 seconds or something and

263
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:43,669
then the cutscene starts playing if we

264
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,740
want something like that to happen so

265
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:49,250
it's more a little bit more like in

266
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,320
arcade game or if we'd rather have it to

267
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,240
start the cutscene right away play the

268
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,040
whole cutscene then go to that that

269
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,009
title screen then start the cutscene

270
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:00,230
again any any sort of setup like that

271
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:02,000
then we need is some notion of which of

272
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,300
those we were in right we would need

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,669
sort of like a sort of States there

274
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:09,559
right

275
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:11,029
okay so you could imagine doing that one

276
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,739
of two ways when I could have like

277
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,720
something cure that's like you know a

278
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,680
title screen like a boolean and I said

279
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,080
it and that's whether I'm playing the

280
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,739
cutscene or not or whatever but my

281
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,440
assumption is that whatever mode

282
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,810
handling we do for handling the fact

283
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,550
that we're either in the attract mode or

284
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:31,279
in the game mode we could presumably

285
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:32,719
just use that same mode handling to

286
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,970
handle the difference between the title

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,639
screen the cutscene and the game all

288
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,500
three of them right so what I'm assuming

289
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,769
we would do is we'd say something like

290
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,769
this which is like game mode and we just

291
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:50,059
say okay there's game mode title screen

292
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:55,129
there's game mode cutscene and there's

293
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:58,269
game mode playing or something right for

294
00:11:55,129 --> 00:12:01,340
world right where I'm off in the world

295
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,710
something like this and there might even

296
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,820
be yet another one I'm not sure

297
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,680
depending on how we want to do that

298
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,290
which is that there might be like a

299
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:11,439
world game mode and a sort of like

300
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:13,969
options game mode we're like you know

301
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,340
let's say for example we want to support

302
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,840
multiple save slots you could imagine

303
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,490
like when you start the game you

304
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,410
actually start off like in the orphanage

305
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,169
and there's different like rooms and

306
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:25,909
each room is a different save game so

307
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:29,449
you hop into the room that you want to

308
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:31,519
play at that time you know that's again

309
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,759
sort of its it's like a menu right it's

310
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,889
just a menu created in the game and so

311
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,539
that you know depending on how we might

312
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,279
want to do it that could also be a

313
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:41,870
different game mode I don't know it

314
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,839
might still be the world game mode but

315
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,460
I'm not sure so that's just something to

316
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,920
think about just something to keep in

317
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,570
mind but let's say for now that we only

318
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,849
have the three that I already know that

319
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:56,450
we want so that we can work with those

320
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,850
instead so if I wanted to do that then

321
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:02,240
what I'd say is all right we've got our

322
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,340
game mode and this is a you know

323
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,629
whatever it is this is the mode right

324
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:10,790
here and then what I would have to do is

325
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:14,269
I'd have to have some way of of having

326
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:16,039
you know different storage for different

327
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:19,259
game modes or different stuff like this

328
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:22,110
right so I'd have to have some way of

329
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:26,309
of creating basically like holding

330
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,810
holding place for these things and so

331
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:29,849
what I'd like to point out here is that

332
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:32,729
each of these things that we're talking

333
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,490
about each of them kind of wants to have

334
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:38,450
its own storage and most of them or

335
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:41,970
perhaps even all of them but regardless

336
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,680
will get like shut down sort of

337
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,350
altogether so in other words when I'm

338
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,459
playing in a particular game world you

339
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,840
know it's gonna do whatever it's gonna

340
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,580
do and it's gonna have all that storage

341
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,910
when I'm done with that all of that

342
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,200
storage is just gonna go away right and

343
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:56,459
the same is true of like the tunnel

344
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,890
scene of the cutscene or whatever when I

345
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,210
start it up it's gonna do some stuff to

346
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,460
like make that happen but then when I

347
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:06,000
shut it back down again you know it's

348
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:09,960
not it's not gonna need to retain

349
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,639
anything right and so that to me also

350
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,960
suggests that I'm gonna have some kind

351
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:19,620
of a sort of like I'm gonna have some

352
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,180
kind of a blind point to read kind of

353
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,379
thing here right so I'm gonna do

354
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:24,269
something where I saw the card I've got

355
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,399
a game mode and whatever the game mode

356
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:28,740
is is gonna kind of determine what I'm

357
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,850
doing and then inside you know in

358
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,379
addition to that I need to store

359
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,690
something that tells me what's going on

360
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:35,460
so maybe I have something like okay I've

361
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,560
got the attract mode state and this is

362
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:40,560
the attract mode or whatever and then

363
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,139
I'd have the the like the world's state

364
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,579
and that would be here and we have stuff

365
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,519
like that already like we have like

366
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,110
worlds to our world here right and that

367
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,230
would be something for example that

368
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,600
would you know might become sort of the

369
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,399
state of the world now I'm not gonna try

370
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,560
and pre guess that I'm just gonna

371
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,299
continue from from this basic premise

372
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,369
I'm gonna start pulling things out and

373
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,409
just see where it leads but you can kind

374
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,759
of get you get the idea right you kind

375
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:11,909
of can start to see where I'm going that

376
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:13,919
all right now I don't really care too

377
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:16,799
much about this being an allocation

378
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,360
style thing so what I really could do

379
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,949
too is just say that we always actually

380
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,320
have a tracker but I'm gonna do it as an

381
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,030
allocation style just in case it's a

382
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,190
large thing they can get flushed

383
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,500
completely and so we can kind of see how

384
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,200
that goes what we want to do with that

385
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,389
right all right so let's slowly start to

386
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,759
piece that looked at

387
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,340
use this apart let's slowly start to see

388
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,169
what we can do with that so I'm gonna

389
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,670
say that inside this I'm gonna have two

390
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:42,379
different kinds of things I'm gonna have

391
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:44,479
something that looks like this right I'm

392
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:49,159
gonna have internal ooh I don't know why

393
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,200
is that do we know why that was oh right

394
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:53,769
it's handmade here oh the active line

395
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,300
shows blue for some reason I forgot that

396
00:15:53,769 --> 00:16:00,259
but that's I think how it's supposed to

397
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:01,309
work yeah it's weird that I didn't think

398
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,899
that was supposed to happen it's been

399
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:05,149
happening also had never struck me as

400
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:07,399
odd on 11 million previous dreams for

401
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:10,699
some reason just then it did don't ask

402
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,079
me don't know why all right but yeah

403
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,550
that's supposed to happen right that's

404
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,830
how we do it on handmade here we've been

405
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:21,559
doing it that way for for a year rains

406
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:25,730
getting old anyway so I'm gonna do an

407
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:31,509
update and render title screen you know

408
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,509
and I'm gonna do an update and render

409
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,279
cutscene and so then I can just kind of

410
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:43,129
put this in here so it's like okay

411
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:45,470
that's what that is right and yeah I'm

412
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:47,120
gonna replace this guy with a switch on

413
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,389
that game mode so instead of just

414
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,620
looking at this exactly well we'll see

415
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:55,610
we're gonna leave this here for a minute

416
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,090
what I'm gonna do instead is I'm gonna

417
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,580
switch on whatever our game state says

418
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:03,019
the game mode is right so we've got this

419
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,220
guy cure this game mode and then we've

420
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:06,859
got we know that it could be these

421
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:13,630
things and so I'm gonna say okay here's

422
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:13,629
the title screen here's the cutscene

423
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,049
here's the world so there's three

424
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:19,400
different modes we could be in and of

425
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:22,039
course we also have I don't know if we

426
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,810
ever did an invalid default case do we

427
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,069
ever do that one I kind of like this one

428
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,909
I never remember whether we did it on

429
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,960
one hand meter or not see invalid code

430
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,140
path yeah we did

431
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,819
I like invalid default case because we

432
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,580
that game mode should always be set to

433
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:39,859
something valid hopefully and the other

434
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:42,679
thing we can do here is also if we want

435
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:45,949
we can set it to something like game

436
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,900
mode you know uninitialized or none

437
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,910
which is like by default when we start

438
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,380
up we've got no game mode we could all

439
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,730
say this like that I don't know that we

440
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,930
really need to do that at the moment so

441
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,730
I'm going to leave that out but you know

442
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,060
sometimes it's good to have a zero value

443
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,519
that's like kind of the amounted set

444
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:03,409
alright so in here we kind of already

445
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,910
know what this is going to be we're

446
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,860
gonna call whenever we're in the

447
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,220
cutscene mode we're gonna call you know

448
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:11,959
update and render cutscene we know in

449
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,799
worlds we're gonna do update and render

450
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,600
game and I suppose this this could maybe

451
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:23,960
more properly be called update and

452
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:25,730
render world and finally in the title

453
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,569
screen we've got update and render title

454
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:32,960
screen which is just something that will

455
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:34,339
create at some point I know that I want

456
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,110
a little title screen there so I know

457
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:38,329
we're gonna have one up at the moment

458
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:40,250
that really actually gonna do anything

459
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:41,629
it'll just probably be a blank screen or

460
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:47,079
who knows what'll be we'll figure out

461
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:51,310
something something okay so there oops

462
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:54,819
tried to cut and paste I failed

463
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:59,359
okay so let's try this

464
00:18:54,819 --> 00:19:00,740
there we go and so when I call update

465
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,379
and render title screen I'm gonna get

466
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,660
this these sort of things here now the

467
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,550
problem with this is I probably want to

468
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,500
have a way of passing these guys just

469
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:12,799
about everything that there is to to

470
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,420
have well you know I don't really have

471
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,619
to I guess because since I'm using a

472
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,080
switch statement never mind it doesn't

473
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:22,309
really matter so this would be fine so

474
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:24,529
yeah if I want to have this well I

475
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:25,819
really need to do is make sure that I

476
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:28,700
pass it all the things that I know that

477
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:32,809
I need which is really just these these

478
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,279
things write these things and I need to

479
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:36,049
know a couple different things that we

480
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:40,129
didn't actually have like I need to know

481
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:42,200
the DT and probably honestly a men need

482
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:45,050
more than just the DT I'm probably

483
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,850
actually also going to need the whole

484
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:49,609
input I feel like it's gonna have to

485
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:52,819
respond to input so it's probably going

486
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:55,729
to be something that takes that directly

487
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:58,159
and then for advanced cut seeing this

488
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,538
thing where we're and also for here

489
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,808
where we get that current cut

490
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:06,288
see I think again I want that to refer

491
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:09,618
to this attract mode state right or

492
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:11,749
something like that probably I don't

493
00:20:09,618 --> 00:20:13,608
really know maybe maybe I don't even

494
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:15,919
need that I don't know we'll see

495
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:17,628
but point being yet and here I think

496
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,720
what we would do is expect there to be

497
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:22,488
some kind of a wrapped up storage that

498
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,440
would be used for these guys I'm not

499
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,850
sure exactly what it would be but it

500
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,759
looks to me like we've already kind of

501
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:30,769
done it right here we're so you know

502
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:35,989
this might be like something like

503
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:38,149
game-mode cutscene right and and it sort

504
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:40,579
of has this information in it I think

505
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:42,768
that might be a little bit more logical

506
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:49,819
with the way that I would want this to

507
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:53,720
work right okay so let's see so we've

508
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:56,269
got game-mode attract doing something

509
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,190
like that game Oh cutscene and game-mode

510
00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:02,598
worlds something like this those are the

511
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,200
three things that I've got right now and

512
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:08,358
so yeah once I call into one of those

513
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,069
guys look I do update and render world

514
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:12,558
right it only makes sense that it's

515
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:13,939
gonna get a pointer to one of those now

516
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,489
if this doesn't actually exist yet but

517
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,169
these two should so I've got game of

518
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:20,210
cutscene and I've got game mode attract

519
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:22,309
we don't really know what the attract

520
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,808
mode has in it at the moment so I'll

521
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:25,489
just stick a team in there or something

522
00:21:23,808 --> 00:21:26,950
so that it's got something but we'll

523
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:29,028
play with that a little bit more later

524
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,919
and then we've got the cutscene which of

525
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:34,339
course is this guy and that one already

526
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:35,960
does kind of exist as well alright so if

527
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:37,548
I want to do this where we're gonna do

528
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,139
make it for cutscene I'm gonna do this a

529
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:41,690
little bit differently now I'm gonna I'm

530
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:44,628
gonna change a little bit how I would do

531
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,820
this right and I'm gonna say that the

532
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:48,648
maybe the outside the the code outside

533
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:50,089
is going to sort of give me an arena or

534
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:52,398
something to work with something like

535
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:53,720
that right and what I'm gonna do is I'm

536
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:56,928
gonna say that this arena

537
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,848
whatever the arena is is gonna get

538
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:01,548
passed in here so it's basically in a

539
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:03,348
say hey I need you to like make the

540
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:04,940
intro cutscene or whatever I want you to

541
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:07,339
destroy your state in this particular

542
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,109
arena and so off it goes right it's

543
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:11,749
gonna do whatever it needs to do for

544
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:13,339
that so this would just be like okay I'm

545
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:15,680
gonna do a push struct I'm

546
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:18,619
Syrena for playing cutscene I'll get one

547
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,310
back I set it up and then I returned it

548
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:25,429
and that's how I initialize the cutscene

549
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:27,529
right so if I did something like that

550
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,820
then I would also have something that

551
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,899
like sonic cutscene but I don't really

552
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,789
need to show anything down because I

553
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,410
know that the person outside can just

554
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:35,059
jettison the arena and everything's fine

555
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,560
so for now I'm just gonna assume that

556
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,940
Moe's don't need to be shutdown they can

557
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,639
just be jettisoned because that's

558
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,920
generally probably what I will end up

559
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,960
doing most of the time all right so if I

560
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:50,330
make an intro cutscene like that that

561
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:52,190
sort of allows me to store the cutscene

562
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:54,699
information and then updating it is a

563
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:59,170
simple matter of passing that back right

564
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,170
so something that looks like this

565
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,099
that's the entirety of what we currently

566
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,279
need to do but we're gonna probably move

567
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:12,469
a little bit more code in there in the

568
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,639
future we'll find out but that's

569
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,809
basically what's going to happen we're

570
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,270
going to be doing the plain cutscene

571
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:19,159
there and update the render title screen

572
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:21,379
would be you know something similar I'm

573
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,670
not sure but that's gonna have in it and

574
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:27,680
it's not a plain cutscene where it's a

575
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:30,080
game mode cutscene go to cutscene and we

576
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,390
do render cutscene a time this is gonna

577
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:37,909
take a game mode cutscene as well I

578
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:39,259
believe right yeah and so we'll see that

579
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:43,519
might be a little too tight but we'll

580
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:45,049
see now we probably could say you know

581
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,639
this advance is not particularly

582
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,680
interesting so we probably could just do

583
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,960
something where we just do that right

584
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,549
and the render is not very interesting

585
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,950
either so we probably could just do this

586
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:57,250
these are probably things that can just

587
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,930
be handled like that without

588
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,220
overcomplicating things so I might just

589
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,279
do it like that there's not gonna be

590
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,110
more than one cutscene playing at once

591
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,490
presumably so we don't really need to

592
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,689
overcomplicate it but if there was gonna

593
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,839
be then you could kind of you could

594
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:14,870
imagine right that sort of thing having

595
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:17,389
happening okay so let's see here where

596
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:19,839
we're at we've got our game mode

597
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,840
cutscene

598
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:30,839
Rena's supposed to be pointer and isn't

599
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:34,538
which is bad and that seems like that's

600
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:38,888
fine spelling wise is challenging better

601
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:41,558
than that seems fine there we go all

602
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:45,428
right and so that's all that's all

603
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:46,720
pretty good so once we've got that then

604
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:49,419
we just have this title screen guy to

605
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,479
work with an Abbe game mode title screen

606
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:56,528
which we don't have anyway lets's title

607
00:24:52,479 --> 00:25:02,558
screen where the cursor just went so

608
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:06,848
game mode title screen and that seems

609
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:08,918
reasonable to me okay so that's all good

610
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:10,989
now we just need to get those guys into

611
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:12,940
somewhere where they can be seen game

612
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:15,278
mode attracting game mode cutscene now

613
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,139
the problem with that is they should be

614
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,950
in here already so I'm wondering why

615
00:25:17,138 --> 00:25:25,199
they weren't I'm not 100% sure game the

616
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:33,819
cutscene those should be in there right

617
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:36,788
game it off as a trap yeah current

618
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:39,220
cutscenes make intro cutscene so now all

619
00:25:36,788 --> 00:25:42,009
we have to do is actually sort of

620
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:46,358
formalize the notion of switching into

621
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:48,940
game modes right okay so how am I gonna

622
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:50,408
do that well first what I have to do is

623
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,840
start to pull out all of the

624
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:55,119
initialization code into something that

625
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:56,829
will allow me to like understand what

626
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:59,528
mode I'm going into and actually do

627
00:25:56,829 --> 00:26:00,999
something about it right and so if you

628
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:02,589
think about it like all this code right

629
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:03,700
here it's like for simulating the game

630
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:04,839
and doing a lot sort of stuff then we

631
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,159
have all this startup code that's in

632
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,959
there that just initializes the world

633
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,309
not stuff we don't actually want that

634
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,019
all that happened when we start up the

635
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:12,190
game we don't want to create a game

636
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,298
world when we start off the game because

637
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,679
no one's playing the game yet and

638
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:16,989
furthermore we might have to do that

639
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,788
again sometime if the person like exits

640
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:20,229
that game and restarts a new one right

641
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:21,220
like maybe they exit that world they

642
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:22,840
didn't want to do that world so they

643
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,970
exit and come back in or who knows what

644
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,259
happens right so what I'm going to do is

645
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,210
I've introduced another function that

646
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:29,409
just allows me to change what game mode

647
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,269
I'm in and that function will be

648
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:33,489
responsible for initializing whatever

649
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:36,778
the game mode is so I'm gonna do

650
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:36,778
something like set game mode

651
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:43,000
and set game-mode will be something

652
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:46,839
which just kind of you know allows me to

653
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,369
to say I'm going to do this this other

654
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,439
thing you know whatever whatever the

655
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:54,729
mode I pass is is what I want it to be

656
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:58,509
right so I'll pass like game state and

657
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,769
I'll pass game mode and it will set

658
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,230
those right so basically do you like

659
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:05,679
game state game mode equals game mode

660
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:10,179
that's what it's gonna do something like

661
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:12,130
that so how's that gonna work well first

662
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:14,649
it has to clear out whatever the

663
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,690
previous mode was right so if I have

664
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:17,768
whatever the arena is I'm gonna just

665
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,778
reuse the same arena although in the

666
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,370
future I may actually ping-pong them for

667
00:27:19,778 --> 00:27:23,740
reasons we'll see a little bit further

668
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:25,268
down the line but for now let's just

669
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,819
start with the with the simpler approach

670
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,500
you can see it what I'd like to do first

671
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:31,898
to say all right so there's gonna be

672
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,638
like a ton arena and instead of a world

673
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:35,739
arena I'm actually gonna call that

674
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:38,709
something else I'm gonna say that that's

675
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:41,169
basically the mode arena right I'm gonna

676
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,788
say the arena that's that's being used

677
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:43,330
for allocation here is actually the mode

678
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:45,129
arena

679
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:49,298
that's where everything is gonna come

680
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:52,450
from right and so what I want to do is

681
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:54,579
say well the game state mode arena is

682
00:27:52,450 --> 00:28:00,220
gonna get cleared and I don't know if we

683
00:27:54,579 --> 00:28:04,298
have a clear for our arenas do we we

684
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,278
don't not that I see anyway yeah I don't

685
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:09,339
see it so I'm gonna introduce one here

686
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,960
which is just clear and this is no

687
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:12,428
different than if we just did a begin

688
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,899
temporary memory and then end temporary

689
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,980
memory but I'm I don't want to call it

690
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:17,138
temporary memory because it's not really

691
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,028
that temperate temporary it's pretty

692
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:21,579
much permanent up until the point where

693
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:22,898
we decide to clear it right so it's it's

694
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:24,460
it's semantically a little bit

695
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:26,168
differently and I'd rather not mix those

696
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,548
two so I want to have a way of clearing

697
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:29,139
it and clearing it's pretty

698
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:32,168
straightforward if you look at what

699
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:33,849
constitutes an arena for for our

700
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:37,330
purposes here there's really not much in

701
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:39,548
it right and so the if we initialize an

702
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:41,859
arena for example you can see what

703
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:44,679
actually happens here clearing an arena

704
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:46,778
for all intensive purposes is is just

705
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,580
going to initialize it that's all it

706
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:52,009
does so if I were to say okay just

707
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:53,720
real reinitialize the arena but

708
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,879
reinitialize it with its own base planar

709
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,350
again that would just clear it out it'd

710
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,120
be like all of the allocations never

711
00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:01,369
happened right and we could just

712
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,869
allocate again to our hearts content so

713
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:04,909
what I'm gonna say is all right clear

714
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:10,119
the mode arena that's all gone then

715
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:13,509
switch on the game mode that we pick

716
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:16,849
whatever that is and based on what it is

717
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:20,390
construct a new thingy whatever the

718
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:22,069
thingy is and so we already know what

719
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:30,320
those three things could be at the time

720
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:35,899
right there the title screen cutscene in

721
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:38,869
the world but as you can sort of see

722
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:43,850
from this you know we we sort of don't

723
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:47,869
we don't quite know right exactly which

724
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:50,359
of these things we don't know what we

725
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:54,349
might need to pass right because imagine

726
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:57,019
for example you know in make this little

727
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:58,909
explicit imagine in here right when we

728
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:00,950
do make intro cutscene or whatever let's

729
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:04,400
suppose there was more than one cutscene

730
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:06,440
we might want to play well this set game

731
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,170
mode if you were happening to pass

732
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,259
cutscene to it you wouldn't have to

733
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,310
actually pass which cutscene you wanted

734
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:15,170
but that would be a parameter that

735
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:16,609
wouldn't get used if you're doing say

736
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,170
the title screen and so you'd end up

737
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:20,209
with set game mode would be taking like

738
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:22,070
all these parameters all is basically

739
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,259
the union of all the parameters for all

740
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:25,849
the different game modes and that's not

741
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:27,319
particularly good right that gets

742
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:28,969
unwieldy pretty quickly and not really

743
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:33,470
something we want to have to deal with

744
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:36,740
so what we would rather do it's

745
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,660
something like begin game mode or

746
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,549
something like this where we're just

747
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,019
gonna say and I guess you know we we

748
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:44,149
could even still Klotz that game mode

749
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:46,160
but instead of doing a switch right here

750
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,710
instead what we'll do is we'll let the

751
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,810
person who is actually trying to do it

752
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,970
whatever they were gonna do set up

753
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:55,700
whatever that dependent state actually

754
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,140
is so we won't bother doing anything

755
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,680
other than just saying we'll clear out

756
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:03,050
the old mode and off we go

757
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,750
that seems a little more sane to me

758
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:08,000
okay so if we wanted to do that then all

759
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,759
we have to do is make it so that when

760
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,380
you try to do something like one of

761
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:15,379
these things where you play something so

762
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:18,080
for example play intro cutscene might be

763
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,450
the more sensible thing to do here what

764
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,819
we'd say is okay that's gonna be like a

765
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:28,940
set game mode call that's that game mode

766
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:31,970
call is going to why is that yeah that

767
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:38,299
set game mode call is going to take the

768
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:39,259
game state and I'm sorry the play trick

769
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:41,269
cutscenes gonna take the game state

770
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:44,299
we're gonna call set game mode on the

771
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:48,009
game state with the the state of playing

772
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:53,769
cutscene right whatever that is and I

773
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:56,359
know it's here somewhere there it is

774
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:58,099
right so that's gonna clear anything

775
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,199
that was happening before changes to

776
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:02,329
this mode which is the cutscene mode and

777
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,279
then what we're gonna do is we're going

778
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:06,889
to actually create that game mode

779
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:12,190
cutscene ourselves and so then we would

780
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:15,890
just say oh the game state cutscene

781
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:18,490
right this guy equals whatever we just

782
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,480
made you don't have to return anything

783
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:23,180
because that's just going to do it and

784
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,420
so that would consume changing a mode

785
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:33,410
similarly in here if we were to say okay

786
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:40,029
play title screen we'd say okay game

787
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:40,029
state same thing

788
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:46,910
literally we just do okay so title

789
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:50,140
screen game mode cutscene is actually

790
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:53,509
now gonna be game of title screen and

791
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:56,630
then we would set something in here but

792
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:59,298
we don't have anything to set really at

793
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:03,830
all but you know I don't know we have T

794
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:06,500
right result T equals zero this one why

795
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:08,829
is there no result T equals zero here I

796
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,779
don't know that seems like a bug to me

797
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:14,230
but anyway so then we have a result T

798
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:18,379
equals zero then we have game state

799
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:20,210
title screen equals result and now we

800
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,679
can play the intro cutscene or the title

801
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:27,048
screen and both will work right okay

802
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,450
so let's step through now and and fix we

803
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:31,879
change that arena situation let's step

804
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:36,350
through that this our initialize arena

805
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,030
initialize arena needs to be fixed so

806
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:41,209
that's just we gotta pass the size as

807
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:43,428
well there we go so now I'm here like

808
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,669
doing the World Arena what we actually

809
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:47,840
want to do there for things like andsome

810
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:49,700
probably what we would really want is

811
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:53,209
for this to no longer be actually

812
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,740
looking at the game state much that's

813
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,900
just kind of what we would rather it do

814
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,190
we kind of don't want game state to

815
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,650
really be there that's really we would

816
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:04,640
just want it to be world right and if we

817
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:07,610
look at what's what's in handmade world

818
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,470
H you know this thing right here this

819
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:12,259
world is probably actually the thing

820
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:16,099
that should be holding most of those

821
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,290
other things that we've got currently

822
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,329
sitting in the game state now I don't

823
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:22,759
know that we actually want to do too

824
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:24,049
much of that yet but you can kind of see

825
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,720
where that's going like that's what we

826
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,879
would prefer to have happen I think

827
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,858
because the game state should be sort of

828
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,719
like the overall structure that can hold

829
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:35,509
multiple different game modes that are

830
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,009
happening in it and so again I'm not

831
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,929
really sure we want to do there but

832
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,030
that's a mutation we probably want to

833
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:42,200
make so we'll look at that but I don't

834
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,210
want to do that quite yet I'm gonna

835
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,239
leave that a little bit more outside of

836
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:49,309
of what's going on here and so for the

837
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,049
moment what I might do is say anywhere

838
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:53,148
that we were using World Arena cuz let's

839
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,250
take a look I don't think we're using it

840
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:56,598
often I mean it's it's used often but

841
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,179
not that often you know you can see

842
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,730
there's just a few what I might do is

843
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:04,429
try to push that over so that the world

844
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,778
arena actually is in here right so there

845
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:10,699
really is a thing that's like rolled

846
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:12,199
arena and so instead it's going to be

847
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:15,469
something like well all right we've got

848
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:18,288
the world right so the world comes from

849
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:20,868
gamestate world we've got the world and

850
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:25,130
I want you to always use this world

851
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:27,289
arena instead right something a little

852
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,568
bit more like that I think that's gonna

853
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:31,869
be saner we'll see how it goes as we go

854
00:35:29,568 --> 00:35:31,869
forward

855
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:45,798
oops let's go ahead in the place game

856
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:48,890
state world world so that should be fine

857
00:35:45,798 --> 00:35:50,900
okay so step game mode is something that

858
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:53,358
we would like to have exposed a little

859
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,250
more broadly right now that's sort of

860
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,288
buried in here about I'd like to do is

861
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,528
say hey anyone can call that if you

862
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:02,390
would like so let's put that up there

863
00:35:59,528 --> 00:36:05,048
all right and so here when we've got

864
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:08,118
arena this is gonna be the game state

865
00:36:05,048 --> 00:36:10,670
mode arena so those things are all going

866
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,079
to come out like all the modes and all

867
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,230
that stuff is just going to come out of

868
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,230
there

869
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:21,259
so then I'm here with the world arena

870
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:22,880
stuff again this is just like ad lo

871
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:26,869
entity that's just stuff I would like to

872
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,519
see that come out of a specific sort of

873
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:30,439
arena that's in the world just again

874
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:32,748
it's preparation of kind of moving these

875
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:35,088
things into groups where we sort of have

876
00:36:32,748 --> 00:36:37,518
a concrete notion of what part of it is

877
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:41,989
like world based stuff and what part of

878
00:36:37,518 --> 00:36:44,478
it is not you know what part of his

879
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:46,309
other things like the title screen and

880
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:49,879
again this may seem like overkill and

881
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:50,959
for our game it may honestly be but

882
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,809
again I kind of watch out do this

883
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:55,938
because a lot of games have a lot more

884
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:57,949
meta state than handmade hero does and

885
00:36:55,938 --> 00:36:59,268
so I just want to show how to piece it

886
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,729
out into something relatively clean

887
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:04,578
because whatever game you might want to

888
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:07,458
make may have a lot more option menus a

889
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:09,380
lot more whatever I don't know what but

890
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:14,268
it might have a lot more whatever that

891
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:22,039
is so let's do play intro cutscene get

892
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:24,258
that going there alright so update and

893
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:29,659
render title screen this is going to

894
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:32,778
take all this stuff presumably and I

895
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:39,648
would assume well I don't really know

896
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:40,969
what it takes let's find out so update

897
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:48,888
and render title screen is going to take

898
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:53,079
the assets at the render group the draw

899
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:53,079
buffer and the title screen

900
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:01,500
update and render cutscene I think takes

901
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:03,319
subsequently the same stuff although I

902
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,789
think it also takes the input group and

903
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,250
it probably isn't gonna take title

904
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:10,380
screen it's gonna take the cutscene and

905
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:13,440
let's go ahead and I don't know why I

906
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:17,269
can never capitalize cutscene properly I

907
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,269
seem to be really bad at it

908
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:32,969
yeah gonna render cutscene and there we

909
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:33,470
go check arena mode arena and then we're

910
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:35,369
good to go

911
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:38,730
alright so now there's a couple things

912
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:40,880
that we haven't done yet obviously one

913
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:43,740
of which is when we create that world

914
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,740
here we now when we whenever we

915
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:50,459
initialize the worlds we need some way

916
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:52,439
of of putting that arena in there so now

917
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,179
when you do this and you do initialize

918
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,630
world you're gonna have to pass a memory

919
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:59,399
arena that's the arena that you want it

920
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,390
to actually use for its allocations

921
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,880
right

922
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:10,469
and so in here where we do World Arena

923
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:13,500
like we were doing it before and we do

924
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:15,899
this this sort of thing right we

925
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,039
actually need that to sort of happen we

926
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,990
need that to happen

927
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:23,880
in the bin here you know so in order to

928
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:27,839
do this what I'd like to do is kind of

929
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,369
move that in here and and say okay and

930
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,170
and you know what I could when we do

931
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,940
this I could make it so that I just look

932
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,730
and games it directly but I'm not again

933
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,829
not really capturing this code right now

934
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:39,119
I'm just gonna I'm gonna do a little bit

935
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:41,579
differently so anyway when I do

936
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,889
initialize arena to initialize this this

937
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,809
arena what I want to do is just use I

938
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:47,699
think all the rest of the memory after

939
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:48,809
you know what's you it when you go to

940
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,859
initialize the world it's supposed to

941
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:50,849
use all the rest of the memory or

942
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,150
something like that

943
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:57,000
I don't really know right but something

944
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:59,369
like that and so if I want to do that

945
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,989
what I want to do is I'm gonna get sort

946
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:02,519
of a parent arena I'm gonna get a thing

947
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:05,429
that's like I'm going to go in here

948
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:07,349
where whatever the here is and what I

949
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:07,739
want to do is I want to say hey however

950
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:12,150
much

951
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:14,549
is left which I think we have right do

952
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:16,530
we have that get arena size remaining

953
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:18,180
right what I want to do is say when we

954
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:20,550
initialize the world I want to just get

955
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:22,289
whatever there is so I'm going to get

956
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:26,070
the ring size or remaining of the parent

957
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:27,989
arena and that's actually what I want

958
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,390
and that's isn't that sub arena we

959
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:32,489
already have that yeah we have that so

960
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:35,519
it's like sub arena this is the arena I

961
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:38,669
want to initialize this is the arena

962
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:41,099
that I'm coming from I want to get I

963
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:44,849
want to use however much there is and

964
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:47,429
that's all something like that so that's

965
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:49,909
what I want to do and so then what I

966
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:54,000
would do in here inside handmade tubes

967
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:59,239
and made STP what I would do in here is

968
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,519
when we actually do do initialize arena

969
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:06,689
this guy can now initialize the mode

970
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:08,909
arena and we can move forward with it so

971
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,710
then when we look at all this stuff we

972
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:12,358
could see like World Chunkin meters and

973
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:15,510
all that sort of stuff that is really

974
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:17,759
just this this is all part of the world

975
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:20,640
thing right this is this is this looks

976
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:24,090
like this right so we've got all this

977
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:25,710
sort of stuff happening here yeah we'd

978
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,510
want to take the this world stuff we

979
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:31,920
want to initialize and here we want to

980
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:33,780
pass it that that mode arena so if you

981
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,059
look at what all this stuff does all of

982
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,910
this stuff is just for initializing the

983
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:41,159
world right every last thing in here has

984
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:43,339
nothing to do with paying a cutscene at

985
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:45,569
all it's all just initializing the world

986
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,220
so again what I'm going to do is I'm

987
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,750
going to just like we did update and

988
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:50,399
render world I'm gonna do a thing here

989
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,969
where we do like initialize world or

990
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,900
something

991
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:56,429
right something like that or or play

992
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,440
world I don't know what we'll call these

993
00:41:56,429 --> 00:42:00,358
things but what I want to do is have it

994
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,889
so that all that stuff actually happens

995
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:04,889
in one of these as well just like

996
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:06,929
exactly analogous to what I did in the

997
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,460
cutscene thing so right here where I

998
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:11,039
pulled those things apart I'm gonna pull

999
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,650
them apart again just exactly the way I

1000
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,289
did before and play world will do

1001
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:19,260
exactly what play intro cutscene does

1002
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:21,050
create a world that you can play and set

1003
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,650
the mode to be playing that world

1004
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:27,140
okay so initialize arena and there's

1005
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,760
audio state these are all in fact I

1006
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:33,460
guess even this stuff here all this

1007
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:35,780
stuff is really just all of this stuff

1008
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,150
it's really just part of that world

1009
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,490
creation right every every last little

1010
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:44,510
thing in here right all of this all of

1011
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:47,089
it everything all the right down to play

1012
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:49,880
cutscene right so I'm gonna pull that

1013
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:51,260
out and I'm gonna put that up sort of

1014
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,670
isolated into a thing where what its

1015
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,550
gonna be like okay this is how we play a

1016
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,710
world there you go

1017
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:00,530
and then we're gonna deal with it

1018
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,119
separately that's gonna be a separate

1019
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,410
thing

1020
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,730
okay so let's I'm not gonna deal with

1021
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:07,909
that quite yet

1022
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:12,079
what is this ground buffer this ground

1023
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:14,210
buffer width okay these guys know what

1024
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:21,130
those are doing there exactly there

1025
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:25,119
probably for allocation purposes hmm I

1026
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:27,140
guess ground but I don't even know I

1027
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,460
know what I want to do with that I

1028
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:33,139
suppose they were used in both places

1029
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:39,460
I'm gonna do a little to do here get

1030
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:39,460
these into a more reasonable location

1031
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:48,590
but I'm just gonna go ahead and find

1032
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:52,250
that for now so I don't care about that

1033
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:55,309
at all at the moment okay so when we do

1034
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:58,280
initialize world I think this is all

1035
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:59,809
good there we go so now I think we're

1036
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,880
totally good and we've got that sort of

1037
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:04,219
play world thing happening so let's just

1038
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,980
start by seeing where we're at here is

1039
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:09,559
running the game we fade out we fade

1040
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,030
into the cutscene obviously that's what

1041
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:12,049
we expect cuz we set up we said we

1042
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,060
called play cutscene in our

1043
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,990
initialization and that's exactly what

1044
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:19,099
we're seeing

1045
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:21,309
pressing the oops I do not know what

1046
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:21,309
just happened

1047
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:27,870
I literally have no idea ah

1048
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,600
so gonna say pressing the button is

1049
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:32,279
gonna run code for the world stuff it's

1050
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,019
not quite gonna do that it's gonna look

1051
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,730
in through here and it's gonna start

1052
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:38,429
trying to do stuff that it can't really

1053
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:40,380
do right because the world has not been

1054
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:42,869
initialized or anything like that so all

1055
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,300
of this stuff here like that that tries

1056
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:48,630
to create a new hero and stuff that is

1057
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:51,090
not actually what we would want right

1058
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:54,780
that's not none of that stuff is is

1059
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:56,100
actually able to sort of occur because

1060
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,840
we haven't actually created a world

1061
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:59,880
right

1062
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,280
but the cutscene part is working fine

1063
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,720
and that's what we would expect so now

1064
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,840
we need to do is kind of make that world

1065
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:09,209
stuff happen a little bit better a

1066
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:11,460
little bit more straightforwardly and so

1067
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,349
what I want to do there is I want to

1068
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,909
kind of figure out how there's some

1069
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:17,279
things that will probably be persistent

1070
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:21,269
in the game state for example we

1071
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:24,269
probably want something like our who is

1072
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:28,289
joined in the actual game like who's

1073
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:30,719
what what heroes are actually can who

1074
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:33,300
signed in basically like who's involved

1075
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,589
in the game that is probably persistent

1076
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,740
so I suspect

1077
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:39,990
oops that controlled hero this kind of

1078
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:42,839
thing here I suspect that that is

1079
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:46,439
actually going to want to be in the in

1080
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:49,079
the actual game state itself but

1081
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,289
everything else probably wants to move

1082
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,849
into the game the game-mode world

1083
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:56,670
basically whatever you want to call that

1084
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:59,460
and I'm not sure again where we want to

1085
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:02,039
really put that it's a little bit

1086
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,840
confusing because world already sort of

1087
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:05,579
meant this sort of storage thing that we

1088
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,260
had here but I'm just going to probably

1089
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:08,519
start to just dump stuff in there and if

1090
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,170
we need to split that file into two

1091
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,119
later we can do that later

1092
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:17,039
that's not really my concern at the

1093
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:18,269
moment right all right so let's go ahead

1094
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,070
and see what happens here if we just

1095
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:21,719
have this thing called world I'm gonna

1096
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:24,330
see what happens if I just start dumping

1097
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:27,269
stuff in there so let's say I take world

1098
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:29,969
here and I make that show up over here

1099
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:31,650
for now and I don't know that I really

1100
00:46:29,969 --> 00:46:33,659
need game-mode world but maybe I'll do

1101
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,550
it that way so this game-mode world and

1102
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:38,519
soak down fear this also like you

1103
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:40,380
gamemode world and then i'm it's gonna

1104
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:42,030
pull out all of the stuff because all of

1105
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:46,680
it only really pertains to a particular

1106
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:49,290
world right so all of this stuff is all

1107
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:52,259
that yeah like every it looks like every

1108
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:54,599
last bit of this right that's all gonna

1109
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,970
come out here and that's all gonna be

1110
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:58,079
part of the game-mode world you know

1111
00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:00,989
what I mean

1112
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,090
and so in here we've got all that stuff

1113
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:04,289
and there's obviously an active world

1114
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,700
that is kind of being played at that

1115
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:07,710
time maybe there'll be other more than

1116
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:09,480
one world struct for all when we know at

1117
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,039
certain times when you're playing I'm

1118
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,079
not sure but point being that's what

1119
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,639
that'll look like and now you can kind

1120
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,159
of see exactly how this is starting to

1121
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,659
shape take shape now we've got a meta

1122
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:20,549
arena and a mode arena I don't know what

1123
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:23,369
the meta arena is to be honest I've

1124
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:27,090
completely forgotten does that what does

1125
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:32,250
that do I don't know I'm getting rid of

1126
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:34,440
it who calls it I guess this was a bad

1127
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:37,320
time to get rid of it well we'll leave

1128
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:41,070
it out till someone complaints anyway so

1129
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,660
if we go ahead and start to I guess

1130
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,950
start to clean some of this stuff up so

1131
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:46,069
that this stuff works

1132
00:47:43,949 --> 00:47:48,269
I gotta go ahead and figure out how to

1133
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:50,670
make sure that everyone is defined

1134
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:51,840
properly I don't remember what happens

1135
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,639
it's low entity it looks like that's

1136
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,680
just defined right in here for some

1137
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:57,869
reason and so it was like pairwise

1138
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,659
collision rule all of these things that

1139
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:02,969
are related to that are all in here and

1140
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:05,190
so is like particle cell and and

1141
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:06,750
particle and all these guys and so what

1142
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,570
I'd like to do is I'll go ahead and move

1143
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:16,789
those for now into where they now more

1144
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:16,789
appropriately belong which is in here

1145
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:23,010
but probably will split that will want

1146
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:26,429
to split that up even more in the future

1147
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:27,600
so let's see in can made a CH we now

1148
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:31,319
have also the problem where like a

1149
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,389
simonetti for example is is gonna be in

1150
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,030
handmade sim right

1151
00:48:33,389 --> 00:48:39,989
I assume that's where we put it's been a

1152
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:41,940
long time but I bassoon so and here we

1153
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:44,339
go there cemento t but I'm assuming that

1154
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,710
we also probably refer to world things

1155
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,480
here like for example we probably refer

1156
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,289
to world positions that you can see

1157
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,610
right there

1158
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:51,989
when we're talking about sim region so

1159
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:53,640
we kind of have a problem where we've

1160
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:55,379
just got too many things that depend on

1161
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,150
each other and of course sea forces us

1162
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,220
to deal with this which is a really

1163
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,780
annoying aspect of it because there's

1164
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:01,769
absolutely no reason we should have to

1165
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,980
manage this sort of stuff

1166
00:49:01,769 --> 00:49:07,050
but unfortunately we kind of do and so

1167
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:10,349
we have sort of a for a declaration

1168
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:12,780
conflict there where we have to define

1169
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:15,630
semana T and I don't really want to move

1170
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,160
sin and I don't really want to move some

1171
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:18,780
entity I really don't want to move any

1172
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:21,029
of this stuff so that's kind of annoying

1173
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:27,200
but what I could do is I could put low

1174
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:29,340
entity in a slightly different position

1175
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,899
could I do that well you know what I

1176
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:33,240
could do I could just make world

1177
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,680
position be in here for a minute which

1178
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:36,329
is not where I want it but you can see

1179
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:38,069
this is again like I said it's just

1180
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:42,420
really annoying it's just a really

1181
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:43,920
really annoying aspect of of programming

1182
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,260
in a language that doesn't understand

1183
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,470
that files should have nothing to do

1184
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:52,320
with dependency it's just stupid but you

1185
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:55,019
know that's that's you code you go to

1186
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,220
two handmade here with the language you

1187
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:59,670
have nothing language you'd like to have

1188
00:49:56,219 --> 00:50:01,079
so anyway if I go ahead and do that then

1189
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,460
I just need to switch the order in which

1190
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:04,409
these two things happen

1191
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,670
we just do it like that and presumably

1192
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:12,299
we'd be fine and yeah and so that would

1193
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,170
be it world's got to come second and sim

1194
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,880
region comes first

1195
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:17,519
oops I switched the wrong ones there I

1196
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,320
meant to do the H files sorry about that

1197
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,360
this is what I actually wanted to do

1198
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,910
world dot H some region dot H I just

1199
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,890
want to do that and then we should be

1200
00:50:23,909 --> 00:50:27,989
hopefully a little bit better world

1201
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,369
chunks the same way so you can kind of

1202
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:31,079
see like I got to move the things that

1203
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:33,000
our primal here and that's just really

1204
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:35,579
annoying so I don't know maybe we can do

1205
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,849
something a little bit more with that

1206
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:41,159
wait okay here is the compromise here's

1207
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:46,440
what I'll do this is less bad I'm just

1208
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:51,299
gonna make a handmade you know world

1209
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,769
mode dot cpp NH which I don't love but

1210
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,030
that would just allow us to get out of

1211
00:50:52,769 --> 00:50:58,409
the business of having these in the same

1212
00:50:54,030 --> 00:51:01,110
file right there we go problem solved in

1213
00:50:58,409 --> 00:51:02,239
not a very saver way but that's just the

1214
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:05,780
way the

1215
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:09,289
voules all right so then if I go back to

1216
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:11,300
handmade H then we can just do okay

1217
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:15,759
world comes first sim region comes

1218
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:21,800
second and world mode comes last

1219
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:24,140
same thing with here world mode actually

1220
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,490
that probably wants to go way down at

1221
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:32,750
the bottom probably something like that

1222
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:34,609
okay so test a few sand tests normal I

1223
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,800
probably those were a little overzealous

1224
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,119
that's probably those are just test

1225
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,100
things so those can probably stay in

1226
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:42,380
here for the time being until they just

1227
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:43,279
get removed entirely and so that'll be

1228
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:47,360
fine

1229
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:51,310
random series definitely should be there

1230
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:52,760
so don't know where that's not they're

1231
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:54,789
random

1232
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,990
should probably just be at the top

1233
00:51:54,789 --> 00:52:02,269
that's definitely a math e sort of a

1234
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:04,579
thing so that's fine audio state again

1235
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:06,469
audio state totally should not have been

1236
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:09,079
moved that was just again a little bit

1237
00:52:06,469 --> 00:52:12,709
overzealous these two guys should

1238
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:14,960
probably be for the time being still off

1239
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:17,240
in handmade H because we really haven't

1240
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,320
formalized something like what sound

1241
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:21,489
just playing or anything like that

1242
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:24,019
so that should be kind of left for later

1243
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:25,579
all right so now let's see what's going

1244
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:26,719
on we got to pour it all this code I

1245
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:28,219
probably shouldn't have done this with

1246
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:29,269
so little time left in the stream but

1247
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:32,559
you know you got to do what you got to

1248
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:35,719
do and so we'll see what we can do

1249
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:37,219
alright so get low entity is now gonna

1250
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,929
be something that's called on the on the

1251
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:40,429
world mode and so all of these things

1252
00:52:38,929 --> 00:52:41,809
are gonna force this to kind of go

1253
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:43,250
through a really annoying process of

1254
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:45,980
just kind of moving through server but

1255
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:48,679
again it's not really a big deal it's

1256
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:50,329
it's just a little bit it's it's just a

1257
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:51,319
little bit of pain that you got to go

1258
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:53,420
through sometimes when you want to make

1259
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,430
a large change but it's really just it's

1260
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,659
just a minor annoyance it shouldn't be

1261
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:58,549
really something to worry about too much

1262
00:52:56,659 --> 00:53:00,949
and not like something I worry about

1263
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,720
very much either a lot of times people

1264
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:04,069
will do coding things to try to prevent

1265
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:06,649
themselves from having to do some of

1266
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:08,600
these things and I I just don't think

1267
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,710
that's a very good idea I prefer to just

1268
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:11,630
go through this kind of cleaning up

1269
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:13,250
every now and again and and partitioning

1270
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:15,170
and you just kind of bite the bullet for

1271
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,039
those that limited amount of time yet to

1272
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,570
do that that

1273
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:19,369
usually much better than trying to do

1274
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:21,080
extra layers of insulation and stuff

1275
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:23,029
that make your code a lot worse than

1276
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:24,829
uglier just for the sake of not having

1277
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:26,350
to go through an hour of of this kind of

1278
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:28,699
thing or something like that right so

1279
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:33,049
anyway let's go ahead and put this in

1280
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:40,579
here so get low empty state this is just

1281
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:43,010
going to be game-mode world no call that

1282
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:46,130
rolled mode or something like that and

1283
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:53,120
that's just going to do game state world

1284
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:55,400
mode guess not sure what else we could

1285
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,799
call that I don't really know they're

1286
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,030
not great names I admit that but what

1287
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,470
I'm gonna do

1288
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,570
alright and so then all of these things

1289
00:54:00,469 --> 00:54:04,219
presumably like entity reference all

1290
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:06,019
that sort of stuff all of these things

1291
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:08,299
actually are not really using the game

1292
00:54:06,019 --> 00:54:10,670
state anymore they're all gonna use

1293
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:14,000
actually that game mode world pretty

1294
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:16,190
much exclusively right there's not gonna

1295
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,869
really be much game state stuff

1296
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:20,090
happening anymore

1297
00:54:17,869 --> 00:54:22,779
so I think I may be able to just blank

1298
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:26,870
it say at the game state game state

1299
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:29,210
that's just gonna be game mode worlds to

1300
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:34,009
our world mode I think I can pretty much

1301
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:35,329
just say that across the board and so

1302
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:37,100
furthermore I think I could probably say

1303
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:41,659
that like game state is just always

1304
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:47,389
world mode I think and we'll find out

1305
00:54:41,659 --> 00:54:50,059
but that's what I think will be true and

1306
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:52,549
it does look like that's very likely so

1307
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:54,259
add collision rule again so now these

1308
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:56,330
guys we've got to kind of get those

1309
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:58,280
pulled out a little bit more so we've

1310
00:54:56,329 --> 00:55:00,889
got add collision rule and actually a

1311
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:04,430
lot of these things in game game world

1312
00:55:00,889 --> 00:55:06,679
mode right a lot of these things are

1313
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:08,750
probably going to go in here so I'm just

1314
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:11,000
gonna grab them out in fact you can kind

1315
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:14,269
of see a lot of them right now look at

1316
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,630
all these guys these are all really none

1317
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:21,619
of this stuff none of this stuff is

1318
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:23,930
actually generic it's all part of it's

1319
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:28,130
all part of that so this is all going in

1320
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:29,509
there and then we've got ground chunks

1321
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,039
those are not

1322
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:36,168
related to that so that's all good this

1323
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:41,569
is all fine that can stay but okay this

1324
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:45,588
all this stuff that out here all this

1325
00:55:41,568 --> 00:55:47,688
stuff is is again comes into the new

1326
00:55:45,588 --> 00:55:52,639
file as well this is all stuff that has

1327
00:55:47,688 --> 00:55:54,438
to do with the game world okay all that

1328
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:57,519
goes there and then that should be just

1329
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:59,838
about it okay

1330
00:55:57,518 --> 00:56:03,558
so let's keep going we've got add

1331
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:06,798
collision rule there that's gonna be on

1332
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:08,630
the game on the world mode to add

1333
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:09,679
collision rule and I guess this is the

1334
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:11,358
same thing is gonna happen here

1335
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:13,338
basically everywhere we would have had

1336
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:23,989
game state game State it's gonna be game

1337
00:56:13,338 --> 00:56:26,298
mode world mode and all the rest of

1338
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:28,958
these guys game state are going to be

1339
00:56:26,298 --> 00:56:28,958
will note as well

1340
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:48,130
there's a lot of them folks there are a

1341
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:51,608
lot of them it would seem if you ask me

1342
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:54,970
but that's fine yeah that's just way it

1343
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,858
goes sometimes look at all of these my

1344
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:59,618
lord

1345
00:56:55,858 --> 00:57:02,858
okay so let's see what else we got

1346
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:10,019
add collision rule where is that

1347
00:57:02,858 --> 00:57:13,119
collision rule chemo world world mode

1348
00:57:10,018 --> 00:57:20,409
what's the O it probably was predefined

1349
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:20,940
and it's probably predefined wrong there

1350
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:25,659
we go

1351
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:30,490
problem solved okay and this is probably

1352
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:31,058
you instruct pre declaration so let's

1353
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:36,489
keep going

1354
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:38,079
okay so play worlds in this case play

1355
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:43,750
world this one actually does want to

1356
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:46,210
remain the same so there are a couple in

1357
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:52,358
here that we want to keep probably just

1358
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:53,980
that one fine not too many more what is

1359
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:55,808
this stuff fast we don't have a world

1360
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:58,298
mode yet okay so that's actually fine

1361
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:59,680
too really all we want to do there is we

1362
00:57:58,298 --> 00:58:02,440
want to allocate one of these so we just

1363
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:05,858
need to say that this is going to do a

1364
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,119
like a exactly analogous to the other

1365
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:10,048
thing we were doing here

1366
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,559
so when we start out to play a world

1367
00:58:10,048 --> 00:58:13,568
inside

1368
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:16,298
what could I not get to my handmade

1369
00:58:13,568 --> 00:58:18,670
cutscene we wanted to the exact same

1370
00:58:16,298 --> 00:58:20,679
thing we were doing before right for

1371
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:22,420
play world we want to do set the game

1372
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:26,848
mode to game mode world that clears this

1373
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:32,619
out then we want to do a game mode world

1374
00:58:26,849 --> 00:58:35,829
world mode close game world right like

1375
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:38,079
that and then we want to allocate

1376
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:41,559
basically all the rest of the stuff that

1377
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:43,710
we can get right so that that's totally

1378
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,710
fine

1379
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:52,319
right so let's see crown shunk updating

1380
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:56,010
and ground chunk rendering for the world

1381
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:59,910
I'm not sure how exactly we want to

1382
00:58:56,010 --> 00:59:03,599
handle that stuff I guess we just passed

1383
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:04,980
the translate in I'm not sure I'm not

1384
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:07,080
sure what we want to do there

1385
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:09,809
I can leave the ground chunk stuff in

1386
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:13,400
there because it does seem relevant so

1387
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:16,889
maybe this stuff does want to be there

1388
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,930
yeah I don't know let's let's try it for

1389
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:21,420
now we'll see I'm not sure what I think

1390
00:59:18,929 --> 00:59:24,029
of it but we'll see so if I wanted to

1391
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,400
leave that in here let's just we'll just

1392
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:28,220
drop it in there and see what happens

1393
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,329
probably fine possibly fine I don't know

1394
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:32,639
all right

1395
00:59:30,329 --> 00:59:35,369
so chunk diamond meters is not a member

1396
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:36,829
of game-mode worlds that's probably true

1397
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:42,420
I agree with that

1398
00:59:36,829 --> 00:59:51,119
that is actually it's game mode worlds

1399
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:55,409
that is also yeah okay

1400
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:59,940
so this should be world mode world world

1401
00:59:55,409 --> 01:00:01,769
mode world probably should dereference

1402
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,970
those seems like a pretty long pointer

1403
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:05,519
shame to crawl for no apparent reason

1404
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:08,750
but doesn't really matter at this point

1405
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:10,920
so let's see get rid of it meant from

1406
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:13,710
identifiers are not found so does that

1407
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:16,858
mean assets has not been specified quite

1408
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:20,909
yet I guess that's what that means let's

1409
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:25,710
take a look here maybe move that a

1410
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:28,139
little bit lower no asset has been oh no

1411
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:29,699
it hasn't been nevermind there we go in

1412
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:31,348
fact asset should probably be quite a

1413
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:34,230
bit further up shouldn't asset be like

1414
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:37,800
more like there yeah okay so let's see

1415
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:40,409
fill ground chunk cannot convert to from

1416
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:44,330
game mode world game state

1417
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:44,329
what does fill ground chunk expect

1418
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:53,430
I suspect a game state but why does it

1419
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:58,650
need a game state do we know feel like

1420
01:00:53,429 --> 01:01:00,599
this could be a game mode world right

1421
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:02,250
and I feel like that's probably actually

1422
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:04,349
better because that also reduces that

1423
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:06,630
like sort of long dependency chain there

1424
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:10,349
as well so then we would just do okay

1425
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:14,610
world mode world mode and this is

1426
01:01:10,349 --> 01:01:18,029
game-mode world goals mode and I'm

1427
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:19,500
pretty much out of time but oh well so

1428
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,790
this stuff is now what we would have to

1429
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:24,150
sort of concentrate on a little bit more

1430
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:24,989
I'm gonna go past it just a bit just to

1431
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:27,300
make sure what's going on here

1432
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:28,889
so please sound I'm gonna not worry

1433
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,539
about the sound stuff for right now so

1434
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:32,369
I'm actually just gonna go ahead and and

1435
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:36,679
comment those out because I don't care

1436
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:39,449
about sound at the moment and let's see

1437
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:40,769
teasing a petition we don't care about

1438
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:42,029
that at the moment either if I'm gonna

1439
01:01:40,769 --> 01:01:42,769
leave it in there just in case we want

1440
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:45,810
it later

1441
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:52,800
let's see controlled Heroes subscrip

1442
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:55,139
and let's see initialize audio State in

1443
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:57,660
game update and render so we initialize

1444
01:01:55,139 --> 01:02:03,299
the audio state we would want to do that

1445
01:01:57,659 --> 01:02:05,719
I guess before we do the mode arena so I

1446
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:10,200
don't know why we set it up that way

1447
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:12,329
that's kind of a little bit weird it

1448
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:16,619
seems like we would rather do something

1449
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:21,869
in fact how is that doing what it's

1450
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:24,269
doing I don't really know I don't really

1451
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:26,219
know what that's doing I feel like that

1452
01:02:24,269 --> 01:02:29,159
wants to be in its phone arena

1453
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:30,449
I feel like this wants in fact to be

1454
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:32,670
honest with you I feel like all this

1455
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:37,889
stuff wants to be done in a way that's a

1456
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:39,030
little bit more should I put it I feel

1457
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:41,659
like all this stuff wants to be done in

1458
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:44,910
a way that's a little bit more systemic

1459
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:47,369
than what is being done at the moment I

1460
01:02:44,909 --> 01:02:50,619
feel like what I would rather do right

1461
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:54,319
is do something like this

1462
01:02:50,619 --> 01:02:57,519
this is the total arena you know and it

1463
01:02:54,320 --> 01:03:02,800
just says like okay I'm gonna initialize

1464
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:08,599
the total arena and that's gonna do this

1465
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:12,500
and that way I can just do like okay you

1466
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:14,480
know I might want different arenas for

1467
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:17,449
different things so I do okay let's say

1468
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:23,300
there's a sub arena that's gonna be for

1469
01:03:17,449 --> 01:03:24,559
the audio something like that and to be

1470
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,240
honest I don't really remember how the

1471
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:30,619
audio stuff works I assume it just keeps

1472
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:33,559
a pointer to the arena it's using yeah

1473
01:03:30,619 --> 01:03:35,150
that's what it does so I'm just gonna

1474
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:36,590
say okay there's sub arena you know and

1475
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:39,920
we give that a megabyte to work with or

1476
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:43,420
something like that however much we

1477
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,500
decide we want audio state space to take

1478
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:48,550
so there's gonna be something like this

1479
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:53,260
it would be from the total arena and

1480
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:53,260
then we would do the same thing with

1481
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:58,610
with our game the mode arena right so

1482
01:03:56,659 --> 01:04:02,679
the mode arena which is gonna hold the

1483
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:02,680
rest of this stuff that would just take

1484
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:11,269
the rest something like that then we

1485
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:14,000
initialize we pass the audio arena like

1486
01:04:11,269 --> 01:04:15,789
so and all would be good now the only

1487
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,460
problem is this guy's got to stay around

1488
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:20,840
so we need this thing to be in here

1489
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:22,429
although really what we probably get to

1490
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:25,640
do is have the audio state itself

1491
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:28,519
allocate that I'm doing too much cleanup

1492
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:30,949
at once not really amenable to an hour

1493
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:32,509
stream but when I get into my head that

1494
01:04:30,949 --> 01:04:34,549
I'm putting something up I like want to

1495
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:37,790
clean it all up that's just the nature

1496
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:39,470
of how I tend to code so it's hard to

1497
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:41,029
leave things as messy as I have to leave

1498
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:43,759
them on the stream sometimes a lot of

1499
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:45,830
times most times you might even say but

1500
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,740
that's just that's just the nature of

1501
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:52,130
how the show has to go so anyway I'm

1502
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:54,259
going to do like to do move this into

1503
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:58,849
the memory it's just the audio system

1504
01:04:54,260 --> 01:05:01,850
proper and we'll try to do its own the

1505
01:04:58,849 --> 01:05:03,159
time okay so let's see we've got the

1506
01:05:01,849 --> 01:05:07,059
audio arena

1507
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:11,079
and we made that one we've got the yet

1508
01:05:07,059 --> 01:05:15,969
remaining arena size remaining total

1509
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:17,590
arena go Ashley I'll just say play the

1510
01:05:15,969 --> 01:05:19,179
intro cutscene that looks a little bit

1511
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:21,250
better to me it's certainly a much

1512
01:05:19,179 --> 01:05:22,960
thinner than it was skipping control of

1513
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,480
heroes again and just finishing up the

1514
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:29,230
rest of this the audio arena is now in

1515
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:31,619
the king of states we don't need this

1516
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:34,000
pointer at all anymore do we

1517
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:42,420
is that even what is that even doing

1518
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:44,769
nothing that goes away and then we have

1519
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:46,769
again just that control with the delete

1520
01:05:44,769 --> 01:05:48,489
entities update and render world

1521
01:05:46,769 --> 01:05:50,889
transient state connect where everyone

1522
01:05:48,489 --> 01:05:54,759
from game state to game mode world so

1523
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:58,539
that would just be world mode this I

1524
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:00,550
believe and yeah so now I think we're

1525
01:05:58,539 --> 01:06:02,800
pretty much all good and this is just

1526
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:05,110
the only part that we haven't done yet

1527
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:11,019
so that should leave us at a reasonable

1528
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:12,550
stopping point I think I'm not sure I'm

1529
01:06:11,019 --> 01:06:19,449
irate about that I don't know if I

1530
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:21,100
actually am yeah yeah and then what's

1531
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:22,929
this complaining about controlled eros

1532
01:06:21,099 --> 01:06:25,630
is not a member of game-mode worlds

1533
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:29,019
that's true that it's not and so that

1534
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:35,650
also probably has to be nerfed for the

1535
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:39,400
moment okay so that's all good

1536
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:41,829
Kiros exists and quit requested so this

1537
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,570
can be if there doubt and so now we're

1538
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:44,650
at least a little bit cleaner but we're

1539
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:45,940
not quite done yet

1540
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:48,700
but we'll have to hold off for tomorrow

1541
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,809
cuz I'm just about out of time I just

1542
01:06:48,699 --> 01:06:52,569
want to make sure that everything's

1543
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:54,759
still running okay which it is but now

1544
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:56,080
we will not get any launching of the

1545
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,450
game and so that's what we'll do

1546
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,699
tomorrow to sort of finish up that

1547
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:01,899
cleanup and then I think we'll be in

1548
01:07:00,699 --> 01:07:03,669
pretty good shape

1549
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:05,079
alright so the probably be hard to do

1550
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:06,130
Q&amp;A because we haven't quite finished

1551
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:07,329
yet but if you do have a question

1552
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:09,400
specifically that's something that we

1553
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:10,449
just did we still have about seven

1554
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,170
minutes for questions so I'll try to

1555
01:07:10,449 --> 01:07:13,169
take a few quick ones

1556
01:07:48,568 --> 01:07:58,079
or not could just not have any questions

1557
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:58,079
that works too

1558
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,700
actually how did the memorias work at

1559
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,050
the moment memory Riina's are just

1560
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:15,569
blocks of memory which gets sub

1561
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:17,789
allocated out so they are kind of just

1562
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:18,838
like you you take a giant block of

1563
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:19,949
memory you start at the beginning and

1564
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:21,779
every time someone wants something just

1565
01:08:19,949 --> 01:08:23,338
put it to be put it wherever the next

1566
01:08:21,779 --> 01:08:25,608
slot is to fill it in that's all they do

1567
01:08:23,338 --> 01:08:25,609
at the moment

1568
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:35,729
2:38 well since no one's asking have you

1569
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:38,429
heard about AMD open sourcing a lot of

1570
01:08:35,729 --> 01:08:39,629
their GPU stuff I have not although

1571
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:41,369
that's probably a very good idea for

1572
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:45,480
them because traditionally the biggest

1573
01:08:41,369 --> 01:08:48,149
problem with AMD has been driver like

1574
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:52,289
inability to get their drivers story

1575
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:53,460
together so having more eyes on that

1576
01:08:52,289 --> 01:08:54,269
problem probably good if that's what

1577
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,829
we're talking about but don't really

1578
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:57,450
know if that's what you're talking about

1579
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:59,779
because I haven't seen thing you're

1580
01:08:57,449 --> 01:08:59,779
referring to

1581
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:53,039
excellent - the world wanted changing be

1582
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:55,738
prefetched like the cutscenes changing

1583
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:58,340
yes potentially and that is one of the

1584
01:09:55,738 --> 01:10:00,479
reasons that I said that the the

1585
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:02,250
clearing the mode when you set the mode

1586
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:03,509
may not be how I leave it eventually I

1587
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:05,850
may have it so that you create a new

1588
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:08,219
mode before you actually switch to it

1589
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:10,680
and can have them hanging around for

1590
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:12,029
longer there's also some other reasons

1591
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:14,250
to do that like if you want to crossfade

1592
01:10:12,029 --> 01:10:17,939
between them or do stuff like that so

1593
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:19,140
that may happen but you got to do it you

1594
01:10:17,939 --> 01:10:22,019
got to get at least to the part where

1595
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:23,730
they're partition first elleven so if i

1596
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:26,250
metagame do you mean the pregame stuff

1597
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:28,529
yes just anything that's not the actual

1598
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:32,460
playing of the game directly is like the

1599
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:33,840
metagame the happy pumpkin hi I just

1600
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:35,279
finished my first semester computer

1601
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,289
science in school just learned some

1602
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:39,359
basic Java but it's wondering and if you

1603
01:10:37,289 --> 01:10:40,710
have any tips moving forward also you

1604
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:44,369
know of any colleges that have good

1605
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:45,920
computer science departments I'm sorry I

1606
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:50,099
don't really know much about

1607
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:52,649
school-based computer science it's not

1608
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:55,560
something I have a lot of experience

1609
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:56,479
with my tips going forward is usually

1610
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,920
that you want to spend as much time

1611
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:01,289
doing your own kind of programming as

1612
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,310
you can and if you're just in game

1613
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:03,238
programming then you probably don't

1614
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:04,860
really want to be programming Java

1615
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:07,019
because people don't generally play up

1616
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:11,488
program games in Java you want to learn

1617
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:15,680
C C++ because that's that tends to be

1618
01:11:11,488 --> 01:11:15,679
more the standard language

1619
01:11:17,809 --> 01:11:21,920
if we're sorry so slow night the chatter

1620
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:23,529
upped it into a flame were over the

1621
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,940
execution of opportunities and games

1622
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:27,759
okay

1623
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:33,948
or exclusion is option menus and games

1624
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:38,239
very well that is always fine to flame

1625
01:11:33,948 --> 01:11:39,469
war culver fly wonder if there's took

1626
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:43,308
reason you put the three game modes

1627
01:11:39,469 --> 01:11:47,529
trucks into a union just because I know

1628
01:11:43,309 --> 01:11:50,210
I only have one at a time that's it

1629
01:11:47,529 --> 01:11:51,710
Elvin so I have this generic USB

1630
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:53,210
controller that's not being detected by

1631
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:56,300
X input any ideas how to go about

1632
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:57,739
detecting it use direct input or try to

1633
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:01,099
use an Xbox controller emulator or

1634
01:11:57,738 --> 01:12:02,629
something well you know if if you just

1635
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:04,130
want to get access to it yeah you could

1636
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:05,739
try direct input if directed but doesn't

1637
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:08,630
work you could also try raw input and

1638
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:10,218
try to access it as an HID device but

1639
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:12,440
that requires you to do a bunch of extra

1640
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:18,399
parsing so you know that's certainly a

1641
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:18,399
harder harder route to go

1642
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,289
alright looks like no more cue colons

1643
01:12:52,359 --> 01:13:01,789
alright alright thank you everyone for

1644
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,190
joining me for another episode of hand

1645
01:13:01,789 --> 01:13:06,649
made hero it's been electric coding with

1646
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:07,669
you as always if you would like to

1647
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:09,679
follow along at home you can always

1648
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:11,180
pre-order the game on handmade hero org

1649
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:13,310
and it comes with a source code as we

1650
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:15,170
develop it so you can follow along with

1651
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:17,930
the series if you're trying to learn

1652
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:20,119
programming that's always an easy thing

1653
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:22,159
to do we also have a forum site where

1654
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:23,779
you can ask questions and check out an

1655
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:25,880
anti episode guide maintained by the

1656
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:27,079
community we have a patreon page you can

1657
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,819
