00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:06,060
hello everybody and welcome handmade

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:11,218
hero show recode a complete game live on

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:14,160
stream we have to do some bit to put our

4
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:16,919
thinking caps on today because basically

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,198
what we have to do now because I think

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,939
we are mostly done with asset processing

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,650
we tried out some asset pressing in

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,829
various ways and it seems to actually

9
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:32,329
work quite well and so we're mostly I

10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:35,488
think down to just stuff that that will

11
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:37,259
sort of fine tune along the way but

12
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,328
there's a sort of a big issue that we've

13
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:40,799
got to deal with that I'm not sure how

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,450
exactly we're going to deal with it

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,259
because there's a lot of you know we've

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,820
got options basically and if we go out

17
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,979
here and look at some of the stuff just

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,808
in debug mode here that we've got you

19
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:55,709
can kind of kind of illustrate the point

20
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:57,209
so if we take a look let me move our

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,128
weird blobby thing over to this room

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,730
here so if we take a look here we've

23
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:05,908
placed a little cat in the room and you

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,379
can see the our art imports doing

25
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,939
exactly what we want to do which is it

26
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:11,908
brings in all the art and it tagged it

27
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,709
properly so this is asking for a gray

28
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,180
tabby and it's getting a gray tabby both

29
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,379
the head and the body and so on and it's

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,020
asking for the head one in the body the

31
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:21,149
other and whatever and so that's all

32
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,679
real good but then you see we get to

33
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,080
this point of like assembling the cat

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,509
and we don't really have any tools for

35
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:31,019
assembling the cat right now and the art

36
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,200
that we have is intentionally made with

37
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,519
separated heads and bodies for pretty

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,920
much all creatures that's just the

39
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,450
grammar and that's there because we may

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,329
want to do like swapping and stuff like

41
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,530
that like we may want to be able to put

42
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:45,089
different heads on different bodies and

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,920
so on maybe not necessarily with the

44
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,219
cats but certainly with all the rest of

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,129
the creatures and who knows maybe even

46
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:56,899
with the cats it's hard to say right and

47
00:01:53,129 --> 00:02:00,239
so what we have here is a case of

48
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:03,689
needing to augment right our artwork

49
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:07,140
with information that is not intrinsic

50
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:08,669
to the artwork itself and in game

51
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,229
development this is a very common

52
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,799
problem and it's a common problem

53
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,570
specifically because art tools

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,490
are terrible this is just universally

55
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:25,409
true we would like ideally to have our

56
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,159
the things which our artists use to make

57
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:32,250
assets for our games intrinsically

58
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,770
understand everything about the assets

59
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,310
that they need to understand in order to

60
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:41,610
output the information we want right in

61
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,920
other words ideally if Anna's drawing

62
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,860
cat in Photoshop Photoshop would also

63
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,859
have a really clean way of knowing that

64
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,690
our game needs to know what's ahead and

65
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,610
what's the body what the tags are for

66
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:55,919
various things such as that so she can

67
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,780
pick them from a list the ability to

68
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,149
find new tags and export them to some

69
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,009
kind of data format we can recognize the

70
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,960
ability to place alignment points that

71
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:06,479
are also themselves marked so we know

72
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,129
how the head goes onto the body and the

73
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,659
ability to place like measurement

74
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:11,849
markers that say how big a particular

75
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,500
thing is all of these things would have

76
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,909
been really great and then we could have

77
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,449
just loaded in a data file to had

78
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,969
exactly what we wanted right but that is

79
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:23,459
never the reality in games art tools are

80
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:28,319
made entirely for other people

81
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,909
essentially even though you get a lot of

82
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,199
attention paid the games now in some

83
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:37,109
tools like 3d studio or Maya for example

84
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:40,530
right they still seem to overwhelmingly

85
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,170
be designed not around what we actually

86
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,659
need them to do and it is always this

87
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:49,039
kind of shoehorning process the end

88
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:54,060
result is always this really ugly

89
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:56,639
unsavory systemic I don't you want to

90
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,159
call its most like a Rube Goldberg sort

91
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,929
of contraption that is created for every

92
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:07,139
game or at least every game engine that

93
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:10,620
requires some set of steps and some set

94
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:13,079
of hacky additional data that augments

95
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,090
the art that gets exported in order to

96
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,160
properly capture at the information

97
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,769
that's necessary to actually represent

98
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,890
an asset in the game not just a bitmap

99
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,959
like you would post on Twitter or a

100
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:29,329
rendering that you would output

101
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,769
to a movie or something like this right

102
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:33,329
and it's not that games are particularly

103
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:34,589
special they happen to be the hardest

104
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:35,788
case for this sort of thing because you

105
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:37,228
typically need a lot of information

106
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:38,579
about how things can be interacted with

107
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:40,079
and how they can be modified because

108
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,959
games are all about interactivity and

109
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,399
modification but this is true even in

110
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,430
movies like most movies have to

111
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,019
dramatically augment their pipelines

112
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,470
from whatever art tools they have just

113
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:54,389
because again it's like our jobs are

114
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,050
just more complicated than art tools

115
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,939
typically are able to accommodate and a

116
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,620
lot of times because there are no

117
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:03,120
standardized ways of doing things and

118
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,418
you're always sort of pushing an

119
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,610
envelope somewhere even if an art tool

120
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:11,758
managed to internalize some process that

121
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,860
was was you know what we were doing five

122
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,720
years ago by the time they actually get

123
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,240
it into an art packaged and shipped it's

124
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,159
usually old news and not actually what

125
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,418
we're doing anymore anyway and still

126
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:26,399
obsolete right and so you just this is

127
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:28,500
just a fact of life it's I guess all I'm

128
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,089
trying to say it's just the way things

129
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,970
go and it's not really gonna get any

130
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:34,469
better probably so fortunately on

131
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,030
handmade hero we're not trying to do

132
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,009
anything to elaborate we don't have

133
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:40,948
really complicated 3d assets with all

134
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:42,900
sorts of additional texturing and markup

135
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:44,460
and stuff like this that's and hitboxes

136
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,649
and collision and physics and all these

137
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,658
sorts of things that would create a

138
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:50,329
really onerous load on us in terms of

139
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:53,519
how we integrate all that data together

140
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:55,288
and create art assets that we can

141
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,299
actually use in the game we have a much

142
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:59,399
simpler problem we just have bitmaps and

143
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,348
those bitmaps can largely be used

144
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,049
exactly as they were exported so we had

145
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:05,459
a pretty easy time devising a way of

146
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,090
getting those into the tool without too

147
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:13,109
much trouble

148
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:15,179
but we have now come to the point and

149
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,500
you to be clear you saw me work around

150
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,360
limitations already right

151
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,689
we used a grid to avoid having to have

152
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,520
lots of PNG s and we use the file name

153
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:26,639
to put tags in so we didn't have to have

154
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:29,609
a metadata file for each individual

155
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,490
thing that specified those but now we've

156
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,560
come to a point where we really do need

157
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,408
to start thinking about adding the

158
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,418
whatever the minimal amount of metadata

159
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:40,449
is and the reason we have to think about

160
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:42,918
that is because there's no other way

161
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,588
we're going to be able to deal with this

162
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:47,899
kind of scenario right the data about

163
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:50,149
where the head goes on the body of this

164
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:53,749
cat or where the head goes on the body

165
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:56,149
of anything right is simply not present

166
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:58,249
in the art data and it's not present

167
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,619
because it simply cannot be present

168
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:03,528
there there really isn't a clean way to

169
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:06,649
do it and if we were to create a photo

170
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:08,718
shop based markup system for that it

171
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:10,749
would probably just be a waste of time

172
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:13,218
the reason it'd be a waste of time is a

173
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:14,869
artist would have to learn it because

174
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:16,728
it's non-standard there isn't such a

175
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:18,289
thing as body head alignment in

176
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:21,678
Photoshop so we'd have to make up a

177
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:24,139
grammar for that like place this not of

178
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:27,168
a fake curve or make a layer called this

179
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:29,119
and stick it here right but more

180
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:31,758
important than that because that would

181
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:34,339
not be that bad like we could say

182
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,619
artists here's how that goes the worst

183
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:39,559
part is artists can't see the results

184
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:42,589
right they have to wait they have to

185
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:44,899
export out of Photoshop and then wait

186
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:46,699
for the game to reload it and even if we

187
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:49,579
make that path really fast it's this

188
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,019
kind of nasty like they can't you know

189
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:54,848
you want the tool you're actually

190
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:57,379
working in to show you the result right

191
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:59,748
that's the real thing that tends to be

192
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,550
the the blocking factor and a lot of

193
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:03,249
these art tools is you want you the

194
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,800
artist needs be able to see the result

195
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:08,778
and you want the result immediately if

196
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,860
you can you don't want to have to wait

197
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:17,718
for Photoshop to save a PNG out you know

198
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:19,369
and so yet it's it's not great so what

199
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:21,228
we would like to do potentially it just

200
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:22,849
say well can we just make a way of us

201
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:24,859
placing it in here right because if I

202
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:26,748
had a way to just sort of say here's

203
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,399
where the heads go on this thing and

204
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:34,038
here's the attachment point you know

205
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:36,198
here to here that would that would give

206
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,328
us exactly what we need right it would

207
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:40,788
allow us to instantly specify that and

208
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:42,649
then we don't have this round tripping

209
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:44,480
problem where you're gonna be fussing

210
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:46,879
with it and trying to see what ends up

211
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,310
looking right and other sorts of stuff

212
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,110
like that so I would like

213
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:54,989
to be able to create some kind of system

214
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:58,950
for doing that and actually being able

215
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:02,340
to make that markup isn't really all

216
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,500
that tough probably right like you know

217
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,028
just displaying a bitmap and having us

218
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,870
pick a point on it or something like

219
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:11,909
that isn't particularly difficult so

220
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,320
that part isn't really the interesting

221
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:16,769
part it's a little bit of grunt work but

222
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,110
other than that it's pretty basic the

223
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:22,379
problem that I think we're gonna have to

224
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,089
think about hardest is not that but

225
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:27,240
rather where does that information go

226
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:30,000
that's really the thing that's a little

227
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,860
bit more troublesome right and so the

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,200
problem that we have is right now we

229
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,330
have a notion of sort of authoritative

230
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,790
and non-authoritative art resources and

231
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,528
this is very common in games

232
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:44,719
it's in fact common in pretty much all

233
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:47,970
of computer software engineering at all

234
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,740
which is to say that if you look at for

235
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,839
example our executable our executable

236
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,000
isn't authoritative right the C files

237
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,200
that bill be executable are it's just

238
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,909
assumed that you could delete the

239
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,060
executable at any time and you can

240
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:02,279
rebuild it from the C files so having

241
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,199
the C files gives you the ability to

242
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,269
build everything the obj is the

243
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,040
executable the PDB they can all be built

244
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:09,870
from the C files so the thing that's

245
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,519
authoritative there is the C files it's

246
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,139
not the excusable because if you deleted

247
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,509
the C files you could never get them

248
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:19,259
back the executable is not sufficient to

249
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:21,838
regenerate the C files right and the

250
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,029
same is true for our hhas they are not

251
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,650
authoritative right the PNG s are

252
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,259
authoritative they store higher res

253
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:31,079
versions and original versions of the

254
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,179
artwork and we take out pieces munge

255
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,759
them around and produce like final

256
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:38,309
versions for use in the game from those

257
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,879
PNG s so the PMT's are authoritative the

258
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:44,489
hhas aren't so normally what we would

259
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,909
want to do is write the data back into

260
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,310
the PNG for example since that's the

261
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:55,469
authoritative thing we would like to say

262
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:56,208
oh that PNG now has the information so

263
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,589
its throat ate it

264
00:10:56,208 --> 00:11:01,708
unfortunately our problem goes one

265
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:03,610
deeper than that the PNG really isn't

266
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:06,458
even the authoritative thing

267
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,139
it's the Photoshop file the ANA used to

268
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,208
make the PNG that's actually

269
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:12,309
authoritative and there's no way we're

270
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,958
going back to that because we don't even

271
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:17,169
have those files less machinery we just

272
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,909
get the exported stuff and the PSD s are

273
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:23,289
stored somewhere else right now we could

274
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:26,139
have made a PSD centric export path that

275
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:29,078
would have been interesting I have done

276
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:33,789
that before but there's a lot of things

277
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:36,969
that go along with that that I'd rather

278
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:38,980
not go into it let's put it that way so

279
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,110
we could have done that and then maybe

280
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,050
what we could have done is reinsert data

281
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,610
back into the PSD but then again you

282
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:47,500
would even run into problems where we

283
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,629
would be doing that on our machine and

284
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,970
then if we if Ana was working on that

285
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:54,549
PSD at the same time she would clobber

286
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,420
our changes potentially so you see I'm

287
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:57,039
just trying to give you some

288
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:59,139
appreciation for just how complicated

289
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,319
such a simple thing can actually be

290
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:05,289
because of its insertion into the

291
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,790
process in an unfortunate place so

292
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:09,610
typically what we do to solve these

293
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:13,629
kinds of problems is we create a

294
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:17,829
separate file right so instead of having

295
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:21,278
the PNG be the only authoritative file

296
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:23,289
or the PSD for that matter we augment

297
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,838
those files with an additional text file

298
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:27,189
input of some sort or it could be binary

299
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,350
it doesn't really matter

300
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,850
text is usually preferred because then

301
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,440
you can edit it with a text editor or

302
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,199
merge it with a change utility but a

303
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,440
binary files find - it's just a little

304
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:40,419
harder to work with sometimes right but

305
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,240
the point is there's a second file so

306
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:46,419
you've got dot PNG but you also have dot

307
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:50,740
txt or dot whatever and that extra file

308
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:53,528
contains whatever data the game wanted

309
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,389
to augment that art asset with that way

310
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:58,028
when you go and know that you need to

311
00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:01,328
re-import a PNG for some reason you also

312
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:03,610
reinforce the dot txt or whatever it was

313
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:05,409
with it and that file contains the

314
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,528
additional information that simply

315
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:09,939
couldn't be flowed back up the pipeline

316
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:12,220
so it basically creates a bifurcation

317
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,110
where you say look authoritative lis

318
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,870
there are two files that combine to make

319
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,460
this file one of which we change in the

320
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,259
game

321
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,360
that's like markup specific bullying in

322
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,860
the game and one of which the artist is

323
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,269
free to modify in the tool of their

324
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,490
choice we don't really care what that

325
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:28,789
tool is and as long as that tool can art

326
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,639
put it out put a PNG we're fine right

327
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:35,039
and so I don't want to say that's a good

328
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,208
solution of problem because a better way

329
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,360
to say it would be there really isn't

330
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:42,329
much of a good solution to this problem

331
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,778
without going way further down the art

332
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,180
tool path right to places that are

333
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:52,220
themselves entire projects if not

334
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,219
products that you could even sell right

335
00:13:53,089 --> 00:14:04,490
so like the text file method which is a

336
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:08,700
very common method is the easiest way to

337
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:10,950
create to solve or workaround this

338
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,620
missing data problem where you've got

339
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,410
data you need that the art tool simply

340
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,230
doesn't provide a convenient method for

341
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:21,449
creating which will hit you pretty much

342
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:25,920
in every type of game you will ever make

343
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:28,320
uh it's it's bad enough in 2d it's you

344
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,549
know it's still problem in 2d games for

345
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,410
sure like we're seeing here but it's

346
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:36,659
even worse in 3d it just gets worse it

347
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:39,149
always just gets worse right it's a it's

348
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:41,429
a problem that gets worse forever and

349
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:43,409
the only thing that really makes it you

350
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:44,729
know if it's if it is more tolerable at

351
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:48,899
all in 3d the only thing that makes it

352
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:52,649
more tolerable is that art tools are

353
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:58,379
used to in 3d and artists are used to

354
00:14:52,649 --> 00:15:01,319
dealing with in 3d mark up adding

355
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,360
skeletons and bones and helper objects

356
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,860
and naming them all and having that

357
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,409
skeleton come come out in the export

358
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,440
lost art stuff that's a very common

359
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:13,049
thing to work with and understand in a

360
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,380
3d pipeline it doesn't exist in the 2d

361
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:18,569
pipeline very much largely again because

362
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:20,909
the tools just don't have it so you know

363
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,700
wait if you ever do skeletons and stuff

364
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:25,379
like that in 2d it's augmented by

365
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,990
secondary tool right like Photoshop

366
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,578
doesn't even do it really so you end up

367
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,870
having to have like okay the artist

368
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:31,339
experts I'm gonna Photoshop then they

369
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,019
loaded

370
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,790
to some kind of a like spriting tool

371
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:37,730
like spriter or something that allows

372
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:39,589
you to push put bones in there and then

373
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,820
maybe you had the mark up there right so

374
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:46,009
just it while it is a much harder and

375
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,950
more extensive problem in 3d because of

376
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:50,450
the amount of additional markup you need

377
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,520
sometimes paradoxically it's actually

378
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,220
easier to deal with in that realm and

379
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,559
the reason is because the tools always

380
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,029
have built into them all of this

381
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,779
additional markup because it had to be

382
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,949
there for other reasons

383
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:04,970
whereas 2d as usual you know Adobe

384
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,970
mostly just sucks the thumb all day so

385
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,680
you end up in a situation where that

386
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,269
stuff just isn't there you know why

387
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,079
doesn't Photoshop have a really complete

388
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:16,939
very good bones animation tool by now

389
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,690
because it doesn't have to write they'll

390
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:23,030
sell copies either way um so anyway

391
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,970
that's basically where we're at and just

392
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,500
to give you an overview of that problem

393
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,000
otherwise I think we're in good shape I

394
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,580
think we've got everything else we need

395
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,779
and so our goal now for this weekend is

396
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,420
to figure out how we're going to solve

397
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:38,509
that problem because then I think we're

398
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:40,729
ready to go on characters as well we

399
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,379
didn't need to solve this problem for

400
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,360
environments and the reason we didn't

401
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,970
need to solve it for environments was

402
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,980
because we understand how these how our

403
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,310
blocks are wrapped with textures and

404
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,409
there isn't really any need to mark them

405
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:57,219
up right there there was no additional

406
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:59,839
information we were able to define

407
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:02,420
entirely intrinsic to the art itself a

408
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,420
rule for how we were going to process

409
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:09,379
that type type of artwork and so that's

410
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:11,390
why we didn't have that problem but for

411
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,130
characters as much as we would have

412
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,650
wanted to be able to do the same thing

413
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:21,230
there really isn't much of a way to make

414
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:24,470
that work you know there were things I

415
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,000
considered and I just felt like they

416
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,860
were a little bit too silly and

417
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,599
ridiculous to try and go down so I

418
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,250
thought this would just be a place where

419
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:36,889
we're gonna have to bite the bullet and

420
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:39,769
add an augmentation so I think like I

421
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:44,060
said we just want to go ahead and do a

422
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:46,660
basic text file augmentation why text

423
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:49,700
file I'm not binary

424
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,970
because generally speaking I think that

425
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,308
in this case simpler is better and while

426
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,730
I prefer binary files typically to text

427
00:17:55,308 --> 00:18:00,950
files honestly that's only once you've

428
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,289
gone a particular distance down your

429
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,819
toolkit approach like you know you want

430
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:06,200
to be able to dip these things and if

431
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:08,689
you're never gonna write like a diff

432
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,279
tool for your binary format then you're

433
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,140
not gonna invest in this binary format

434
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,539
long term then text is better there's a

435
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,860
break point there where if you're only I

436
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:18,079
spend a little bit of time on something

437
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,759
texts will win because there are way

438
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,859
more text utilities if you can just

439
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,359
leverage and binary doesn't really have

440
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:25,490
that same sort of thing yet I think

441
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,589
someday it might there are people who've

442
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,819
done work on arbitrary definitions of

443
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:32,000
binary files and stuff I don't know if

444
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:35,000
you're seeing that there's a project of

445
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,119
github for like making like little

446
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,500
grammatical descriptions of binary files

447
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,819
you know things like that eventually I

448
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:46,579
think might start to create ways we can

449
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:47,960
stop relying on ASCII so much which I

450
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:50,689
don't think is a very good format for

451
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,100
storing pretty much anything but at the

452
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,320
moment just because of the way tools

453
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:56,599
work it is better if you're only gonna

454
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,879
spend a little bit of time so I'm gonna

455
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:00,980
go ahead and load up here and I'm gonna

456
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,650
make a min estate you know here's our

457
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,740
art directory right I'm gonna go ahead

458
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,780
and make a imaginary addition to this

459
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,240
art directory and I'm just gonna write

460
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:13,069
it by hand first right and so what I

461
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,670
want to do is I want to write a text

462
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:18,769
file by hand that's going to experiment

463
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:22,550
with what we could do to markup this

464
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:24,500
stuff with what we need and then we're

465
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:26,869
going to flow that back through our

466
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,730
pipeline expand our definition of an HHA

467
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:33,079
to include what we actually want to have

468
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:36,319
in here in that respect and when I do

469
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:38,480
that we will get to see it all work and

470
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,389
make sure it's valid and when we're all

471
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,019
done then our tasks say for next weekend

472
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,790
can be to write the editor part in the

473
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:49,400
game that allows us to quickly make

474
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:54,859
those modifications visually and save

475
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,840
them back to the text file right and off

476
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:58,428
we go in some sense you could think of

477
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,408
this as look we

478
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:01,999
are just going to augment our HSA with

479
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,830
the data we need and we're just gonna

480
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:06,499
write stuff back to the HSA so it's

481
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:09,319
always correct the text file is just a

482
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:11,329
way of also saving that data right and

483
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:13,759
the reason for that like I said is that

484
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:15,288
HHA isn't authoritative so ideally we

485
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,899
want to be able to just delete and

486
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:20,179
rebuild it anytime we want because it's

487
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:23,168
our shipping format not honest or

488
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:25,220
editing format we don't want to have to

489
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:27,169
we want to be able to update like the

490
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,769
format of our HHA and delete it and

491
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:33,950
rebuild it anytime we want at least up

492
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:36,200
to a certain point and so you know we at

493
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,249
least at the very least even if we

494
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,808
didn't save out the text files

495
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:41,690
automatically we were at the very least

496
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:44,720
one hour HHA edit tool to be able to

497
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,999
unpack an HHA into text files that did

498
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,240
have that additional data or something

499
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:51,558
like that right so that we could rebuild

500
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,210
the HHA as necessary

501
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:58,548
and so on okay uh so let's suppose we

502
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:02,240
were going to work on character cat

503
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:04,069
Berman ghost here right or I guess let's

504
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,730
do gray tabby because gray tabby

505
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:09,408
is the one that was in that room that we

506
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,929
were looking at there so that may be an

507
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:15,590
easier way to do it so if I look at

508
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:18,440
character cat gray tabby dot PNG if I

509
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:22,628
just do a markup file here so I make a

510
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:28,129
you know text in here that goes with it

511
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:31,398
what we know from looking at the the

512
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:38,719
tool here let me just go ahead and not

513
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:40,368
the tool the the source file so what we

514
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,200
know from looking at the source file

515
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:44,749
right oh that's weird

516
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:51,548
if you zoom in far enough it handles the

517
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:51,548
Alpha properly what

518
00:21:54,089 --> 00:22:09,388
what is there a rationale for that oh

519
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:14,949
okay so I think I get it now they're

520
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:18,449
scaling so they're down sampler doesn't

521
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:24,220
handle alpha but they're up sampler does

522
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:28,239
right that's probably how big it is in

523
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:30,999
the actual file if you go below that the

524
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:33,399
alphas wrong if you go above that it's

525
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:35,528
fine so nobody ever tested like at

526
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:39,548
Microsoft they were like didn't test the

527
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:41,200
down sampler for alpha there's like I

528
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:43,148
don't know man

529
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,028
but for some reason whoever wrote the up

530
00:22:43,148 --> 00:22:48,008
sampler maybe they was the same person I

531
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:49,298
don't know but they had a bug in one and

532
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:51,038
not in the other I guess I don't know

533
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:53,408
that's crazy but there you go

534
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:57,158
so mystery solved I always wondered why

535
00:22:53,409 --> 00:23:00,519
the Alpha was broken in that then now I

536
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,749
know never notice that before anyway

537
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:04,778
back to our story

538
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:10,298
so in each of these cases right we know

539
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:12,730
the alignment point for where the for

540
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:17,319
where the head would go would be

541
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:19,179
specified in each of these sort of each

542
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:22,808
of these turns right like the head goes

543
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:24,609
here or here or whatever so we know we'd

544
00:23:22,808 --> 00:23:27,668
have an alignment point that we would

545
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:30,339
want to write out into the file for each

546
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:33,549
grid position potentially right

547
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:34,358
and same with the the heads of cells we

548
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:35,950
know that there's like an alignment

549
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:40,210
point there or whatever an alignment

550
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:42,519
point there and so on so we know we've

551
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,960
got like for each grid square we know we

552
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,388
have an alignment point that we want to

553
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,889
place in there you know what I mean and

554
00:23:46,388 --> 00:23:49,988
that alignment point would would

555
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:55,658
basically give us the information we we

556
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:57,159
needed to align heads to bodies and we

557
00:23:55,659 --> 00:24:01,480
could also have alignments for other

558
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:03,129
things but I don't so I guess we do know

559
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,490
one no I think about we do know one of

560
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:10,808
the thing too so we had hats first

561
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:12,579
sample that can go on to heroes and you

562
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:17,649
know I mean I guess there's no real

563
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:19,839
reason they couldn't go on to the thing

564
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,160
that they couldn't go on to cats as well

565
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,970
right you just shrink it down or

566
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:27,820
whatever and so we do also have an

567
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:31,660
additional placement situation here

568
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:35,019
which is to say that heads also have a

569
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:39,009
like adornment that they could put on as

570
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:42,549
well so if we take a look at how that's

571
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:44,619
going to work it means that we sort of

572
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:46,869
have a grids an idea that a particular

573
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:50,529
grid square has information associated

574
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:52,808
with it and we probably want to say if

575
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:54,359
we look at a character here a character

576
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:56,799
template right

577
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,899
we know that we've got sort of these

578
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,169
grid squares numbered like zero zero and

579
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,910
then over right going down the Y and

580
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:05,019
over an X that's the way we numbered

581
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,880
them when they come into the file

582
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:08,019
because again PNG is start at the top

583
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,460
and go down and that's what we're

584
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:14,740
loading here so you know if we wanted to

585
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:18,370
specify like a grid square for example

586
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:20,319
right we could say you know we could we

587
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:22,449
could make some syntax and I don't know

588
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,220
what that syntax should be right but we

589
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,640
can make some kind of a syntax for

590
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,380
saying look what's the what's the grid

591
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,770
square that we're talking about here you

592
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,840
know what's the what's the actual grid

593
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:39,429
square we're talking about and then we

594
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:41,949
could make some way of inside that

595
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:43,870
talking about properties that that grid

596
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,850
square has you know what I mean like

597
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:50,049
what are the points that we care about

598
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:53,379
that are related to this particular

599
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:55,119
object right and so what we want to do

600
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,929
there is just have a few things that we

601
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:04,689
can specify and so for example you know

602
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:07,059
maybe we want to do like two types of

603
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:11,080
attachments so like attached to or like

604
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:13,779
you know we want to have sort of

605
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:16,689
attached parent you know an attached

606
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:18,789
child or something like this right so in

607
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,380
other words if you put a hat on a head

608
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:22,930
that's where the try

609
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:26,560
would attach if you put the head onto a

610
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:28,750
body the head is saying where what the

611
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,009
parent attach point is the body is

612
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,430
saying what the channel attach point is

613
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:36,910
and they match up you know what I mean

614
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:40,240
um and I don't know that right now we

615
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:43,120
have anything that doesn't follow that

616
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,029
basic pattern meaning there's only

617
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:48,369
attachments that go on that way I don't

618
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:53,259
think there's any other kind of

619
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:55,779
attachment like I don't think we need to

620
00:26:53,259 --> 00:27:01,420
contemplate that there are attachment

621
00:26:55,779 --> 00:27:03,129
like slots right attach parent is

622
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,340
obviously unique but attached child you

623
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:10,330
know you could imagine there being like

624
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:11,799
multiple places to put something and I

625
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:13,269
think we can cross that bridge if we

626
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:14,740
come to it I mean it's pretty easy to

627
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:17,650
augment whatever you do here to have

628
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:19,150
that but at the moment I would say I

629
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,250
don't know that we really need that

630
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:32,680
because I don't think we're gonna have

631
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:36,000
that I wish I could think of a place

632
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,000
where that would actually be necessary

633
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:48,599
but I'm just not

634
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:02,599
I'm just not thinking of anything off

635
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:04,308
the top of my head so we'll see you know

636
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,839
we'll see where it goes if we want to be

637
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,700
future proof we could you know we could

638
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,928
do something there maybe when we're in

639
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:13,210
there we'll make it so that that thing

640
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:15,440
can be an array and we'll go from there

641
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,179
but you know if you imagine something

642
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,919
like this which just said look here's a

643
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:20,330
grid square and then for that grid

644
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:22,700
square we're gonna attach a bunch of

645
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:23,569
information then what we could say is

646
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,940
you know all right

647
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:27,678
the parent attachment is some position

648
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,048
right you know it's like this kind of

649
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:34,820
thing you know what I mean

650
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:44,089
and then the the child position is some

651
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:47,798
other thing like so on and I want to say

652
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:50,000
that we probably want scale as well here

653
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:57,980
so you know I want to say that we

654
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:01,669
probably want some way of saying how big

655
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,710
the thing would be you know what I mean

656
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:05,870
I don't know how we want to specify that

657
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:09,440
but something where we would say you

658
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:14,089
know if you attach me to anything I'm

659
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:23,080
you know half the size that normal stuff

660
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:26,658
would be or like here's how big I I am

661
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:29,329
and so I don't know that might be

662
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:34,250
something that we want to specify as a

663
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:37,569
scale maybe just in general so you know

664
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,569
maybe we would say something like this

665
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:47,839
you know and so that would just allow us

666
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,490
to change how big the thing is in the

667
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:53,139
world right so this is like how many

668
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,140
meters the thing is or who knows what

669
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,210
and maybe I'll say size cuz it's not

670
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:01,849
really scale you know it's like oh this

671
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,669
is 4 meters big or a point four meters

672
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:06,918
you know who knows right something that

673
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:09,620
and then on here what we could do is say

674
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:10,909
you know when you do an attached child

675
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:14,569
you can also spell

676
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:17,299
2phi the size right so you would say

677
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:21,200
look it's you know anything that I

678
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:23,210
attach gets a scale value and and you

679
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:30,950
know you know maybe you could just say

680
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:33,619
it this way right so like anything that

681
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,239
attaches to me gets it instead of it

682
00:30:33,618 --> 00:30:37,038
being its normal size it's like a tenth

683
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:38,720
the size the reason I say that is

684
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,089
because you know like let's say these

685
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,769
hats we kind of just want to play fast

686
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,928
and loose with them so you know you put

687
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:46,368
a hat on one of the hero characters well

688
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:49,909
not what I hear one of the orphans like

689
00:30:46,368 --> 00:30:51,499
so the hero or any of the orphans you

690
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:56,299
know it's going to be a particular size

691
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:58,038
we then put it on two we then put it on

692
00:30:56,298 --> 00:31:00,679
two like the cat it's gonna have to be

693
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:03,440
smaller so we would want the cat to say

694
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,429
that like the cat's artwork just as look

695
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,080
when you put something on here it gets

696
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:13,720
this much smaller right so I think I

697
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:13,720
think that's basically all we need there

698
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:20,569
yeah trying to think if there's other

699
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:24,348
stuff we want to but I think that's

700
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:28,878
basically it so we want something like

701
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:32,298
this this is the size value this is a

702
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:33,498
scale value they're different right this

703
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:35,989
is basically saying this is the

704
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:37,608
percentage of the size of the child to

705
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:40,220
use and this is saying here's how big I

706
00:31:37,608 --> 00:31:46,158
am generally speaking when I'm not being

707
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:47,538
scaled or at a scale of 1.0 so I think

708
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,999
we could do something like that attached

709
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:54,288
parent attached child birth would just

710
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:58,028
be percentages inside the square and I

711
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:58,028
think then we'd be good to go

712
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:18,959
so I think that's pretty good here's

713
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:21,000
what I will say I think we also want the

714
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,130
ability to be a little bit more broad

715
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,589
right so I think we want to be able to

716
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:35,669
say something like well okay you know by

717
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:40,230
default the size for like some range of

718
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:44,309
the squares is gonna be you know this

719
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:45,870
and by default the range of the other

720
00:32:44,308 --> 00:32:48,720
ones is going to be something else or

721
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:54,658
whatever right so it would be nice to do

722
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:58,200
something where you said you know maybe

723
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:00,419
something like this so you could just

724
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,120
say look the default size and child

725
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:07,409
scale or this and then I'm going to

726
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:17,489
specify some specifics here which can

727
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:19,320
override them if you want to I'm trying

728
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,769
to think of like how I want to specify

729
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,769
that

730
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,429
because typically speaking we're gonna

731
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:37,740
want at least two of those you would

732
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:41,669
want one for up here and one for down

733
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:44,009
here right and so you'd want to be able

734
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:47,759
to do something and I'm not sure exactly

735
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:56,639
like how to do this but you'd want to do

736
00:33:47,759 --> 00:34:06,269
something that looked like like that you

737
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:11,098
know where you could just say look for

738
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:23,579
all of those that's what it is and for

739
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:25,440
all of these that's what it is not sure

740
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:27,750
what the best way to annotate that is

741
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,059
cuz there isn't really a way to do that

742
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,829
and see there's no like we don't really

743
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:34,710
if we're trying to stay with sort of see

744
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:41,310
like see it see like syntax the ranges

745
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:43,918
are really the issue but you can you

746
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:47,639
know imagine these getting applied in

747
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:51,138
this way right and so we could do

748
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:54,899
something like that where we've got

749
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:57,809
different things applied and then any

750
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:59,519
individual one can also be specified but

751
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:01,500
in general like you just read these in

752
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,108
order so this gets applied to all of

753
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,690
these this gets applied to all of these

754
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:10,699
and then this gets applied only to this

755
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,700
particular one you know

756
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:32,579
that seems fine to me like I don't see

757
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:34,689
much I don't see much issue there I

758
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:37,239
don't know how everyone else feels about

759
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:40,179
that but that seems like a pretty

760
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:44,559
reasonable syntax and I don't know that

761
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:50,819
we really need much else there I think

762
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:50,820
that's all we would actually care about

763
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,710
yeah

764
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:20,059
all right I suppose the other thing that

765
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:22,089
I'm not really sure about so one thing

766
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:25,610
that's a little bit weird there is

767
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:27,559
trying to understand exactly how those

768
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:38,269
things would be edited is a little

769
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:41,059
tricky but I feel like you could pretty

770
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:43,960
much just do this directly and I think

771
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:43,960
we'll probably be fine

772
00:36:55,809 --> 00:37:04,190
so we free we're gonna put these in the

773
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:09,130
HHA so I'm gonna load up file formats so

774
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:09,130
if we were gonna put those in the HHA i

775
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:20,929
have to think a little bit about how we

776
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:23,539
want to represent that so i kind of

777
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:36,848
almost feel like that wants to be its

778
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:36,849
own array almost it's hard to say

779
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:53,809
if you look at the way that HHA bitmap

780
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:57,359
is defined then a line percentage is

781
00:37:53,809 --> 00:38:01,139
attached parent so we have that in there

782
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,210
currently and the question is just you

783
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:07,769
know should we all mint that structure

784
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:10,199
to effectively have a bunch of markup in

785
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:13,619
it you know we just say this thing is

786
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:18,539
pretty big so it's got you know a whole

787
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:22,589
mess of stuff so the size the child

788
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:40,050
scale the parent attach and all that all

789
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:43,470
goes in there and I'm not sure my guess

790
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:45,240
is the answer should be no and the

791
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:49,769
reason that I say that my answer should

792
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:57,949
be no is because the HHA bitmap I

793
00:38:49,769 --> 00:39:04,949
believe is streamed in and so really

794
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:07,230
this is where you would rather oh okay

795
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:11,039
well so it isn't streamed in so we do

796
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:12,900
have that loaded so I thought maybe this

797
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,329
data was part of it so okay so that's

798
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,539
fine no then it can totally go here

799
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:17,539
right

800
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,880
that's totally fun

801
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,760
I just wanted to make sure that this was

802
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,349
always accessible to us at all times and

803
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,570
not something that got streamed in

804
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:32,759
because I want to be able to know this

805
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:37,080
information without having to stream it

806
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:42,270
in and so that's good I'm relatively

807
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:44,610
happy with that so yeah thinking it

808
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:48,030
through just in my head

809
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:48,030
[Music]

810
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,889
I guess I would say it probably belongs

811
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:11,839
there

812
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:15,029
and that's a reasonable place to put it

813
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,550
having to attach things that may

814
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:19,890
actually be separate entities does

815
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:22,170
become it becomes kind of interesting as

816
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:27,089
to how we're exactly going to handle

817
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:28,920
that but I don't think at the end of the

818
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:31,740
day it's really all that difficult

819
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,490
because once we know where the entities

820
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:38,159
are then in it's really just the same as

821
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:39,750
having traversable x' so I think we'll

822
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,549
probably end up doing as traversable x'

823
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,559
when you actually say I need to place

824
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:46,260
this but this thing on this particular

825
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,659
traversable or whatever I think all you

826
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,330
really have to do is then say okay the

827
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:53,039
same kind of thing happens for placing

828
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:56,250
stuff like hats which would maybe be a

829
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,269
separate entity onto a particular

830
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:00,650
character

831
00:40:57,269 --> 00:41:00,650
right and

832
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,849
yeah and again this is sort of stuff

833
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,080
that we're gonna have to feel it over

834
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:30,460
time but just thinking it through that

835
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:30,460
all sounds pretty good to me so yeah

836
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:55,828
I think I'm good with all that I think

837
00:41:52,588 --> 00:41:58,558
that's all fine I don't really know but

838
00:41:55,829 --> 00:42:00,869
it seems okay and so if we wanted to

839
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,960
make this stuff be represented in here

840
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:07,559
let's say right and we wanted to augment

841
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:10,710
the file to have these then what I would

842
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:13,829
do is say in addition to the dimensions

843
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:18,900
of the bitmap itself and the align

844
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:24,839
percentage here right what we want to do

845
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:33,300
is have the like the child align right

846
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:40,230
which is this bit we would want a child

847
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:45,539
scale value and our scale value so we'd

848
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:50,159
really want to just have these something

849
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:51,719
like this and so really all we be doing

850
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,909
here is saying in addition to storing

851
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:55,679
the dimensions of the bitmap as they

852
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:57,389
actually are we've got a ton of like

853
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,889
floating-point stuff now here that we're

854
00:42:57,389 --> 00:43:03,118
gonna pack in there as well and this is

855
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:05,368
you know going to be parent blind to

856
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,818
kind of go with this and if we just

857
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:12,960
adopt this naming convention over here

858
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:15,230
as well which seems good I could say

859
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,230
that

860
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:30,409
oops that's okay that was already ranked

861
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:56,510
and so these would just be directly

862
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:59,389
imported into the file right I guess

863
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:04,480
that's all I have to say about that we

864
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:07,579
can like I said try to plan for future

865
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,490
expansion there by saying if we want

866
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:14,239
more alignment points per bitmap we can

867
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:15,889
make that child align be fattier so you

868
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,219
could say you know you get eight of them

869
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:18,219
or something

870
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:23,509
I just don't know to what extent that

871
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:27,710
really makes any sense because I don't

872
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:29,720
know how we would actually differentiate

873
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:33,199
between those attachment points in the

874
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:35,029
first place like we would have to start

875
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,949
like naming them or something right

876
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:39,320
you'd have to start saying here's the

877
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:42,379
child Lyman point and what kind of

878
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:45,230
alignment point it is right and we could

879
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:48,260
do that if we wanted to you know I don't

880
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:50,570
know maybe we should I guess it's kind

881
00:44:48,260 --> 00:45:00,500
of free for us to do so so we could do

882
00:44:50,570 --> 00:45:04,180
something like you know this so you just

883
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:07,820
say like look this is where a hat goes

884
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:10,250
and you know here's where my belt goes

885
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:14,300
or something I don't know right so you

886
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:17,329
could imagine something like that where

887
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:20,060
you just had like a who knows you know

888
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:23,170
here's top of head

889
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:23,170
and here's

890
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:37,210
you know something like that or like

891
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:40,299
base of neck right we totally could do

892
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,159
that and if we did want to do that then

893
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:47,650
you know we could imagine augmenting it

894
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:50,949
with something like this so we could

895
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:54,430
essentially say you know okay there's an

896
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:56,949
HHA alignment point you know and an

897
00:45:54,429 --> 00:46:01,349
alignment point actually has a lot of

898
00:45:56,949 --> 00:46:03,939
information on it it says like you know

899
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:09,610
how big the child should be that goes

900
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:13,740
there what type it was so you know what

901
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,740
it what kind of alignment point it is

902
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:30,789
you know like that who knows and you

903
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:32,940
know some location like where it is you

904
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,940
know

905
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:46,360
something like that

906
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:49,659
so then we could say well now you know

907
00:46:46,360 --> 00:47:00,099
you get some of these you get HHA line

908
00:46:49,659 --> 00:47:01,779
points and you can just put those on if

909
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:04,089
you want them and then you can attach

910
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:07,540
things to other things and off you go

911
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:11,050
and then when we talk about this one how

912
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:12,969
this one attaches to other things what

913
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:16,210
we could basically say there was well

914
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:20,289
okay so we also have an HHA line point

915
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:29,289
for the parent and that maybe only has

916
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:31,360
one and it's the same thing right so you

917
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:33,519
know you could treat it like this where

918
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,860
you just have like here's the parent

919
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:41,110
side here's the child side and this

920
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:43,870
stuff is just not there right and maybe

921
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:49,360
get seven of these total and one of the

922
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:52,509
other one to make eight in all so if you

923
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:54,340
look at that that actually I mean it's

924
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,960
pretty good actually now I think about

925
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:59,289
it it seems pretty reasonable because

926
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:04,449
now we can basically say all right I've

927
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:08,849
got one point I specify which tells me

928
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:12,909
my size relative to my parent right

929
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:16,420
where it is on me and what I am trying

930
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:20,799
to attach to so basically like the heads

931
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:22,510
would all have a base of neck as their

932
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,550
attachment point because that's what

933
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:29,470
they're trying to go on to you know and

934
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:32,920
so we could encode what it's supposed to

935
00:48:29,469 --> 00:48:35,349
stick on to then in here when we got

936
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:40,300
child points you know a body would have

937
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:43,119
a P percent of where the neck was a size

938
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:46,800
of probably 1.0 on heroes anyway because

939
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:50,739
it's not going to be smaller than normal

940
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,550
and then the type would be base of neck

941
00:48:50,739 --> 00:48:54,669
so those two

942
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:56,650
matchup right and that way you could

943
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:58,630
just look when you want to put a bitmap

944
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:02,170
on another bitmap you can just look to

945
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:03,760
see where there is a point that is the

946
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:07,780
same as the point that the thing wants

947
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,060
to attach to and you just use it so that

948
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,000
would give us the ability to have lots

949
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:15,820
of different attachment points on things

950
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:25,449
and you know obviously each one of these

951
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:30,730
right has a total of four four byte

952
00:49:25,449 --> 00:49:33,519
values so it's 16 bytes per right and so

953
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:39,789
really you can even be more generous

954
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:42,130
here if you wanted to be I also say have

955
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:44,590
a none value so you know we could even

956
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:46,630
make it considerably more so in case you

957
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:51,430
wanted to have something that has stuff

958
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:55,180
stuck all over it for some reason or

959
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:59,769
where's multiple hats because you know

960
00:49:55,179 --> 00:50:00,429
you're making portal 2 or something you

961
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:04,659
could do that

962
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:06,039
now you know it seems pretty good the

963
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:07,869
only thing I would say is you know does

964
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:09,340
rotation need to be in there I mean it

965
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:11,319
could be that you want to wear a hat

966
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:14,950
like on the side of your head versus on

967
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:19,300
the top I don't know that that really

968
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:26,289
works particularly well so I don't know

969
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:36,190
that we want to have that in there seems

970
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:41,289
iffy to me kinda but there there you go

971
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:43,750
right so I think that's mostly

972
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:46,179
everything we would need so it would

973
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:54,340
look kind of like that and this stuff by

974
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:57,339
default would just be like zeroed out or

975
00:50:54,340 --> 00:51:02,579
set to point five point five and one as

976
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:02,579
default values might be more sensible

977
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:10,940
yeah and that'll be that well I mean

978
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,890
really can just be zeroed out because if

979
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,030
the type field was aged a bit that the

980
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:15,619
line none then you know it's

981
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:19,360
uninitialized and can't really be used

982
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:19,359
for anything so that's fine too

983
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:36,080
so I guess I'd put one more in here

984
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:40,750
which is if we're just free-floating in

985
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,750
the world like we're not actually

986
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:50,620
attached to anything then this is the

987
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:50,619
one to use as well right

988
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:14,170
and I guess when I think about that the

989
00:52:12,219 --> 00:52:15,969
only thing I'm not sure about is if

990
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:18,309
there's something that wants to be in

991
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:20,230
both places and wasps have specified

992
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:23,369
different values does it imply that you

993
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:26,369
sometimes need multiple parents as well

994
00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:26,369
right

995
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:49,590
so I guess what I would say is maybe we

996
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:54,570
just go absolutely nuts with this and

997
00:52:49,590 --> 00:53:02,250
just say like a line point 16 and then

998
00:52:54,570 --> 00:53:11,190
we just say all right and we say look if

999
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:12,659
you set the high bit here right which I

1000
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:15,420
technically don't know if it'll complain

1001
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:19,230
about this because C++ is terrible and

1002
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:20,670
Oasis bad at everything I don't know if

1003
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:23,340
you're allowed to have a high bit

1004
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:25,619
because I want to say that it maybe only

1005
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:29,460
wants these to be signed or some stupid

1006
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:31,859
thing like that but we'll find out so if

1007
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:34,070
we were to say that let's take a look

1008
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,070
here

1009
00:53:41,608 --> 00:53:48,808
yeah so this would have to be a bit

1010
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:50,249
larger to have that many wonder how many

1011
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:54,710
we could have without making ourselves

1012
00:53:50,248 --> 00:53:54,709
larger not much huh

1013
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:10,900
13 you 60 floors so there's one new 64

1014
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:13,179
so that would give us 12 so we would

1015
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:18,970
only be able to have six if we were

1016
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:21,419
gonna have the if we were gonna stay

1017
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:29,199
inside the size that we previously

1018
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:40,690
requested for these guys which is 128 2

1019
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:42,759
cache lines wide since I don't know that

1020
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:45,039
we need that many of them I guess I

1021
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:50,530
would be inclined to say maybe we just

1022
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:52,960
leave it at 6 for now because since the

1023
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:55,000
H at JS are just the resource format it

1024
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,539
seems like we could add more if we

1025
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,588
needed them later and then just rebuild

1026
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:04,599
the output data so it seems fine and

1027
00:55:01,588 --> 00:55:08,920
then we don't expand our footprint at

1028
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:11,798
all it keeps it relatively clean and we

1029
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:16,240
can also if we wanted to we could be a

1030
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:21,338
little bit more judicious with our use

1031
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:25,750
of sizes in general so for example we

1032
00:55:21,338 --> 00:55:28,119
could just make these more concise as

1033
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:32,530
well right like we could say that this

1034
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:37,568
is all done this way and it really

1035
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:40,109
wouldn't affect things much right so you

1036
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:40,108
could do that

1037
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:46,598
and then you could have twice as many

1038
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:49,000
write in the same size so you know we

1039
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:53,260
could do something like that for P

1040
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,599
percent this seems very smart to do it

1041
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:58,900
that way because you don't give up any

1042
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,809
precision you effectively have exact

1043
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,760
same precision for size it's a little

1044
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:05,530
bit hard to specify what that would mean

1045
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,940
because you'd have to say well how am I

1046
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:11,798
supposed to find this size in the first

1047
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:14,970
place like you know how do i encode the

1048
00:56:11,798 --> 00:56:14,969
amount of scale that I want

1049
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:19,360
into a u16 but I still think it's

1050
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:21,429
probably pretty easy I mean we're not

1051
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:24,099
going to encode sizes of like more than

1052
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:27,059
you know 50 or 60 or hundred or

1053
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:31,929
something so if you assume that you can

1054
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:35,739
you know you've got six five five three

1055
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:38,679
six total values right so one over six

1056
00:56:35,739 --> 00:56:41,199
five five three six there is that if I

1057
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:43,419
multiply that by a hundred to say that

1058
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:45,039
the maximum scale is a hundred then

1059
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:52,630
you'd still have precision all the way

1060
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:57,550
down to like 0.002 at worst right

1061
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:58,809
which seems fine so we can we can do it

1062
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,400
this way and then have a lot of them and

1063
00:56:58,809 --> 00:57:03,610
still not take up very much space either

1064
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:08,039
and the type field again not a big deal

1065
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:11,050
because we also know for that field I

1066
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:15,969
mean there's only gonna be like 30 or 40

1067
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:18,670
of these in our wildest dreams we're not

1068
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:21,909
gonna have 65,000 of them because oh my

1069
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:23,349
god I don't even want to know what kind

1070
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:25,420
of a world we've created if we have

1071
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:28,869
65,000 different ways that things can

1072
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:31,680
attach to each other the designers have

1073
00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:35,589
gone crazy if that's what happened right

1074
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:36,969
so I think that's probably good I think

1075
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:45,280
that's roughly where we would want to be

1076
00:57:36,969 --> 00:57:54,669
and so if we just go ahead and clean

1077
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:57,370
that up a little bit then I think we're

1078
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:59,349
good I maybe would say that

1079
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:00,519
HHA bitmap alignment world is maybe

1080
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:03,969
you'll not right

1081
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:09,400
maybe there's default so in other words

1082
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:13,569
if I don't know what I should be doing

1083
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:15,070
then I use this one so if you attach me

1084
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:19,390
to nothing like I'm floating in the

1085
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:21,610
world I would use it and I'll also use

1086
00:58:19,389 --> 00:58:23,889
that if you attach me to something I

1087
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:27,880
just don't know what it is so like you

1088
00:58:23,889 --> 00:58:28,989
know I attached you to top of head on

1089
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,230
somebody but you don't specify

1090
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:34,239
top-of-head then I'll use the default if

1091
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:37,179
there was one specified you know what I

1092
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:39,278
mean so there's kind of like a fallback

1093
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:42,909
procedure there where you know default

1094
00:58:39,278 --> 00:58:45,518
will match anything and it's overridden

1095
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:47,828
if you can find a specific match you

1096
00:58:45,518 --> 00:58:52,899
know what I mean so that seems

1097
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:54,519
reasonable maybe possibly who knows and

1098
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,680
that allow so that would allow Philips

1099
00:58:54,518 --> 00:58:59,528
to specify twelve alignment pieces of

1100
00:58:56,679 --> 00:59:03,098
alignment information which seems good

1101
00:58:59,528 --> 00:59:04,449
and hopefully would get us past anything

1102
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:06,940
that we might need to do but again we

1103
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:11,048
could also expand that if we felt like

1104
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:16,298
we needed to for some reason so I think

1105
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:24,009
that's okay again these are for you 16

1106
00:59:16,298 --> 00:59:28,059
so this right here excuse me so this

1107
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:33,940
right here is is 8 bytes right / I want

1108
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:39,490
to say right - 2 - 2 so it's a total of

1109
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:45,630
8 bytes which means that you know let me

1110
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:45,629
just think about how much that would be

1111
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:57,369
yeah so 12 8 byte alignments right is 96

1112
00:59:55,239 --> 01:00:00,548
bytes and then we've got the dimensions

1113
00:59:57,369 --> 01:00:04,990
here that are specified that gives us us

1114
01:00:00,548 --> 01:00:06,548
more there really is no way to trim that

1115
01:00:04,989 --> 01:00:08,348
down in any way that we probably care

1116
01:00:06,548 --> 01:00:09,730
about because we could change that to 16

1117
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:11,230
but it wouldn't help us get an extra

1118
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:13,240
alignment point in there so I'm not sure

1119
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:19,230
that we really care about that

1120
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:23,068
what we could do here though however mmm

1121
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:23,068
we could do something like this

1122
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:30,200
and so that way all of these things are

1123
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:33,029
encoded in u16s so they're all gonna be

1124
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:35,819
the same size there and then we'd have

1125
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:37,500
two more to play with here in case we

1126
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:39,230
needed to use those for something else

1127
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:41,880
and we just clear that Missouri normally

1128
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:44,880
the other thing we could do there so the

1129
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,860
bitmap Jim is specified but the other

1130
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,720
thing we could specify there is what the

1131
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:50,700
original dimension of the bitmap was I

1132
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:52,739
don't know if we really need that for

1133
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:55,739
anything I don't think we do because we

1134
01:00:52,739 --> 01:01:00,149
could just use that to set the initial

1135
01:00:55,739 --> 01:01:03,509
size parameter inside the align point

1136
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:06,240
and so I don't know that we care

1137
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:12,480
particularly much about what that

1138
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:15,049
original dimension is you just probably

1139
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,050
don't care

1140
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:31,920
so I'm going to say let's leave it like

1141
01:01:26,909 --> 01:01:33,598
that and let's verify that if I up this

1142
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:38,460
by one listen that we aligned it right

1143
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:41,910
yet the sizes is wrong so I think that's

1144
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:44,940
everything there if we look here at when

1145
01:01:41,909 --> 01:01:47,368
we're in the hej editor and we're

1146
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:50,400
dumping the information the alignment

1147
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:52,619
information is now incomplete because

1148
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:58,559
we've got multiple alignment points that

1149
01:01:52,619 --> 01:02:02,160
we might want to print out right and so

1150
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:04,499
what I'd like to do here is all you know

1151
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,118
augment this when we see a bitmap I'd

1152
01:02:04,498 --> 01:02:09,449
like to go through and actually print

1153
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:11,849
out all of the alignment points so I'm

1154
01:02:09,449 --> 01:02:16,639
gonna say well let's call it point index

1155
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:20,369
I'm gonna say asset oops

1156
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:24,960
zero point index is less than array

1157
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:31,739
count did we cast this bitmap I think

1158
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:36,179
yet we did bitmap align points so just

1159
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:43,048
iterate over all of them and if it's

1160
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:47,098
specified then I will print it so it's a

1161
01:02:43,048 --> 01:02:50,460
line point point equals bitmap the line

1162
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:53,309
points point index so I've pulled out

1163
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:58,460
that point and I'm just gonna look to

1164
01:02:53,309 --> 01:03:01,410
see if the type is not you know none

1165
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:05,909
then I'm going to print out the data

1166
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:07,969
from that particular point now while I'm

1167
01:03:05,909 --> 01:03:10,828
printing this I probably want to use

1168
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:14,778
indentation of some kind so I probably

1169
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:14,778
want to do something like this

1170
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:27,659
and I probably want to do that if it's

1171
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:40,849
not the first one right so I want to do

1172
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:40,849
something like and here you know if

1173
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,560
something like that so you know if this

1174
01:03:53,610 --> 01:04:00,150
is the first one then let's just mark

1175
01:03:55,559 --> 01:04:02,340
the factors alignment in this thing and

1176
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:09,559
then we'll print out that particular

1177
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:09,559
point so you know whichever one it is

1178
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:17,970
which is point index we'll say here's

1179
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:24,059
this one we want to print out the type

1180
01:04:17,969 --> 01:04:27,179
so we want like a line type name from

1181
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:30,690
and I'm gonna say whatever this type is

1182
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:35,250
give me back string I could print right

1183
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:38,880
so in here I can say what type it is

1184
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:41,730
and then I want to be able to print out

1185
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,039
this stuff so the P percent the size the

1186
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:47,400
type we've already said what it was so

1187
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:56,099
we just need these two now and so in

1188
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:59,910
there I've got point P percent and just

1189
01:04:56,099 --> 01:05:03,299
to make that back into a float because

1190
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:07,710
these are encoded like as you sixteens I

1191
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:10,369
probably want to say something like this

1192
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:10,369
right

1193
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:23,549
so we can look at them as percentages

1194
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:26,460
rather than looking at them as u16s

1195
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:32,550
because you know that's the way that

1196
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:35,789
we've encoded it and the size is another

1197
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:36,690
one of those now because this is

1198
01:05:35,789 --> 01:05:38,730
something we're probably going to do

1199
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:41,460
frequently we may want to bake that

1200
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:49,309
encoding into a function so we may want

1201
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:49,309
to do something like you know like this

1202
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:59,759
so we can pass in one of these points

1203
01:05:53,460 --> 01:06:01,619
and get the decoded version in a

1204
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:05,610
predictable way in case we want to

1205
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:08,069
change the encoding later and again as

1206
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:10,860
you know I am NOT a fan of using get or

1207
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:13,980
set functions I think they're dumb and a

1208
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:16,349
waste of everyone's time but once you

1209
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:19,050
actually have work to do then they're a

1210
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:20,369
good idea because hey now I can just

1211
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:22,320
have that work done for me and I'm

1212
01:06:20,369 --> 01:06:24,210
actually creating a function that does

1213
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:27,390
something not just wasting everyone's

1214
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:29,400
time and so in this case since we've

1215
01:06:27,389 --> 01:06:32,069
already got that happening everyone's

1216
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:37,680
going to have to do this work let's just

1217
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:39,809
make that a utility so that everyone can

1218
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:41,519
call it and that gets us both things it

1219
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:44,969
allows us to change how we encode it

1220
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:47,090
later and it makes it easier for the

1221
01:06:44,969 --> 01:06:49,619
people calling it so it's a win-win

1222
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:52,350
instead of a lose-lose like it would

1223
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:56,159
have been if we just added it for a pair

1224
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:57,960
value like type for example so that

1225
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,839
allows us to create recreate the

1226
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:05,639
percentages and then I can just do that

1227
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:08,610
instead so I can do P percent equals get

1228
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:10,920
P percent and then I just passed the

1229
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:13,620
point that I'm asking for here and then

1230
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,940
I can just do P % XP percent Y and it's

1231
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:16,559
you know much easier for me to use

1232
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,240
because now I don't have to understand

1233
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,639
how those values are encoded because

1234
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:23,449
they are encoded

1235
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:27,710
so get science would be the same way you

1236
01:07:23,449 --> 01:07:31,309
know it's something like this but it's

1237
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:32,960
not exactly this and that's the that's

1238
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:35,090
the thing that like I sang for is a

1239
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:39,230
little bit confusing to think about

1240
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:41,390
right so if we did this then you could

1241
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:44,539
you could represent any size you wanted

1242
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:46,730
up to 1.0 but you couldn't represent

1243
01:07:44,539 --> 01:07:49,779
more than 1.0 and so what I think we

1244
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:51,920
want to do here is say look there's a

1245
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:54,950
additional multiplier on the front end

1246
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,340
that just says that's the maximum scale

1247
01:07:54,949 --> 01:08:00,710
you can ever scale something and

1248
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:02,690
everything else is going to be less than

1249
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:04,670
that but it's still significant more

1250
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:08,409
than 1.0 right and that seems reasonable

1251
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:08,409
to me so I think that's what we'll do

1252
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:19,250
and could also just been uniformity sake

1253
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:20,810
do it this way just makes it easier to

1254
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:22,550
inspect those values than to bugger when

1255
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:23,630
we're you know invariably stepping

1256
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:25,600
through this because we want to verify

1257
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:28,039
what's working and what's not and so on

1258
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,560
so there's the point index there's the

1259
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:33,350
string there's the three values that we

1260
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:37,550
want to know in terms of the location of

1261
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:40,190
things and their size that's all we

1262
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:45,650
really need for this part of the process

1263
01:08:40,189 --> 01:08:47,569
but we do need a way to get this data in

1264
01:08:45,649 --> 01:08:51,170
here and you know it's the same as you

1265
01:08:47,569 --> 01:08:53,420
can see we've got the same stuff that

1266
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:55,250
we're talking about here for other

1267
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:57,289
things like how to get the tag names and

1268
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:59,479
so on and so what I'd like to do there

1269
01:08:57,289 --> 01:09:04,399
is just say yeah let's let's do the same

1270
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:07,129
thing for the aligned names and I should

1271
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:11,569
probably just follow exactly what we've

1272
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:15,020
been doing right so you know this exact

1273
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:17,989
thing we should probably just do for the

1274
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:21,790
alignment points as well right so in

1275
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:25,909
here when we say a line type name from

1276
01:09:21,789 --> 01:09:28,250
just like we had here and you know I

1277
01:09:25,909 --> 01:09:31,849
guess thinking about it going forwards

1278
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:33,380
we're probably going to need this to be

1279
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:36,350
parsable too if we

1280
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:38,329
do you have these in a in a string

1281
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:40,759
format that we're saving out so really I

1282
01:09:38,329 --> 01:09:45,158
think we want this whole process like

1283
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:47,350
this whole thing probably needs to be

1284
01:09:45,158 --> 01:09:52,638
probably needs to be there as well

1285
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:58,010
right so I'm just gonna go ahead and

1286
01:09:52,639 --> 01:10:03,319
copy this and put it in here and so what

1287
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:09,139
we're gonna have here is assuming this

1288
01:10:03,319 --> 01:10:12,170
is a a line point name or a line point

1289
01:10:09,139 --> 01:10:24,230
type name something like that right and

1290
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:26,149
this would be a line point type there

1291
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:28,279
you go

1292
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:30,019
and so this is literally just gonna

1293
01:10:28,279 --> 01:10:31,550
provide that same exact kind of

1294
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:35,080
translation table but for a different

1295
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:35,079
that type of thing right

1296
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:45,619
and so in here we've got this many of

1297
01:10:40,579 --> 01:10:53,840
them and it's gonna be a little bit

1298
01:10:45,619 --> 01:10:56,000
different so there is a little bit more

1299
01:10:53,840 --> 01:11:01,090
we have to do so it's not as

1300
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,090
straightforward but it's pretty similar

1301
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:27,260
so that's what we expect so far and then

1302
01:11:24,859 --> 01:11:30,589
in here where we go to pull this out if

1303
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:50,690
I say instead of tag name for my D if I

1304
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:53,390
say I'm a line name from type so if I

1305
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:55,579
pass one of those types in and then we

1306
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:57,920
look it up we would do exactly the same

1307
01:11:55,579 --> 01:12:03,769
thing here we look through all of the

1308
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:06,529
names that are in the mix we look at one

1309
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:08,840
of them and we see if the types match

1310
01:12:06,529 --> 01:12:12,769
and if the types do match then we just

1311
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:14,900
return whatever the name of that one

1312
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:18,200
actually is if not we just return

1313
01:12:14,899 --> 01:12:24,639
unknown and the same thing would happen

1314
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:24,639
here so HHA fit map a line type when we

1315
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:35,750
look through here we say a line point

1316
01:12:31,789 --> 01:12:38,569
type from name you pass in the name we

1317
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:40,819
search through the list so it's not an

1318
01:12:38,569 --> 01:12:42,859
asset tag ID it's an H it's a bitmap a

1319
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:46,549
line type that comes back we assume that

1320
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:52,460
we can't match it so it's a none we look

1321
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:57,880
through all the names and if we

1322
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:57,880
eventually find one that that matches

1323
01:12:58,329 --> 01:13:01,869
then we return it

1324
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:10,529
right so the only thing that's important

1325
01:13:08,699 --> 01:13:15,649
to remember here is that when we're

1326
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:15,649
working with these we need to also check

1327
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:25,289
for the parent flag because that's going

1328
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:27,960
to be welded onto the type field and so

1329
01:13:25,289 --> 01:13:29,760
you know we want to be able to crack

1330
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:35,670
that as well and so one way to do that

1331
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:42,449
is is is to parent and you can pass that

1332
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:48,960
in here and that just says okay you know

1333
01:13:42,449 --> 01:13:57,119
if the the type has that flag set then

1334
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:59,600
it is and then the other thing you can

1335
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:59,599
say is

1336
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:16,219
get me the type so here we would say I

1337
01:14:18,859 --> 01:14:25,828
want to cast us to an align type and I

1338
01:14:22,618 --> 01:14:27,868
want to only have the part of the type

1339
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:36,118
that doesn't have the rest of it in it

1340
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:37,738
right like so so we have yeah as I said

1341
01:14:36,118 --> 01:14:43,589
we have this so I'm gonna go ahead and

1342
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:46,788
put those in here just we can expand

1343
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:50,998
them out a bit and see them clearly and

1344
01:14:46,788 --> 01:14:53,248
again this is just all of the encoding

1345
01:14:50,998 --> 01:14:56,538
and decoding work here well it's really

1346
01:14:53,248 --> 01:15:00,349
just a decoding work we haven't done

1347
01:14:56,538 --> 01:15:06,179
encoders for these but that's you know

1348
01:15:00,349 --> 01:15:07,918
probably less important we may not

1349
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:09,809
actually need those to be their own

1350
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:11,248
functions because less people are going

1351
01:15:09,809 --> 01:15:13,679
to be doing that possibly only one

1352
01:15:11,248 --> 01:15:18,478
person and then we can just have that in

1353
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:19,979
line all right so now you can kind of

1354
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:21,780
see those a little more clearly there

1355
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:25,229
but but what they're doing is very

1356
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:29,038
obvious right so I've got the align

1357
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:32,880
points there and I can crack out the

1358
01:15:29,038 --> 01:15:35,130
data from them now when I do when I need

1359
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,340
the information from them I can say oh

1360
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:40,618
is it one that goes to parent or not and

1361
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:44,429
what's the type so that way you know

1362
01:15:40,618 --> 01:15:45,658
when I'm actually know what happened

1363
01:15:44,429 --> 01:15:47,880
there what I'm actually doing something

1364
01:15:45,658 --> 01:15:51,679
like this if I compile it it'll give me

1365
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,679
an error because this is not oh well

1366
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:56,248
it'll give me an error because it's

1367
01:15:54,779 --> 01:15:58,639
named wrong that wasn't actually what I

1368
01:15:56,248 --> 01:15:58,639
was going to say

1369
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:05,690
what I was trying to say is this error

1370
01:16:03,828 --> 01:16:07,069
is when I want to do explain so it'll

1371
01:16:05,689 --> 01:16:08,359
give me an error because it's not the

1372
01:16:07,069 --> 01:16:10,549
right type and that's good because

1373
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:13,189
really this isn't that type this is the

1374
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:15,320
type with with a possible flag well done

1375
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:22,488
and at the top and so what I want to do

1376
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:27,618
is have a way of getting the align type

1377
01:16:22,488 --> 01:16:30,259
here from from this and that's what I'm

1378
01:16:27,618 --> 01:16:34,359
going to print which is cracked and then

1379
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:37,789
I would say you know is it to parent and

1380
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:39,469
that's to get another thing right so in

1381
01:16:37,789 --> 01:16:44,380
here I would print this and then I'd

1382
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:46,578
also want to print something else like

1383
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:50,868
it doesn't attach forward it doesn't

1384
01:16:46,578 --> 01:16:54,799
attach you know I don't know how we want

1385
01:16:50,868 --> 01:16:58,098
to write that probably I'd want to write

1386
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:01,250
that as like outgoing or incoming so

1387
01:16:58,099 --> 01:17:05,539
maybe I would do this I know this is

1388
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:07,340
hard to say but so if it attaches back

1389
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:10,488
to the parent it looks like that if it

1390
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:15,529
attaches to a chart to something on the

1391
01:17:10,488 --> 01:17:17,750
other side you know what I mean honestly

1392
01:17:15,529 --> 01:17:24,259
I feel like it maybe should be written

1393
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:25,969
like this so like if it goes to the

1394
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:27,980
parent then you'll see a little thing

1395
01:17:25,969 --> 01:17:30,289
that sort of says like it's back going

1396
01:17:27,979 --> 01:17:33,259
back that way so it would meet something

1397
01:17:30,289 --> 01:17:35,658
on the other end and then if it's not

1398
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:37,190
going to the parent then it's an

1399
01:17:35,658 --> 01:17:39,589
outgoing connection and would have a

1400
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:46,039
thing going that way you know I don't

1401
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:48,039
know don't look at me uh that's all well

1402
01:17:46,039 --> 01:17:51,590
and good

1403
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:55,039
lying type there and I think that gives

1404
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:57,289
us what we want the only issue here is

1405
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:59,569
our percent s is I don't remember if we

1406
01:17:57,289 --> 01:18:05,029
ever actually fixed those so that we

1407
01:17:59,569 --> 01:18:07,058
could print strings ok it looks like

1408
01:18:05,029 --> 01:18:11,569
we're still doing dot stars for those

1409
01:18:07,059 --> 01:18:14,300
and I'm not sure that that's like such a

1410
01:18:11,569 --> 01:18:16,279
good idea because you could see how no

1411
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:18,770
this gets you know with all the dot

1412
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:24,050
stars so I kind of feel like to a

1413
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:26,030
certain extent you know I don't remember

1414
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:29,480
where we put this stuff probably in

1415
01:18:26,029 --> 01:18:38,689
utils right because it's just orb shared

1416
01:18:29,479 --> 01:18:41,479
or something yeah so in here you know

1417
01:18:38,689 --> 01:18:46,609
when we look at what the type of the

1418
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:51,949
thing is it's coming through in here you

1419
01:18:46,609 --> 01:18:54,920
can see us grab a string and we could

1420
01:18:51,949 --> 01:18:56,960
instead just have another case where we

1421
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:59,810
know that there are strings that just

1422
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:03,289
get pushed on as strings you know I'm

1423
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:07,520
saying and it would require us to

1424
01:19:03,289 --> 01:19:09,500
finding a different letter code that's

1425
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,450
like non-standard which is a little bit

1426
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,220
bad because compilers now have welded in

1427
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:16,220
checking because of course that's how

1428
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:17,630
they chose to solve that problem instead

1429
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:20,900
of just letting you write your own

1430
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:22,310
checking yeah if you want to know how to

1431
01:19:20,899 --> 01:19:24,679
do this correctly go look at how John

1432
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:26,810
did it in his language it's actually

1433
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:30,710
correct so you can add your own codes

1434
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:32,090
and check them which is kind of the

1435
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:33,319
obvious thing that someone who

1436
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:36,529
programmed computers for a living would

1437
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:42,109
do and therefore not what the C++ people

1438
01:19:36,529 --> 01:19:44,719
do whatever so what you want to do here

1439
01:19:42,109 --> 01:19:46,609
is you want to go well is that worth it

1440
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,289
I think it probably is cuz this is just

1441
01:19:46,609 --> 01:19:53,179
super error-prone like it's just not

1442
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:56,720
good and so constantly having this

1443
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:58,340
notion of how things are gonna be casted

1444
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,930
and dealt with it's just it's just bad

1445
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:02,300
right it leads to a lot of air proneness

1446
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:04,039
so I think because we're using that more

1447
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:06,829
here I just want to go ahead and support

1448
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:11,899
that and so let's say we did add one

1449
01:20:06,829 --> 01:20:14,199
here you know I don't know what would be

1450
01:20:11,899 --> 01:20:18,019
an unused letter but like a capital S

1451
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:20,210
might be an example of something

1452
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:24,470
reasonable to use and if we then just

1453
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:26,510
grab this here and do the exact same

1454
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:28,070
case really all we're saying is that

1455
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:30,650
it's mostly this

1456
01:20:28,069 --> 01:20:33,738
is this case but we're grabbing on a

1457
01:20:30,649 --> 01:20:35,868
string like that so we're gonna get a

1458
01:20:33,738 --> 01:20:39,888
you know this kind of composite case

1459
01:20:35,868 --> 01:20:42,859
right and so when we do this temp equals

1460
01:20:39,889 --> 01:20:47,810
thing we're actually gonna do it

1461
01:20:42,859 --> 01:20:50,179
this way to grabbed out of the buffer I

1462
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:51,770
don't know why we say obaid precision

1463
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:57,800
and then we proceed to obey the

1464
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:59,150
precision so I think maybe we were only

1465
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,820
talking about with there or something

1466
01:20:59,149 --> 01:21:03,379
I'm not sure so that's a little bit hard

1467
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:06,319
to square I'm not sure what that to do

1468
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:08,389
actually means in this case but if the

1469
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:10,158
precision is specified then here we say

1470
01:21:08,389 --> 01:21:12,380
like okay you know well it's less

1471
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:15,319
imprecision take a look at the size or

1472
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:18,199
whatever and then you know otherwise we

1473
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:19,670
use the full length of the string so

1474
01:21:18,198 --> 01:21:22,069
what we can do here is something a

1475
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:26,420
little bit better what we can do instead

1476
01:21:22,069 --> 01:21:28,639
is say look set temp test size equal to

1477
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:31,609
what the strings length would be because

1478
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,560
we know that we already can get that for

1479
01:21:31,609 --> 01:21:36,529
free it's with just a known value we

1480
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,630
load and then if the precision is

1481
01:21:36,529 --> 01:21:41,779
specified then all we have to do is use

1482
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:44,929
the lesser of the two so if you specify

1483
01:21:41,779 --> 01:21:47,988
a particular precision then rather than

1484
01:21:44,929 --> 01:21:48,980
doing this we can just say all right if

1485
01:21:47,988 --> 01:21:51,348
temp test

1486
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:53,779
size was going to be greater than the

1487
01:21:51,349 --> 01:21:58,670
precision then clamp it down to the

1488
01:21:53,779 --> 01:22:03,889
precision but otherwise you don't need

1489
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:05,539
to do anything right and so you know we

1490
01:22:03,889 --> 01:22:09,139
can even make that part of a compound

1491
01:22:05,539 --> 01:22:11,179
predicate here like this and so if we

1492
01:22:09,139 --> 01:22:13,819
would need to clamp then clamp otherwise

1493
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:16,250
don't and then when we get the temp test

1494
01:22:13,819 --> 01:22:19,448
at out of this we would just say okay

1495
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:19,448
however much

1496
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:35,940
I assume we want the app to always be at

1497
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:37,889
the end it looks like so we just want to

1498
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:40,939
advance to how much we do so that's fine

1499
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:45,750
as well right so I think that would just

1500
01:22:40,939 --> 01:22:50,158
output a string for us directly you know

1501
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:55,319
with no with no other fuss and such

1502
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:58,939
right let me take a look at where that

1503
01:22:55,319 --> 01:23:02,779
was trying to happen oh sorry

1504
01:22:58,939 --> 01:23:02,779
so why isn't that

1505
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:22,840
okay so it's sets so this is just I

1506
01:23:20,698 --> 01:23:29,879
don't know why we wrote this like this

1507
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:34,029
so this is just temp as well right so

1508
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:39,760
I'm not sure why it wasn't written like

1509
01:23:34,029 --> 01:23:42,158
that but you know it wasn't so I'm not

1510
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:44,050
sure anyway so what we can do here now

1511
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:51,519
is just say look that's the capital S

1512
01:23:44,050 --> 01:24:02,860
and that'll print that out oh all right

1513
01:23:51,520 --> 01:24:03,869
looks like somebody oh man I take it

1514
01:24:02,859 --> 01:24:07,809
back

1515
01:24:03,868 --> 01:24:12,750
we're not using our string out are we

1516
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:18,100
here hmm that's unfortunate

1517
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:21,279
well I tried I tried to be good but

1518
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:27,539
we're not using our runtime library so

1519
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:31,929
that's unfortunate that's really too bad

1520
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:34,889
we tried right I mean we tried we tried

1521
01:24:31,929 --> 01:24:37,090
to make a good system but again you know

1522
01:24:34,889 --> 01:24:40,539
yet another reason not to use a C

1523
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:49,020
runtime library right can't make your

1524
01:24:40,539 --> 01:24:49,019
own printf so we guess I'm okay with

1525
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:54,340
guess I'm okay with that

1526
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,369
I don't love it but that's where we're

1527
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,369
at

1528
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:10,960
now that that's taken care of I think

1529
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:13,699
we're good to go on the HHA edit front

1530
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:17,029
but now we got to go in here and do some

1531
01:25:13,699 --> 01:25:19,069
other saucy maneuvers now one thing I

1532
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:21,229
should mention is that when we're

1533
01:25:19,069 --> 01:25:33,039
loading the HHA bitmap

1534
01:25:21,229 --> 01:25:36,919
these zeroes in yes so in this case here

1535
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:39,590
we need to have this b + HH a bitmap v 0

1536
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:46,789
because we did update how that's stored

1537
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:49,310
right so if you look at I mean this is

1538
01:25:46,789 --> 01:25:51,739
not really necessary because really what

1539
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:53,780
we should do eventually is just be able

1540
01:25:51,739 --> 01:25:59,659
to rebuild them without having the old

1541
01:25:53,779 --> 01:26:02,050
ones ever loaded but you know it used to

1542
01:25:59,659 --> 01:26:02,050
look like this

1543
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:07,250
and so you know if we want to continue

1544
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:15,020
to have the ability to load that old

1545
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:17,149
format we should respect it right so

1546
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:19,760
that's the way we were doing that and

1547
01:26:17,149 --> 01:26:22,489
what that implies is that here when we

1548
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,199
actually load the data in we can't

1549
01:26:22,489 --> 01:26:26,569
actually do a trivial conversion like

1550
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:28,250
this anymore what we have to do is

1551
01:26:26,569 --> 01:26:29,779
actually convert the data from the old

1552
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:32,960
format to the new format so that we

1553
01:26:29,779 --> 01:26:35,179
properly included now that's not

1554
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,480
particularly hard to do because in this

1555
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:41,510
case it's really pretty straightforward

1556
01:26:37,479 --> 01:26:49,129
we clear the bitmap asset out I believe

1557
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:53,270
to 0 first or at least I hope we do let

1558
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:55,869
me just see if that's actually true no

1559
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:55,870
asset

1560
01:26:57,430 --> 01:27:02,690
yes so we clear it out so everything's

1561
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:04,790
set to zero so we only need to set

1562
01:27:02,689 --> 01:27:07,729
fields that we actually get from the

1563
01:27:04,789 --> 01:27:09,350
original khat one so if we look at what

1564
01:27:07,729 --> 01:27:16,299
those are right there just the

1565
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:16,300
dimensions and the align percentage

1566
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:24,769
right that's what we're actually gonna

1567
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:28,759
get but we need to encode them

1568
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:31,460
differently so when we actually set the

1569
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:34,760
encoding for these we probably want like

1570
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:35,930
I saying to do an in-and-out so for

1571
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,850
things that are going to encoded in

1572
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:40,880
multiple places we probably want to be

1573
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:44,990
able to do those in and out so for a

1574
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:55,039
line percentage I'm gonna read it out of

1575
01:27:44,989 --> 01:28:05,960
the destination like so yeah so a line

1576
01:27:55,039 --> 01:28:08,600
percentage of zero and one kind of want

1577
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:17,960
that to be here but for coder thinks

1578
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:21,789
otherwise so that's that's that right so

1579
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:25,819
I can get my aligned percentage like so

1580
01:28:21,789 --> 01:28:28,390
and then I can get my dimensions largely

1581
01:28:25,819 --> 01:28:28,389
directly

1582
01:28:32,448 --> 01:28:36,000
and the only difference here is I have

1583
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:37,859
to truncate the music scene but we know

1584
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,960
we don't have any bitmaps larger than 65

1585
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:42,238
thousand pixels so this is free because

1586
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:46,230
we all know all of the visa assets that

1587
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:48,928
exist and none of them have that so once

1588
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:51,868
we grab that let me copy this then all

1589
01:28:48,929 --> 01:28:54,510
we need to do is generate one synthetic

1590
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:59,460
align point that mimics our old one

1591
01:28:54,510 --> 01:29:05,969
align point that we had right so in a

1592
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:09,289
line points zero which I think I'll make

1593
01:29:05,969 --> 01:29:09,289
it a little easier in myself and just

1594
01:29:09,859 --> 01:29:19,319
well maybe what I'll do here it actually

1595
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:24,060
is just do one in code that kind of

1596
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:29,039
writes the whole thing so maybe what

1597
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:33,179
I'll do is something like this so set

1598
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:37,738
the first align point right and set it

1599
01:29:33,179 --> 01:29:41,730
to when I'm what I've got here

1600
01:29:37,738 --> 01:29:43,979
right so it's an align point that goes

1601
01:29:41,729 --> 01:29:49,348
to the parent it's not a child align

1602
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:52,769
point right so I want to say that it's

1603
01:29:49,349 --> 01:29:58,319
to parent I want to say that it's the

1604
01:29:52,770 --> 01:30:01,230
default right something like this I want

1605
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:02,729
to say that the size is 1.0 and I want

1606
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:06,348
to say that the align percentage is the

1607
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:10,019
thing that I read out of the source file

1608
01:30:06,349 --> 01:30:11,610
right now I don't know if I really want

1609
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:15,420
to were these two together but maybe I

1610
01:30:11,609 --> 01:30:20,579
do so maybe I would just say something

1611
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:24,739
like this and the other way I can do it

1612
01:30:20,579 --> 01:30:24,738
is comma true and have it do the or

1613
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:30,129
[Music]

1614
01:30:31,149 --> 01:30:39,409
maybe like that I don't know I'm of

1615
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:42,920
mixed feelings on that because in the

1616
01:30:39,409 --> 01:30:44,269
one hand I I'm not doing the or makes it

1617
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:47,779
so that I can pass a boolean pretty

1618
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:49,730
cleanly here from some source on the

1619
01:30:47,779 --> 01:30:52,789
other hand when it's bare like that it's

1620
01:30:49,729 --> 01:30:56,149
a little bit ugly so we'll see but

1621
01:30:52,789 --> 01:30:58,489
anyway let's just call it that way for

1622
01:30:56,149 --> 01:31:00,529
now and then what I'm going to do is

1623
01:30:58,489 --> 01:31:02,719
inside here where we've got the stuff

1624
01:31:00,529 --> 01:31:06,579
that does the decode I'm gonna put in a

1625
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:06,579
thing that does the encode right

1626
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:15,500
and so what I'll do here is just say

1627
01:31:11,810 --> 01:31:19,280
pass me in a line point as my

1628
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:31,010
destination and then pass me in a line

1629
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:37,429
point type why we didn't just call this

1630
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:41,420
a line point type or maybe we did I feel

1631
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:44,090
like it's a little weird right like this

1632
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:45,859
is called an haja line point and this is

1633
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:50,380
called a bitmap a line type which is

1634
01:31:45,859 --> 01:31:50,380
dumb it should look like that

1635
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:19,880
let me just clean that a little bit

1636
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:23,210
there we go all right

1637
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:25,609
much better so anyway once we get all

1638
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:27,949
that in there we should be able to just

1639
01:32:25,609 --> 01:32:35,649
do one that truly sets it as well so

1640
01:32:27,949 --> 01:32:35,649
when I've got this destination here

1641
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:47,239
parent and then we've got our size and

1642
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:49,129
then we've got our key percent here's

1643
01:32:47,239 --> 01:32:51,649
all the information that we want to set

1644
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:55,520
in this thing and what I'm going to do

1645
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:58,849
is just fill it out right so I'm going

1646
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:01,460
to say okay you got the P percent we got

1647
01:32:58,850 --> 01:33:08,740
the size we got the type this is all the

1648
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:08,739
stuff that we need actually put in there

1649
01:33:10,029 --> 01:33:24,170
and so I will say this is the type board

1650
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:26,779
with two parents and so there we're just

1651
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:28,819
saying look if we know the type goes in

1652
01:33:26,779 --> 01:33:32,689
the type field we know that two parent

1653
01:33:28,819 --> 01:33:34,279
is going to or in either the two parent

1654
01:33:32,689 --> 01:33:36,859
flag or nothing depending on whether

1655
01:33:34,279 --> 01:33:39,500
it's set and so that'll take care of

1656
01:33:36,859 --> 01:33:42,920
that part of it the size we then have to

1657
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:45,710
encode into a range so that we can use

1658
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:49,789
it as a 16-bit value here so what we

1659
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:53,600
want to do there is say for both that

1660
01:33:49,789 --> 01:33:58,039
and P percent we want to essentially do

1661
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:59,660
look we got a cast us to a you 16 but

1662
01:33:58,039 --> 01:34:03,970
first we got to convert it so when you

1663
01:33:59,659 --> 01:34:03,970
pass in like you know the P percent

1664
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:16,460
whatever that P percent values

1665
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:18,650
X is cuz I gotta do this twice whatever

1666
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:21,289
that P percent values X is I just want

1667
01:34:18,649 --> 01:34:25,250
to blow it out to however big a you 16

1668
01:34:21,289 --> 01:34:28,670
could be and then leave it at that

1669
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:30,710
right so literally all we're doing here

1670
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:35,270
is saying look it's a zero to one value

1671
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:38,750
that we're talking about so when we go

1672
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:41,510
to read it just multiply it by six five

1673
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:43,220
five three five and store that as a you

1674
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:44,630
16 because we know that's the way we're

1675
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:46,550
going to reverse convert it later and

1676
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:48,529
that'll be the closest we can get to the

1677
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:51,289
input floating point value for the

1678
01:34:48,529 --> 01:34:53,750
science we'll do the same thing we just

1679
01:34:51,289 --> 01:35:00,229
say look we know we've got this funky

1680
01:34:53,750 --> 01:35:01,340
kind of like you know the other way to

1681
01:35:00,229 --> 01:35:03,859
look at this would be look we're just

1682
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:07,819
solving the equation right we've got you

1683
01:35:03,859 --> 01:35:09,739
know stored equals you 16 max over P

1684
01:35:07,819 --> 01:35:13,429
percent so if we want to get people sent

1685
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:18,439
back it's just you know swapping the the

1686
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:20,210
sides that that's already on so anyway

1687
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:22,069
hopefully everyone sees that and I don't

1688
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:23,539
do it on the blackboard but if anyone's

1689
01:35:22,069 --> 01:35:24,710
confused about that I can do it on the

1690
01:35:23,539 --> 01:35:28,909
blackboard it's just I'm literally

1691
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:34,220
solving the equation you know if result

1692
01:35:28,909 --> 01:35:36,139
x equals this right which is what we're

1693
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:39,860
saying here then obviously if what I

1694
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:43,070
wanted to do was get back what's being

1695
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:45,409
stored in here then I just need to

1696
01:35:43,069 --> 01:35:51,559
reverse this equation right so I need to

1697
01:35:45,409 --> 01:35:53,359
multiply both sides by P percent so that

1698
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,730
clears it out of the denominator and

1699
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:57,529
puts it into the numerator times the

1700
01:35:55,729 --> 01:35:59,949
numerator but on to the other side the

1701
01:35:57,529 --> 01:36:04,719
new the numerator of the other side and

1702
01:35:59,949 --> 01:36:04,720
then I need to divide by result X right

1703
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:11,019
I do that right

1704
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:21,380
not so good with doing math in a text

1705
01:36:19,289 --> 01:36:21,380
editor

1706
01:36:30,819 --> 01:36:40,729
wait so that would be correct but this

1707
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:44,380
is wrong I was gonna say that I did that

1708
01:36:40,729 --> 01:36:44,379
math correctly but this is not correct

1709
01:36:46,090 --> 01:37:02,710
why did I write that that way that's

1710
01:36:52,939 --> 01:37:02,710
what it should be right

1711
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:10,399
all right so glad I happen to do that

1712
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:11,570
out because that was just wrong yeah I

1713
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:17,989
don't know why I wrote that way

1714
01:37:11,569 --> 01:37:19,579
originally right why did we do that that

1715
01:37:17,989 --> 01:37:21,949
was I don't know I guess I must have

1716
01:37:19,579 --> 01:37:25,010
could not be thinking I typed it in but

1717
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:27,679
this P percentage is a value from zero

1718
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:29,060
to you 16 max right so in order to

1719
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:31,789
change it to a value from 0 to 1 we

1720
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:33,710
would want to divide by you 16 max so

1721
01:37:31,789 --> 01:37:36,109
that's what should have been written

1722
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:37,579
here not what I wrote before which

1723
01:37:36,109 --> 01:37:39,409
probably people on the stream already

1724
01:37:37,579 --> 01:37:41,720
caught of course I'm not reading stream

1725
01:37:39,409 --> 01:37:43,760
by program as per the rule but

1726
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:45,050
presumably someone saw that hopefully

1727
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:50,270
someone saw that if not then you're

1728
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:52,789
sleeping on on watch as well anyway let

1729
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:54,530
me do that one more time so assuming

1730
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:56,979
that you know we've got this equation

1731
01:37:54,529 --> 01:38:06,619
here what I want to do is solve for this

1732
01:37:56,979 --> 01:38:08,989
so it's that which now gives us the

1733
01:38:06,619 --> 01:38:11,479
answer that I typed in down here which

1734
01:38:08,989 --> 01:38:12,500
is what we want but before we didn't get

1735
01:38:11,479 --> 01:38:14,239
that because I had written this equation

1736
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:16,220
wrong unsurprisingly if you write the

1737
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:19,130
wrong equation when you solve it you get

1738
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:20,810
a different equation um so yes so that's

1739
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:22,190
all I was trying to say there and I'm

1740
01:38:20,810 --> 01:38:23,900
really glad that I happen to digress

1741
01:38:22,189 --> 01:38:26,029
there because that saved me the trouble

1742
01:38:23,899 --> 01:38:31,549
of having to debug that later and look

1743
01:38:26,029 --> 01:38:34,099
under why did I write that so anyway we

1744
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:36,079
should have a complete setting now for

1745
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:38,720
these so we can get and set them and

1746
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:42,078
they will look in code and decode the

1747
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:46,208
sort of values into what they need to be

1748
01:38:42,078 --> 01:38:49,009
and I think that's fairly complete right

1749
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:50,569
this has to probably be cast to you 16

1750
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:51,949
because it's not a get like the compiler

1751
01:38:50,569 --> 01:38:53,779
PI doesn't necessarily know that its new

1752
01:38:51,948 --> 01:38:54,469
16 or not I should double check to see

1753
01:38:53,779 --> 01:38:55,550
what it says

1754
01:38:54,469 --> 01:38:57,498
see if it's telling me something I

1755
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:58,820
wouldn't order you know yeah I think

1756
01:38:57,498 --> 01:39:00,108
that's just integral promotion because

1757
01:38:58,819 --> 01:39:01,518
there's nothing in there that's greater

1758
01:39:00,109 --> 01:39:05,209
than you 16 but I guess it doesn't

1759
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:08,570
really know that so if we now take a

1760
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:11,208
look at what's going on here let's see

1761
01:39:08,569 --> 01:39:16,849
we've got a few places where these type

1762
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:25,479
names are wrong because I've changed

1763
01:39:16,849 --> 01:39:28,279
them to be easier to understand and okay

1764
01:39:25,479 --> 01:39:32,499
so that's everything we need to do to

1765
01:39:28,279 --> 01:39:35,328
handle HHA files in that new way I argue

1766
01:39:32,498 --> 01:39:37,550
and then we also have when we're

1767
01:39:35,328 --> 01:39:39,078
actually doing work in our bitmaps you

1768
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:42,260
can see there's some places where this

1769
01:39:39,078 --> 01:39:44,088
stuff's actually used right and so when

1770
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:47,899
we loft some of these pieces of

1771
01:39:44,088 --> 01:39:51,679
information up here you can see us we're

1772
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:54,139
relying on this information and we now

1773
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:56,538
don't necessarily have it anymore right

1774
01:39:54,139 --> 01:40:00,529
like we don't have an aligned percentage

1775
01:39:56,538 --> 01:40:02,628
anymore to loft up into our bitmap now

1776
01:40:00,529 --> 01:40:09,828
what we can do is just read the first

1777
01:40:02,628 --> 01:40:13,099
one so we certainly can just say get P

1778
01:40:09,828 --> 01:40:19,009
percent and just say look give me the

1779
01:40:13,099 --> 01:40:22,899
one from align points zero and off we go

1780
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:22,899
so I have to put it to do here

1781
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:40,170
so we kind of need to make some more

1782
01:40:35,698 --> 01:40:43,769
thoughtful stuff here you know we got to

1783
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:45,239
think about this a little bit more so

1784
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:48,780
we'll we'll talk about that a little bit

1785
01:40:45,238 --> 01:40:58,618
later obviously but as it is right now

1786
01:40:48,779 --> 01:41:00,960
we can sort of just keep that sort of

1787
01:40:58,618 --> 01:41:03,420
odd spotlight there inside here where

1788
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:05,189
we're actually creating these we're

1789
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:06,630
gonna have to augment this significantly

1790
01:41:05,189 --> 01:41:07,799
because this is where we want to now put

1791
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:12,060
the parser that can read this

1792
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:14,070
information from an actual source file

1793
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:18,780
right and so that's something that we

1794
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:19,469
have to take into account and do more

1795
01:41:18,779 --> 01:41:22,738
directly

1796
01:41:19,469 --> 01:41:25,079
now storing this stuff this is just a

1797
01:41:22,738 --> 01:41:29,488
question of actually packing down to a

1798
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:31,198
u16 which is fine and we may want to

1799
01:41:29,488 --> 01:41:39,589
check your but I don't know like I'll

1800
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:48,779
say maybe we check here and an error

1801
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:49,770
it's okay because maybe we do want to do

1802
01:41:48,779 --> 01:41:51,899
that the future I don't want to deal

1803
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:53,369
with it now and so really all we're

1804
01:41:51,899 --> 01:41:56,759
talking about now is the fact that these

1805
01:41:53,368 --> 01:41:58,500
defaults were here and now they're not

1806
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:01,469
gonna be here anymore

1807
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:03,179
what I'm gonna do is again just continue

1808
01:42:01,469 --> 01:42:06,750
what we were doing before which is just

1809
01:42:03,179 --> 01:42:09,600
say look let's let's go ahead and set

1810
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:13,109
this to the same default it was being

1811
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:14,850
set to just for now and then we'll all

1812
01:42:13,109 --> 01:42:16,469
meant that by actually parsing a file

1813
01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:18,630
text file and seeing if there is

1814
01:42:16,469 --> 01:42:21,658
anything in it that we need to process

1815
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:23,368
there so when I set this a line point

1816
01:42:21,658 --> 01:42:26,759
I'm just gonna say like okay got these

1817
01:42:23,368 --> 01:42:30,179
bitmaps aligned points and what I want

1818
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:31,409
to do is then set it to exactly the same

1819
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:34,889
default values we were setting the other

1820
01:42:31,408 --> 01:42:39,509
ones too so in here right I'm just gonna

1821
01:42:34,889 --> 01:42:40,760
say HHA aligned default I'm gonna say

1822
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:45,110
true for the

1823
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:48,050
parents I'm going to say that the size

1824
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:51,799
should be 1.0 and that the P percent

1825
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:55,788
should be 0.5 0.5 and then I'm gonna get

1826
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:58,119
rid of this right so now that should

1827
01:42:55,788 --> 01:43:01,250
completely mimic the original behavior

1828
01:42:58,118 --> 01:43:03,738
and our only issue that we have now is

1829
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:07,578
that our hhas we want to update them to

1830
01:43:03,738 --> 01:43:09,018
the new format right so if I go to our

1831
01:43:07,578 --> 01:43:12,439
data directory right like what you can

1832
01:43:09,019 --> 01:43:17,150
see is we've got these here and you can

1833
01:43:12,439 --> 01:43:19,038
look remember where our be zeros were

1834
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:20,929
there they are so you can see we have

1835
01:43:19,038 --> 01:43:25,609
all these V zeros and we want to be able

1836
01:43:20,929 --> 01:43:27,889
to use V 1 files so we want to be able

1837
01:43:25,609 --> 01:43:31,729
to update those V zeros to the ones

1838
01:43:27,889 --> 01:43:39,739
right so what I want to do here is

1839
01:43:31,729 --> 01:43:42,589
delete those hhas yeah delete these hhas

1840
01:43:39,738 --> 01:43:45,408
that we have that our view ones here and

1841
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:48,369
make the you know sort of into V twos

1842
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:51,558
now I'm not gonna add support for

1843
01:43:48,368 --> 01:43:54,380
converting the ones to V 2 because we

1844
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:57,079
don't eat it and really conversion can

1845
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:59,118
go away eventually because we can just

1846
01:43:57,078 --> 01:44:01,279
go directly from our source pngs

1847
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:02,899
but what I would like to do is respect

1848
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:04,698
the fact that we change it so if anyone

1849
01:44:02,899 --> 01:44:08,299
ever did want to just as an exercise it

1850
01:44:04,698 --> 01:44:09,678
would be nice if they could go OK we can

1851
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:11,480
actually tell the difference between all

1852
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:15,170
these version numbers so I'm gonna make

1853
01:44:11,479 --> 01:44:19,038
the version number b2 here uh and go

1854
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:27,760
from there right now in the HHA edit

1855
01:44:19,038 --> 01:44:27,759
code path let me just see here

1856
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:44,420
where is our ehh ehh there it is

1857
01:44:40,989 --> 01:44:46,269
so what I want to do here is essentially

1858
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:49,369
say look we're not gonna actually

1859
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:51,980
preserve this path because I don't care

1860
01:44:49,369 --> 01:45:04,699
about it so I'm just gonna go ahead and

1861
01:44:51,979 --> 01:45:08,779
do this right like so and so now if I

1862
01:45:04,699 --> 01:45:11,869
actually try to HHA edit one of these

1863
01:45:08,779 --> 01:45:15,019
files so test one of you and I say it

1864
01:45:11,869 --> 01:45:17,210
should tell me that it doesn't should

1865
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:21,380
tell me that doesn't know what it is

1866
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:22,970
right and that's exactly what I want so

1867
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:26,029
you know if I tell it to dump it it

1868
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:28,730
should just not you'll do it and so

1869
01:45:26,029 --> 01:45:30,829
that's like I said we could support

1870
01:45:28,729 --> 01:45:33,859
those old ones I just don't care about

1871
01:45:30,829 --> 01:45:35,989
it so like eventually the hej editor can

1872
01:45:33,859 --> 01:45:37,579
just lose backwards-compatibility more

1873
01:45:35,989 --> 01:45:42,139
or less for anything that we don't

1874
01:45:37,579 --> 01:45:44,689
actually ship a jamais for right up to

1875
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:46,460
the end of hand-made here our production

1876
01:45:44,689 --> 01:45:49,009
because we'll just rebuild things from

1877
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:51,170
the pngs and be fine but once if people

1878
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:52,789
start trading a jamais around you know

1879
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:54,590
when the game is released or something

1880
01:45:52,789 --> 01:45:56,659
then we would if we updated the format

1881
01:45:54,590 --> 01:46:02,480
we would support both formats probably

1882
01:45:56,659 --> 01:46:04,489
right ok so what I want to do now is

1883
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:05,659
just quickly check to make sure that

1884
01:46:04,489 --> 01:46:06,859
this work that also will just do a

1885
01:46:05,659 --> 01:46:10,519
little bugging and then we'll call it a

1886
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:14,630
day so I'd like to see if I can recreate

1887
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:18,500
these hhas so you can see local HHA is

1888
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:20,329
not an issue that's not something to

1889
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:24,439
care about so really what we care about

1890
01:46:20,329 --> 01:46:26,510
is intro art test1 test2 test3 and test

1891
01:46:24,439 --> 01:46:30,649
fonts right so that's what we want to

1892
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:32,930
actually rebuild so I'm going to delete

1893
01:46:30,649 --> 01:46:38,319
those or I could just make a view one

1894
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:43,280
directory and move them in there like so

1895
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:44,429
and so we have to recreate these from

1896
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:47,578
these

1897
01:46:44,429 --> 01:46:50,550
right so let's go ahead and do that HHA

1898
01:46:47,578 --> 01:46:56,248
edit I believe we can just say rewrite

1899
01:46:50,550 --> 01:47:01,739
and we can pass one of these so if we

1900
01:46:56,248 --> 01:47:07,170
want to do intro art then we can write

1901
01:47:01,738 --> 01:47:10,768
intro art v2 BJJ right and so now in

1902
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:15,538
theory we rewrote that file that has the

1903
01:47:10,769 --> 01:47:18,809
intro art in it and in theory I can read

1904
01:47:15,538 --> 01:47:20,969
it now right and so we can see what's in

1905
01:47:18,809 --> 01:47:24,389
it and let's just verify that I'm right

1906
01:47:20,969 --> 01:47:29,130
about that because we want to be able to

1907
01:47:24,389 --> 01:47:44,029
you know look at this a little more

1908
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:44,029
cleanly oops

1909
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:51,529
and so in here we should be able to see

1910
01:47:49,560 --> 01:48:04,710
all of our assets and that they actually

1911
01:47:51,529 --> 01:48:09,000
have something in them so it's not quite

1912
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:11,310
right so we're a little off so you can

1913
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,460
see here that the size does not look

1914
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:17,310
right it should be 1.0 and you can see

1915
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:20,670
that this is unknown this is correct so

1916
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:25,890
we're not quite there let's go look at

1917
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:27,180
why we got that happening so we're

1918
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:28,950
definitely passing one point now and

1919
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:32,760
we're definitely passing HHA align

1920
01:48:28,949 --> 01:48:36,720
default and so what I'd like to do is

1921
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:37,980
just go in here and and see oh I think I

1922
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:41,340
already know I forgot to and off that

1923
01:48:37,979 --> 01:48:44,879
flag so that one makes perfect sense but

1924
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:50,180
let me just see why we got the incorrect

1925
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:50,180
size so for our get size

1926
01:49:00,328 --> 01:49:09,058
yeah we just we just never finished we

1927
01:49:04,948 --> 01:49:12,169
never finished right so for our get size

1928
01:49:09,059 --> 01:49:15,510
it's exactly the same as this right

1929
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:21,179
we've got an f32 here that we then need

1930
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:24,090
to scale up like so but because we want

1931
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:28,289
an extra hundred of range there we need

1932
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:32,489
to first knock it down right so we need

1933
01:49:28,289 --> 01:49:36,689
to say look take off some of what you

1934
01:49:32,488 --> 01:49:39,328
were gonna do there like so and that way

1935
01:49:36,689 --> 01:49:42,689
we can encode up to a hundred and set of

1936
01:49:39,328 --> 01:49:47,009
up to 1 so that encoding is fine the get

1937
01:49:42,689 --> 01:49:47,908
type is totally wrong I don't again I

1938
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:50,730
think I just wasn't

1939
01:49:47,908 --> 01:49:53,009
maybe the coffee we're off right we we

1940
01:49:50,729 --> 01:49:56,250
want to knock that off so it should have

1941
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:57,449
been an N with a knotted version so I

1942
01:49:56,250 --> 01:50:01,158
don't know what we were thinking there

1943
01:49:57,448 --> 01:50:06,658
but just probably asleep at the switch I

1944
01:50:01,158 --> 01:50:07,828
guess so yeah let's go ahead and try

1945
01:50:06,658 --> 01:50:10,920
that again

1946
01:50:07,828 --> 01:50:16,198
so now if I look at that intro or v2

1947
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:20,550
data HHA let's rewrite that a second

1948
01:50:16,198 --> 01:50:25,348
time and see if we can get a cleaner

1949
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:29,329
version of that right where's my tab

1950
01:50:25,349 --> 01:50:29,328
view at closed it

1951
01:50:33,789 --> 01:50:39,039
if I now will put up the assets let's

1952
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:41,440
see if we got smarter alignment in there

1953
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:44,109
so we've got a default alignment that

1954
01:50:41,439 --> 01:50:45,039
lines out to the parent which is what we

1955
01:50:44,109 --> 01:50:49,059
want

1956
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:51,970
it's 1.04 size which is what we want and

1957
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:54,100
off we go now what we can see here is

1958
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:56,560
there is a little bit of an ugliness

1959
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:57,760
here that sort of suggests we want to be

1960
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:02,050
a little bit more careful with how we're

1961
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:04,390
doing it the fact that I can't represent

1962
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:06,579
exactly half way is not particularly

1963
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:14,670
troublesome but the fact that I can't

1964
01:51:06,579 --> 01:51:14,670
represent exactly one is bad right and

1965
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:26,250
so it would be nice to look at why we're

1966
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:26,250
not able to represent exactly one there

1967
01:51:35,409 --> 01:51:39,699
and get it so that we can because we

1968
01:51:37,630 --> 01:51:42,340
don't really want everything scaled down

1969
01:51:39,699 --> 01:51:45,279
by a little bit like that doesn't like

1970
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:47,949
that's actually not great so if we look

1971
01:51:45,279 --> 01:51:51,170
at when we're getting the size out

1972
01:51:47,949 --> 01:51:51,170
[Music]

1973
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:07,590
these aren't exactly reversed so one

1974
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:11,380
thing we could do maybe is do them

1975
01:52:07,590 --> 01:52:13,239
exactly reversed so I think part of the

1976
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:14,949
problem too is a hundred is not a power

1977
01:52:13,238 --> 01:52:17,019
of two which probably is bad as well

1978
01:52:14,948 --> 01:52:20,139
because it sets us up for being off by

1979
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:28,179
one there let's just try I'm just gonna

1980
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:29,739
say let's try when we actually have six

1981
01:52:28,179 --> 01:52:35,859
five five three six right we're gonna be

1982
01:52:29,738 --> 01:52:37,839
dividing by I'm just saying like out

1983
01:52:35,859 --> 01:52:39,130
loud here so if I have one point oh and

1984
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:46,869
I'm gonna divide it by six five five

1985
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:48,429
three five there or I should say I have

1986
01:52:46,869 --> 01:52:50,439
one point oh and I'm in multiply it by

1987
01:52:48,429 --> 01:52:54,340
six by five three five I've got six five

1988
01:52:50,439 --> 01:52:56,589
five three five right and so when I

1989
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:59,020
actually do a divide there you want to

1990
01:52:56,590 --> 01:53:07,539
divide it by something that would evenly

1991
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:12,390
go into six five five three five right

1992
01:53:07,539 --> 01:53:14,439
and so you know if you were to divide by

1993
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:20,739
something that could go into it so let's

1994
01:53:14,439 --> 01:53:23,738
say six five five three five and I want

1995
01:53:20,738 --> 01:53:29,709
to divide it by like let's say 127 or

1996
01:53:23,738 --> 01:53:33,099
maybe 126 6 6 5 5 3 5 divided by 255 so

1997
01:53:29,710 --> 01:53:38,829
it can it can record that in 57 times 25

1998
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:42,250
can produce can produce that value I

1999
01:53:38,829 --> 01:53:48,488
don't know if there's a 126 I don't know

2000
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:53,460
what the factors of 6 5 5 3 5 are is

2001
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:53,459
there like a factorize web page

2002
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:01,369
there we go

2003
01:54:05,579 --> 01:54:13,800
so just looking at what the factors are

2004
01:54:08,039 --> 01:54:19,380
here 3 5:17 and 257 right so if I was to

2005
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:28,529
take those numbers you know 3 times 17

2006
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:34,310
is 51 5 times 17 is 85 5 times 17 seems

2007
01:54:28,529 --> 01:54:34,309
like the best one to me

2008
01:54:45,408 --> 01:54:53,698
so let's say that's the maximum and that

2009
01:54:51,238 --> 01:54:56,089
way you'll have an even number that

2010
01:54:53,698 --> 01:54:58,529
you're then encoding into a u16 and

2011
01:54:56,090 --> 01:55:03,110
encoding back out and so you shouldn't

2012
01:54:58,529 --> 01:55:03,109
have any weird divides at that point

2013
01:55:05,029 --> 01:55:11,998
that's my that's my argument and we can

2014
01:55:08,908 --> 01:55:14,219
also as well stick it in this way so

2015
01:55:11,998 --> 01:55:16,050
we've done the multiply a head of time

2016
01:55:14,219 --> 01:55:17,309
to get it out of the fractional part I

2017
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:20,849
don't think that will help at all

2018
01:55:17,309 --> 01:55:22,708
but I you know wave a dead chicken over

2019
01:55:20,849 --> 01:55:26,489
the floating point number and pretend

2020
01:55:22,708 --> 01:55:29,248
you did something useful so if I leave

2021
01:55:26,488 --> 01:55:31,218
that fraction that way I just want to

2022
01:55:29,248 --> 01:55:39,658
see if that'll give me a better result

2023
01:55:31,219 --> 01:55:44,359
so let's take these guys out and I'm

2024
01:55:39,658 --> 01:55:48,448
gonna do rewrite and then I'm gonna do a

2025
01:55:44,359 --> 01:55:49,889
dump and then a tab view and things this

2026
01:55:48,448 --> 01:55:53,219
time thankfully I didn't close my tab

2027
01:55:49,889 --> 01:55:56,159
view so looking at the assets again this

2028
01:55:53,219 --> 01:56:03,389
time there we go so now I've got my

2029
01:55:56,158 --> 01:56:05,038
exact 1.0 which is what I wanted I don't

2030
01:56:03,389 --> 01:56:07,019
know why I don't have an even point five

2031
01:56:05,038 --> 01:56:09,090
point five but I don't really care about

2032
01:56:07,019 --> 01:56:10,800
that so I'm okay with that I wasn't okay

2033
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:13,409
with not getting an even 1.0 because I

2034
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,998
want scale of 1.0 in particular to be

2035
01:56:13,408 --> 01:56:17,969
able to represent it exactly because it

2036
01:56:14,998 --> 01:56:20,998
is the neutral scale and so that was

2037
01:56:17,969 --> 01:56:23,099
important to me what I would like to

2038
01:56:20,998 --> 01:56:25,978
quickly look at is just why we're not

2039
01:56:23,099 --> 01:56:27,288
getting that direct in and out so if I

2040
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:30,780
do P percent

2041
01:56:27,288 --> 01:56:32,670
dot xn dot Y times you see nice I guess

2042
01:56:30,779 --> 01:56:39,748
the reason is because of the rounding

2043
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:41,969
error we might want to round these and

2044
01:56:39,748 --> 01:56:43,800
if I rounded this guy if I had rounded

2045
01:56:41,969 --> 01:56:46,698
this guy it probably would have rounded

2046
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:51,119
us up to one which would have been fine

2047
01:56:46,698 --> 01:56:52,589
in that case maybe I don't actually know

2048
01:56:51,118 --> 01:56:54,509
if that's true as I'm saying it but

2049
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:56,819
that's when we do it but this is

2050
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:59,510
probably would have

2051
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:01,979
do with the rounding case so when I

2052
01:56:59,510 --> 01:57:04,980
truncate this to a you 16

2053
01:57:01,979 --> 01:57:07,139
I wanna if I'm closer to the you 16

2054
01:57:04,979 --> 01:57:11,069
that's higher up maybe I should round it

2055
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:16,140
so meaning in this case when I do this

2056
01:57:11,069 --> 01:57:17,639
multiply ident to do a bias of 1.5 to

2057
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:22,220
make sure that I would round up in the

2058
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:22,220
case where it's up up round a bowl

2059
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:28,649
although really what I would like it to

2060
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:30,119
do is actually round meaning I would

2061
01:57:28,649 --> 01:57:33,539
like it to do a rounding conversion

2062
01:57:30,119 --> 01:57:37,439
because I don't want to bump it up to

2063
01:57:33,539 --> 01:57:41,119
0.5 so I don't know like I don't

2064
01:57:37,439 --> 01:57:41,119
remember if our intrinsics have around

2065
01:57:42,649 --> 01:57:48,299
so we do have a round real 32 to you int

2066
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:51,600
32 and so what I might do here is say

2067
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:54,960
look let's round this you know I'm

2068
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:56,550
saying and so if we round it then we

2069
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:58,980
will get a more accurate result there

2070
01:57:56,550 --> 01:58:00,930
and that might be a good thing to do

2071
01:57:58,979 --> 01:58:03,059
across the board so just all of these

2072
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:10,950
are just gonna get rounded and then

2073
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:14,220
truncated that seems better to me I'm

2074
01:58:10,949 --> 01:58:16,199
gonna argue that's better so let's try

2075
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:19,050
it one last time and then I think we can

2076
01:58:16,199 --> 01:58:19,849
maybe say we we did our work and we're

2077
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:23,520
good to go

2078
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:29,340
there's the rewrite there's the dump and

2079
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:31,590
then if I look at it here let's see now

2080
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:38,760
so the rounding is just all it's doing

2081
01:58:31,590 --> 01:58:40,619
is changing which bump I went to so I'm

2082
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:44,880
still not thrilled with that and that's

2083
01:58:40,619 --> 01:58:47,220
probably just because the u16 max isn't

2084
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:49,289
evenly divisible by it too so you can't

2085
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:52,010
put a value directly in the middle of it

2086
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:52,010
you know I'm saying

2087
01:59:07,539 --> 01:59:11,050
and I guess what I would say is again I

2088
01:59:09,488 --> 01:59:12,669
don't really know if I care for any

2089
01:59:11,050 --> 01:59:14,800
particular reason there's no nothing

2090
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:20,140
special about directly in the middle of

2091
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:21,850
the bitmap really so I'm not sure if I

2092
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:23,670
really care one way or the other maybe I

2093
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:24,840
do maybe I don't

2094
01:59:23,670 --> 01:59:27,699
[Music]

2095
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:30,130
but if we wanted to represent it exactly

2096
01:59:27,699 --> 01:59:32,289
I think we would have to use a scaling

2097
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:35,230
value that was capable of representing

2098
01:59:32,289 --> 01:59:36,279
the middle perfectly and so in order to

2099
01:59:35,229 --> 01:59:37,869
do that you know there's a couple ways

2100
01:59:36,279 --> 01:59:41,109
we could do that right we know that you

2101
01:59:37,869 --> 01:59:43,059
16 max is not capable beam tools by two

2102
01:59:41,109 --> 01:59:45,699
it's pretty trivial to turn into

2103
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:55,450
something that is right I mean you could

2104
01:59:45,699 --> 02:00:00,340
just do this and then you lost one 65536

2105
01:59:55,449 --> 02:00:05,679
of your ability to be precise but I

2106
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:10,829
think at that point you've gained your

2107
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:13,030
ability to produce a have again right

2108
02:00:10,829 --> 02:00:15,189
because you can specify a value that's

2109
02:00:13,029 --> 02:00:17,409
exactly halfway between the two so I

2110
02:00:15,189 --> 02:00:21,399
think that's true let's see if it

2111
02:00:17,409 --> 02:00:26,460
actually is I should really make this

2112
02:00:21,399 --> 02:00:26,460
into one command line here oops

2113
02:00:32,829 --> 02:00:44,930
and I did it again so I'm gonna go ahead

2114
02:00:43,729 --> 02:00:46,309
and say let's leave it that way

2115
02:00:44,930 --> 02:00:48,409
it's better to be able to represent

2116
02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:50,840
exactly half probably than it is to have

2117
02:00:48,409 --> 02:00:54,380
that extra one value there so I'm gonna

2118
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:56,719
leave it at that so okay that's it

2119
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:58,400
really for today but I want to really

2120
02:00:56,719 --> 02:00:59,779
quickly see if we can run with these

2121
02:00:58,399 --> 02:01:03,109
files just to see if there's anything

2122
02:00:59,779 --> 02:01:05,149
else obviously that we did wrong and so

2123
02:01:03,109 --> 02:01:09,049
looking at the V one directory here's

2124
02:01:05,149 --> 02:01:11,269
again the files that we actually need so

2125
02:01:09,050 --> 02:01:14,659
I'm just going to really do a quick hh8

2126
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:21,640
edit rewrite of the v-0 directory test

2127
02:01:14,659 --> 02:01:21,639
1v1 hij test 1 V 2 by JJ

2128
02:01:41,159 --> 02:01:47,920
and so now I think we have all of our

2129
02:01:44,859 --> 02:01:53,859
files right we've got intro art we've

2130
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:57,250
got test1 test2 test3 and test fonts and

2131
02:01:53,859 --> 02:02:02,679
so now I can see whether or not we can

2132
02:01:57,250 --> 02:02:04,359
actually run and it looks like we can

2133
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:06,190
now the only thing that's a little weird

2134
02:02:04,359 --> 02:02:10,509
there is we need to import some stuff

2135
02:02:06,189 --> 02:02:12,909
now and we we didn't really test the

2136
02:02:10,510 --> 02:02:15,280
import path so all of this stuff seems

2137
02:02:12,909 --> 02:02:21,579
to be working pretty good I don't see

2138
02:02:15,279 --> 02:02:24,550
any problems right that all seems pretty

2139
02:02:21,579 --> 02:02:31,659
reasonable and so all I really need to

2140
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:33,250
do here is if I slap down a local HHA it

2141
02:02:31,659 --> 02:02:35,109
should run the import and we can see

2142
02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:38,229
whether the importer still does it

2143
02:02:35,109 --> 02:02:41,130
properly as well meaning it will is it

2144
02:02:38,229 --> 02:02:43,359
capable of creating a version 2 HHA that

2145
02:02:41,130 --> 02:02:46,390
will correctly place everything it looks

2146
02:02:43,359 --> 02:02:48,519
like it is um so that's good that

2147
02:02:46,390 --> 02:02:50,440
verifies a bunch of things like verifies

2148
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:52,240
that we can add stuff to our eh at JS

2149
02:02:50,439 --> 02:02:53,229
pretty easily and run a conversion

2150
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:55,329
that's that's really pretty

2151
02:02:53,229 --> 02:02:56,709
straightforward so that's good case we

2152
02:02:55,329 --> 02:02:58,079
need to modify the file format and don't

2153
02:02:56,710 --> 02:03:01,390
want that to be a huge pain in the butt

2154
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:04,869
and now I think we've got roughly what

2155
02:03:01,390 --> 02:03:06,850
should be in there and so that's all

2156
02:03:04,869 --> 02:03:09,479
good I'll go to a quick Q&amp;A and then

2157
02:03:06,850 --> 02:03:09,480
we'll wrap it up

2158
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:58,119
all righty then let's hear loops

2159
02:03:54,699 --> 02:04:00,529
no God wish Linux could understand how

2160
02:03:58,119 --> 02:04:03,680
to access a mouse

2161
02:04:00,529 --> 02:04:03,679
[Applause]

2162
02:04:13,399 --> 02:04:21,029
85 isn't a factor of six five five three

2163
02:04:16,199 --> 02:04:22,679
four yeah but we don't care

2164
02:04:21,029 --> 02:04:26,250
those are your they're two separate

2165
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:27,840
equations right so this equation is the

2166
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:29,430
one that uses the eighty five and it's

2167
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:32,520
still using six five five three six

2168
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:36,740
three five this equation which does not

2169
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:36,740
use eighty five is using the minus one

2170
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:52,350
let's see

2171
02:04:48,899 --> 02:04:55,589
could you use you 16 max plus one in a

2172
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:56,940
size modifier of 128 probably not

2173
02:04:55,590 --> 02:05:07,140
because you still want to be able to

2174
02:04:56,939 --> 02:05:08,009
represent 1.0 I'm sorry okay I see

2175
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:18,390
you're saying you're saying for the

2176
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:20,900
sizing one um yes so yes I think you

2177
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:22,770
could do that yes

2178
02:05:20,899 --> 02:05:24,179
color seems like it would make a nice

2179
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:25,500
addition to the bitmap parenting system

2180
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:30,840
a ghost wearing a hat should not have a

2181
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:33,239
hat with a lower alpha value so color is

2182
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:35,430
actually something that it gets is on

2183
02:05:33,239 --> 02:05:39,359
the property side of things it doesn't

2184
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:40,860
depend on the artwork really so no I

2185
02:05:39,359 --> 02:05:45,210
don't think that needs to be encoded

2186
02:05:40,859 --> 02:05:46,439
into the bitmaps like whether or not

2187
02:05:45,210 --> 02:05:48,119
something as a ghost is actually a

2188
02:05:46,439 --> 02:05:49,919
property and it can be propagated to

2189
02:05:48,119 --> 02:05:51,720
children just as easily if we want it to

2190
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:54,050
or not it doesn't have to be in the

2191
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:54,050
artwork

2192
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:09,430
last week you were mulling over whether

2193
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:11,710
or not to separate the head from the

2194
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:13,630
body in the spritesheet since then has

2195
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:15,130
this idea become more solidified now we

2196
02:06:13,630 --> 02:06:16,960
haven't really looked at that part yet

2197
02:06:15,130 --> 02:06:18,609
also do you plan on giving us some of

2198
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:20,439
the faces more articulate animation an

2199
02:06:18,609 --> 02:06:22,059
example I thought of at the start of the

2200
02:06:20,439 --> 02:06:23,769
stream today was blinking eyes on the

2201
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:25,600
cats or other characters perhaps as

2202
02:06:23,770 --> 02:06:28,210
overlays of eyelids with furs and so for

2203
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:29,800
each head angle yeah we could do

2204
02:06:28,210 --> 02:06:31,270
blinking I don't know that I care about

2205
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:32,800
that right now but it's pretty easy for

2206
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:45,190
us to add right because we just have a

2207
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:46,930
blink tag that's like zero one let's see

2208
02:06:45,189 --> 02:06:48,460
totally random question graphic do you

2209
02:06:46,930 --> 02:06:50,470
like that the C post was professor has

2210
02:06:48,460 --> 02:06:53,140
no special syntax for invoking a macro

2211
02:06:50,470 --> 02:06:54,610
are there merits to that in your mind or

2212
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:58,210
not would you prefer a special syntax

2213
02:06:54,609 --> 02:07:03,339
for invoking macros no I would say it

2214
02:06:58,210 --> 02:07:05,920
actually the opposite way around I would

2215
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:07,630
say that the C++ preprocessor does have

2216
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:11,920
a special syntax for invoking a macro

2217
02:07:07,630 --> 02:07:13,960
and that's bad a macro processor is

2218
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:16,840
supposed to be a way that you can modify

2219
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:18,699
code that's written to do one thing to

2220
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:22,930
do something else it's the whole point

2221
02:07:18,699 --> 02:07:24,849
of a macro preprocessor and there is no

2222
02:07:22,930 --> 02:07:27,970
other point in my opinion of the macro

2223
02:07:24,850 --> 02:07:29,920
preprocessor in the first place it's

2224
02:07:27,970 --> 02:07:31,630
basically for meta programming it's for

2225
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:33,909
reaching into something that was written

2226
02:07:31,630 --> 02:07:36,760
textually one way and changing it to be

2227
02:07:33,909 --> 02:07:37,960
written textually another way so I would

2228
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:39,940
argue that actually the biggest

2229
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:41,829
limitation of the C bus was preprocessor

2230
02:07:39,939 --> 02:07:43,449
besides the fact that it's just really

2231
02:07:41,829 --> 02:07:45,550
underpowered in terms of its ability to

2232
02:07:43,449 --> 02:07:46,329
program things in general and the fact

2233
02:07:45,550 --> 02:07:47,529
that I don't think you should need a

2234
02:07:46,329 --> 02:07:49,149
preprocessor your language should just

2235
02:07:47,529 --> 02:07:51,489
have the ability to do meta programming

2236
02:07:49,149 --> 02:07:52,989
in it if you know those two things I

2237
02:07:51,489 --> 02:07:54,489
would then say if you're actually having

2238
02:07:52,989 --> 02:07:56,529
a macro preprocessor in the first place

2239
02:07:54,489 --> 02:07:57,880
it should allow arbitrary matching

2240
02:07:56,529 --> 02:07:59,529
syntax so that you can reach in and grab

2241
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:01,960
anything you want it should be the case

2242
02:07:59,529 --> 02:08:04,539
that you can create a C++ macro that

2243
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:06,369
matches against a plus B in the middle

2244
02:08:04,539 --> 02:08:09,909
of the text so it can for example

2245
02:08:06,369 --> 02:08:12,729
replace in fix notation instead of just

2246
02:08:09,909 --> 02:08:15,609
postfix function calls as things that

2247
02:08:12,729 --> 02:08:16,929
can be rewritten right it's kind of just

2248
02:08:15,609 --> 02:08:17,938
obvious that you should be able to do

2249
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:20,159
that and

2250
02:08:17,939 --> 02:08:23,989
I don't know why you would do it another

2251
02:08:20,158 --> 02:08:23,988
way but you know there you go

2252
02:09:01,118 --> 02:09:11,299
all right I'm gonna close it up I will

2253
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:13,699
leave that as it is if someone wants to

2254
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:16,159
raid a bug on the github about switching

2255
02:09:13,698 --> 02:09:17,988
the camera movement by the way I'm fine

2256
02:09:16,158 --> 02:09:21,979
with keeping it consistent so that left

2257
02:09:17,988 --> 02:09:23,598
right is congruent with up/down but I

2258
02:09:21,979 --> 02:09:26,299
probably won't remember to do that by

2259
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:27,770
the time we get back there so if someone

2260
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:30,050
wants to put a bug in there so we get to

2261
02:09:27,770 --> 02:09:38,750
it eventually someday when we're doing

2262
02:09:30,050 --> 02:09:40,130
bug stuff we can do that all right thank

2263
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:41,479
you for joining me for never said a hand

2264
02:09:40,130 --> 02:09:44,179
made here oh it's been a pleasure coding

2265
02:09:41,479 --> 02:09:45,468
with you as always if you want to follow

2266
02:09:44,179 --> 02:09:46,730
along the series at home you can always

2267
02:09:45,469 --> 02:09:49,099
peer to the game on handmade here at

2268
02:09:46,729 --> 02:09:50,569
Oregon it comes with a source code so

2269
02:09:49,099 --> 02:09:53,480
that you can play around with it

2270
02:09:50,569 --> 02:09:57,289
yourself and try to learn along with the

2271
02:09:53,479 --> 02:10:00,769
series I will be back here tomorrow when

2272
02:09:57,289 --> 02:10:03,260
we will try to parse some files to do

2273
02:10:00,770 --> 02:10:07,460
the annotation that we added support for

2274
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:09,289
today and while that probably won't take

2275
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:11,750
too long it is a little bit of busy work

2276
02:10:09,289 --> 02:10:13,158
so you know who knows if we finish it

2277
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:16,609
tomorrow then what we'll start on is

2278
02:10:13,158 --> 02:10:19,189
just some understanding inside the code

2279
02:10:16,609 --> 02:10:20,988
of how to use those alignment points so

2280
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:22,879
we're gonna have to add some code that

2281
02:10:20,988 --> 02:10:25,819
does the thinking of like okay I'm

2282
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:27,289
snapping this to this so here's the

2283
02:10:25,819 --> 02:10:28,488
alignment point I use or whatever it's

2284
02:10:27,289 --> 02:10:32,750
so that's gonna be a little bit of work

2285
02:10:28,488 --> 02:10:35,328
to I think that's mostly all the work we

2286
02:10:32,750 --> 02:10:37,368
have left to do in terms of importing

2287
02:10:35,328 --> 02:10:39,819
characters and having them you know

2288
02:10:37,368 --> 02:10:42,618
animate properly and do stuff like that

2289
02:10:39,819 --> 02:10:44,899
so hopefully that'll be done probably by

2290
02:10:42,618 --> 02:10:46,908
next weekend and then we're free to kind

2291
02:10:44,899 --> 02:10:48,848
of drop characters in the game just like

2292
02:10:46,908 --> 02:10:51,589
we were currently for you to drop

2293
02:10:48,849 --> 02:10:52,460
environment stuff in the game and we can

2294
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:53,828
start playing with that a little bit

2295
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:56,539
more I guess it also allows us to

2296
02:10:53,828 --> 02:10:58,759
control how furniture gets set up and

2297
02:10:56,539 --> 02:11:00,019
stuff which we kind of want too so it's

2298
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:01,670
actually good not just for the

2299
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:08,179
characters but it'll also allow us to

2300
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:11,059
have more useful control over the not

2301
02:11:08,179 --> 02:11:12,590
you know not just not just organic

2302
02:11:11,059 --> 02:11:14,150
entities but actually inorganic enemies

2303
02:11:12,590 --> 02:11:15,949
