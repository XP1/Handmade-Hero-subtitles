00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
all right mmm thank you everybody for

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,369
coming by

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,130
I'm here with Casey Mira Tori of

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,809
handmade hero incorporated hello where

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,179
he makes only the finest handmade hero

6
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:16,559
so we got to get your image up again

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,019
do you want me to send you the video

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,169
feed again yeah okay you sure you up

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,768

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,170
right good luck

11
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:28,679
if this tanks your computer so I'm

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,960
clicking I'm doing all the know that was

13
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,700
pop out that was wrong okay yeah we're

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,210
fine and then I'll go back to the video

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,180
the game

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,000
oh the game is struggle blessing more

17
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,679
yeah of course

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,019
actually no the game is fine it's OBS is

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,859
struggle busing or whatever yeah you

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:54,000
need you need one of these new risin 7ap

21
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:57,780
use in your system John for extra thread

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,759
rather helps you could rip my dude most

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,739
of my CPU cores are doing nothing right

24
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,618
now okay let's just point that out oh

25
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:08,188
well you know multi-threading is hard

26
00:01:03,618 --> 00:01:12,719
yeah it actually is hard so that that

27
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:14,849
doesn't bode well so what's up John you

28
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,829
you said you wanted to talk today about

29
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:26,519
water and I'd be like water is hard man

30
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:28,019
well it's hard normally fortunately well

31
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,289
I don't even know where to start talking

32
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,938
about this let me give a little bit of

33
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,920
an intro for the people okay so

34
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:40,078
sometimes I work on video games so one

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:47,490
of the games that I am working on right

36
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:51,569
now has this kind of a situation where

37
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:53,489
you walk around in a grid world and you

38
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,589
sort of occupy one grid square at a time

39
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:59,188
and there are puzzly things that happen

40
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,020
so like I could push stuff around and I

41
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:03,118
could push stuff across the water and

42
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:05,459
then this little card can go in the

43
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,068
river and then I can get on that thing

44
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,288
and I can ride it for a while I can get

45
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,089
off I could push this rock into the

46
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,889
water and it can change the course of

47
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,539
the water so there's like a whole game

48
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:22,500
here with you know stuff that you do

49
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:27,090
mm-hmm and it's it's a pretty well

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,000
defined game in the sense that we will

51
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,650
in several senses so one it's a very

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,139
kind of an abstract game that operates

53
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,060
on grids and so you could have the same

54
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:40,589
game for the most part with like

55
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:43,170
terrible graphics right but part of what

56
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,229
we're doing in this project is having

57
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:51,689
nicer graphics for several reasons I

58
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:53,280
guess one is well because it's fun to do

59
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:55,469
that it's fun to make a game with good

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,629
graphics I know there is people will

61
00:02:55,469 --> 00:03:00,870
actually pay you to play your game if it

62
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:03,419
has good graphics but lastly you know

63
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,840
what I have discovered a long time ago

64
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,039
is that graphics actually really matter

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,769
they're not a separate thing from

66
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,340
gameplay you know like what what your

67
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:17,900
mind is doing when you play a game is in

68
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,189
part responding to what you see and

69
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,739
those responses will be different

70
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:24,359
depending on what you see right and and

71
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:29,009
so for these reasons I've always felt

72
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:31,230
that it matters what what your game

73
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:37,129
looks like right like you know early on

74
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:40,078
I don't know earlier in history and also

75
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:43,259
probably still some indie game

76
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:45,269
developers believe that like visuals

77
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,069
don't matter and like it just matters if

78
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,849
your game is a good game in terms of

79
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:52,799
some actual abstract rules or quote

80
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:54,449
mechanics unquote or whatever I hate

81
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,799
that word I don't hate the word but I

82
00:03:54,449 --> 00:04:02,129
think it's a good word and that's I

83
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,230
think it's demonstrably not true and you

84
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:06,090
know some games that I work on that's

85
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,548
even less true than other games so for

86
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,939
the witness it's extremely not true like

87
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,409
if you just accidentally put a bug in

88
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,879
the shader to make the colors a little

89
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:16,379
bit different in the witness part of the

90
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,659
game becomes unplayable yes

91
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:21,358
yeah and so it's like so clearly these

92
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,500
things are coupled to some degree but

93
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,060
part of the reason I was doing that

94
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,279
stuff we did in the witnesses because it

95
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,530
was becoming clear that they have a lot

96
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,149
to do with each other always

97
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:31,849
every day well since people like

98
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:34,189
analogies to things I mean I would hope

99
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,350
that most people wouldn't say like well

100
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:38,990
if you know if the script for a movie is

101
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,700
good then you don't need cinematography

102
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,980
or good actors or any of that stuff

103
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:45,139
because you know the viewer will just

104
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,640
hear the words of the script and

105
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,199
understand that it's like a great film

106
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,449
or something but it's like but that's

107
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,539
not what a film is right like a film is

108
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:55,430
many things coming together to make an

109
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,500
overall effect so you would assume that

110
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,090
unless you think games are somehow

111
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,550
magically different than all other media

112
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:04,219
it matters how all of the pieces are

113
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,020
interacting and the best examples of

114
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,750
things in that media should be things

115
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:11,389
where every single element that that

116
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,360
media has are all working together for

117
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:17,389
the same end right I mean that's that's

118
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,370
what makes a great game as opposed to a

119
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:20,930
great game design and those are

120
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,490
different things and should be

121
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,250
considered different things yeah

122
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,810
absolutely and you know that doesn't

123
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,668
even necessarily have to do with the

124
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:34,399
budget or whatever right rearranging our

125
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:37,549
cameras and it's hard to talk well yeah

126
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,879
I want more of a pier situation here yes

127
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,540
I was I was basically subsuming you you

128
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,909
you were you were becoming very very

129
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,379
eclipsed by my very presence okay this

130
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,880
is about as close as I'm going to bother

131
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,649
to get it right now so people who are

132
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:56,649
OCD are freaking out about the

133
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:56,649
mismatched cameras so

134
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,970
yeah I mean I agree with that completely

135
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,710
and it doesn't necessarily mean in terms

136
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,150
of talking about games that the budget

137
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,620
has to be high right like there's

138
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:17,109
different types of things looking nice

139
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,759
right there's the you know there is the

140
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,330
Michael Bay it's full of explosions

141
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,399
right and then there's like well you can

142
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:27,279
pick a game like I don't know Monument

143
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,109
Valley or something where you're

144
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,389
objectively speaking it's not like a

145
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,400
trillion hours went into modeling the

146
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,870
levels or something right but it's like

147
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,909
they picked an art style and a color

148
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,829
scheme yeah if it's well art directed

149
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:50,560
yeah art direction goes a really really

150
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:55,959
long way and so forth yep so yeah so for

151
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:58,000
all these reasons and many more we want

152
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,219
the graphics in this game to look good

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,990
and you know early on I didn't worry

154
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,290
about that early on it was just like hey

155
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,000
we just make a grid it was the whole

156
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,360
engine was 2d actually in the very

157
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,180
beginning and I started implementing you

158
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,060
know the rules and then gradually we

159
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,949
bolt it up and then sometime sometime

160
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,379
probably before the first year was out

161
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,779
started going 3d and then it was just

162
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:25,959
like well we have this game with 2d

163
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:27,909
bitmap tiles the first step in making it

164
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,739
3d is to just put those on each face of

165
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,870
a cube and now we're drawing cubes right

166
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,850
yep so it literally started there this

167
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,829
whole engine so this engine is being

168
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,890
made in a new programming language and

169
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:39,909
so there was zero zero code in the

170
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:41,680
beginning right mhm

171
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,510
this wasn't there like licensed unity

172
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,540
and buy some stuff on the asset store

173
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:53,459
kind of a situation it's we're building

174
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:55,600
this up literally from nothing so and

175
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,949
part of that is also figuring out

176
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,420
exactly what is the game that we're

177
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:59,860
making because I sort of knew in the

178
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,009
beginning but then as you work on it

179
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,980
more and more you get more of a concrete

180
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:09,399
idea so like the river stuff that I just

181
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,920
showed and and you know dropping rocks

182
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,539
in the water and all these things like

183
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,580
there are a lot of nuances like in the

184
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,350
beginning you think well what you know

185
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,800
you have to be able to drop rocks in the

186
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,699
water but

187
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:25,439
there's a lot of nuances that have to be

188
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:28,780
decided like between between having that

189
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,899
high-level idea and finishing the game

190
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:33,788
right and so so at this point we're far

191
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:35,408
enough along that I think we know most

192
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:38,979
of those and we can start doing stuff

193
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:40,208
anyway so right around someone's asking

194
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,009
why didn't I use the witness engine

195
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,569
because it's in C++ and it's made for

196
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:46,990
first-person games and this is a

197
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:51,790
third-person game which looks very

198
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:54,759
different right and I mean to be fair

199
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:59,740
you you it's not like you didn't move

200
00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:01,958
code over right I mean yeah no we did

201
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,959
that actually accelerated things a fair

202
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,599
bit yeah the fact that we did yeah over

203
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:11,649
I just brought the game up so you know

204
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,379
that the you don't have to reuse an

205
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:17,589
exact engine to still get a lot of reuse

206
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:19,809
out of stuff that you've developed yeah

207
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,190
I mean the editor for this game looks

208
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,769
very similar to the editor for the

209
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,040
witness because it is I mean you know

210
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:29,679
that that editor actually goes back to

211
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:31,778
yeah a happy cake right happy cake which

212
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,929
nobody will know what that is that's

213
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:37,600
right they can look it up it actually

214
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:38,849
goes back to a thing before happy yeah

215
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,879
was it gone

216
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:49,690
yeah lots of side-project people will

217
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:51,610
not know what they were okay so we can

218
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,950
start getting a little bit concrete at

219
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,500
this point after that great amount of

220
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,500
background I guess anyway so so around

221
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:04,479
around the end of 2018 beginning of 2019

222
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:06,278
I was like water is important in this

223
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,039
game there's a lot of islands in this

224
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:10,480
game right even if there weren't we want

225
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,208
nice-looking water in some of these

226
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,670
other scenes it's sort of like because

227
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:20,859
we have settings that are you know in in

228
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:25,078
watery places and well okay let's say

229
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:27,639
one more thing about about this game and

230
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:29,049
this is an idea that still has not come

231
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:30,909
to fruition but one of the high-level

232
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:33,279
ideas was like look

233
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:35,799
this game was chosen in certain ways

234
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,470
like the because I knew that we were

235
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:41,889
building a game from scratch right with

236
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,899
a new engine then I wanted to limit how

237
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,490
much we needed to do in certain

238
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,289
dimensions to have a feasible game so

239
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,659
for example in the witness you have like

240
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:51,789
infinite view distance we had to like

241
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:54,250
LOD all these things and like combine

242
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:57,549
meshes into clusters and like try to

243
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,159
paint the shadow map data into the mesh

244
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:02,289
by vertex past a certain distance and

245
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,669
get rid of texture data and all these

246
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:06,939
things that you do to make a

247
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:09,490
first-person game run faster with this

248
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,780
game part of the design was like oh this

249
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,730
will be a good project because the

250
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:17,409
camera is always on a localized place

251
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,110
like you can see here if I just pop the

252
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:22,809
game to the top for a minute the camera

253
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,750
there is looking down at a limited scene

254
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:28,869
and so if you decide like per square of

255
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,340
world what is the most dense that can be

256
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,610
in terms of triangles are a number of

257
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,649
textures or something then that puts a

258
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:40,060
cap on how much your engine ever has to

259
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:41,559
do mmm and then you know you don't have

260
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:44,199
to worry about certain things right we

261
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:46,179
could focus on building certain kinds of

262
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,890
capability in the engine and then worry

263
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:49,239
about other things like okay maybe

264
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,639
that'll happen when we do a first-person

265
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,799
game again right now it's not that

266
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,299
simple because we do have side views on

267
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,889
some of these levels and whatever but

268
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,949
for those particular levels you just

269
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:02,169
don't give yourself a problem right and

270
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,580
you still have a much more bounded

271
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:04,689
problem than you had before because

272
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,040
you're like look I still know I'm

273
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,050
looking at it from roughly this far away

274
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:10,539
I still know I'm only looking at it

275
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:12,429
across this angle spectrum etc etc so

276
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:14,409
yeah you have a lot more control yes

277
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:15,879
whereas first-person it's like oh dude

278
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:19,000
the player is gonna walk up all in

279
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:21,939
everything and yeah and so part of that

280
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,519
was wow you know so if we want to make a

281
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:28,420
game that looks really nice because we

282
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,100
have this very well controlled view like

283
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:31,689
it's so controlled that it doesn't even

284
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,120
scroll most of the time like we have

285
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,280
some levels that scroll but they scroll

286
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,019
between known positions even yeah so

287
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:42,159
it's like it's very very controlled mhm

288
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,620
give me one second I'm going to turn off

289
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,250
the air conditioning I have this modern

290
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,649
air conditioned

291
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,659
that much like computers they won't ever

292
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:53,519
do the right thing yep we have one of

293
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:53,519
those here yep we have one of those here

294
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:05,500
so I will have to turn that back on in

295
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,430
like probably an hour or something

296
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,309
mm-hmm

297
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:12,879
so one of the things I was thinking was

298
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:16,929
hey since were programming an engine for

299
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:19,960
this thing and the game has relatively

300
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:21,489
limited scenes we could go kind of over

301
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,550
the top when it comes to certain classes

302
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,870
of graphical effects right like hey

303
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:28,649
we're gonna have light beams in this

304
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,210
game we're gonna have a lot of water and

305
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:33,490
whatever else like crystals like all

306
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:38,740
these things we could just go kind of

307
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:41,169
insane in terms of how much like how

308
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,450
much pixel horsepower we spend on doing

309
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:45,339
those effects right because we sort of

310
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,920
have that budget that said we have to

311
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,050
not get into a situation where we end up

312
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,338
having to put in all the engineering

313
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:54,250
effort that I was just saying we were

314
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:56,800
gonna save right yeah but because you

315
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,100
kind of can't like yeah you have a

316
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,559
limited amount of engineering effort to

317
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,500
produce the game right yeah um but it's

318
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,899
always been the dream to like do that do

319
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,309
some really nice effects and maybe it's

320
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,689
kind of dumb because they're small on

321
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:12,219
the screen or whatever but maybe that

322
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,860
also lets us make them really nice

323
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:20,259
mm-hmm

324
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:21,850
so that is the history now we haven't

325
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:25,000
done most of those yet we do have some

326
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:29,560
limited effects that are pretty nice so

327
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,929
if I bring the game back up here I mean

328
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,819
they're not they're not like beyond

329
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:35,409
standardly nice but you know we've got

330
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,180
some of the basics so like there's this

331
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:40,209
crystal I'm next to and if you like

332
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:42,819
stare at it and see that it's doing you

333
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,650
know it's doing some refracted kind of

334
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,379
things yeah you know it's sampling the

335
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:49,059
frame buffer and whatever and that I did

336
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:50,980
some water stuff this week so that works

337
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:52,599
even if I drop it into the water so it's

338
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,060
actually like still refracting

339
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,089
underwater which may matter on some

340
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:58,969
levels and it's all you can't see it

341
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,069
that clearly

342
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,170
the water layers in front of it but

343
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,610
mm-hmm there's a nice depth fade on the

344
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,139
thing and all that so we're we're

345
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,269
starting to do some of these things but

346
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,100
as you can see also the water is very

347
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:12,409
basic I have these like circle like

348
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,850
particles moving around we'll talk in a

349
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:16,360
minute about what's going on there

350
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,360
mm-hmm

351
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:24,500
so about a year year and a half ago you

352
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,540
know I said to some people on the team

353
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,519
like hey it's it's probably time to get

354
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:33,438
more serious about the water and we

355
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:35,500
built up from the relatively minimal

356
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:37,610
infrastructure that we had at that time

357
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,860
we built up something that actually

358
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:43,519
looks nicer than what is currently here

359
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,528
okay so what what what you see right now

360
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,639
is not the best that this has ever

361
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:51,740
looked okay however you know some of the

362
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,480
things that we did were experiments that

363
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,188
were as they look better in the moment I

364
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,360
felt like these are not exactly on the

365
00:15:55,188 --> 00:16:00,740
path to what we actually want to do okay

366
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,919
so what I felt we were ending up with

367
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,049
was we were ending up with a lot of like

368
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,149
I didn't have a ton of time back at that

369
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:10,188
time to like I would like send people

370
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:15,019
some emails saying here's a here's a

371
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:16,429
description of what we need to do let's

372
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:19,490
talk about what that would be just so

373
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:20,989
that I'm not very vague so okay

374
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,778
there are gameplay requirements like

375
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,278
I've just mentioned right you know you

376
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:28,519
need to do the things in the gameplay

377
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:30,078
that I just mentioned and so because

378
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,209
it's a puzzle game that also requires

379
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,489
clarity so for example on this

380
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:37,099
screenshot you see it's pretty clear

381
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,600
where these gameplay rivers are you know

382
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,778
I could make it more clear very easily

383
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,790
by tinting this but like so there's this

384
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:46,250
particle motion but especially the color

385
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:50,299
right now which doesn't look very fancy

386
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:52,879
like the color you know I would not

387
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:56,058
describe this as a high production value

388
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,278
way of coloring the rivers but it's at

389
00:16:56,058 --> 00:17:02,088
least very clear right and that clarity

390
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:03,828
cannot be spoiled or it's it's something

391
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:06,140
that that we need to have control over

392
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:08,928
at all times right so fief up these

393
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,809
graphical effects it cannot be in a way

394
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:13,179
that makes it

395
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:14,588
like ambiguous in some levels when

396
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:16,089
you're playing where is the river and

397
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:19,778
where isn't and so one of the things we

398
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:21,428
were doing was well we have a okay so

399
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:23,859
let's talk about part of what we have

400
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:25,659
now is that we have this fluid simulator

401
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,938
running in the background here mm-hmm

402
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:32,289
which is where some of this stuff is

403
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:34,450
coming from so you know we seed it for

404
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:36,609
example with the flow directions of the

405
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,379
rivers and in this case not with

406
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:40,209
anything else so that you could maybe

407
00:17:38,378 --> 00:17:41,980
vertex paint some prefered flow

408
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,019
directions we had some mechanisms for

409
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,769
that mm-hmm and let me let me pop up a

410
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:49,628
little a little Hut here where okay so

411
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:51,278
this this image in the lower left is a

412
00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:54,128
shadow map which is maybe not that

413
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:58,990
relevant but that level the image just

414
00:17:54,128 --> 00:18:00,998
next to it is it's a fluid sim buffer

415
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:05,618
it's a little bit minified the actual

416
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:07,509
texture I think is 2 K by 2 K and it's a

417
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:09,308
4 component thing I forget I can point

418
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:11,169
people at the paper that this is except

419
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:14,259
I don't remember which one it is it's a

420
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:17,110
4 component texture where x and y our

421
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,639
flow direction and then Z and W I don't

422
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:24,278
remember in what order but they're like

423
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:27,908
pressure and vorticity right so it's an

424
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:29,950
interesting like piece to have under the

425
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:31,778
hood but we were do we used to be doing

426
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:35,649
a lot more with the output of this fluid

427
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:38,259
simulation than we're doing right now so

428
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:40,839
for example we were rendering like

429
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:42,548
instead of instead of this coloring of

430
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:46,778
the rivers that we have right now that

431
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:49,599
is based on just basically sampling the

432
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:51,220
gameplay like the gameplay data of what

433
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,709
happens to an entity when it goes into

434
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,819
the square is exported via a different

435
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,210
texture map that we're actually not

436
00:18:54,819 --> 00:19:00,128
drawing here right now and then that's

437
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,519
just being sampled in when we draw the

438
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:05,288
water plane currently mm-hmm and the

439
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,659
reason for that is because it's very

440
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:12,519
clear and we used to actually be

441
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:19,179
sampling the the fluid simulator right

442
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:20,859
and then like threshold amount is

443
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:22,909
greater than something then color it

444
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:25,819
river colored otherwise don't

445
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:28,639
and that was a little bit more organic

446
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:30,710
but it also um it wasn't very

447
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:34,548
controllable and it didn't look nice

448
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,858
right and so it wasn't and and you could

449
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,960
then try to maybe like filter that on

450
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:41,538
the back end to try to make it look more

451
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,608
nice but you're in the situation where

452
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:46,038
you're starting with data that doesn't

453
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:48,019
fundamentally look that nice and trying

454
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:50,868
to produce data that looks nice by

455
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:53,149
filtering it mm-hmm it's not a very good

456
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:55,368
position to be in sometimes you know

457
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:58,778
maybe it just wasn't working for me the

458
00:19:55,368 --> 00:20:01,249
things that we were doing there mm-hmm

459
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:04,190
so that's actually turned off right now

460
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:06,288
there's some other stuff so there was I

461
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,558
guess this came from some papers or

462
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:15,408
something there used to be an element in

463
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:22,368
here that involved what do you call it

464
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:28,599
oh geez I would call what OBS is not

465
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:31,819
happy again it involved like convecting

466
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:32,598
colors around in a secondary texture map

467
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:36,499
uh-huh right

468
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:38,178
mmm so so parallel to this one on the

469
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:39,829
right here that would be another texture

470
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,450
gap that it was the same size it was

471
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:43,460
just like you have colored and that was

472
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,440
a way of like doing ocean flow and we

473
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,899
did that and it like it looked cool in

474
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,269
the abstract uh-huh but it looked like

475
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:51,768
ink spreading around yeah which is it's

476
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,089
always gonna look like that I mean

477
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:55,548
that's know if they can look like really

478
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:57,439
yeah and I was like this isn't this

479
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:59,509
doesn't actually look like anything we

480
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,009
want right so let me talk about the high

481
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:04,579
level mission statement of what do we

482
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:07,970
actually want all right so we want not

483
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:10,819
ambiguous for gameplay mm-hmm sexy video

484
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:13,249
game water right what is 60 video game

485
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:18,200
water mean well it means it responds to

486
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:20,598
lighting right in a nice way it means

487
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,538
it's actually kind of 3d like we did

488
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:26,479
lots of prototypes of stuff where we

489
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:28,669
were doing sort of a more 2d illustrator

490
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:30,950
II water and we had some stuff that

491
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:33,470
looked kind of cool but like it was very

492
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,390
2d and if you're making a 3d game where

493
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,390
you have like 3d lighting

494
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,520
and you know the player is trying to

495
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,320
gauge where things are in space and all

496
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:48,710
these things then the more that you do

497
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:50,240
in 2d it's both a stylistic clash and it

498
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,860
makes the game harder to play sometime

499
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,069
because it's more difficult to judge

500
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:56,389
things yep

501
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:58,819
and so there's always this balance of

502
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,980
gameplay and looking nice and so some of

503
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,599
it you see so so on the water that you

504
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,490
see right now you know we have this grid

505
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,379
in the background and it's like not the

506
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,390
nicest looking grid yet but it's got

507
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,549
some elements of what we want right it's

508
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,259
like it's not a perfectly it's not like

509
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:13,819
a texture map just projected down there

510
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:16,339
it's being generated by a noise function

511
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:18,500
it's like it's got some other noise

512
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:20,539
function multiplied against it so that

513
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,179
it's not like a constant really annoying

514
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,918
grid but if you want to play you can

515
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:26,480
tell where the squares are and so if you

516
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,820
need to know if something is 8 squares

517
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,679
away across the ocean or not and you can

518
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:33,289
know that and it's not a problem right

519
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:36,110
yeah and we want water that looks really

520
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:40,308
nice like you would see in like a demo

521
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:44,479
of something i high-powered high

522
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:48,589
technology water but that doesn't ruin

523
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,779
gameplay right so based on that

524
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:53,839
description can I ask a couple questions

525
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:57,619
sure so the first question I have is as

526
00:22:53,839 --> 00:23:01,369
a game design is this the kind of game

527
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:04,789
where at some point the player is going

528
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:09,609
to be presented with a piece of water

529
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:13,159
like a pool of water with a block

530
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:15,199
blocking the mouth of the water that

531
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:24,860
they can then move and watch the water

532
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:26,419
flow out into something else there's two

533
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:28,849
versions of that right uh-huh

534
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:33,610
one is does the water level of the top

535
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:37,159
pool change like are we actually doing

536
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:39,379
volumetric transport exactly like yeah

537
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,230
I'm serving and the answer to that is no

538
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:46,490
okay but there's a related answer that

539
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:49,240
is yes which let me know jeez I after we

540
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,620
finished this piece I want to take a bit

541
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,839
up the windows in a little bit of a

542
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:58,839
better way here but I can go to this

543
00:23:52,839 --> 00:24:01,209
other level where for example we have

544
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:03,250
this elevated pool ah thank you this is

545
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:07,269
what I was asking basically yes but it's

546
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:10,359
not the water I don't think ever drains

547
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:13,990
out of this pool but things can go from

548
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:17,679
above to below but okay so so but my

549
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:23,200
question here a little more specifically

550
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:25,779
is does that happen dynamically meaning

551
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,480
could there have been a block in this

552
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:30,399
thin that two-square empty spot that you

553
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,329
then move so that the user has to see

554
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,160
the water come and fill in the area even

555
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:39,699
if it doesn't drain out existing water

556
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,220
can they see movement of water in a 3d

557
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,279
way is what I'm trying to get at yeah

558
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,529
well okay is that something that's going

559
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,589
to happen in this game probably to some

560
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:52,119
degree so okay you know so what we're

561
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,669
doing in this game is we're starting

562
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,679
from on the gameplay side I'm starting

563
00:24:54,670 --> 00:25:01,390
with a set of gameplay elements and then

564
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:03,250
we're exploring the way they interact

565
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:06,640
and sort of expounding on the

566
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,619
consequences mm-hmm and doing everything

567
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,200
that

568
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:13,229
well everything reasonable that those

569
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,340
things lead to right and so yes

570
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:17,589
otherwise known as the John blow method

571
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:20,409
of game design something like I don't

572
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:25,119
want to be typecast man not too late but

573
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:26,560
but so one of the things was you know we

574
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,319
had all these puzzle mechanics that were

575
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,169
defined in 2d and then we're extending

576
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,939
them to 3d right and so water was one of

577
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:37,570
the basic things and so extending water

578
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,700
to 3d is I wasn't gonna do it and then

579
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:41,200
we had a request from someone working on

580
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,480
the game to do it and it was like you

581
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:50,740
know what I like doing stuff okay let's

582
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:53,460
do all right okay but you know that so

583
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,870
the 3d part of it is in mid

584
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,789
implementation right like last week you

585
00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:01,059
couldn't even have to water planes

586
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:03,220
visually right now you can and it sort

587
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,500
of does it correctly except like the

588
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,059
the flow map data between the two levels

589
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,700
and shared right now or like the

590
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:13,690
rendering isn't totally separate right

591
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:16,410
but for example right so you see others

592
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:19,779
this upper there's this upper plane man

593
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:24,370
you know where it goes down there's sort

594
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:26,440
of a gap but the very least that needs

595
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:28,029
to be water going down and in fact

596
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,710
there's two possible things that could

597
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:31,779
be because right now there's a gameplay

598
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,569
River that's how you kind of want to see

599
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:37,450
a gameplay River going down right but it

600
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:39,669
also could be a non flowing at the edge

601
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,710
but then there's still water there right

602
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,390
because something could like this lily

603
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:48,009
pad would be able to go off the edge

604
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:49,660
right like whether whether there was a

605
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:51,069
river there or not if it was going in

606
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,320
the right direction and so you kind of

607
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:56,500
still need maybe like an infinity pool

608
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:58,179
like very slight amount of water over

609
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,559
the edge right there's at least you know

610
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,360
things that could happen there but then

611
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,039
if there's river over the edge we have

612
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:07,629
this thing where you can disrupt rivers

613
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:10,809
right and so the river then has to be

614
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:15,460
able to stop flowing and if you have a

615
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:18,339
situation like like this where you know

616
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,509
let's say again this is gonna be a

617
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:22,509
little bit confusing because of the

618
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:24,400
bottom layer but let's say and say you

619
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:25,960
have a river that's being fed from an

620
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,580
upper level and drops down at the lower

621
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,930
level yeah it looks like it's in the

622
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,509
lower level also but that's because

623
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:37,720
again right now we just have separate

624
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:39,069
yeah yeah if you have that situation

625
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,319
then you sort of want to be able to

626
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:44,139
disrupt the river up here and then this

627
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:46,389
river elimination that happens flows

628
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,920
actually down the waterfall and down to

629
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:55,509
the bottom right that would be the thing

630
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:57,100
to do mmm-hmm so but if that is actually

631
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:59,410
erasing the whole river

632
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:01,509
yeah well it's because the level is set

633
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,880
up in validly low like what's actually

634
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:05,950
happening over here is not actually

635
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,800
valid game play state okay don't bother

636
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,180
it like this is how this level should be

637
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,180
set up to be correct you're like not

638
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:15,070
allowed to have a rock you know at the

639
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,820
same time so what'll happen is it'll

640
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:22,460
it'll erase it up

641
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:25,759
till it hits an obstacle I see okay

642
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,350
actually that's a different bug it's a

643
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,419
different bug when it started erasing

644
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:31,099
the whole loop I guess other side

645
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:33,500
feeding in I guess that doesn't matter

646
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:34,668
from the perspective of what we're

647
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,548
dealing with I was just curious what was

648
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:39,049
yeah it's that thing that last you sure

649
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:41,388
wasn't supposed to happen

650
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:43,668
I actually just fix and water bugs this

651
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:45,199
morning that had to do with again this

652
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:47,538
rewrite that I was talking about to do

653
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,850
multi-layer it's it's in progress right

654
00:28:47,538 --> 00:28:51,619
so I would say so the term fixing water

655
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:54,500
bugs could either refer to what you were

656
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:55,908
doing or like neutering those little

657
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,619
things that like live on the surface of

658
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,980
the water well well I said I was gonna

659
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:01,989
mention what these white dots are there

660
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:05,149
yes

661
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,970
okay that was exactly the answer to the

662
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:10,189
question so thank you said and so I want

663
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,679
that stuff to happen I don't think I

664
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:16,429
want you to pull a lever and this starts

665
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:20,919
draining gosh although I mean do we do

666
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:25,370
that maybe okay like the problem is just

667
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:29,179
like okay normally if something is in

668
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:31,908
water you can't move it mm-hmm and so

669
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:34,548
you wouldn't you wouldn't normally be

670
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:38,389
able to move stuff but let me let me go

671
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:45,888
back to this level that that we were on

672
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:47,949
it's called KC MO there are some things

673
00:29:45,888 --> 00:29:52,250
that you can do in water so for example

674
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:54,200
this thing this door here is in the

675
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,970
water and I can open and close it this

676
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,519
energyfield thing by standing on this

677
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:02,960
button okay okay yeah you don't think

678
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:04,429
that wery propagate ocean flow through

679
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,690
that if it's blocked by that but we

680
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,669
probably should mm-hmm

681
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:10,090
you certainly could start blocking

682
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:13,038
something with that I think so like if I

683
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:15,709
if I mess with this level where like say

684
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:18,589
this block starts out on this and then

685
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:22,700
this is like let's put it over here just

686
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:26,148
to be clear so that's going to be open

687
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,788
at the start of the level right if I

688
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:29,469
manipulate this so I step off the button

689
00:30:28,788 --> 00:30:32,138
and close

690
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,548
oh that didn't actually all right so

691
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:35,109
that's not hooked up to rivers at all

692
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:36,460
but you could see that that should block

693
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:47,918
the river the same way as dropping

694
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:49,629
Estonian does mhm we just have so you

695
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,730
could have a level where there's one of

696
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:56,168
those at an upper level like feeding a

697
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:58,569
waterfall that turns on mm-hmm and maybe

698
00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:01,330
maybe we do that or maybe we just don't

699
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:03,308
build that level yeah right or here's a

700
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:06,398
here's a more annoying situation that we

701
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:08,558
also don't totally handle right now let

702
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:12,339
me move this guy over here we have the

703
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:15,819
bard who can charm monsters and other

704
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:21,250
characters and also crystals for some

705
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:24,450
reason so like she can get this thing to

706
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,769
go in the water but she can also like

707
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:29,679
steer it around what sits in the water

708
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:32,259
so she can like you know keep blocking

709
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,509
her and cause it to read Evert and stuff

710
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:37,808
so you can imagine one of these on an

711
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:40,269
upper level that you know that is

712
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:43,240
keeping the water in that she causes it

713
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:46,620
to move out of the way and so the

714
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,620
question is do we build that level

715
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:49,619
mm-hmm

716
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:57,609
what just happened

717
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:04,490
did the stream crash or something people

718
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:07,000
are complaining okay I think the stream

719
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:09,470
just went down or something

720
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,980
all right well they're saying it's back

721
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:13,430
okay

722
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:17,900
okay um I've been having very minor

723
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:22,130
internet outages here and I don't know

724
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:25,130
what to do about that except just to

725
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:27,710
move there's a lot of reasons to do that

726
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:34,340
besides the Internet yeah we are making

727
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:36,440
a local recording so so it'll be okay

728
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:42,500
you can watch any parts that you miss

729
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:47,680
later on mm-hmm and just to clarify one

730
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:50,029
thing about that so the rocks that are

731
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,460
blocked like the blocker rock that

732
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:54,109
you've got charmed right now yeah so

733
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,850
based on the way that it's rendered

734
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:58,129
right now my guess would have been that

735
00:32:55,849 --> 00:33:00,919
it wouldn't actually stop water from

736
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:04,580
flowing at all it would just stop water

737
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,230
from flowing like violently because it

738
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:08,269
looks like it's kind of submerged in the

739
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,370
water so does that mean there's kind of

740
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:12,619
two ways of blocking water in a sense as

741
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:14,269
well there's a blocking a river

742
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:16,899
quote-unquote which is a gameplay

743
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:19,789
element and then there's blocking water

744
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:23,509
which would change whether there was

745
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:25,819
water there or or not is that yeah yeah

746
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:28,190
a fair statement the property of this

747
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:31,549
rock right now is that you can step on

748
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:34,220
it but there is still water in the

749
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:36,200
square technically right but water can't

750
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:42,319
flow through it like there's water in

751
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:44,840
the square but like it doesn't do

752
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:47,000
anything right mm-hmm but you know if

753
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,490
you move the thing you still water right

754
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,349
yeah by the way your stream is now no

755
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,640
graphics for some reason I have no idea

756
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:54,649
yeah because I was while you were

757
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,620
speaking I was deciding to use that

758
00:33:54,650 --> 00:34:00,950
moment to start changing the windows

759
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:02,569
around okay and then that was a disaster

760
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,180
we can pause for a second if you want to

761
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:08,889
try and get it back

762
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:11,079
I just do this oh okay let's just pause

763
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:13,989
and do win so what I was trying to do

764
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,929
was make a window capture of like you

765
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:19,089
and discord but my knees get a black

766
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:23,139
screen from window captured on this

767
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:27,730
court that's the tie quality even yeah

768
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:30,398
so like I don't and of course there's

769
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:35,309
two discord windows it says at see Mira

770
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:35,309
Tori put it up and there's like nothing

771
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:42,059
I'm trying man I'm trying my best here

772
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:46,360
it's not possible to get high quality

773
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:51,360
yeah so the problem is the only way that

774
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:54,309
I have to get you is like display I got

775
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,050
like I want to have you up over the game

776
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:57,909
while I'm doing the game but I can only

777
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:00,970
get you on display so just for the

778
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:03,609
record like the obvious thing that you

779
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:05,559
want is you just want discord to have a

780
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,030
sources button that allows you to

781
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:08,139
connect over the network to someone

782
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:11,200
else's obs

783
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:14,199
right I mean yeah now you're just asking

784
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:16,119
for wait so we should just go add that I

785
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,679
mean granted I'm sure like it would take

786
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,329
seven years just to be able to like

787
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,069
build or something because there's

788
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:23,860
probably like you know 17 million

789
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:26,680
libraries and 27 thousand lines of code

790
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:29,110
but 27 thousand no 27 million lines of

791
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:32,710
code but that would be a nice thing to

792
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:41,710
add anyway continue to not allow these

793
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:44,320
people to ruin our day okay so those are

794
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:47,500
things that we actually have some

795
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,289
latitude in deciding how high-powered we

796
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:54,639
want to make this in terms of like is it

797
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:55,840
volumetric in some way and for the

798
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:02,109
purposes of what we're talking about

799
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:04,300
today I would be satisfied if it's like

800
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:06,130
fakely volumetric like I think if you're

801
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,750
rendering water you want some

802
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:11,710
interesting stuff to happen so for

803
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:13,869
example you know people may not be able

804
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:15,730
to see this very well I'll I'll actually

805
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,369
turn off my camera again for a second

806
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:21,550
because

807
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:25,179
which that's the wrong thing I know

808
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:27,220
there's so many things so in the upper

809
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:28,839
right for example you can see that

810
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:31,839
there's sort of a very milquetoast

811
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,730
displacement map that's happening on on

812
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,430
the water like if you look up there you

813
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,409
can sort of see some a little bit of

814
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:40,149
specular reflection of it it's just not

815
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:41,649
turned up right now it doesn't look very

816
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,849
good right now you know it's one of

817
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,809
those things that used to look a lot

818
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:46,750
better mm-hmm

819
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:48,699
but but the point is one one very

820
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,820
obvious way of making this water more 3d

821
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:53,679
is to at least have like normal maps

822
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,000
that are flowing with all this stuff

823
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,069
which actually is happening it's just

824
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,230
the lighting is not tuned right mm-hmm

825
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,519
but then you actually want it like if

826
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,090
you really want it to feel like water

827
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:05,380
right you don't just want it like little

828
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:08,140
normal maps you want to do like

829
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,930
displacement map at least or possibly

830
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:22,539
geometry like scrolling by mm-hmm you

831
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:27,399
want so if I do like like so there's a

832
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:31,150
subtle issue here right which is you

833
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:33,550
want your game to feel good mm-hmm not

834
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,559
necessarily in an exploitative way right

835
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,180
so I'm not one of these Inca people who

836
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:39,820
is like I want to reward you all the

837
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:41,230
time in fact a lot of people complain

838
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,570
about my games because I don't reward

839
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,710
them all the time look what just just

840
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,000
hear me out for a second what if when

841
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:48,760
you push the rock into the water all

842
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,710
these coins came spewing out yeah they

843
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,870
could make the Mario coin sound yeah

844
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:59,079
that would be great but so but there is

845
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:01,029
a thing about if something actually has

846
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:05,230
gameplay circumstan

847
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:07,540
consequence and is important then there

848
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:09,579
is a dimension to a game about that

849
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:13,980
thing feeling good or not yep right

850
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:18,130
mm-hmm but part of that feeling good is

851
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:20,340
let me put it this way things that are

852
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:23,440
important in gameplay state should have

853
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,430
proportionate impact visually enough and

854
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,280
auditorily

855
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:30,940
yes and so if something is important to

856
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,339
gameplay but it does

857
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:36,309
have as much impact like say visually

858
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:42,099
but you spent let's say you spent a lot

859
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:43,210
of effort like I don't even know I'm

860
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:44,829
trying to pick something that doesn't

861
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,480
have gameplay consequence let's just

862
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:48,430
let's just say you you you took this

863
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,838
gray grid that I'm standing on and put a

864
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:51,669
lot of effort into making that look

865
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,469
really nice hmm but then you drop the

866
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,079
rock into the water and it like looks

867
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:57,848
like it does now which isn't as bad as

868
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,859
it used to like it used to just be a

869
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:01,480
grid Klunk Klunk Klunk you can still see

870
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:03,068
that happening underneath mm-hmm

871
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,980
underneath the particles they're kind of

872
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:08,440
hiding I'm like if that's what it is but

873
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:11,139
like it looks like the Unreal Micro

874
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,088
polygons demo on the ground that I'm on

875
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:14,588
right now it's like that's a that's a

876
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:19,809
fundamental mismatch you don't really

877
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:22,119
want yep okay so in cinema that's called

878
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:25,900
Hitchcock's rule and basically it says

879
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:29,440
that the importance of something to the

880
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:31,180
scene should roughly correspond to the

881
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,599
amount of attention it gets in the frame

882
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:36,940
and yet this of course named after Robyn

883
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:40,170
Hitchcock from The Cure absolutely not

884
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,880
not no relation to Alfred Hitchcock and

885
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,460
so I mean basically the paraphrasing of

886
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,380
what you've said I think is something's

887
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,449
audio-visual presence in the game should

888
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:55,599
roughly correspond to its importance in

889
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:57,730
the gameplay yeah you know exact yeah

890
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,190
rules are never really rules but they're

891
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,210
just like rules of thumb you feel it

892
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,099
when that's not the case

893
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:06,250
Yeah right player feels it when that's

894
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:07,599
not the case okay what also leads

895
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,639
players to create their own games

896
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,960
sometimes where they'll like end up

897
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:12,818
spending a ton of time with something

898
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,710
that is not the game at all because you

899
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:16,300
made that more fun than the actual game

900
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:20,318
right and more interesting and engaging

901
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:23,289
but yeah and so so what I imagine is for

902
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:25,690
example let's let's say if I were to do

903
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:28,000
a very straightforward thing starting

904
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,650
here and just extrapolating forward if I

905
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,510
wasn't allowed to change the core

906
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,130
technology that we are using at all

907
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:35,950
mm-hmm

908
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:39,789
I will I will speak in a bit about maybe

909
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:41,559
why we need more technology or there are

910
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:44,079
some things about the underlying thesis

911
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:49,150
so far of

912
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,650
for example using using a fluid

913
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,539
simulator underneath to help generate

914
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:55,689
some of this stuff then either don't

915
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:57,249
work or that we need to add more in

916
00:40:55,688 --> 00:41:00,548
order to make them work mm-hmm

917
00:40:57,248 --> 00:41:02,978
but that's maybe getting a little ahead

918
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:06,400
of myself I would say like if I was to

919
00:41:02,978 --> 00:41:08,259
just take this forward right hmm what I

920
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,179
would do and and what I would I sent in

921
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:12,400
these emails originally right is like

922
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:15,999
okay for all these little white dots

923
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,349
that we're drawing these are actually so

924
00:41:15,998 --> 00:41:20,318
so what you see in front of you right

925
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:22,929
now is actually really stupid it uses a

926
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:25,298
tremendous amount more fill rate than

927
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:27,369
then you see mostly doing nothing

928
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:30,818
because these white particles are like

929
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:35,170
my debug particles if I go I go to the

930
00:41:30,818 --> 00:41:36,728
water particle render GL I can actually

931
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,588
show you how big these circles actually

932
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:41,228
are they're like huge

933
00:41:38,588 --> 00:41:43,420
no more overlapping and the reason is

934
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:47,489
that these are supposed to be for

935
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,729
example like normal mapped wavelets that

936
00:41:47,489 --> 00:41:51,579
constructively and destructively

937
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:55,808
interfere as they flow around right yep

938
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:57,519
and either you do a displacement map so

939
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:59,619
it's ironic that I say that nobody ever

940
00:41:57,518 --> 00:42:01,178
does deferred rendering but like maybe

941
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:04,559
you just add those into a height map

942
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:07,329
scaler into a buffer and then do the

943
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:10,329
normal map and lighting computation in a

944
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:11,829
post pass right or I think I think

945
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:15,699
actually you don't need to do that

946
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:19,719
because like supposedly you can't really

947
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:23,909
add normals or gradients but but you

948
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:26,048
actually can add by vectors and like I

949
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:30,518
think if you do something slightly

950
00:42:26,048 --> 00:42:32,708
correct in linear algebra aka geometric

951
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:34,958
algebra it comes out correct that you

952
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:36,608
could just evaluate normals and add

953
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:40,719
normals but I just I haven't sat down to

954
00:42:36,608 --> 00:42:43,958
figure out what that is but anyway you

955
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:45,639
have all these all these wavelets like

956
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:47,108
flowing around and constructively and

957
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:49,778
destructively interfering and that gives

958
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:52,119
you something that is more water like

959
00:42:49,778 --> 00:42:54,009
than what you already see and I think I

960
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:55,380
think I could get that going in like

961
00:42:54,009 --> 00:42:58,588
less than a day

962
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:01,680
turn you know we actually used to have

963
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:04,900
procedurally generated like little waves

964
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,909
like they were just like a sort of like

965
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,139
a sync pulse or whatever on each of

966
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:12,129
these it was just they were looking

967
00:43:08,139 --> 00:43:13,779
regular and and a little too scaled a

968
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,490
little too regularly like you want you

969
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,750
want big waves and medium waves and

970
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:18,399
small waves because you want something

971
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:22,119
noise like to happen when they mix

972
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,559
mm-hmm but also when you do that you

973
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:24,579
don't want it to be too noisy because

974
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,889
you want to be able to see the flow

975
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:29,289
going in a specific direction all right

976
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:32,949
all these things anyway so step one is

977
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:35,920
do that step two you know add that into

978
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:39,838
the Z offset of the ocean plane so that

979
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:43,389
it maybe does some stuff like occludes

980
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:45,549
at least the edges of some of these

981
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:48,059
little islands that you see here right

982
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,060
mm-hmm

983
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:54,539
that would also have a color component

984
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:57,220
so right now we have this very bland

985
00:43:54,539 --> 00:44:00,250
background color but you actually can

986
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:02,559
can set a bitmap that will color the

987
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:09,940
whole scene right so just your standard

988
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:12,489
diffuse color thing but then we have a

989
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,320
few mechanisms that that are disabled

990
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:16,719
right now so both may be a background

991
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,980
bitmap or else vertex painted stuff so

992
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,199
that you don't require people to have a

993
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:22,420
bit they have a vertex paint tool in the

994
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:24,159
editor and you could go paint like well

995
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,838
maybe the waves are bigger over here and

996
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,239
smaller over here right that could be

997
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:32,369
one of the channels or although that

998
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:35,439
seems a little bit not great because I

999
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:37,510
mean it it sort of goes a little bit

1000
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,940
against the grain of what's supposed to

1001
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:43,119
be going on which is to say that it's

1002
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,588
creating detail in the graphics where

1003
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,059
the detail doesn't actually exist in the

1004
00:44:44,588 --> 00:44:48,009
gameplay like it seems like someone

1005
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:50,108
should have to go put like some actual

1006
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,570
stuff over there to change what it looks

1007
00:44:50,108 --> 00:44:54,730
like a little you know I'm saying to you

1008
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:58,300
sort of but but also no because the

1009
00:44:54,730 --> 00:45:01,960
problem is the problem is you don't want

1010
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:03,580
it like this is a this is a kind of

1011
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,090
decision that has to be made correctly

1012
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:09,500
for any game okay

1013
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:12,079
and if you add a lot of stuff

1014
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:14,900
I mean maybe like maybe we could figure

1015
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,549
out the way to make that work but the

1016
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:20,869
problem with adding stuff is that people

1017
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:23,930
are always unconvinced gameplay right

1018
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:25,969
like do I need to get over there or

1019
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:28,509
something and if we had to do that on

1020
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:31,489
every level to make the level look good

1021
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:38,180
that starts to be a problem of its own

1022
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:39,709
and so and so let me turn this back now

1023
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:50,149
I'll make them I'll make them medium

1024
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:54,400
sized dots so like I would at least like

1025
00:45:50,150 --> 00:46:00,320
the ability to provide a good amount of

1026
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:01,910
visual visual interest on across a wide

1027
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:06,050
variety of levels across hundreds of

1028
00:46:01,909 --> 00:46:07,489
levels without needing to do that maybe

1029
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:10,789
now maybe that's the wrong assumption

1030
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:12,469
and we can talk about that or maybe

1031
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:20,480
other forms of visual interest like

1032
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:22,819
background bitmap plus you know just

1033
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,829
meshes on the ground under the water and

1034
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,440
controlling the overall opacity of the

1035
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:30,170
water and things like maybe that's

1036
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,889
enough visual interest it's hard to say

1037
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:35,840
mhm I feel like this would be a good

1038
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:37,690
point I kind of want another drink so

1039
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:41,450
why don't we do the thing

1040
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:43,909
let's get questions from people do you

1041
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:45,469
want to do the question curator thing

1042
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:46,940
for a few minutes I mean I guess we

1043
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:50,629
could but we haven't really talked about

1044
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:55,570
this yet so like I I kind of feel like

1045
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,570
the next thing to talk about is to I

1046
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:02,299
have a few more things to say about the

1047
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:04,340
fluid sim let me pause for a second and

1048
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,110
start some some tea and then we can talk

1049
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,789
about the fluid sim and then and then

1050
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,519
maybe you can just start throwing

1051
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:11,779
questions at me or whatever okay all

1052
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:13,489
right so back in a minute

1053
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,040
why don't you just chat with with the

1054
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:18,349
people well I'm gonna go get some tea -

1055
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:22,730
okay well people out there

1056
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:24,059
I can chat with the people and we'll be

1057
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:35,539
back in a minute

1058
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:36,789
[Music]

1059
00:47:35,539 --> 00:48:33,420
[Applause]

1060
00:47:36,789 --> 00:48:34,529
[Music]

1061
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:41,250
[Applause]

1062
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:41,460
[Music]

1063
00:48:41,250 --> 00:49:00,139
[Applause]

1064
00:48:41,460 --> 00:49:00,139
[Music]

1065
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:13,899
water is not boiled yet but it's getting

1066
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,900
there

1067
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:37,578
okay is Casey back yes I am actually

1068
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:43,180
all right great so here's what I thought

1069
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:46,700
of to say about this issue so whereas

1070
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:48,649
the visuals of things the the Robyn

1071
00:51:46,699 --> 00:51:51,159
Hitchcock rule that we discussed is true

1072
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,160
mm-hmm

1073
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:58,940
it is not it does not completely

1074
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,559
determine things yes and so there are

1075
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,900
there are aesthetic dimensions to

1076
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,269
whatever you're talking about that are

1077
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,950
essentially extra or that give you

1078
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:11,710
freedom to make other decisions right

1079
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:15,858
and so for example in a game like this I

1080
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:17,690
probably want the visuals of an island

1081
00:52:15,858 --> 00:52:19,670
that I'm standing on to be very distinct

1082
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:21,440
from the water so I don't have to squint

1083
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:25,130
and say where's Island and where's water

1084
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:29,659
I mean but if I make the island like

1085
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:31,539
brown or like a volcanic color or you

1086
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:34,068
know green grassy color or whatever

1087
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:36,858
doesn't necessarily matter that's a

1088
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:41,019
degree of freedom that I have right I'm

1089
00:52:36,858 --> 00:52:43,730
deciding what the level looks like and I

1090
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:50,900
mean that's that's obvious so far I

1091
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:53,838
suppose and so I would say that the goal

1092
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:56,740
actually let me get I got to get the cup

1093
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:59,119
for my tea sorry back in one more second

1094
00:52:56,739 --> 00:53:05,298
are we gonna get the swirling the

1095
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:06,980
awesome like swirling chai thing one of

1096
00:53:05,298 --> 00:53:09,170
my favorite parts of John streams is

1097
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:11,780
when you do the swirling try like and

1098
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:14,720
there's the rock music playing if you do

1099
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:17,619
not have a cup for it I mean you can

1100
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:20,000
pour it straight in but are we getting

1101
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:23,210
John are we gonna get the swirling chai

1102
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,940
rock like hard rock thing we have no

1103
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,809
milk right now I almost went out and got

1104
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,730
some all right I don't

1105
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:33,099
okay now that might be a bonus stream

1106
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:33,099
tonight okay okay so

1107
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:43,759
I would say that part of the goal is to

1108
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:47,059
when we're building a water system right

1109
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:53,240
is that we want to be aware that that

1110
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:54,710
presents certain dimensions of aesthetic

1111
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:56,929
explore ability that are a little bit

1112
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:58,760
extra like the color of an island or you

1113
00:53:56,929 --> 00:54:00,799
know the style of whatever the grass is

1114
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,460
or whatever all these things are right

1115
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,880
mm-hmm

1116
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:08,510
we want to both create something that

1117
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:10,780
provides ample ability or ample

1118
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:16,010
opportunities for that kind of

1119
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:17,930
elaboration mm-hmm and also that

1120
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:20,570
something that technically lets us do

1121
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:25,159
those things mm-hmm you know and so so

1122
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:30,619
with the fluid sim for example well okay

1123
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:33,170
so so we can drive particles they the

1124
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:35,450
direction about where they go could come

1125
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:37,220
from the fluid sim or it could come from

1126
00:54:35,449 --> 00:54:39,679
somewhere else right on particular

1127
00:54:37,219 --> 00:54:41,929
levels like if if there's a level where

1128
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:44,319
there aren't any rivers and the flow is

1129
00:54:41,929 --> 00:54:47,480
not going to change you could have a

1130
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,880
statically painted flow map or an

1131
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,380
algorithmic the painted flow map or

1132
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,670
something and that gives you opportunity

1133
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,160
to do certain kinds of things so you

1134
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:56,960
could imagine like a lone Island in the

1135
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:59,210
middle of the water where the waves kind

1136
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,070
of like radiates around it it was sort

1137
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:05,710
of like a Zen garden kind of a feeling

1138
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:09,200
right or you could imagine just waves

1139
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:12,079
constantly coming from you know

1140
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:14,029
Southeast to Northwest like maybe maybe

1141
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,500
the fiction of a series of levels is it

1142
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:17,180
you're trying to get to the south east

1143
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,880
like into the wind I don't know right

1144
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:20,659
hmm so whatever these opportunities are

1145
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,608
mm-hmm

1146
00:55:20,659 --> 00:55:26,809
we want to be able to play around with

1147
00:55:24,608 --> 00:55:29,779
whatever those dimensions are and so the

1148
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:32,539
wave height thing was one example of

1149
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:36,080
that however I will say that it often

1150
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:37,130
looks weird right if you just what

1151
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,588
awesome looks weird

1152
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:41,119
sorry I meant wave wave size like

1153
00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:43,519
painting wave size around different

1154
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,800
parts of the map uh-huh right yeah like

1155
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:47,630
if you paint that in a way where you're

1156
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,940
kind of being responsive to what the

1157
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:50,380
islands are like

1158
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:53,349
you're just saying I'm sort of painting

1159
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:55,119
it where waves are big when you're a

1160
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:57,940
certain distance from the islands right

1161
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,000
then that could look more natural but if

1162
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:04,240
you if you do it in a way that doesn't

1163
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,099
correlate then it looks weird right and

1164
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:10,449
so then the question is well should we

1165
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:12,010
Auto generate wave size or do we prefer

1166
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:13,088
sort of having the freedom or do you

1167
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:14,740
want something in-between where you

1168
00:56:13,088 --> 00:56:18,309
generate it but let people modify it

1169
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:20,469
okay you know anyway hmm

1170
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:23,318
so so the last thing I want to say right

1171
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:25,480
so we can control particles from fluid

1172
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:27,489
soon we can control them from a

1173
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,289
statically painted thing we could maybe

1174
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:31,689
have a crossfade between those things

1175
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:35,019
hmm but the idea behind a fluid sim to

1176
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:37,030
begin with is that like it automatically

1177
00:56:35,019 --> 00:56:39,789
generates complexity for you to some

1178
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:41,500
degree that responds to the things in

1179
00:56:39,789 --> 00:56:44,739
the level right so you can sort of see

1180
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,630
like this Brown island on the north I I

1181
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:50,078
put that there with the river flowing in

1182
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:52,990
so you can sort of see that like there's

1183
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,789
this gameplay flow causing the particles

1184
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:56,588
to go in and then they sort of like flow

1185
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:58,599
around to the left and go out and we

1186
00:56:56,588 --> 00:57:00,519
bunch up in these little pools yeah and

1187
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:02,410
that's all caused by the simulator like

1188
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:04,420
nobody had to hand-paint that right and

1189
00:57:02,409 --> 00:57:06,338
that's good just to the extent that it

1190
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:09,700
produces behavior that you like yep here

1191
00:57:06,338 --> 00:57:12,608
it's a little bit it's a little bit

1192
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:13,838
weird looking if you like sit down and

1193
00:57:12,608 --> 00:57:16,210
think about it because you're like wait

1194
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:18,130
shouldn't the shouldn't the sum of flow

1195
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,990
into one side be equal to the flow out

1196
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:24,220
the other side and the reason it's not

1197
00:57:19,989 --> 00:57:27,868
is because for purposes of gameplay

1198
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:30,730
clarity we cheat particle velocities

1199
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:33,970
when they're inside gameplay flow so

1200
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:37,329
like the the fluid simulator like in

1201
00:57:33,969 --> 00:57:39,250
this 2 by 3 or 2 by 4 grid that's kind

1202
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:41,050
of going into the little bay there or

1203
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:43,568
whatever what's it called when it's like

1204
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:46,269
not a bay but it's connected on both

1205
00:57:43,568 --> 00:57:47,889
sides I have no idea channel it's a

1206
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:54,579
channel that's kind of got bays on each

1207
00:57:47,889 --> 00:57:57,639
side okay um so the the actual fluid sim

1208
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:59,230
has a much lower velocity for the

1209
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:01,960
particles going in but were we're

1210
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:04,150
amplifying it

1211
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,480
for gameplay clarity because one thing

1212
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:08,710
that happens if you don't do that is

1213
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,380
there doesn't seem to be that big of a

1214
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:13,119
difference between River and non River

1215
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:15,010
because one of the things that a fluid

1216
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,890
sim is going to do is it smooths out the

1217
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:19,980
velocity field right and so even if you

1218
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:24,639
color River differently from non River

1219
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:28,420
then a the actual visible difference

1220
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:31,629
between what you see in the river and

1221
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,519
what you see outside the river is not

1222
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:35,079
going to be very large by default if you

1223
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:37,630
just say there's River here and you let

1224
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:42,400
the fluid sim solve the rest and that's

1225
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:44,890
actually bad probably right because then

1226
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,930
if the idea it like why is that lilypad

1227
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:48,608
not flowing but if I push it one Square

1228
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:50,608
over it does flow the particles are

1229
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:53,949
going just as fast in each place

1230
00:58:50,608 --> 00:58:56,558
approximately and so so that's like

1231
00:58:53,949 --> 00:59:00,009
mentally very weird all of a sudden and

1232
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:04,119
that's a problem that I would like to

1233
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:06,400
solve and so if you think about it like

1234
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:10,420
what's a fluid sim gonna do if you just

1235
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:12,910
say all the water is all the water is

1236
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:16,930
still and then you have a flowing river

1237
00:59:12,909 --> 00:59:18,909
right here it's gonna make the stuff

1238
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:19,598
right next to it almost flowing river

1239
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:22,298
right

1240
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:25,240
yeah and that sort of violates the

1241
00:59:22,298 --> 00:59:26,920
extreme discreteness of our gameplay

1242
00:59:25,239 --> 00:59:28,689
world yeah it's a little bit of a

1243
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,318
contradiction in what we're asking for

1244
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:35,230
yeah and now sometimes that means you

1245
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:37,029
shouldn't ask for that but sometimes it

1246
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:40,929
means there's an opportunity to find

1247
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:46,329
something that's still systemic and

1248
00:59:40,929 --> 00:59:48,730
complex but that gives you what you want

1249
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:50,410
and so one example like I said before

1250
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:52,869
maybe we shouldn't have a fluid sim

1251
00:59:50,409 --> 00:59:55,480
that's one way to do it or maybe we need

1252
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:58,740
more on top of the fluid sim so if you

1253
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:02,019
imagined like like what would it take

1254
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:07,868
actually to have a strongly flowing

1255
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:09,429
river like this with the water next to

1256
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:11,470
it kind of being still you would need

1257
01:00:09,429 --> 01:00:15,399
some kind of counter pressure right and

1258
01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:18,568
so like an announcer like

1259
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:22,000
I mean you can't really is the answer

1260
01:00:18,568 --> 01:00:23,650
well I mean I haven't experimented with

1261
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,420
it I mean obviously if you have counter

1262
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:27,789
pressure it's like coming from somewhere

1263
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:31,510
right III meant you can't in nature

1264
01:00:27,789 --> 01:00:34,028
sorry yeah I mean in nature you just

1265
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:35,289
couldn't have this line of life stuff

1266
01:00:34,028 --> 01:00:37,480
around it not flow that's just not a

1267
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:38,980
thing right yeah and so so the question

1268
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,159
is are there things that we could feed

1269
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:45,519
in mm-hmm that would make something more

1270
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:48,038
like that and maybe like maybe we could

1271
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:49,119
make it so that you know next to any

1272
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:51,579
River like this

1273
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,640
there's squares of water that are like

1274
01:00:51,579 --> 01:00:56,769
flowing into it instead of out of it or

1275
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:58,568
that are twisting into it right even if

1276
01:00:56,769 --> 01:01:00,940
the net flow in the square isn't that

1277
01:00:58,568 --> 01:01:03,009
big yep and that might actually be

1278
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:04,450
visually very interesting all right and

1279
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:06,490
it might help with this problem and then

1280
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:09,639
we cheat to bridge the rest of the way

1281
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:12,969
that's one thing okay um another thing

1282
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:18,190
though this is all very obviously 2d

1283
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:19,808
right now right the the particles the

1284
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:22,750
circular particles that I have right

1285
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:27,670
here okay and let me just say I don't

1286
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:30,639
think we should want or need to do like

1287
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:32,170
a 3d fluid sim if we stay with fluid Sam

1288
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:34,480
I think we can get by with like you know

1289
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:36,099
yeah some 2d find Sims paint

1290
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,019
I agree with you stood together huh like

1291
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:40,119
it's so it's so massively more

1292
01:01:38,019 --> 01:01:42,159
computationally expensive to do oh yeah

1293
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:44,140
to do 3d that we don't want to do that

1294
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:46,420
yeah but one very easy thing that we can

1295
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:50,409
do is we can have some inside the water

1296
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:54,818
particles right that fill out sort of

1297
01:01:50,409 --> 01:01:57,068
the fill out the square so that this

1298
01:01:54,818 --> 01:01:59,469
river kind of area doesn't just feel

1299
01:01:57,068 --> 01:02:00,788
painted on top right like it it has some

1300
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:03,578
depth and that could be done with

1301
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:07,000
current the current system like current

1302
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:11,140
technology but but I mean I it's just to

1303
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,539
say that like whether the fluid sim is

1304
01:02:11,139 --> 01:02:16,118
the right thing is in question like it

1305
01:02:13,539 --> 01:02:17,789
does these things that are good and it

1306
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:20,230
also does some things that are bad and

1307
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:21,670
the things that are bad are actually

1308
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:23,139
worse than the things that are good

1309
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:26,200
because the things that are bad

1310
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:28,150
interfere with gameplay clarity and even

1311
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:29,259
not even necessarily clarity because I

1312
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:32,230
could just like pump

1313
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:35,350
the brightness on on the actual river

1314
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:40,510
areas and and say look it's very clear

1315
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:42,670
but like you you also want to sell it

1316
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:45,100
like you want your brain to accept what

1317
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:47,289
it's seeing yeah yeah and and so that

1318
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:49,929
lilypad really should be in an area with

1319
01:02:47,289 --> 01:02:52,059
not that much net flow like maybe you

1320
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:54,730
could imagine that it's it's maybe got a

1321
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:56,019
string connecting it to a little Lily

1322
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:58,090
yeah

1323
01:02:56,019 --> 01:03:01,929
stem connecting it somewhere and it

1324
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:03,070
won't really move in a small current yet

1325
01:03:01,929 --> 01:03:04,719
but it will in a bigger current

1326
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:07,030
something like that like we can do all

1327
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:09,368
these little things put together to like

1328
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:12,340
sell what's happening but of course we

1329
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:13,660
have to decide what that is and then the

1330
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:17,500
last thing I would say is there's a

1331
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:19,118
question when I talk about I can talk

1332
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,280
two days about this but there's a

1333
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:25,300
question you know when I push when I

1334
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:27,609
push this stone into the water right now

1335
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:30,490
we make these very 2d particles right

1336
01:03:27,608 --> 01:03:33,969
and part of the reason that's so big

1337
01:03:30,489 --> 01:03:35,979
is to cover up the fact that we're

1338
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:37,689
changing a square at a time in terms of

1339
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:40,090
the coloration they're just something

1340
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:43,000
that we would fix the underlying yes

1341
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:44,680
happening yep but also you probably just

1342
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,420
don't want a bunch of 2d particles right

1343
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:49,329
like if you're doing sexy video game

1344
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:50,349
water for the Year 2022 uh-huh 2023

1345
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:53,469
we're not announced I don't know when

1346
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:56,858
the games coming out 2021 january

1347
01:03:53,469 --> 01:04:02,669
negative 3rd 2021 yep um no that is not

1348
01:03:56,858 --> 01:04:05,619
it you know you would actually want

1349
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:07,750
probably to see some like how does this

1350
01:04:05,619 --> 01:04:09,490
feel good right well there's good sounds

1351
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:12,789
but there's good visuals you see like

1352
01:04:09,489 --> 01:04:15,579
the the wave front has like you know

1353
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:19,389
some very active energetic water that's

1354
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:23,469
plowing forward making the changes that

1355
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:24,849
you made yep right and then so this this

1356
01:04:23,469 --> 01:04:26,769
rectangle that's next to where I'm

1357
01:04:24,849 --> 01:04:28,539
standing right now that's actually a

1358
01:04:26,769 --> 01:04:30,519
little bit of a mistake but there is

1359
01:04:28,539 --> 01:04:31,599
some entity work going underneath it

1360
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:33,369
doesn't it doesn't get rendered

1361
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,409
correctly quite yet but there's little

1362
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:37,660
turbulences that get drawn so like when

1363
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:39,429
the water when the water stops that this

1364
01:04:37,659 --> 01:04:41,559
rock there should be one here on the so

1365
01:04:39,429 --> 01:04:42,730
there is you just can't see it see how

1366
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:46,389
like my feet or

1367
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:48,579
kind of cyan color uh-huh

1368
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:51,549
there's this little turbulence rectangle

1369
01:04:48,579 --> 01:04:53,170
here on the yep on the rock and then

1370
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:55,300
there's one here on the ground and the

1371
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:57,099
idea would be we would draw those into

1372
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:59,260
the depth buffer or maybe some geometry

1373
01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:03,400
to be like oh there's water hitting

1374
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:05,410
these points and splashing back right so

1375
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,090
it would be more dynamic mm-hmm like

1376
01:05:05,409 --> 01:05:08,739
what what you it wouldn't just be water

1377
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:10,780
smoothly flowing around a corner it

1378
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:12,849
would be like waters hitting this corner

1379
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:15,310
and kind of getting like violently

1380
01:05:12,849 --> 01:05:16,900
knocked back or mildly violently not

1381
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:18,579
back uh-huh so there's been a little bit

1382
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,769
of work in that direction but as you can

1383
01:05:18,579 --> 01:05:25,539
see it's like not hooked up um that's

1384
01:05:20,769 --> 01:05:28,869
probably enough of me just saying stuff

1385
01:05:25,539 --> 01:05:34,539
okay I mean I think I have everything

1386
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:43,780
now yeah so I have to know get you back

1387
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:47,759
on display capture okay so what is your

1388
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:51,010
opinion about what should be done uh so

1389
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,869
let me first ask a couple questions

1390
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:56,470
about what you were trying to do so far

1391
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:59,230
so if I understand you correctly sort of

1392
01:05:56,469 --> 01:06:03,608
the original concept here was you were

1393
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:07,300
going to have I believe they call these

1394
01:06:03,608 --> 01:06:09,449
methods wave packet methods right where

1395
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:12,609
you're basically like sending little

1396
01:06:09,449 --> 01:06:14,500
wave tracers around that rather than

1397
01:06:12,608 --> 01:06:16,779
being rendered as particles or level

1398
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:20,530
sets they're rendered as little like

1399
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:23,680
wave functions that are trying to like

1400
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:25,960
have a phase that roughly gets set

1401
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:28,449
relative to something that was sort of

1402
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,858
the original basic design of what you've

1403
01:06:28,449 --> 01:06:31,779
got on the screen right now you just

1404
01:06:29,858 --> 01:06:33,819
haven't actually done that yet that's

1405
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:36,369
why it's still just part of like circles

1406
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:39,609
and not an actual thing yeah basically

1407
01:06:36,369 --> 01:06:42,100
what I'm imagining is that each one of

1408
01:06:39,608 --> 01:06:43,719
those particles probably has a color

1409
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:45,130
component that acts in the way that you

1410
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:47,199
would expect that like blends with the

1411
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:50,050
other one uh-huh but then also probably

1412
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:51,368
has a geometric component okay and maybe

1413
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:55,880
you're adding that now the thing about

1414
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:56,838
that is that's already kind of 2d look

1415
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,730
you imagine that you were like

1416
01:06:56,838 --> 01:07:01,670
tessellating things down to an extreme

1417
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:04,278
level maybe you would just want the test

1418
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:06,019
later to make triangles there's mmm-hmm

1419
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:09,349
and maybe that's better somehow okay um

1420
01:07:06,018 --> 01:07:11,419
but but that's the basic idea and we had

1421
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:14,240
both of we've had color in the past

1422
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:16,849
uh-huh and we've had we've had like

1423
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:18,439
normal maps in the past yeah we haven't

1424
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:19,640
had both and with the normal maps

1425
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,670
they've always been weird they like

1426
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:24,739
we're added we're yeah yeah you know and

1427
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:27,019
and so and then the other question is

1428
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:28,639
how much motion do you get like if

1429
01:07:27,018 --> 01:07:31,129
they're just like if it's if you imagine

1430
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:34,629
like a sync pulse that doesn't move huh

1431
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:38,390
right and that's just going through huh

1432
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:40,039
you might need so many particles to do

1433
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:40,730
that that it's totally unreasonable for

1434
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:43,009
that to look good

1435
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:44,719
yep but if you like oscillate the sync

1436
01:07:43,009 --> 01:07:47,079
pulse up and down so it's like actually

1437
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:49,969
a standing wave that's animated you know

1438
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:51,559
like like a lot of simpler wave systems

1439
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:53,719
do then you probably don't need nearly

1440
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:55,309
as many because you get a lot of motion

1441
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:57,288
out of that and that's actually what

1442
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:59,089
waves do in nature I think yes they're

1443
01:07:57,289 --> 01:08:01,278
sort of moving and and this body of

1444
01:07:59,088 --> 01:08:03,170
water is has momentum to go up and then

1445
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:04,909
it's falling right now and so you can

1446
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:07,159
sort of be simulating that to get I

1447
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:09,409
think to drive us a little bit onto the

1448
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:11,179
topic of like what are you actually

1449
01:08:09,409 --> 01:08:14,750
simulating yeah and so the idea here is

1450
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:20,539
that I mean the idea here is at some

1451
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:23,929
level every particle is simulating a

1452
01:08:20,539 --> 01:08:25,759
piece of water in some way like not not

1453
01:08:23,929 --> 01:08:28,190
it as I have a resolution as you would

1454
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:30,319
need to do like anything like serious

1455
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:32,178
simulation but but to get visuals out of

1456
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:36,048
it and that's that's actually a stark

1457
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:37,940
difference so like way back in the day a

1458
01:08:36,048 --> 01:08:40,488
couple years ago or whatever I had I

1459
01:08:37,939 --> 01:08:43,608
made a system that was much simpler but

1460
01:08:40,488 --> 01:08:46,519
it looks better again right um but was

1461
01:08:43,609 --> 01:08:48,770
limited and what that was was you know

1462
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:50,929
we know the gameplay flow direction you

1463
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:52,520
had all these grid points and so we'll

1464
01:08:50,929 --> 01:08:55,190
tessellate each square into like four

1465
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:59,210
points and then we'll do like a blend of

1466
01:08:55,189 --> 01:09:02,149
you know normal maps like every every

1467
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:05,600
pixel had like four normal Maps blended

1468
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:08,119
together and and from from the neighbors

1469
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,690
ramp and and the normal from the

1470
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:12,920
neighbor was like the flow and whatever

1471
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:14,939
it was me and so that was a very

1472
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:17,789
relatively straightforward simple

1473
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:19,858
gridded way of getting some kind of nice

1474
01:09:17,789 --> 01:09:22,319
you know water flow that was

1475
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:25,079
controllable is just very gritted and

1476
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,460
very not organic yep it doesn't give you

1477
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:28,859
any where to go once you've done that

1478
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:32,489
it's like okay great now I've got some

1479
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:35,270
grids and I've got some water and it's

1480
01:09:32,488 --> 01:09:38,039
not as nice as I would like yep okay

1481
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:39,630
it's and so this was our attempt at like

1482
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:41,880
okay how do you how do you do something

1483
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:43,770
different okay instead of instead of

1484
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,650
generating your normal Maps or whatever

1485
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:49,069
your waves from these fixed grid points

1486
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:54,738
going into fixed directions we'll do it

1487
01:09:49,069 --> 01:10:01,380
just by having particles moving freely

1488
01:09:54,738 --> 01:10:04,529
okay so I think I've got it all so now I

1489
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:06,960
will I will say what I think

1490
01:10:04,529 --> 01:10:08,849
off the cuff of my head with some with

1491
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:13,489
some caveats so there's a couple

1492
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:16,350
important caveats one is that so

1493
01:10:13,488 --> 01:10:17,879
so continuum dynamics is not my thing I

1494
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:19,410
mean we'll start with that obviously I

1495
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:24,329
don't do this for a living even a little

1496
01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:25,649
bit so you know my my thinking on this

1497
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:31,010
topic is not going to be particularly

1498
01:10:25,649 --> 01:10:33,448
good and the second thing is that you

1499
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:38,010
know most the time when I work on a

1500
01:10:33,448 --> 01:10:40,559
problem like this I do probably have a

1501
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:43,530
pretty good idea when I start that's not

1502
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,969
terrible but after I actually sit down

1503
01:10:43,529 --> 01:10:46,259
and really work the problem for six

1504
01:10:44,969 --> 01:10:47,880
months I'm at a completely different

1505
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:50,579
place so I'm just guessing that whatever

1506
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,529
I say now is also not what I would end

1507
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:58,189
up with if I actually went so you know

1508
01:10:52,529 --> 01:11:00,420
it's the place I would start right yeah

1509
01:10:58,189 --> 01:11:03,238
so my high-level thinking on this is

1510
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:05,550
that I actually I guess I disagree with

1511
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:08,369
the second part of what you just said

1512
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:10,739
which was that you had a system where

1513
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:12,300
you took a grid and you did the for like

1514
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:13,409
normal map lending thing and you were

1515
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,850
like but I don't know where to go from

1516
01:11:13,409 --> 01:11:17,609
there so you switched to the particle

1517
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:19,829
one I guess I think maybe that first

1518
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:22,109
system sounds more like the right system

1519
01:11:19,829 --> 01:11:23,809
to me and let me go through why I think

1520
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:28,409
that

1521
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:30,630
so from from looking at the problem the

1522
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:34,229
way you've described it I feel like the

1523
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:36,750
way that I would think of it is this is

1524
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:39,500
a game that wants the water to be what

1525
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:41,760
the water is gonna be at each Square and

1526
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,890
the reason I say that is because

1527
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,530
everything else in the game is about

1528
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:48,750
what's on that square so much like you

1529
01:11:46,529 --> 01:11:51,509
said if the lily pad is staying still

1530
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:53,369
the last thing I want is the water sim

1531
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:55,170
to come in here and draw some particles

1532
01:11:53,369 --> 01:11:57,569
clearly moving past that lily pad

1533
01:11:55,170 --> 01:12:00,329
because that just feels weird and it

1534
01:11:57,569 --> 01:12:01,559
makes the makes the player not really

1535
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:03,390
understand what the heck is going on

1536
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,700
because they look at the thing and they

1537
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:07,320
go oh so I guess the water is not really

1538
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:09,300
a thing I'm just supposed to look at

1539
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:11,250
like the color of the water cuz that's

1540
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,600
the thing that actually tells me and the

1541
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,310
motion of the waters are relevant

1542
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,250
because I can't trust it or something

1543
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:19,590
right and so I feel like if you go too

1544
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:21,539
far down that route you're always gonna

1545
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:23,159
be fighting this sort of like cognitive

1546
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:25,199
dissonance between what the water looks

1547
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:26,670
like it's doing and you're always gonna

1548
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:31,050
have to paper over the fact that's not

1549
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:33,960
doing the right thing so for me the the

1550
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:37,079
first thing I clue in on there is I want

1551
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:39,659
the water to say what it's doing on each

1552
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:41,550
square and I want to start there that's

1553
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:43,590
just there's just what my head wants to

1554
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:45,750
start with now right so that's like my

1555
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:48,420
first thought is I want to start with

1556
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:51,750
the gameplay and if it says this water

1557
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:54,630
isn't moving then that's an important

1558
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:56,189
underlying input to this system that I

1559
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:59,600
should not that I should be working with

1560
01:12:56,189 --> 01:13:04,229
not papering over so that's thought one

1561
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:06,030
thought too is I want to split the way

1562
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:09,869
that I'm simulating this into two parts

1563
01:13:06,029 --> 01:13:13,079
so one part is creating attractive and

1564
01:13:09,869 --> 01:13:14,489
interesting water from that input so

1565
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:16,769
that's one thing that I want to be able

1566
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:18,389
to do and I think I have a pretty good

1567
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:21,480
idea how to do that so we'll talk about

1568
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:27,590
that in a second but the second part of

1569
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:30,389
that is I probably want to tackle the

1570
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:32,940
transition of water properties in a

1571
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:36,650
slightly separate way and the reason I

1572
01:13:32,939 --> 01:13:38,629
say that is because in this game you're

1573
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:41,329
not going to have most of the water

1574
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:44,180
undergoing large-scale transitions most

1575
01:13:41,329 --> 01:13:47,630
of the time so designing a system that

1576
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:50,119
can do really good effects for I pushed

1577
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:51,650
a rock in front of the waterfall as the

1578
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:54,680
way all of the water is being simulated

1579
01:13:51,649 --> 01:13:57,710
is probably going to suck down a lot

1580
01:13:54,680 --> 01:14:00,710
more GPU time and potentially CPU time

1581
01:13:57,710 --> 01:14:04,279
then I'm gonna want so in my thinking

1582
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:08,270
I'm imagining that I will always want to

1583
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:12,920
do a pre pass where I build rectangular

1584
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:14,660
regions maybe even sometimes not exactly

1585
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:18,619
rectangular regions so let's just say

1586
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:21,769
disjoint set forests so some set of n

1587
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:24,099
collections of contiguous squares that

1588
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:26,630
are currently undergoing water

1589
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:28,850
transformation and I think I would

1590
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:31,520
partition my simulation into two parts

1591
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:33,680
one that handles those isolated square

1592
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:37,490
regions and one that handles everything

1593
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:40,789
else so those are my two structural

1594
01:14:37,489 --> 01:14:43,279
thoughts let's start by ignoring the

1595
01:14:40,789 --> 01:14:45,319
transition regions first because I think

1596
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:48,170
that's sort of a separate simulation

1597
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:49,519
problem and then well also it's the

1598
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:53,270
thing that's doing the least amount of

1599
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:58,520
water at any given time so the first

1600
01:14:53,270 --> 01:15:00,980
question I have is have you seen we

1601
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:04,190
bring it up here have you ever seen

1602
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:07,969
water surface wavelets the paper by the

1603
01:15:04,189 --> 01:15:09,949
Nvidia paper sure do you want to take a

1604
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:12,350
quick look at the video for water

1605
01:15:09,949 --> 01:15:13,639
surface wavelets and take a look at them

1606
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:17,690
specifically the part where they show

1607
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:20,920
how to paint water stuff into it

1608
01:15:17,689 --> 01:15:26,539
this actually might be it says SIGGRAPH

1609
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:28,550
2018 aha so this could well be after I

1610
01:15:26,539 --> 01:15:30,019
was doing the research need to do the

1611
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:32,239
thing because because when I did the

1612
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:36,170
four-way grid thing that I did it was

1613
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:39,199
like sort of based on mm-hmm you know

1614
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:42,470
what some people some paper somewhere

1615
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:43,340
yeah so jump forward to the part well

1616
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:45,920
you can watch the whole thing if you

1617
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:48,079
want but the part that I'm specifically

1618
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,440
interested in is the part where they

1619
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:55,800
show how to paint

1620
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:57,509
uh water velocity I can't really read

1621
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,829
the text oh wait painting is you'll be

1622
01:15:57,510 --> 01:16:02,570
able to see when you get there just keep

1623
01:15:58,829 --> 01:16:02,569
keep runnin for ya here you go

1624
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:11,969
so this is just I want some waves right

1625
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:23,760
and then in a second they show I want

1626
01:16:11,969 --> 01:16:26,359
some directional flow Suzanne yeah and

1627
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,360
you know

1628
01:16:34,868 --> 01:16:46,269
I mean it's true that something like

1629
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:48,420
this okay yeah so if we have a fluid sim

1630
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:52,300
running in the background right mm-hmm

1631
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:54,130
then wow this I don't know if this is

1632
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,199
happening for the viewers but the video

1633
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:57,639
is just super Skippy for me I think it's

1634
01:16:56,198 --> 01:17:01,509
just it's happening for the viewers yeah

1635
01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:02,650
it's okay yeah too much time guys can

1636
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:05,130
your watch this video

1637
01:17:02,649 --> 01:17:08,079
yeah correct like it's literally

1638
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:11,260
rendering frames from back in time and

1639
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:12,819
then forward like it's not just yeah

1640
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:15,190
it's whenever those happen to show up at

1641
01:17:12,819 --> 01:17:17,679
OBS like it's like that's the order you

1642
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:21,158
get them in no but I mean on the screen

1643
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:23,260
for me yeah yeah no I mean in the point

1644
01:17:21,158 --> 01:17:25,750
in the fantastic web browser there's the

1645
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:27,849
future of software distribution you know

1646
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:31,510
the kids like to tell me it's all mm-hmm

1647
01:17:27,849 --> 01:17:36,239
like I'm seeing frames out of order in

1648
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:38,489
the browser mm-hmm like it's crazy okay

1649
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:40,539
so something like this actually

1650
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:42,908
something like you're seeing behind the

1651
01:17:40,539 --> 01:17:44,738
boats in this scene or like before when

1652
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:47,948
they were painting the waves mhm and you

1653
01:17:44,738 --> 01:17:49,899
had very still water mm-hmm that

1654
01:17:47,948 --> 01:17:51,638
probably is the best thing honestly and

1655
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:56,379
we're not really going to get that from

1656
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:58,270
the fluid sim that said right mm-hmm one

1657
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:00,279
thing when you said I could so if if we

1658
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:07,630
say that it's a it's a fundamentally

1659
01:18:00,279 --> 01:18:09,279
painted driver of the visuals then we

1660
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:12,329
could still use a fluid sim for

1661
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:14,859
something like well here's a level that

1662
01:18:12,329 --> 01:18:16,059
that has it's got islands with an

1663
01:18:14,859 --> 01:18:17,710
interesting shape and there's just no

1664
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:20,320
rivers on this level so like flow

1665
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:22,569
doesn't really matter and so then we can

1666
01:18:20,319 --> 01:18:24,969
use that to do whatever like well we

1667
01:18:22,569 --> 01:18:26,920
just want we want to seed the flow maybe

1668
01:18:24,969 --> 01:18:30,099
with the fluid sim and like then

1669
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:32,319
generate generate some paint vectors

1670
01:18:30,099 --> 01:18:33,699
that then we sample in like opposite

1671
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:36,549
bitmap or something you know

1672
01:18:33,698 --> 01:18:38,138
yeah so I'm okay honestly it would be

1673
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:39,460
nice to not be running a fluid sim at

1674
01:18:38,139 --> 01:18:41,650
runtime if we just use that as an

1675
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:43,270
authoring tool sometimes but that so

1676
01:18:41,649 --> 01:18:45,479
just to be clear that paper is a fluid

1677
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:45,480
sim

1678
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:51,789
so the way that paper works is I would

1679
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:54,520
say probably pretty close to the thing I

1680
01:18:51,789 --> 01:18:56,979
would start with for your system if I

1681
01:18:54,520 --> 01:19:00,370
was going to take a crack at it and what

1682
01:18:56,979 --> 01:19:03,488
it does is it runs a fluid sim on the

1683
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:05,019
coarse mesh so kind of like the mesh

1684
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:07,689
you've got out in front of you might be

1685
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:09,550
the density of the fluid some like right

1686
01:19:07,689 --> 01:19:11,710
you wouldn't actually have a more

1687
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:13,119
detailed one like it looks like when you

1688
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:15,310
brought up that bitmap you were doing a

1689
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:18,010
much more detailed fluid sim than the

1690
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:19,780
game grid uh so this paper would do it

1691
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:21,970
more like on the grid that you see in

1692
01:19:19,779 --> 01:19:23,920
front of you which is exactly what I

1693
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:25,600
want because I'm thinking I want to

1694
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,609
basically be able to specify some of

1695
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,289
these values directly and then other

1696
01:19:27,609 --> 01:19:31,299
ones I want to just take on whatever

1697
01:19:29,289 --> 01:19:34,000
characters as they are and yet other

1698
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:35,619
ones such as the ones like that are in

1699
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,460
areas that are gameplay important I

1700
01:19:35,619 --> 01:19:41,109
might want to always zero out and say no

1701
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:45,100
real motion here or almost no motion

1702
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:49,988
right then what they do is they in the

1703
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:54,250
so in the Tessa later on the GPU they

1704
01:19:49,988 --> 01:19:56,649
use the same basic idea as you get from

1705
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:57,729
you know like they call those things I

1706
01:19:56,649 --> 01:20:00,939
think I wrote it down here so I wouldn't

1707
01:19:57,729 --> 01:20:02,919
forget when I was taking a quick look so

1708
01:20:00,939 --> 01:20:05,019
Tessa and Dorff waves they call them a

1709
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,909
lot but they're basically like when they

1710
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:10,620
do this they did the spectral analysis

1711
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:13,000
of what you tend to get in water and

1712
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:15,130
what the breakdown of the wave forms are

1713
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,979
so that when you just want like when

1714
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:19,510
when VFX people just want an ocean they

1715
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:21,159
just like put in these parameters and

1716
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:22,869
you can sample it without doing any

1717
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:25,210
fluid sim it's just like it just gives

1718
01:20:22,869 --> 01:20:26,890
you a notion because they know what the

1719
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:33,399
general waveform should be you know and

1720
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:36,400
I mean kind yes so there's there's a

1721
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:38,079
whole field of fluid dynamics literature

1722
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:40,359
you can go read which is literally just

1723
01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:43,210
like we want effectively closed form

1724
01:20:40,359 --> 01:20:46,929
solutions to oceans and lakes and stuff

1725
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:49,720
where we just sample known wave forms

1726
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:51,130
and the the reason you don't just use

1727
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,810
these always obviously is because they

1728
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:54,640
don't respond to anything right they

1729
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:56,440
don't they don't respond to boundaries

1730
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:58,600
they don't respond to the shape of the

1731
01:20:56,439 --> 01:21:00,198
water if they just give you back thing

1732
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:03,019
that looks like water for a given

1733
01:21:00,198 --> 01:21:04,698
pache and nothing else right so what the

1734
01:21:03,019 --> 01:21:08,170
Nvidia people did is they basically are

1735
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:11,779
doing sort of that in a way that is

1736
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:14,538
interpolated through the water sim so

1737
01:21:11,779 --> 01:21:16,639
they have the simulation vectors and

1738
01:21:14,538 --> 01:21:19,578
then they like basically up sample that

1739
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:23,538
using what they know to be believable

1740
01:21:19,578 --> 01:21:26,658
waveform patterns for water right right

1741
01:21:23,538 --> 01:21:29,899
so that to me sounds like a really good

1742
01:21:26,658 --> 01:21:33,138
first step for your water thing and

1743
01:21:29,899 --> 01:21:34,939
here's why number one it gives you a

1744
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:37,130
really good way to control the system

1745
01:21:34,939 --> 01:21:39,379
because you can use some water sim if

1746
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:42,739
you want to by allowing the actual grid

1747
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:44,929
to undergo a solve or you can just not

1748
01:21:42,738 --> 01:21:46,488
you can always just set those values

1749
01:21:44,929 --> 01:21:48,260
that that's what the painting example

1750
01:21:46,488 --> 01:21:49,458
sort of gives you is more of a thing

1751
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:51,679
where you're like look I can just

1752
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:54,439
override what that thing is telling me

1753
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:56,118
because I'm gonna mostly want for all of

1754
01:21:54,439 --> 01:21:58,248
the places near where the player can go

1755
01:21:56,118 --> 01:22:00,170
to just freakin specify if this is what

1756
01:21:58,248 --> 01:22:03,349
it is so that feels like a really good

1757
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:06,109
start and second because it's using a

1758
01:22:03,349 --> 01:22:09,199
wave distribution function for the up

1759
01:22:06,109 --> 01:22:12,920
sampling that also suggests to me that

1760
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:14,569
if you had you know like I'm imagining

1761
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,069
if I sat down or to play with this I

1762
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:17,630
would gain some intuition for how those

1763
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:18,768
equations were working and how I wanted

1764
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:21,828
to structure them and I could probably

1765
01:22:18,769 --> 01:22:23,510
imagine giving artists control over

1766
01:22:21,828 --> 01:22:25,189
those wave functions in ways that would

1767
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:26,780
allow them to shape the characteristics

1768
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:29,658
of the waves to be more appropriate to

1769
01:22:26,779 --> 01:22:31,639
this particular game as opposed to I

1770
01:22:29,658 --> 01:22:33,978
want it to look like real water because

1771
01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:35,989
this game doesn't look like real

1772
01:22:33,979 --> 01:22:37,789
anything it's like a fantasy you know

1773
01:22:35,988 --> 01:22:40,399
world that has a certain art style to it

1774
01:22:37,788 --> 01:22:43,130
and you probably want your waves to be

1775
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:45,228
correspondingly not like the real world

1776
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:46,609
and so I feel like being able to shape

1777
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:47,749
those wave functions is probably

1778
01:22:46,609 --> 01:22:49,698
something that could easily be done

1779
01:22:47,748 --> 01:22:52,368
because they're by definition being done

1780
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:54,109
as a interpolation pass that doesn't

1781
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:55,969
actually affect the simulation and

1782
01:22:54,109 --> 01:22:57,679
therefore won't like make everything

1783
01:22:55,969 --> 01:23:00,349
explode if the artists like does weird

1784
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:02,090
things to the parameters so that's my

1785
01:23:00,349 --> 01:23:03,559
first thought and I think what I would

1786
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:04,998
do is I would start there if it were

1787
01:23:03,559 --> 01:23:06,708
just me and I starting for nothing I'd

1788
01:23:04,998 --> 01:23:08,349
be like let's start there let's see what

1789
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:12,979
we can do with interpolated

1790
01:23:08,349 --> 01:23:14,150
well-distributed wave some nations in

1791
01:23:12,979 --> 01:23:16,010
the Tessa later Bay

1792
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:19,039
an underlying grid that we can paint

1793
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:22,010
and/or run the sim on lightly if we

1794
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:25,670
decide we need that for some reason so

1795
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:27,770
you know when we have a very crisp with

1796
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:32,600
gameplay grid like this mm-hmm

1797
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:34,550
so one of the things that that's a job

1798
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,320
that has to be done an aesthetic job

1799
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:38,060
that has to be done regardless of the

1800
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:40,908
implementation method so far because

1801
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:43,460
nothing has magically solved this is you

1802
01:23:40,908 --> 01:23:44,658
always want to get corners to like look

1803
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:47,899
good mm-hmm

1804
01:23:44,658 --> 01:23:49,670
so in my very original like even before

1805
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:51,859
the four-way blend I had like just

1806
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:53,029
scroll a normal map in one Square and

1807
01:23:51,859 --> 01:23:54,319
whatever and then you see the thing

1808
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:56,300
going down and then going to the right

1809
01:23:54,319 --> 01:24:00,309
you kind of just want to round it you

1810
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:03,920
know make it look nice and then the the

1811
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:05,330
the the four-way blend one I forget what

1812
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:08,029
it looked like but like it didn't it

1813
01:24:05,329 --> 01:24:10,939
didn't look great and and actually in a

1814
01:24:08,029 --> 01:24:13,130
lot of cases of corners or intersecting

1815
01:24:10,939 --> 01:24:16,369
in different ways naive blends like that

1816
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:19,779
will often the kind of diet like the

1817
01:24:16,369 --> 01:24:21,738
blend will not be of the right magnitude

1818
01:24:19,779 --> 01:24:25,969
because you're adding a different number

1819
01:24:21,738 --> 01:24:29,019
of things or whatever or the like if you

1820
01:24:25,969 --> 01:24:29,020
imagine a three-way intersection

1821
01:24:29,859 --> 01:24:33,619
actually I don't I don't remember what

1822
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:35,060
the problems were anyway there were

1823
01:24:33,619 --> 01:24:36,619
problems like it didn't it didn't look

1824
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:41,570
that great and then the fluid sim

1825
01:24:36,619 --> 01:24:42,920
version of course you kind of get for I

1826
01:24:41,569 --> 01:24:44,710
don't even know what the fluid shape

1827
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:48,649
would be right now if I turn these

1828
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:51,408
articles into yeah but you can you can

1829
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:53,539
already sort of see like they're not

1830
01:24:51,408 --> 01:24:55,819
even like evenly distributed across the

1831
01:24:53,539 --> 01:24:59,269
river like things tend to particles tend

1832
01:24:55,819 --> 01:25:00,710
to clump into the nearside flow and so

1833
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:02,060
you need to maybe start addressing that

1834
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:04,489
if you're even going to get a uniform

1835
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:07,190
shape yeah maybe you could get it

1836
01:25:04,488 --> 01:25:08,359
looking good eventually but they're

1837
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:12,049
problems that have to happen so I'm

1838
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:15,170
wondering like so one way to control

1839
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:18,380
that completely right imagine I was

1840
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:20,810
generating a per pixel flow Direction

1841
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:22,159
image that's at the same resolution as

1842
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:23,750
the screen and then and then that's

1843
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:24,079
being used by whatever back-end right

1844
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:27,229
uh-huh

1845
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:30,949
so an obvious thing that I can do is

1846
01:25:27,229 --> 01:25:33,049
just have curved tile pieces that I like

1847
01:25:30,949 --> 01:25:34,309
slap down for the corners or whatever

1848
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:36,470
that are just like the shape that I want

1849
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:38,060
right and you could add a noise function

1850
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:38,840
to that or you could animate them or

1851
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:41,480
something

1852
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:44,300
mm-hmm but that's very controllable

1853
01:25:41,479 --> 01:25:46,039
mm-hm and so question one is like maybe

1854
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:48,890
that's the right way to go and then

1855
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:50,180
maybe I don't really want a see I guess

1856
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:52,760
the thing I don't know from this paper

1857
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:58,970
is if I don't want to do a sim which I'm

1858
01:25:52,760 --> 01:26:00,560
not necessarily sure I do like I could

1859
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:03,260
think of things that I want to sim like

1860
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:05,510
hey if I want this wavefront smashing

1861
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:07,280
forward maybe there's just like some

1862
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:09,980
little spheres bound to each other with

1863
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:11,779
Springs or whatever and and I'm running

1864
01:26:09,979 --> 01:26:13,429
that and that's not even really a water

1865
01:26:11,779 --> 01:26:16,670
sim but it's just giving me something

1866
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:22,039
for the front of it like yeah it's extra

1867
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:23,840
right yeah um so well I mean just to be

1868
01:26:22,039 --> 01:26:25,519
clear like that's one of the reasons why

1869
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:28,010
I thought of this paper particularly is

1870
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:30,590
because it's partitioned into two halves

1871
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:32,989
and you can assess each half separately

1872
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:33,949
if you don't want it if you don't want

1873
01:26:32,988 --> 01:26:36,289
to do assume you don't then you just

1874
01:26:33,949 --> 01:26:39,619
don't do one right the actual rendering

1875
01:26:36,289 --> 01:26:41,960
part if I'm not gonna do a sim mm-hmm

1876
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:44,059
like what what is the actual rendering

1877
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:47,210
part do so it's it's sampling it's got

1878
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:49,010
some some distributions of some

1879
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:51,710
frequency distributions that it knows

1880
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:53,690
yeah generate waves and it just does it

1881
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:55,760
interpolate those parameters based on

1882
01:26:53,689 --> 01:26:58,189
surrounding grid squares and then like

1883
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:01,100
yeah I mean I believe basically the the

1884
01:26:58,189 --> 01:27:03,889
idea behind the paper is that you have

1885
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:06,500
some set of parameters that you have

1886
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:08,780
computed either with the fluid sim or

1887
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:11,470
just you specified what you wanted and

1888
01:27:08,779 --> 01:27:16,009
then the majority of the papers

1889
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:18,770
contribution is let's make a Tessa later

1890
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:22,730
that produces believable water from that

1891
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:24,710
very low res input which I think is

1892
01:27:22,729 --> 01:27:26,479
exactly what you want basically right

1893
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:28,300
well I'm not sure about the test later

1894
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:31,519
part like if it's an Nvidia paper

1895
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:33,110
they're about using GPU features in ways

1896
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,010
that I don't well you don't you don't

1897
01:27:33,109 --> 01:27:35,509
necessarily what test they they're just

1898
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:37,219
doing that because they want the water

1899
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:39,650
to actually displace which you usually

1900
01:27:37,219 --> 01:27:40,770
do but you know I mean maybe you don't

1901
01:27:39,649 --> 01:27:41,909
in this case for some reason

1902
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:46,020
but usually you want your water to have

1903
01:27:41,909 --> 01:27:48,300
a varying height I mean I might like I'm

1904
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:50,130
agnostic about that okay but yeah you

1905
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:53,100
could replace replace Tessa later with

1906
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:54,690
pixel shader if you would rather right

1907
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,430
if that's your call it doesn't matter

1908
01:27:54,689 --> 01:27:57,809
which one I mean or it could just be pre

1909
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:59,039
tessellated to some degree like I don't

1910
01:27:57,810 --> 01:28:02,820
know to what degree they need to

1911
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:04,319
dynamically allocate triangle density or

1912
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:06,779
if I could start with like a uniform

1913
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:08,039
grid I just like move those up and down

1914
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:09,689
and then make up the difference with

1915
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:11,039
normal man well it's it's a sample

1916
01:28:09,689 --> 01:28:13,049
function so you do anything you want

1917
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:15,269
right if you want to you can make it

1918
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:17,220
sample to tessellate if you'd rather you

1919
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:19,200
can have it sample to produce pixels you

1920
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:21,600
could subdivide sure if you look at the

1921
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:22,979
two samples and decide that there's you

1922
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,660
know too much variance between them you

1923
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:26,339
could subdivide it I mean it's it's just

1924
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:28,489
sampling functions so you know whatever

1925
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:30,210
you want to do with it you could do

1926
01:28:28,489 --> 01:28:31,889
obviously haven't implemented the paper

1927
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:34,470
myself because like I said I don't work

1928
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:37,289
with this stuff but it seems like the

1929
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:39,300
right place to start because it does

1930
01:28:37,289 --> 01:28:40,769
what you want right it takes a low res

1931
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:42,659
mesh and up samples it into stuff that

1932
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:46,320
looks like water which seems like a good

1933
01:28:42,659 --> 01:28:47,639
place to start and to see what you can

1934
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:49,739
get out of that and the other reason I

1935
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:53,660
say that is because since it is

1936
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:56,909
fundamentally a low res a low res grid

1937
01:28:53,659 --> 01:28:59,099
super sampling approach to me that also

1938
01:28:56,909 --> 01:28:59,970
suggests that I could go in there and I

1939
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,829
mean I don't know if I could or not

1940
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:03,960
because I'm actually looked at it but

1941
01:29:01,829 --> 01:29:06,930
that suggests to make it probably go in

1942
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:09,239
there and for lack of better term make

1943
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:10,710
the interpolation worse and the reason

1944
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:12,210
that I say that is because if the goal

1945
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:14,880
of this game is to make things look

1946
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:17,130
square II then one thing I might want to

1947
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,600
do is change probably what they're going

1948
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:19,800
to do is something like a radial basis

1949
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,600
kind of approach where they're going to

1950
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,550
get really nice smooth continuity cuz to

1951
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,740
trying to look like water maybe I want

1952
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:27,270
to make it look blockier with a harder

1953
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:28,859
fall-off so maybe I go in there and

1954
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,870
change it to a fairly tight smooth step

1955
01:29:28,859 --> 01:29:33,089
around the cube you know and things like

1956
01:29:30,869 --> 01:29:35,010
this the video where they were painting

1957
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:39,170
that first painting part where they

1958
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:42,690
showed like that seemed crisp enough

1959
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:44,100
yeah yeah I agree but I don't I don't

1960
01:29:42,689 --> 01:29:45,839
know but it just it just I felt like

1961
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:48,060
that'd be another thing I could screw

1962
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:50,400
with to give the water an almost

1963
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:51,690
unnatural look but one that reinforced

1964
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:53,549
the gameplay in a way that might be cool

1965
01:29:51,689 --> 01:29:54,279
and you know maybe it might not be but

1966
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:57,520
it's something

1967
01:29:54,279 --> 01:29:58,569
try which again usually what I'm looking

1968
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,889
for when I look at something like this

1969
01:29:58,569 --> 01:30:02,408
and I have a very specific problem

1970
01:29:59,889 --> 01:30:04,000
statement like like you had I'm just

1971
01:30:02,408 --> 01:30:05,618
like how many options does this approach

1972
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,880
give me because if the answer is I just

1973
01:30:05,618 --> 01:30:08,710
got to do this one thing and it comes

1974
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,909
out the way it comes out that to me

1975
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:10,868
doesn't sound very profitable because I

1976
01:30:09,908 --> 01:30:12,460
know that's probably not going to be

1977
01:30:10,868 --> 01:30:14,049
exactly what I want but this approach

1978
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:15,730
was like okay there's a lot of things I

1979
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:18,250
can screw with here I've got a coarse

1980
01:30:15,729 --> 01:30:20,109
grid and a super sampling step the super

1981
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,908
sampling step is pretty arbitrary I

1982
01:30:20,109 --> 01:30:23,649
could blend it however I wanted to I

1983
01:30:21,908 --> 01:30:25,538
could adjust the way that was doing like

1984
01:30:23,649 --> 01:30:26,979
you said maybe I want to don't want to

1985
01:30:25,538 --> 01:30:29,979
test later maybe I just want to produce

1986
01:30:26,979 --> 01:30:31,689
like coloration values or normal maps

1987
01:30:29,979 --> 01:30:33,609
from it or whatever I could probably do

1988
01:30:31,689 --> 01:30:35,138
that because there's no it's not coupled

1989
01:30:33,609 --> 01:30:36,969
to the simulation which I really like

1990
01:30:35,139 --> 01:30:38,800
because the more couple days of

1991
01:30:36,969 --> 01:30:40,389
simulation the less flexibility gonna

1992
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,860
have to change it without potentially

1993
01:30:40,389 --> 01:30:45,429
breaking everything and and all this

1994
01:30:41,859 --> 01:30:47,799
other crap so yeah so I felt like that

1995
01:30:45,429 --> 01:30:50,408
was I was like yes this is this this

1996
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:52,389
feels good when I was thinking about

1997
01:30:50,408 --> 01:30:55,058
what you said and and remembering that

1998
01:30:52,389 --> 01:30:56,500
paper so anyway

1999
01:30:55,059 --> 01:30:59,889
well of course the problem now with this

2000
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:02,198
discussion is to evaluate that paper

2001
01:30:59,889 --> 01:31:04,359
requires like a substantial amount of

2002
01:31:02,198 --> 01:31:07,448
engineering work that will not happen on

2003
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:08,558
this stream that's correct so I don't

2004
01:31:07,448 --> 01:31:10,118
know where to take confession now

2005
01:31:08,559 --> 01:31:14,409
because it's sort of like well we try

2006
01:31:10,118 --> 01:31:16,719
that well dynamic dynamic sim is now the

2007
01:31:14,408 --> 01:31:18,158
question so there's the second part of

2008
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:20,109
your thing which is like you know I push

2009
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:23,859
push rocks in the water or I move rocks

2010
01:31:20,109 --> 01:31:25,689
out of the mouth of a thing yeah so

2011
01:31:23,859 --> 01:31:27,488
obviously that particular paper really

2012
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:29,618
doesn't help us at all there I mean

2013
01:31:27,488 --> 01:31:33,069
maybe it helps us I mean they were they

2014
01:31:29,618 --> 01:31:34,988
were showing it evaluate no no I just

2015
01:31:33,069 --> 01:31:37,509
mean it doesn't help us because it

2016
01:31:34,988 --> 01:31:39,759
assumes we already have like the surface

2017
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:41,969
of the water and all we're trying to do

2018
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:44,710
is like up sample it to look good and

2019
01:31:41,969 --> 01:31:46,149
but in your case we don't actually have

2020
01:31:44,710 --> 01:31:49,300
that necessarily so like for example

2021
01:31:46,149 --> 01:31:51,488
let's the case I'm thinking of is when

2022
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,619
you had that sort of pool sitting up

2023
01:31:51,488 --> 01:31:55,899
above the main level and it has this

2024
01:31:53,618 --> 01:31:57,729
mouth where the water can flow out right

2025
01:31:55,899 --> 01:31:59,738
so I'm thinking about the case where

2026
01:31:57,729 --> 01:32:02,288
I've got maybe one of those yellow

2027
01:31:59,738 --> 01:32:04,299
energy fields and so it's completely

2028
01:32:02,288 --> 01:32:06,189
blocked and then I remove the energy

2029
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:08,199
field and now I want to see the water

2030
01:32:06,189 --> 01:32:11,259
come forward

2031
01:32:08,199 --> 01:32:13,269
like in a sort of way that creates the

2032
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:15,280
resulting waterfall over time right I

2033
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:19,450
don't just want to see it appear like I

2034
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:24,099
want to see right and so while the

2035
01:32:19,449 --> 01:32:27,159
create and destroy River function that

2036
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:30,130
part on the flat surfaces that part I

2037
01:32:27,159 --> 01:32:32,739
could see just hacking away at the

2038
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:35,529
Nvidia method might produce okay results

2039
01:32:32,739 --> 01:32:36,939
I'm not sure it would but it might the

2040
01:32:35,529 --> 01:32:39,250
because you could just like make a

2041
01:32:36,939 --> 01:32:42,819
really turbulent parameters at the head

2042
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:45,729
and tail or something right but I'm not

2043
01:32:42,819 --> 01:32:48,219
sure it will and then for the waterfall

2044
01:32:45,729 --> 01:32:49,479
case I don't see how it helps at all I

2045
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:51,369
guess is what I'm saying so we still

2046
01:32:49,479 --> 01:32:53,439
need some idea of how that's going to be

2047
01:32:51,369 --> 01:32:56,739
tackled and so what I was thinking for

2048
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:59,139
that is probably what I would say is I

2049
01:32:56,739 --> 01:33:01,239
feel like that's probably more where

2050
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:04,530
your particles are gonna want to come

2051
01:33:01,239 --> 01:33:08,559
into play so the way I would probably

2052
01:33:04,529 --> 01:33:13,769
suggest tackling that the way I would

2053
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:17,470
have started it is I've got a notion

2054
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:19,540
both of where are the water tiles which

2055
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:20,590
is what normally we're doing and let's

2056
01:33:19,539 --> 01:33:23,500
say we're sending them with something

2057
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:26,020
like the Nvidia approach there but then

2058
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:29,229
I've also got an ocean of tiles that are

2059
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:31,600
becoming water so in other words they

2060
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:33,549
weren't water and now because of a

2061
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,050
gameplay state change when the gameplay

2062
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:38,590
system comes in and starts tagging

2063
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:40,659
things as newly water they I remember

2064
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:42,610
that I had not been rendering them as

2065
01:33:40,659 --> 01:33:45,010
water previously so that state change

2066
01:33:42,609 --> 01:33:46,839
has happened in the game but the

2067
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:49,810
renderer much like your animation system

2068
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:51,670
is like trying to play catch-up so - is

2069
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:52,960
this part of the water sim this water

2070
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:56,289
Sam has now been basically given a

2071
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,369
directive from the game hey quickly find

2072
01:33:56,289 --> 01:33:59,470
a way to make this look like it has

2073
01:33:57,369 --> 01:34:02,710
water and you're like okay and so then

2074
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:04,990
what I would say is from that I would

2075
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:07,119
say we probably want to now have a

2076
01:34:04,989 --> 01:34:09,789
particle flow like kind of a mixed

2077
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:14,319
system where I'm going to be shooting

2078
01:34:09,789 --> 01:34:18,460
water particles from the water tile or

2079
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:20,949
tiles around it into it and doing some

2080
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:23,500
sort of volumetric rendering there be

2081
01:34:20,949 --> 01:34:25,840
because well there's only two things I

2082
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:27,550
can think of to do one is that one and

2083
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,989
then you use a level set method to

2084
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:33,180
actually produce some water surfaces

2085
01:34:28,989 --> 01:34:35,170
until it fills up and the other one is

2086
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:36,789
you know I don't know if we'd actually

2087
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:38,829
work or not but it's like the only other

2088
01:34:36,789 --> 01:34:41,500
apps I can think of is you actually just

2089
01:34:38,829 --> 01:34:44,439
write something procedural which takes

2090
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:46,720
the sides of water that are bordering

2091
01:34:44,439 --> 01:34:49,059
the cells that are newly water and you

2092
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:51,220
have a way of displacing them forwards

2093
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:55,780
in some procedural way that doesn't

2094
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:57,670
involve shooting particles out and okay

2095
01:34:55,779 --> 01:35:04,989
so in terms of what we're gonna do

2096
01:34:57,670 --> 01:35:08,170
gameplay-wise mm-hmm like what are we

2097
01:35:04,989 --> 01:35:12,429
going to allow ourselves to do in terms

2098
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:16,690
of level geometry yeah if you imagine so

2099
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:19,420
we're talking about the case of you know

2100
01:35:16,689 --> 01:35:21,159
a yellow yellow force field keeping

2101
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:23,649
water in and when you open it up what

2102
01:35:21,159 --> 01:35:26,739
happens yeah um what if there's just

2103
01:35:23,649 --> 01:35:28,389
like dry land below there and the water

2104
01:35:26,739 --> 01:35:29,649
goes down it has to go somewhere which

2105
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:33,130
kind of sounds like what you're talking

2106
01:35:29,649 --> 01:35:35,889
about yeah I don't think we're gonna do

2107
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:37,480
that okay then great I mean and and that

2108
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:40,780
solves most of the problem like you

2109
01:35:37,479 --> 01:35:42,729
still have a problem of like you need

2110
01:35:40,779 --> 01:35:45,009
water traveling along this vertical

2111
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:47,079
thing that somehow stylistically matches

2112
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:50,079
the rest of the water but maybe that's

2113
01:35:47,079 --> 01:35:51,850
not that hard in theory you could

2114
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:54,699
probably get away with doing something

2115
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:57,850
pretty similar like so with the Nvidia

2116
01:35:54,699 --> 01:36:01,059
method you know their wave functions are

2117
01:35:57,850 --> 01:36:02,650
gonna be about upright water but you

2118
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:05,320
could probably go ahead and hack those

2119
01:36:02,649 --> 01:36:08,199
wave functions to just be like waterfall

2120
01:36:05,319 --> 01:36:10,299
ask water and just use those on that

2121
01:36:08,199 --> 01:36:12,760
part of the water like I bet I could

2122
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:15,159
make that work if you know again if I

2123
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:18,730
study this for a while as a very first

2124
01:36:15,159 --> 01:36:21,340
approximation if you just like pretend

2125
01:36:18,729 --> 01:36:23,349
it's just flowing sideways yeah exactly

2126
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:26,170
okay 90 degrees right exactly and then

2127
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:28,000
like you know alter the higher

2128
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:29,560
frequencies so that they're biased

2129
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,470
downward or whatever so it's like yeah

2130
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,880
things are I mean it have it's not it's

2131
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:34,829
it's gonna be the kind of thing that

2132
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,538
like you have to start

2133
01:36:34,828 --> 01:36:38,578
look at but I mean fundamentally

2134
01:36:36,538 --> 01:36:40,108
speaking it doesn't seem like an

2135
01:36:38,578 --> 01:36:41,188
impossibility right it's like look

2136
01:36:40,109 --> 01:36:43,019
there's wavefunctions

2137
01:36:41,189 --> 01:36:45,030
we can probably hack some together that

2138
01:36:43,019 --> 01:36:46,918
will produce a relatively believable

2139
01:36:45,029 --> 01:36:48,478
waterfall so we just apply the same

2140
01:36:46,918 --> 01:36:49,469
freaking technique to the water there as

2141
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:53,369
we do elsewhere it just has a different

2142
01:36:49,469 --> 01:36:55,229
wavelength it's coated we know when we

2143
01:36:53,368 --> 01:36:57,148
output these in the same way that we

2144
01:36:55,229 --> 01:36:58,409
have the coarse mesh for everything else

2145
01:36:57,149 --> 01:36:59,849
we also have the coarse mesh for there

2146
01:36:58,408 --> 01:37:02,578
and they have specific values that say

2147
01:36:59,849 --> 01:37:04,679
I'm a waterfall as opposed to I'm moving

2148
01:37:02,578 --> 01:37:06,088
this direction that direction right yeah

2149
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:09,208
and then of course you can always add

2150
01:37:06,088 --> 01:37:12,179
particles to taste yes you need to cover

2151
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:13,889
things up mm-hmm okay well I mean I

2152
01:37:12,179 --> 01:37:15,719
guess that's what we're gonna try it

2153
01:37:13,889 --> 01:37:17,939
sounds like it makes sense to me I mean

2154
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:19,139
of course I might go read the paper and

2155
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:24,329
then say this is stupid

2156
01:37:19,139 --> 01:37:26,849
yep and more important than the paper I

2157
01:37:24,328 --> 01:37:31,078
would assume is just the also just going

2158
01:37:26,849 --> 01:37:33,958
look it's more just can we spend some

2159
01:37:31,078 --> 01:37:36,029
time trying to do wavefunction mixing

2160
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:38,969
you know maybe the paper sucks but that

2161
01:37:36,029 --> 01:37:41,099
idea I think is okay so maybe just just

2162
01:37:38,969 --> 01:37:45,569
the broad idea could be profitable even

2163
01:37:41,099 --> 01:37:48,029
if the paper isn't you know yeah should

2164
01:37:45,569 --> 01:37:50,248
we do questions from the viewing public

2165
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:51,228
now sure you feel like that's a good

2166
01:37:50,248 --> 01:37:56,158
time okay

2167
01:37:51,229 --> 01:37:58,289
KC will moderate your questions so type

2168
01:37:56,158 --> 01:37:59,908
the questions make sure they're the best

2169
01:37:58,288 --> 01:38:03,658
question that you've ever asked in your

2170
01:37:59,908 --> 01:38:05,429
life all the best questions and KC will

2171
01:38:03,658 --> 01:38:09,408
decide I will grab a snack while he's

2172
01:38:05,429 --> 01:38:09,408
doing that then I'll be back

2173
01:40:02,590 --> 01:40:06,880
how's the progress on the funnels

2174
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,010
bearing beta Casey it's going it's a

2175
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,279
pretty big project so it's been tough to

2176
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:11,280
finish

2177
01:40:38,659 --> 01:40:41,738
[Music]

2178
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:58,659
just a couple more minutes and I will be

2179
01:40:55,090 --> 01:41:00,150
ready so you know I don't usually have

2180
01:40:58,658 --> 01:41:02,829
food at home hmm

2181
01:41:00,149 --> 01:41:04,569
but way back at the start of quarantine

2182
01:41:02,829 --> 01:41:08,920
time I was like oh I need to get a lot

2183
01:41:04,569 --> 01:41:12,988
of food and then I was like all right

2184
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:15,219
well I don't I don't usually eat at home

2185
01:41:12,988 --> 01:41:18,309
so why don't I get a lot of fun food

2186
01:41:15,219 --> 01:41:23,850
that I used to eat when I hit home like

2187
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:27,310
when I was a kid so SpaghettiOs yeah and

2188
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:30,699
at that time I invested this was a very

2189
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:33,969
important investment in a box of brown

2190
01:41:30,698 --> 01:41:36,460
sugar cinnamon pop-tarts oh that is

2191
01:41:33,969 --> 01:41:38,050
serious quarantine food gotcha

2192
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:41,050
and I feel that this investment has come

2193
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:44,079
to maturity and it's it's time to

2194
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:54,150
liquidate the investment and so I'm

2195
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:54,149
doing that now so John know he left

2196
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,960
by the way Gino's three I cannot overlay

2197
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:24,030
John over his image because I don't have

2198
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:28,050
a feed from John's camera his computer

2199
01:42:24,029 --> 01:42:29,849
can't do it unfortunately like it his

2200
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:32,130
computer can't stream his webcam to me

2201
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:34,139
while also capturing his screen for

2202
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:35,190
twitch given so how much trouble we've

2203
01:42:34,139 --> 01:42:37,289
had so far

2204
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:39,059
yeah like if I try to add the virtue

2205
01:42:37,289 --> 01:42:42,590
forget it splitter on top of all this

2206
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:42,590
yeah yeah okay one sec

2207
01:42:57,319 --> 01:43:02,399
you know I haven't ever done the

2208
01:42:59,819 --> 01:43:04,340
separate streaming PC thing just because

2209
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:06,809
I don't want to have more computers yeah

2210
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:09,779
that might just be what I have to do I

2211
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:13,530
actually highly recommend it even though

2212
01:43:09,779 --> 01:43:15,960
I absolutely hate computers just because

2213
01:43:13,529 --> 01:43:19,259
this is one case where you can just like

2214
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:20,850
leave it set up and never touch it no

2215
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:24,180
matter what you do to your dev machine

2216
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:26,070
and that helps paper over the ridiculous

2217
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:27,630
crap it's no easier to set up the first

2218
01:43:26,069 --> 01:43:29,279
time because it's still complete crap

2219
01:43:27,630 --> 01:43:32,010
and the capture card will be complete

2220
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:33,960
crap and all that stuff but at least you

2221
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:35,730
just like as much as possible leave it

2222
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:39,180
in stasis until Windows updates itself

2223
01:43:35,729 --> 01:43:40,159
and ruins everything happens about every

2224
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:55,230
6 months

2225
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:58,800
yep ok are you ready yes ok so I guess I

2226
01:43:55,229 --> 01:44:02,849
would say you know no offense to the

2227
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:04,920
chat but not a real not a really not a

2228
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:07,140
really bumper crop today it's ok we're

2229
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:10,680
gonna go through them anyway

2230
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:15,270
so I'll start with the first question

2231
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:16,680
which I don't I think has a pretty easy

2232
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:18,660
answer so even though I don't think it's

2233
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:20,039
particularly relevant necessarily it's

2234
01:44:18,659 --> 01:44:23,550
probably pretty easy an answer and that

2235
01:44:20,039 --> 01:44:25,319
is if there was way less time and budget

2236
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:28,230
what sacrifices could be made to finish

2237
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:35,130
this requirement faster and I have an

2238
01:44:28,229 --> 01:44:39,089
answer but I'll let you answer first it

2239
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:41,630
doesn't really work that way like if

2240
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:45,779
there were less time and budget globally

2241
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:47,400
across the game you want to use the

2242
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:52,319
Robyn Hitchcock from the Cure rule

2243
01:44:47,399 --> 01:44:54,539
mm-hmm and allocate sufficient

2244
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:56,009
reasonable amounts of time to everything

2245
01:44:54,539 --> 01:45:01,470
to bring them all up to a particular

2246
01:44:56,010 --> 01:45:03,180
level right and so if you told me well

2247
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:05,940
you only have a week to do water or

2248
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:07,110
something I'd be like well that's gonna

2249
01:45:05,939 --> 01:45:09,599
put water

2250
01:45:07,109 --> 01:45:11,009
out of phase with everything else so

2251
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:15,480
let's take some time away from something

2252
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:17,360
else and put it on water however I have

2253
01:45:15,479 --> 01:45:20,669
another level of answer to that which is

2254
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:22,799
you know so Casey you used to go to GDC

2255
01:45:20,670 --> 01:45:26,100
right yeah back when it didn't suck as

2256
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:27,510
much yeah I used to go to GDC also and

2257
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:30,570
even back then we thought it was pretty

2258
01:45:27,510 --> 01:45:35,250
terrible nah tonight so I what I will

2259
01:45:30,569 --> 01:45:37,679
say is 97 98 ish like right after it got

2260
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:40,800
taken over but before they had time to

2261
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:43,770
turn it to crap it was kind of amazing

2262
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:45,360
like you know I remember it was a long

2263
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:47,850
time ago but I remember talking to

2264
01:45:45,359 --> 01:45:50,460
Charles he was probably like 2000 or

2265
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:52,350
2001 or something it was like I just

2266
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:57,899
went to see a movie in the middle of the

2267
01:45:52,350 --> 01:46:01,770
day like yeah yep I know where you're

2268
01:45:57,899 --> 01:46:04,349
coming from okay so back when we used to

2269
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:06,869
go to GDC one thing you will learn from

2270
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:09,600
the wise people at GDC lecturing

2271
01:46:06,868 --> 01:46:10,679
incorporated mm-hmm is that you have to

2272
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:13,289
scope your game

2273
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:16,020
all right what you will learn from these

2274
01:46:13,289 --> 01:46:19,350
people is that whatever brilliant

2275
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:21,119
amazing ideas you have for a game at the

2276
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:22,380
outset they will tell you over and over

2277
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:25,019
that you can't do all those things

2278
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:27,210
mm-hmm and that 2/3 of the way through

2279
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:28,920
development you'll find that you have to

2280
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:31,050
dump half your game on the floor and

2281
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:33,449
then Stitch the rest of it together and

2282
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:36,960
rescue that in somehow ship that mm-hmm

2283
01:46:33,448 --> 01:46:40,559
right and then a lot of these games are

2284
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:42,510
like Metacritic 65 don't even make any

2285
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,100
money one of the reason you ship them

2286
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:47,010
out the door was ostensibly to make

2287
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:49,619
money and then a lot of these people the

2288
01:46:47,010 --> 01:46:51,239
company name on their badge when they

2289
01:46:49,618 --> 01:46:54,500
went to speak at GDC that company

2290
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:58,609
doesn't exist anymore all right

2291
01:46:54,500 --> 01:47:00,689
okay still like yep I'm just saying

2292
01:46:58,609 --> 01:47:07,649
question the advice a little bit right

2293
01:47:00,689 --> 01:47:10,738
and so since I started my new way of

2294
01:47:07,649 --> 01:47:12,448
game design right which fortunately

2295
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:15,138
we're still able to do because people

2296
01:47:12,448 --> 01:47:17,579
bought the witness right I have never

2297
01:47:15,139 --> 01:47:19,289
scoped a game where I'm making air

2298
01:47:17,579 --> 01:47:20,369
quotes with my finger scoping a game

2299
01:47:19,289 --> 01:47:23,310
means to cut it

2300
01:47:20,369 --> 01:47:26,670
from what you wanted to make to what you

2301
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:29,730
actually can make both braid and the

2302
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:33,180
witness went the other way they both got

2303
01:47:29,729 --> 01:47:34,709
bigger braids certainly maybe not in

2304
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:35,909
terms of number of level like I didn't

2305
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:37,350
know how big it was going to be in terms

2306
01:47:35,909 --> 01:47:40,829
of levels but in terms of like feature

2307
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:42,420
set and you know how much time we spent

2308
01:47:40,829 --> 01:47:45,659
making it look nice and all that we did

2309
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:47,909
way more right and then with the witness

2310
01:47:45,659 --> 01:47:52,979
it's just a massively bigger game like

2311
01:47:47,909 --> 01:47:56,010
we thought it would be at most you know

2312
01:47:52,979 --> 01:47:57,809
I figured it might be a 20-hour game

2313
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:59,940
because braid was like a 5 hour game and

2314
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:01,740
making a game four times as big would be

2315
01:47:59,939 --> 01:48:03,629
huge but it's like if you play

2316
01:48:01,739 --> 01:48:05,099
everything in the witness it's easily a

2317
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:07,640
hundred hour game unless you're like

2318
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:11,880
really fast at puzzles

2319
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:14,640
it's just huge so the way I like to see

2320
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:16,710
it is look if you're gonna put a lot of

2321
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:19,200
effort into something anyway like it

2322
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:21,390
takes it's not easy to make games right

2323
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:23,699
even now with Unity game engine where

2324
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:24,840
you press the make game button if you do

2325
01:48:23,699 --> 01:48:26,130
that you just have the same thing

2326
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,480
everybody else has when they press the

2327
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:30,239
make game button which isn't very good

2328
01:48:27,479 --> 01:48:32,819
right so it's hard it's hard to get to a

2329
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:34,739
point where you're even able to release

2330
01:48:32,819 --> 01:48:35,579
something that's notable in any way

2331
01:48:34,739 --> 01:48:38,130
right mm-hmm

2332
01:48:35,579 --> 01:48:41,159
it takes you a decent amount of time and

2333
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:43,170
effort to get there so why would you

2334
01:48:41,159 --> 01:48:45,479
then waste the opportunity that you

2335
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:47,069
spent getting there by just like firing

2336
01:48:45,479 --> 01:48:49,289
it off a little too early and having it

2337
01:48:47,069 --> 01:48:50,789
not be that good right because then

2338
01:48:49,289 --> 01:48:52,350
it'll take you I don't know did it take

2339
01:48:50,789 --> 01:48:54,269
you two years to get to that point it's

2340
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:55,500
gonna take you another two years or you

2341
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:57,570
can get to that point again and have

2342
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:59,130
another attempt at maybe being able to

2343
01:48:57,569 --> 01:49:00,840
make something good and so if your

2344
01:48:59,130 --> 01:49:02,340
response every time is I got a scope

2345
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:10,699
this because it's been 2 years or

2346
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:13,860
whatever then well I did I mean you you

2347
01:49:10,699 --> 01:49:16,800
the strategy you are undergoing has an

2348
01:49:13,859 --> 01:49:18,929
obvious result right and we just see

2349
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,329
that over people's careers in the games

2350
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:22,650
industry and like nobody stops to

2351
01:49:21,329 --> 01:49:25,590
question that

2352
01:49:22,649 --> 01:49:30,239
that said I'm notorious for taking a

2353
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:31,489
long time doing game projects and you

2354
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:33,729
don't have to take as long as we do

2355
01:49:31,489 --> 01:49:35,429
especially if you don't insist

2356
01:49:33,729 --> 01:49:38,500
building your own engine all the time

2357
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:41,409
and all these things although it does

2358
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:43,479
help with quality if you build your own

2359
01:49:41,409 --> 01:49:48,220
engine so like these are all decisions

2360
01:49:43,479 --> 01:49:49,899
that you can make I don't know I feel

2361
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:55,449
like I've answered that question to a

2362
01:49:49,899 --> 01:50:00,238
reasonable degree mm-hmm so next

2363
01:49:55,449 --> 01:50:02,800
question is sort of a oh sorry

2364
01:50:00,238 --> 01:50:04,779
do you have anything to say about that

2365
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:06,550
I hope the whole scoping thing and

2366
01:50:04,779 --> 01:50:08,800
because I know you're you're working on

2367
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:10,119
your own thing that you've been working

2368
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:12,970
on for a long time and I don't think you

2369
01:50:10,119 --> 01:50:14,859
feel like scoping it so I guess what I

2370
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:16,560
would say is that I have mixed feelings

2371
01:50:14,859 --> 01:50:22,899
about this

2372
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:28,680
here are my feelings about it so I think

2373
01:50:22,899 --> 01:50:31,449
scoping your life slash company is

2374
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:34,690
incredibly important and scoping your

2375
01:50:31,449 --> 01:50:36,639
game is completely unimportant is the

2376
01:50:34,689 --> 01:50:40,000
guess the way I would say it because

2377
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:43,239
when I try to assess like what makes

2378
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:46,810
things I'm working on late it's almost

2379
01:50:43,238 --> 01:50:55,238
always that like I had too many other

2380
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:59,590
things to do does that make sense are

2381
01:50:55,238 --> 01:51:00,779
you saying that work-life balance causes

2382
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:04,810
you to not get work done

2383
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:07,389
um no more like work work balance right

2384
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:10,660
so like you know it's really hard to do

2385
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:12,579
like handmade hero for example and also

2386
01:51:10,659 --> 01:51:14,439
work on a hard technical problem because

2387
01:51:12,579 --> 01:51:17,380
oftentimes like you need to be able to

2388
01:51:14,439 --> 01:51:19,389
go for like a month of time where your

2389
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:23,609
brain is literally focused just on this

2390
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:23,610
one thing right I agree

2391
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:30,880
exactly engine and a game and it does

2392
01:51:29,079 --> 01:51:34,000
affect the quality of work like no

2393
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:37,750
question yes and I think the problem is

2394
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:40,539
that so okay so one thing I will say

2395
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:43,090
like from what you just talked about is

2396
01:51:40,539 --> 01:51:44,529
I would say but you do kind of scope

2397
01:51:43,090 --> 01:51:46,750
your game a little bit right John

2398
01:51:44,529 --> 01:51:49,689
because you didn't pick

2399
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:52,510
the hardest possible technical game to

2400
01:51:49,689 --> 01:51:55,779
do along with your compiler right and

2401
01:51:52,510 --> 01:51:57,460
that was a smart decision because you

2402
01:51:55,779 --> 01:51:59,229
could have picked a more technically

2403
01:51:57,460 --> 01:52:01,060
ambitious game right you easily could

2404
01:51:59,229 --> 01:52:03,309
have if you'd wanted to we could easily

2405
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:06,430
come up with games that would have been

2406
01:52:03,310 --> 01:52:09,010
worse than this one now grant is as you

2407
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:11,289
normally do you always go like let me

2408
01:52:09,010 --> 01:52:15,340
push what I can do to in this game to

2409
01:52:11,289 --> 01:52:18,779
the limit but you didn't go let me also

2410
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:22,360
make the massively multiplayer online

2411
01:52:18,779 --> 01:52:25,359
first-person infinite view distance you

2412
01:52:22,359 --> 01:52:27,849
know a thousand people per server game

2413
01:52:25,359 --> 01:52:30,698
right which you could have done if you

2414
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:34,090
weren't trying to say let me pick the

2415
01:52:30,698 --> 01:52:35,889
easiest to scope of my ideas to go with

2416
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:37,719
my compiler yeah so that was a smart

2417
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:39,010
decision right I would like to use a

2418
01:52:37,719 --> 01:52:41,890
different verb for that because I think

2419
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:44,800
of those as relatively orthogonal things

2420
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:46,600
okay like yeah you absolutely should be

2421
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:50,500
smart at the outset about what you're

2422
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:54,010
deciding to build yeah I mean that's the

2423
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:56,229
the canonical newbie mistake is like kid

2424
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:59,500
gets out of school and wants to get in

2425
01:52:56,229 --> 01:53:03,968
videogames and wants to make the super

2426
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:05,529
MMO sports spaceship game or what you

2427
01:53:03,969 --> 01:53:08,289
know just like put everything in there

2428
01:53:05,529 --> 01:53:10,630
and it's like well actually it's very

2429
01:53:08,289 --> 01:53:10,869
difficult to do what you're talking

2430
01:53:10,630 --> 01:53:13,539
about

2431
01:53:10,869 --> 01:53:14,979
mhmmm so that is that is universal right

2432
01:53:13,539 --> 01:53:19,238
it's very hard to make games and you

2433
01:53:14,979 --> 01:53:21,218
need to respect that going in even going

2434
01:53:19,238 --> 01:53:22,839
back to braid though when I did braid it

2435
01:53:21,219 --> 01:53:25,119
was like look I have this history of not

2436
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:26,710
finishing projects how do I help ensure

2437
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:28,539
that I finish this one I'm gonna do a

2438
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:30,340
2-d game yeah because I don't want to

2439
01:53:28,539 --> 01:53:33,880
deal with 3d right that was like a

2440
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:36,010
foundational decision and it paid off

2441
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:40,359
right it looked like that's just what

2442
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:42,880
that was so that is true that is

2443
01:53:40,359 --> 01:53:44,409
different however then like giving up on

2444
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:46,930
your dreams in the middle of development

2445
01:53:44,409 --> 01:53:49,079
yep sort of I mean I you could have a

2446
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:52,480
hybrid of those things where it's like I

2447
01:53:49,079 --> 01:53:54,550
guess I'm learning now what is

2448
01:53:52,479 --> 01:53:56,079
practically able to be accomplished and

2449
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:58,390
when I made this decision early on I

2450
01:53:56,079 --> 01:54:00,550
didn't really know but the people who

2451
01:53:58,390 --> 01:54:03,350
lecture for GE see lack

2452
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:05,449
Incorporated LLC don't really have that

2453
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:07,310
excuse because they've made like four

2454
01:54:05,449 --> 01:54:09,920
games before or whatever they should

2455
01:54:07,310 --> 01:54:11,330
know and they still say well you have to

2456
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:13,789
scope your game every time and I'm like

2457
01:54:11,329 --> 01:54:16,430
no just make a better make a better

2458
01:54:13,789 --> 01:54:19,340
decision about what you're going to

2459
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:21,440
build or work in a situation where

2460
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:24,619
you're not as budget constrained right

2461
01:54:21,439 --> 01:54:26,479
yeah which also has implications on what

2462
01:54:24,619 --> 01:54:30,319
you can build right like I cannot build

2463
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:32,179
a Assassin's Creed ragnerok or whatever

2464
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:34,549
cuz like I just don't have that kind of

2465
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:36,409
money yeah I could build an indie

2466
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:39,170
version of an assassin's Creed game with

2467
01:54:36,409 --> 01:54:42,739
that kind of gameplay but like I just

2468
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:48,109
can't build those huge Maps no you know

2469
01:54:42,739 --> 01:54:50,179
historically accurate things yeah but

2470
01:54:48,109 --> 01:54:53,029
because I don't try to do that we have

2471
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:55,490
money to pay people to stay employed for

2472
01:54:53,029 --> 01:54:57,800
extra years beyond you know what we

2473
01:54:55,489 --> 01:54:59,090
originally would have scheduled or

2474
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:01,909
whatever which is why we don't have to

2475
01:54:59,090 --> 01:55:04,579
like scope the game in the GDC lecture

2476
01:55:01,909 --> 01:55:07,909
sense yeah all right way too much on

2477
01:55:04,579 --> 01:55:09,649
this point I think ok next point and I

2478
01:55:07,909 --> 01:55:14,210
don't necessarily think the question

2479
01:55:09,649 --> 01:55:16,009
quite gets at the answer that is

2480
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:19,250
actually useful but I'll ask the

2481
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:20,930
question what about refractions and

2482
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:29,659
seeing the seabed with some kind of

2483
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:32,030
caustics i can be the answer is we

2484
01:55:29,659 --> 01:55:35,000
already have a very cheap basic version

2485
01:55:32,029 --> 01:55:41,389
of that like if i if i zoom in here I

2486
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:42,680
mean maybe I'm too zoomed now as you can

2487
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:45,920
sort of see if you look at those two

2488
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:48,079
yellow blocks I think they're obscured

2489
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:49,489
at the moment well no they're actually

2490
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:51,350
not because they're taped there over

2491
01:55:49,489 --> 01:55:52,609
your face as well the problem is the

2492
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:54,620
framerate is really low

2493
01:55:52,609 --> 01:56:00,079
okay so if you look at these blue Icee

2494
01:55:54,619 --> 01:56:02,659
okay let me I've got to lock the camera

2495
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:04,840
and then all tab oh I locked it in the

2496
01:56:02,659 --> 01:56:04,840
wrong place

2497
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:14,010
so if you look real close I mean there's

2498
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:15,869
a lot of motion on the screen but you'll

2499
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:18,630
see that the edges of these stones are

2500
01:56:15,869 --> 01:56:21,619
not solid they're actually they're

2501
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:24,600
actually wavy they wave a little bit

2502
01:56:21,619 --> 01:56:26,789
that's because we are doing some

2503
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:28,860
diffraction or refraction or whatever

2504
01:56:26,789 --> 01:56:33,930
that you want to call it it's not a

2505
01:56:28,859 --> 01:56:36,269
great deal right now but we already do

2506
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:43,650
that like the shader the shader for the

2507
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:45,570
ocean decides you know decides it gets

2508
01:56:43,649 --> 01:56:47,309
drawn after the background gets drawn

2509
01:56:45,569 --> 01:56:49,529
and it decides where to sample from that

2510
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:51,750
background which is not a physically

2511
01:56:49,529 --> 01:56:53,939
correct thing to do but it is the

2512
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:55,680
general hack that videogames often do to

2513
01:56:53,939 --> 01:56:56,789
create the impression of that and then

2514
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:59,430
you know there are little geometric

2515
01:56:56,789 --> 01:57:01,560
tricks you can try to do to get it sort

2516
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:04,170
of as close as you can to what it really

2517
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:07,100
is right but again in this kind of a

2518
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:09,329
game we can do that kind of a trick

2519
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:10,800
heavily whereas in a game like the

2520
01:57:09,329 --> 01:57:12,210
witness we couldn't do that kind of a

2521
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,670
trick we had to be physically accurate

2522
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:16,050
for reasons of gameplay right so it's

2523
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:19,579
actually kind of a relief to be able to

2524
01:57:16,050 --> 01:57:21,869
do weird hacks and stuff that said right

2525
01:57:19,579 --> 01:57:24,059
if we wanted to do a higher powered

2526
01:57:21,869 --> 01:57:26,279
version of that like I'm sure there's a

2527
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:29,190
whole literature on just like how to do

2528
01:57:26,279 --> 01:57:33,989
5% better oh yeah I know water

2529
01:57:29,189 --> 01:57:35,849
refraction right so that's not like by

2530
01:57:33,989 --> 01:57:39,869
the time you're at a point where you're

2531
01:57:35,850 --> 01:57:43,710
like look I have I know what the height

2532
01:57:39,869 --> 01:57:46,170
of the water is per pixel and I have a

2533
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:48,960
scene in the background that I know what

2534
01:57:46,170 --> 01:57:51,060
the depth buffer is and stuff or or I

2535
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:52,800
can do some pre computed stuff just in

2536
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:55,230
3d without the you know pre

2537
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:57,360
rasterization or whatever like you can

2538
01:57:55,229 --> 01:58:03,599
do it really a lot with that and I'm not

2539
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:04,949
really worried about that yeah yeah I

2540
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:07,289
mean I guess what I would say to the

2541
01:58:04,949 --> 01:58:10,229
question is just like we're kind of

2542
01:58:07,289 --> 01:58:13,170
talking more right now about how do we

2543
01:58:10,229 --> 01:58:15,599
produce something that allows us to get

2544
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:19,630
information about what the water surface

2545
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:22,420
should be and how we then choose to rent

2546
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:25,239
that is actually a totally separate

2547
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:27,369
question that actually can be answered

2548
01:58:25,238 --> 01:58:30,729
in a whole variety of ways that may be

2549
01:58:27,369 --> 01:58:32,260
completely decoupled from how you figure

2550
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:36,218
out what the surface should roughly look

2551
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:39,969
like if that makes sense so you know I

2552
01:58:36,219 --> 01:58:42,340
mean everything from on r-tx cards we

2553
01:58:39,969 --> 01:58:44,800
run a ray tracer from the water surface

2554
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:47,230
to actually produce the exact thing to

2555
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:50,529
some kind of random hack with screen

2556
01:58:47,229 --> 01:58:54,069
space sampling is on the table and you

2557
01:58:50,529 --> 01:58:56,619
know that's usually not that hard to

2558
01:58:54,069 --> 01:58:58,779
decouple from the where the heck is the

2559
01:58:56,619 --> 01:59:00,130
water surface or what is this turbulence

2560
01:58:58,779 --> 01:59:03,179
at a particular point which is what we

2561
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:03,179
kind of needed to know here

2562
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:10,449
all right so question what about making

2563
01:59:07,869 --> 01:59:12,729
a prototype scene to set the stylistic

2564
01:59:10,448 --> 01:59:18,099
direction I have no idea what John wants

2565
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:22,149
the water to look like okay that is

2566
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:31,710
something that we do for most aspects of

2567
01:59:22,149 --> 01:59:35,488
the game however okay step one okay when

2568
01:59:31,710 --> 01:59:38,079
artists develop a style for a game right

2569
01:59:35,488 --> 01:59:40,599
partially they're working from ideas or

2570
01:59:38,079 --> 01:59:44,469
like sketches or something but partially

2571
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:46,960
what they are doing is figuring out how

2572
01:59:44,469 --> 01:59:50,050
to use the tools that you give them in

2573
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:51,340
the engine or in terms of what content

2574
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:53,920
generation tools you have or whatever

2575
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:56,380
figuring out what they can do with those

2576
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:59,250
things that looks good and how to make

2577
01:59:56,380 --> 02:00:01,779
things look good with those things right

2578
01:59:59,250 --> 02:00:05,550
so if you're saying well just have them

2579
02:00:01,779 --> 02:00:08,198
make a concept for water it's like well

2580
02:00:05,550 --> 02:00:09,610
they don't have tools for water because

2581
02:00:08,198 --> 02:00:10,869
we haven't built the tools for water

2582
02:00:09,609 --> 02:00:14,079
because we don't know what those are yet

2583
02:00:10,869 --> 02:00:16,269
and so if they make any concept for

2584
02:00:14,079 --> 02:00:18,880
water well you can start doing that but

2585
02:00:16,270 --> 02:00:21,100
then it's not going to be constrained by

2586
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:24,429
the other so like you can go into max or

2587
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:26,199
Maya and like render a scene that has

2588
02:00:24,429 --> 02:00:29,139
cool-looking water and that could help a

2589
02:00:26,198 --> 02:00:30,460
little bit but it's not guided by any of

2590
02:00:29,139 --> 02:00:33,340
the stuff that we're talking about and

2591
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:36,859
then at that point also is not guided by

2592
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:38,449
you know is it real-time or not in is it

2593
02:00:36,859 --> 02:00:40,279
so real-time that you can throw it into

2594
02:00:38,448 --> 02:00:45,169
your scene and not worry about framerate

2595
02:00:40,279 --> 02:00:49,460
right or or even and there are other

2596
02:00:45,170 --> 02:00:51,140
questions like does it take a consistent

2597
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:54,770
amount of time like whatever method is

2598
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:57,800
being used for this water right um one

2599
02:00:54,770 --> 02:00:59,420
thing we did do before was you know one

2600
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:02,440
person who was working on this at that

2601
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:04,969
time likes Unreal Engine a lot and did a

2602
02:01:02,439 --> 02:01:06,738
little bit of Unreal Engine prototyping

2603
02:01:04,969 --> 02:01:08,420
but like it never really looked like any

2604
02:01:06,738 --> 02:01:09,859
like you know what water looks like in

2605
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:13,579
an Unreal Engine game and it looked like

2606
02:01:09,859 --> 02:01:15,380
that it was like well if we want that we

2607
02:01:13,579 --> 02:01:18,439
know how to do that

2608
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:22,850
it's just that prototyping never got

2609
02:01:18,439 --> 02:01:24,979
beyond that point it's possible that we

2610
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:27,020
could have done that but again like part

2611
02:01:24,979 --> 02:01:31,399
of our job and establishing this style

2612
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:32,870
of this game is to like like you want to

2613
02:01:31,399 --> 02:01:35,149
be a little bit new you want to just

2614
02:01:32,869 --> 02:01:36,469
like not copy everybody right if you

2615
02:01:35,149 --> 02:01:39,379
can't if you can't figure out anything

2616
02:01:36,469 --> 02:01:40,908
new to do then that's fine but we

2617
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:42,469
already should be able to figure out new

2618
02:01:40,908 --> 02:01:44,960
things to do because we already have new

2619
02:01:42,469 --> 02:01:47,390
inputs like I don't think I've ever

2620
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:49,670
played a game that has these like grid

2621
02:01:47,390 --> 02:01:52,060
based orthogonal River flows where you

2622
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:54,829
disrupt rivers and stuff right and so

2623
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:56,390
that kind of leads you to at least a

2624
02:01:54,829 --> 02:01:58,789
slightly different implementation than

2625
02:01:56,390 --> 02:02:00,619
whenever everyone else has also we're

2626
02:01:58,789 --> 02:02:02,929
still in a situation where technology

2627
02:02:00,619 --> 02:02:04,849
keeps improving over time and so just

2628
02:02:02,929 --> 02:02:06,500
the fact that you have better technology

2629
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:10,219
than the people four years ago who made

2630
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:12,289
whatever other and but by that I mean

2631
02:02:10,219 --> 02:02:13,819
the hardware technology right there's a

2632
02:02:12,289 --> 02:02:16,429
lot more transistors going the software

2633
02:02:13,819 --> 02:02:22,069
technology is actually worse but you

2634
02:02:16,429 --> 02:02:23,690
know we kind of suffer through that so

2635
02:02:22,069 --> 02:02:26,179
all these things mean you should be able

2636
02:02:23,689 --> 02:02:32,329
to do something new or different or good

2637
02:02:26,179 --> 02:02:34,670
and so then if you use like an old

2638
02:02:32,329 --> 02:02:38,390
codebase or old system to prototype

2639
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:41,179
something you maybe preemptively closing

2640
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:42,980
doors on ideas of how to do things you

2641
02:02:41,179 --> 02:02:45,319
know because because that system was

2642
02:02:42,979 --> 02:02:46,368
made like let's say it's old enough that

2643
02:02:45,319 --> 02:02:48,708
just nobody

2644
02:02:46,368 --> 02:02:51,679
of thought to run a high-res fluid sim

2645
02:02:48,708 --> 02:02:53,448
at all because maybe maybe shaders

2646
02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:54,439
didn't even have that ability we can go

2647
02:02:53,448 --> 02:02:59,779
back that far

2648
02:02:54,439 --> 02:03:01,699
right it's like okay well if you decide

2649
02:02:59,779 --> 02:03:03,168
that that looks good then you're setting

2650
02:03:01,698 --> 02:03:05,538
a threshold for what you're going to

2651
02:03:03,168 --> 02:03:08,988
accept that's you know maybe a little

2652
02:03:05,538 --> 02:03:11,418
too low so for all those reasons we

2653
02:03:08,988 --> 02:03:14,029
haven't done that yet but also though

2654
02:03:11,418 --> 02:03:15,498
right once we program some stuff here

2655
02:03:14,029 --> 02:03:17,300
and I'm like oh this is kind of good I

2656
02:03:15,498 --> 02:03:19,998
think this I think this is related to

2657
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:23,779
what we can ship you know it'll of

2658
02:03:19,998 --> 02:03:26,208
course get revised a few times um only

2659
02:03:23,779 --> 02:03:28,038
at that point do we start figuring out

2660
02:03:26,208 --> 02:03:30,078
the style of the the water in the game

2661
02:03:28,038 --> 02:03:32,208
really because that is one of the people

2662
02:03:30,078 --> 02:03:33,498
on the art team take these tools and say

2663
02:03:32,208 --> 02:03:35,658
okay we're gonna start making stuff with

2664
02:03:33,498 --> 02:03:36,918
this right then we're gonna discover

2665
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:40,429
like oh they want to have this ability

2666
02:03:36,918 --> 02:03:42,590
and they don't have it or whatever like

2667
02:03:40,429 --> 02:03:44,059
they should be able to do this thing or

2668
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:45,619
they can do this thing and it should

2669
02:03:44,059 --> 02:03:48,559
look better than it does and why doesn't

2670
02:03:45,618 --> 02:03:51,438
it look that good or we all that kind of

2671
02:03:48,559 --> 02:03:53,179
thing comes out that happens but when

2672
02:03:51,439 --> 02:03:57,249
you're creating the technology that

2673
02:03:53,179 --> 02:03:57,248
happens after you create the technology

2674
02:03:59,408 --> 02:04:07,069
so I have a different answer that

2675
02:04:01,878 --> 02:04:08,689
question it's similar to what you just

2676
02:04:07,069 --> 02:04:11,628
said but it's a little bit broader I

2677
02:04:08,689 --> 02:04:14,179
guess and that is that when you're

2678
02:04:11,628 --> 02:04:16,998
talking about defining the look of

2679
02:04:14,179 --> 02:04:18,618
anything doesn't really matter what it

2680
02:04:16,998 --> 02:04:25,340
is when you're just doing aesthetic

2681
02:04:18,618 --> 02:04:27,529
experimentation it's not true that

2682
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:30,610
iteration is always fastest and most

2683
02:04:27,529 --> 02:04:33,590
productive when given to the art team so

2684
02:04:30,609 --> 02:04:34,728
artistic iteration is meaning if the

2685
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:37,458
thing that you're talking about is

2686
02:04:34,729 --> 02:04:40,219
fundamentally based on a sketching or

2687
02:04:37,458 --> 02:04:42,139
layering kind of process then artists

2688
02:04:40,219 --> 02:04:44,359
are fastest because that's their trade

2689
02:04:42,139 --> 02:04:47,179
it's using repetitive application of

2690
02:04:44,359 --> 02:04:48,228
tools to produce a result but when

2691
02:04:47,179 --> 02:04:51,889
you're talking about something like

2692
02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:54,079
water there really has never been even

2693
02:04:51,889 --> 02:04:56,569
in the history of all animation that I

2694
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:58,488
know of including film a time when

2695
02:04:56,569 --> 02:04:59,599
primarily the art department produced

2696
02:04:58,488 --> 02:05:01,428
the water and the reefs

2697
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:03,050
for that as water is far too complex for

2698
02:05:01,429 --> 02:05:05,449
an artist to produce with a brush pretty

2699
02:05:03,050 --> 02:05:07,609
much period and so what's always

2700
02:05:05,448 --> 02:05:09,589
happened is you have an iteration

2701
02:05:07,609 --> 02:05:11,599
process that involves programmers

2702
02:05:09,590 --> 02:05:14,090
generating tools for artists and then

2703
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:15,439
the artists use those tools and it feeds

2704
02:05:14,090 --> 02:05:17,659
back on itself and this has happened

2705
02:05:15,439 --> 02:05:20,499
even since the very first time that we

2706
02:05:17,658 --> 02:05:23,478
had fluid dynamics in film for example

2707
02:05:20,498 --> 02:05:25,969
at DreamWorks on I want to say Prince of

2708
02:05:23,479 --> 02:05:28,820
Egypt this is exactly what happened and

2709
02:05:25,969 --> 02:05:30,618
it's gone from there right so in the

2710
02:05:28,819 --> 02:05:32,628
case of John's game specifically it

2711
02:05:30,618 --> 02:05:34,398
would make very little sense to ask an

2712
02:05:32,628 --> 02:05:36,229
artist to iterate on the water because

2713
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:38,780
it's very hard for artists to produce

2714
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:42,530
water effects they have to use plugins

2715
02:05:38,779 --> 02:05:45,050
for their favorite and I use that term

2716
02:05:42,529 --> 02:05:46,938
in quotes Autodesk product that sort of

2717
02:05:45,050 --> 02:05:48,498
produce water sometimes and oftentimes

2718
02:05:46,939 --> 02:05:50,809
not very well and often not very

2719
02:05:48,498 --> 02:05:52,368
controllable and so on and so forth it

2720
02:05:50,809 --> 02:05:54,050
takes a tremendous amount of artist time

2721
02:05:52,368 --> 02:05:56,089
to set up these simulations it's very

2722
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:59,090
difficult for them to do much to them

2723
02:05:56,090 --> 02:06:01,668
and they take a long time to render so

2724
02:05:59,090 --> 02:06:04,369
the iteration time for your art staff on

2725
02:06:01,668 --> 02:06:07,340
water effects is usually lower than the

2726
02:06:04,368 --> 02:06:09,259
iteration time for your programmers and

2727
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:11,689
so typically if you have programmers

2728
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:13,729
with an aesthetic eye on your team you

2729
02:06:11,689 --> 02:06:14,929
give them the water sim first and then

2730
02:06:13,729 --> 02:06:17,208
you count it to your artist not the

2731
02:06:14,929 --> 02:06:19,399
other way around if you literally have

2732
02:06:17,208 --> 02:06:21,408
no programmers who understand what looks

2733
02:06:19,399 --> 02:06:22,939
good and what don't then you may be in a

2734
02:06:21,408 --> 02:06:24,858
situation where you have to head to the

2735
02:06:22,939 --> 02:06:26,090
art team first but normally that just

2736
02:06:24,859 --> 02:06:27,289
isn't the decision you would make and

2737
02:06:26,090 --> 02:06:35,139
it's not the decision anyone makes as

2738
02:06:27,288 --> 02:06:35,139
far as I know okay

2739
02:06:35,649 --> 02:06:47,539
so here is a question that is I guess

2740
02:06:44,139 --> 02:06:49,489
it's just someone wanting us to clarify

2741
02:06:47,538 --> 02:06:51,529
maybe when I was talking about the

2742
02:06:49,488 --> 02:06:52,848
Nvidia paper but the question is could

2743
02:06:51,529 --> 02:06:54,948
you elaborate on why you need to

2744
02:06:52,849 --> 02:06:57,288
multiply two noises to draw the grid

2745
02:06:54,948 --> 02:07:00,768
instead of using a 3d noise with dziak

2746
02:06:57,288 --> 02:07:03,858
as the time axis a noise multiply as a

2747
02:07:00,769 --> 02:07:10,570
noise part so I can probably take that

2748
02:07:03,859 --> 02:07:10,570
question unless you want to I mean

2749
02:07:11,819 --> 02:07:16,979
there are two there are multiple things

2750
02:07:14,189 --> 02:07:19,198
going on right there's how do you

2751
02:07:16,979 --> 02:07:21,209
animate it at all which like the 3d

2752
02:07:19,198 --> 02:07:25,138
question will answer but there's also

2753
02:07:21,210 --> 02:07:27,289
like you don't want a boring noise

2754
02:07:25,139 --> 02:07:33,539
function you want something multi scale

2755
02:07:27,289 --> 02:07:37,078
right and so you need to create that in

2756
02:07:33,539 --> 02:07:39,179
some way I would say like like we don't

2757
02:07:37,078 --> 02:07:42,840
you know we have very particular desires

2758
02:07:39,179 --> 02:07:45,000
like we don't want large portions of the

2759
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:46,679
grid to be erased at one time so that

2760
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,859
you can't see the lines over a very

2761
02:07:46,679 --> 02:07:51,539
broad place but if we just speckle a

2762
02:07:49,859 --> 02:07:53,009
bunch of little holes around through the

2763
02:07:51,539 --> 02:07:55,698
lines then they're gonna be pretty

2764
02:07:53,010 --> 02:07:59,699
consistent like there's actually a

2765
02:07:55,698 --> 02:08:06,658
stylistic balance right that we're

2766
02:07:59,698 --> 02:08:08,250
trying to achieve and I mean what yeah I

2767
02:08:06,658 --> 02:08:13,319
don't know okay that's all I have to say

2768
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:14,819
on that so what I was gonna say is part

2769
02:08:13,319 --> 02:08:16,590
of that is just like when you're hacking

2770
02:08:14,819 --> 02:08:18,809
stuff together like you're gonna make

2771
02:08:16,590 --> 02:08:21,319
something that happens to look good at

2772
02:08:18,810 --> 02:08:23,670
the time my guess is that the grid

2773
02:08:21,319 --> 02:08:25,319
probably will change because once you

2774
02:08:23,670 --> 02:08:26,908
have the final water system in you'll

2775
02:08:25,319 --> 02:08:28,679
probably become a lot more obvious what

2776
02:08:26,908 --> 02:08:31,439
actually wants to happen there and then

2777
02:08:28,679 --> 02:08:33,029
at that point it'll be like yeah so the

2778
02:08:31,439 --> 02:08:34,828
way we do it is we sample the water soon

2779
02:08:33,029 --> 02:08:36,689
which tells us something about the grid

2780
02:08:34,828 --> 02:08:38,658
and then we use some noise on top of

2781
02:08:36,689 --> 02:08:40,738
that because we want to use some

2782
02:08:38,658 --> 02:08:43,170
displacement not related to the water

2783
02:08:40,738 --> 02:08:45,598
and off we go right so I'm guessing even

2784
02:08:43,170 --> 02:08:47,639
once the grid is like this is exactly

2785
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:49,529
what we want it to be it probably will

2786
02:08:47,639 --> 02:08:51,630
come from multiple sources because

2787
02:08:49,529 --> 02:08:53,759
typically you want sources that both

2788
02:08:51,630 --> 02:08:56,039
capture underlying phenomena which are

2789
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:58,829
coming from one system and ones that are

2790
02:08:56,039 --> 02:09:01,710
about an authorial input that is about

2791
02:08:58,828 --> 02:09:03,809
the grid only itself right so typically

2792
02:09:01,710 --> 02:09:06,149
it's not uncommon for wanting to apply

2793
02:09:03,810 --> 02:09:07,800
multiple inputs to create something

2794
02:09:06,149 --> 02:09:09,359
because you're trying to capture

2795
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:11,279
different opinions about what should

2796
02:09:09,359 --> 02:09:13,649
happen oftentimes one comes from

2797
02:09:11,279 --> 02:09:15,300
gameplay or comes from simulation and

2798
02:09:13,649 --> 02:09:16,679
the other comes from tweaking that you

2799
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:18,449
want to lay on top of it to maintain

2800
02:09:16,679 --> 02:09:23,260
certain aesthetic criteria that are

2801
02:09:18,448 --> 02:09:26,349
separate yeah and also

2802
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:28,810
once we have more stuff like say we say

2803
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:31,900
we do this other water simulator or even

2804
02:09:28,810 --> 02:09:34,390
say we just did the the particle one

2805
02:09:31,899 --> 02:09:36,039
that we have right now and just beefed

2806
02:09:34,390 --> 02:09:37,329
it up got it further along we would have

2807
02:09:36,039 --> 02:09:39,010
more material to work with

2808
02:09:37,329 --> 02:09:41,619
right so as long as you've got some

2809
02:09:39,010 --> 02:09:45,690
model of like some waves that go up and

2810
02:09:41,619 --> 02:09:48,789
down right then you might be like well

2811
02:09:45,689 --> 02:09:51,939
we can create a more visually integrated

2812
02:09:48,789 --> 02:09:56,500
scene by using that variation to provide

2813
02:09:51,939 --> 02:09:58,000
some of the some of the appearance and

2814
02:09:56,500 --> 02:10:00,460
disappearance for the grid lines that we

2815
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:03,100
want so that we're not multiplying it by

2816
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:04,840
some arbitrary external noise functions

2817
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:07,600
so like for example maybe in the troughs

2818
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:09,789
of waves it fades out and maybe at the

2819
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:12,490
peak it doesn't fade out and maybe that

2820
02:10:09,789 --> 02:10:13,750
by itself isn't like enough to get you

2821
02:10:12,489 --> 02:10:15,369
to the style that you want but maybe

2822
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:17,229
it's like half or two-thirds of it and

2823
02:10:15,369 --> 02:10:18,789
then you can do the rest of it with a

2824
02:10:17,229 --> 02:10:20,979
noise function that you layer on top of

2825
02:10:18,789 --> 02:10:24,269
that or something but but the more that

2826
02:10:20,979 --> 02:10:24,269
you have to work with that

2827
02:10:33,698 --> 02:10:40,238
there's just a there's a way of making

2828
02:10:36,130 --> 02:10:42,760
things where everything is related and

2829
02:10:40,238 --> 02:10:45,218
everything that can be used is used well

2830
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:50,469
and so you should look for those

2831
02:10:45,219 --> 02:10:53,890
opportunities if you can and yeah and

2832
02:10:50,469 --> 02:10:55,510
and so so if you say well this is our

2833
02:10:53,890 --> 02:10:56,860
prototype of how the grid lines were

2834
02:10:55,510 --> 02:10:58,030
done early on and we don't want to

2835
02:10:56,859 --> 02:11:00,579
change it then you may miss those

2836
02:10:58,029 --> 02:11:04,170
opportunities as you improve your

2837
02:11:00,579 --> 02:11:04,170
implementation of the other things so

2838
02:11:04,710 --> 02:11:09,069
next question is there seems to be a

2839
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:11,020
trade-off between visual realism and

2840
02:11:09,069 --> 02:11:12,549
gameplay clarity similar to the movement

2841
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:14,020
system however unlike the movement

2842
02:11:12,550 --> 02:11:16,869
system it seems that water will look

2843
02:11:14,020 --> 02:11:18,610
weirder if non continuous than character

2844
02:11:16,869 --> 02:11:20,109
movement what do you think is a good

2845
02:11:18,609 --> 02:11:21,670
trade-off and what are the knobs you

2846
02:11:20,109 --> 02:11:24,939
could tweak to make the trade-off go one

2847
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:26,829
way or the other well I will it look

2848
02:11:24,939 --> 02:11:28,629
weirder or really just looks vile eyes

2849
02:11:26,829 --> 02:11:33,309
right so okay this is gonna be weird

2850
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:35,590
because we just we just redid all our

2851
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:39,130
tone mapping and all this stuff so

2852
02:11:35,590 --> 02:11:41,260
colors are really messed up but let me

2853
02:11:39,130 --> 02:11:47,409
pick something like this let me get rid

2854
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:50,320
of the extra so I mean here's a an

2855
02:11:47,409 --> 02:11:55,599
island or a set of islands it's grid

2856
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:57,130
based the grading is very clear you

2857
02:11:55,600 --> 02:12:00,940
don't really have questions about where

2858
02:11:57,130 --> 02:12:02,529
you can stand on this if anything I

2859
02:12:00,939 --> 02:12:04,710
would say that the little ocean pattern

2860
02:12:02,529 --> 02:12:07,539
in the background is a little too noisy

2861
02:12:04,710 --> 02:12:10,179
like the bubbles pattern but you can

2862
02:12:07,539 --> 02:12:12,250
imagine that's part of like me breaking

2863
02:12:10,179 --> 02:12:13,989
all the ocean shaders and stuff right

2864
02:12:12,250 --> 02:12:17,529
like the water here used to look a lot

2865
02:12:13,988 --> 02:12:18,879
better but just you know the point that

2866
02:12:17,529 --> 02:12:21,340
I want to make is about the land

2867
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:23,590
it's very artificially conforming to

2868
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:26,170
grid squares like you don't ever expect

2869
02:12:23,590 --> 02:12:29,860
an island to look like this but it's

2870
02:12:26,170 --> 02:12:33,000
stylized and it looks coherent and the

2871
02:12:29,859 --> 02:12:37,319
game sells it to you so it's fine right

2872
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,319
you can do the same thing with water

2873
02:12:40,439 --> 02:12:45,549
that's all I have to say about that I

2874
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:46,989
think I don't know um mmm

2875
02:12:45,550 --> 02:12:49,630
so the only thing I would add to that is

2876
02:12:46,988 --> 02:12:50,859
that as far as knobs are concerned I

2877
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:52,449
think we kind of already talked about

2878
02:12:50,859 --> 02:12:54,130
that when we were talking about like

2879
02:12:52,448 --> 02:12:56,408
when I was sort of pitching the like

2880
02:12:54,130 --> 02:12:58,510
maybe start with that Nvidia paper as an

2881
02:12:56,408 --> 02:13:00,609
example approach you have a lot of knobs

2882
02:12:58,510 --> 02:13:02,230
to turn you have what do those wave

2883
02:13:00,609 --> 02:13:04,089
functions look like that you're sampling

2884
02:13:02,229 --> 02:13:06,129
to create the wave pattern

2885
02:13:04,090 --> 02:13:08,289
what's the interpolation fall-off that

2886
02:13:06,130 --> 02:13:10,810
you're using to blend them together what

2887
02:13:08,289 --> 02:13:12,969
are you doing on the source coarse mesh

2888
02:13:10,810 --> 02:13:15,159
right so you have tons and tons and tons

2889
02:13:12,969 --> 02:13:17,198
of knobs and I guess the meta comment is

2890
02:13:15,158 --> 02:13:19,388
just one of the reasons that I went to

2891
02:13:17,198 --> 02:13:20,829
that first as a method to suggest was

2892
02:13:19,389 --> 02:13:23,349
specifically because I feel like it has

2893
02:13:20,829 --> 02:13:25,529
a lot of actual options which i think is

2894
02:13:23,349 --> 02:13:30,099
what you want in this kind of scenario

2895
02:13:25,529 --> 02:13:34,689
yeah so so going back to another island

2896
02:13:30,099 --> 02:13:37,960
example here for a second like it's not

2897
02:13:34,689 --> 02:13:39,460
the case that we just randomly did

2898
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:40,658
someone said let's make islands that

2899
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:42,368
look good and then randomly did

2900
02:13:40,658 --> 02:13:45,009
something and did it right it was like

2901
02:13:42,368 --> 02:13:56,139
we experimented we prototyped we were

2902
02:13:45,010 --> 02:13:58,000
like how how how square or non square do

2903
02:13:56,139 --> 02:13:59,920
we need these to be right if they're too

2904
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:03,460
square they look weird if they're too

2905
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:06,310
non square then you end up in situations

2906
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:08,319
where you know it looks like you should

2907
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:12,130
be able to get like cross diagonals that

2908
02:14:08,319 --> 02:14:13,599
you can't actually cross or you know it

2909
02:14:12,130 --> 02:14:15,489
just looks weird that your character is

2910
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:18,039
standing on a square and is actually

2911
02:14:15,488 --> 02:14:19,959
like halfway in the water or a block

2912
02:14:18,039 --> 02:14:22,590
looks like it should fall and so we

2913
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:25,090
weigh all these

2914
02:14:22,590 --> 02:14:28,510
given the base technology that we have

2915
02:14:25,090 --> 02:14:30,639
for this which is let's just so first we

2916
02:14:28,510 --> 02:14:33,550
could place some flat pieces down right

2917
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:36,279
and then we have like some edge pieces

2918
02:14:33,550 --> 02:14:39,010
and there's I forget how to manipulate

2919
02:14:36,279 --> 02:14:40,840
it but there's like a decal layer that's

2920
02:14:39,010 --> 02:14:43,119
creating all this coloring so you see as

2921
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:45,779
I move this piece around there's like a

2922
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:48,779
decal being projected on top of it I

2923
02:14:45,779 --> 02:14:48,779
don't

2924
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:53,440
okay there's like this and then I forget

2925
02:14:52,210 --> 02:14:55,210
how you there's like a little editor

2926
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:57,159
where you can splat down the decals in

2927
02:14:55,210 --> 02:14:59,649
there so anyway we had some set of tools

2928
02:14:57,159 --> 02:15:02,470
for things like this right and then even

2929
02:14:59,649 --> 02:15:04,210
these little views it aligns in the

2930
02:15:02,470 --> 02:15:05,789
middle there our art direction rules

2931
02:15:04,210 --> 02:15:08,230
that we came up with which is like look

2932
02:15:05,789 --> 02:15:10,779
these can be organic and stuff that's

2933
02:15:08,229 --> 02:15:13,539
fine but they shouldn't they shouldn't

2934
02:15:10,779 --> 02:15:15,699
am big you ate the grid right so these

2935
02:15:13,539 --> 02:15:17,199
are sort of near the grid lines and you

2936
02:15:15,699 --> 02:15:19,269
look at this and you can your brain

2937
02:15:17,199 --> 02:15:22,210
knows where the square is and here

2938
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:23,890
there's like a dark shaded bit but

2939
02:15:22,210 --> 02:15:25,750
you're it's in the square and your brain

2940
02:15:23,890 --> 02:15:27,750
knows where it is right if you come

2941
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:34,210
along and use these tools to like do

2942
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:36,970
this right suddenly you're making a mess

2943
02:15:34,210 --> 02:15:40,230
and it's not as good anymore and if I

2944
02:15:36,970 --> 02:15:43,780
had more time I can mess it up more and

2945
02:15:40,229 --> 02:15:46,119
so it's it's not like like when you look

2946
02:15:43,779 --> 02:15:47,590
at it at a relatively finished thing

2947
02:15:46,119 --> 02:15:49,599
that's had some thought into it like

2948
02:15:47,590 --> 02:15:51,940
this it's easy to just assume that

2949
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:53,740
that's what happens when you decide to

2950
02:15:51,939 --> 02:15:56,199
make an island and quote make it look

2951
02:15:53,739 --> 02:15:57,729
nice or whatever but actually there's a

2952
02:15:56,199 --> 02:16:00,819
substantial thought process that goes

2953
02:15:57,729 --> 02:16:02,679
into very specific trade-offs and so

2954
02:16:00,819 --> 02:16:05,920
with water again you have those same

2955
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:07,539
trade-offs and we haven't been able to

2956
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:10,239
make those yet because we haven't really

2957
02:16:07,539 --> 02:16:13,930
implemented anything that that was ready

2958
02:16:10,239 --> 02:16:15,849
for production yet right so all that

2959
02:16:13,930 --> 02:16:17,470
comes a little later I forget I forget

2960
02:16:15,850 --> 02:16:22,420
how that ties in to what Casey was

2961
02:16:17,470 --> 02:16:24,280
saying but it totally does ok so someone

2962
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:26,079
asked side note do you know if that

2963
02:16:24,279 --> 02:16:27,239
paper helped make the water in sea of

2964
02:16:26,079 --> 02:16:30,369
Thieves

2965
02:16:27,239 --> 02:16:36,610
I have no idea but I doubt it cuz sea of

2966
02:16:30,369 --> 02:16:39,670
thieves is older than that paper next

2967
02:16:36,610 --> 02:16:41,230
question do you have a specific approach

2968
02:16:39,670 --> 02:16:43,030
when implementing something out of a

2969
02:16:41,229 --> 02:16:45,189
paper sometimes they are quite heavy

2970
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:49,719
sorry quite hand-wavy regarding

2971
02:16:45,190 --> 02:16:51,340
implementation details I've been burned

2972
02:16:49,718 --> 02:16:53,109
by papers so many times that I just

2973
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:57,219
don't trust them I have a very low

2974
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:59,920
opinion of of quote computer science

2975
02:16:57,218 --> 02:17:01,388
unquote papers that claim like if

2976
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,200
they're about if they're about a mathy

2977
02:17:01,388 --> 02:17:03,879
part of computers

2978
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:06,490
science I feel like I can depend on them

2979
02:17:03,879 --> 02:17:09,159
like if they're like you know this is

2980
02:17:06,489 --> 02:17:11,379
our proof that it takes oh of this many

2981
02:17:09,159 --> 02:17:13,809
steps to do this thing or whatever or

2982
02:17:11,379 --> 02:17:20,859
you know that kind of thing I think is

2983
02:17:13,809 --> 02:17:22,779
fine the kind that are like we got a 12%

2984
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:24,730
speed up by doing the following thing

2985
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:27,010
like almost all of those are garbage and

2986
02:17:24,729 --> 02:17:30,939
I've been very specifically I've done

2987
02:17:27,010 --> 02:17:32,590
jobs where even like prior to I'm

2988
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:35,409
thinking of a very specific incidents

2989
02:17:32,590 --> 02:17:38,200
but like there had been some new papers

2990
02:17:35,409 --> 02:17:40,000
out I've had friends say oh yeah this is

2991
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:41,170
great little did I know they didn't

2992
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,889
actually implement them in anything

2993
02:17:41,170 --> 02:17:43,659
serious

2994
02:17:41,889 --> 02:17:46,059
I went in took a contract where I had

2995
02:17:43,659 --> 02:17:47,649
one month to make this thing work and I

2996
02:17:46,059 --> 02:17:49,420
couldn't make it work and there was no

2997
02:17:47,649 --> 02:17:51,100
other option that would work for the

2998
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:52,510
earth you know these days with the

2999
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:54,130
amount of experience that I have I could

3000
02:17:52,510 --> 02:17:56,770
have cobbled something together but then

3001
02:17:54,129 --> 02:17:59,049
I was just like I don't like I failed a

3002
02:17:56,770 --> 02:18:01,870
contract basically because this research

3003
02:17:59,049 --> 02:18:04,468
paper sucked and because I didn't know

3004
02:18:01,870 --> 02:18:04,469
what else to do

3005
02:18:05,639 --> 02:18:12,099
so yeah man I don't know like and I've

3006
02:18:10,629 --> 02:18:14,199
had I've had experiences like that

3007
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:15,969
several times I was doing a thing in

3008
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:17,950
terrain generation once where there was

3009
02:18:15,968 --> 02:18:20,349
a paper that claimed to be very fast and

3010
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:23,469
I implemented it and I was like oh it's

3011
02:18:20,350 --> 02:18:25,149
not that fast actually and I wrote up a

3012
02:18:23,468 --> 02:18:26,229
thing about how it wasn't that fast they

3013
02:18:25,149 --> 02:18:28,270
could make it faster and the author of

3014
02:18:26,229 --> 02:18:31,869
the paper was like oh but these five

3015
02:18:28,270 --> 02:18:35,140
words deep deep in this paragraph out of

3016
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:37,510
this five to seven page paper there's

3017
02:18:35,139 --> 02:18:39,399
five words that suggest something that

3018
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:41,979
maybe solved this problem and I'm like

3019
02:18:39,399 --> 02:18:43,539
dude you didn't I can tell you didn't do

3020
02:18:41,979 --> 02:18:46,000
this work and you didn't publish it in

3021
02:18:43,540 --> 02:18:47,500
the source code and you don't know how

3022
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,440
much this actually makes you faster or

3023
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:55,629
not so like what I don't know just too

3024
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:56,829
many bad experiences the incentives for

3025
02:18:55,629 --> 02:19:00,519
the people who publish these papers are

3026
02:18:56,829 --> 02:19:02,559
all wrong so so the answer is just if

3027
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:04,750
I'm going in to implementing a paper

3028
02:19:02,559 --> 02:19:07,959
it's with extreme skepticism and an

3029
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:12,700
expectation that it may not work and

3030
02:19:07,959 --> 02:19:15,669
that I certainly wouldn't ever do it on

3031
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:17,920
a deadline anymore and then

3032
02:19:15,670 --> 02:19:19,689
it's with the expectation that I may

3033
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:22,420
have to use the paper just as a starting

3034
02:19:19,689 --> 02:19:24,010
point and as a source of maybe ideas of

3035
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:26,649
how to do things and then branch away

3036
02:19:24,010 --> 02:19:34,090
from that in terms of it actually doing

3037
02:19:26,649 --> 02:19:36,909
something that's good so let me take a

3038
02:19:34,090 --> 02:19:41,049
quick second to answer one of the

3039
02:19:36,909 --> 02:19:43,299
questions the that sort of popped up

3040
02:19:41,049 --> 02:19:45,819
that's really easy to answer really

3041
02:19:43,299 --> 02:19:47,978
quickly and it was so you have the

3042
02:19:45,819 --> 02:19:49,689
procedural method you have now more or

3043
02:19:47,978 --> 02:19:51,699
less and you have the baked method

3044
02:19:49,689 --> 02:19:53,530
provided by Nvidia couldn't you use

3045
02:19:51,700 --> 02:19:54,939
something similar to the way a specular

3046
02:19:53,530 --> 02:19:57,150
reflection map works to blend between

3047
02:19:54,939 --> 02:20:01,510
the two or is that we're saying already

3048
02:19:57,149 --> 02:20:04,779
so yeah just to be clear if if it wasn't

3049
02:20:01,510 --> 02:20:08,590
already the Nvidia paper is backed by a

3050
02:20:04,780 --> 02:20:10,900
Sim so if you want to you can just use

3051
02:20:08,590 --> 02:20:13,659
the simulation as your course grid or

3052
02:20:10,899 --> 02:20:17,770
blend the simulation between painted and

3053
02:20:13,659 --> 02:20:20,200
Sims however you want it's not like the

3054
02:20:17,770 --> 02:20:23,079
Nvidia paper is baked it's actually not

3055
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:24,850
this the Nvidia paper is a sim and then

3056
02:20:23,079 --> 02:20:26,319
up sampling and it's the up sampling

3057
02:20:24,850 --> 02:20:28,390
part where you add into fine detail

3058
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:39,850
waves that's that's what's going on

3059
02:20:28,389 --> 02:20:41,379
basically okay let's see so I think one

3060
02:20:39,850 --> 02:20:42,880
person said can you show the water and

3061
02:20:41,379 --> 02:20:44,619
the other more complete levels and talk

3062
02:20:42,879 --> 02:20:46,209
about what goes on there I think that's

3063
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:48,189
what you kind of just have on the screen

3064
02:20:46,209 --> 02:20:50,079
right now right I mean all the water is

3065
02:20:48,189 --> 02:20:51,909
basically wrecked compared to how it

3066
02:20:50,079 --> 02:20:54,670
looked like this water here looked a lot

3067
02:20:51,909 --> 02:20:57,760
better two weeks ago you know and it's

3068
02:20:54,670 --> 02:21:03,129
just in part like you can see how it's

3069
02:20:57,760 --> 02:21:04,719
maybe if I turn off my face again you

3070
02:21:03,129 --> 02:21:06,609
can see how it's a little shiny in the

3071
02:21:04,719 --> 02:21:08,679
upper right corner and maybe looks a

3072
02:21:06,610 --> 02:21:10,540
little bit like somebody put effort in

3073
02:21:08,680 --> 02:21:12,399
at one point like it used to look a lot

3074
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:16,479
more like that it's just like changing

3075
02:21:12,399 --> 02:21:18,010
all the the tone mapping process and

3076
02:21:16,478 --> 02:21:20,349
thus the calibration of all the

3077
02:21:18,010 --> 02:21:22,540
materials in the entire game like we

3078
02:21:20,350 --> 02:21:24,100
changed our dynamic range and then I

3079
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:25,960
broke the water like all sorts of things

3080
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:29,351
have happened so we have approximately

3081
02:21:25,959 --> 02:21:30,819
zero examples anymore of water

3082
02:21:29,351 --> 02:21:34,301
it's actually supposed to be trying to

3083
02:21:30,819 --> 02:21:38,710
look good which is then why this is a

3084
02:21:34,300 --> 02:21:40,899
good time to sort of pick it up and go

3085
02:21:38,710 --> 02:21:48,189
again so that we have like something you

3086
02:21:40,899 --> 02:21:50,619
know so this is now I think we're just

3087
02:21:48,190 --> 02:21:52,301
down to kind of broader questions oh

3088
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:54,910
well there's one more that I guess I can

3089
02:21:52,300 --> 02:21:56,290
sort of answer there's a question that

3090
02:21:54,909 --> 02:21:57,970
says how about a detailed enough

3091
02:21:56,290 --> 02:21:59,560
cellular automata that represents

3092
02:21:57,970 --> 02:22:01,479
pressure for the water sixteen by

3093
02:21:59,560 --> 02:22:04,210
sixteen per tile for example so that is

3094
02:22:01,479 --> 02:22:08,050
what a water sim is cellular automata

3095
02:22:04,210 --> 02:22:10,479
and finite element analysis tomorr

3096
02:22:08,050 --> 02:22:14,770
basically just the same kind of idea

3097
02:22:10,479 --> 02:22:16,569
they are well to be a little bit more

3098
02:22:14,771 --> 02:22:19,421
complete so there's two ways you can

3099
02:22:16,569 --> 02:22:22,449
think of simulate simulations or two

3100
02:22:19,421 --> 02:22:24,521
main methods that you use one is called

3101
02:22:22,450 --> 02:22:26,620
or Larian and one's called Lagrangian or

3102
02:22:24,521 --> 02:22:28,780
Larian methods are ones that operate on

3103
02:22:26,620 --> 02:22:30,730
a fixed grid or a fixed set of points

3104
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:32,440
and the grungy and methods are ones that

3105
02:22:30,729 --> 02:22:35,290
operate on points that move around in

3106
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:36,551
space and then there are mixed models

3107
02:22:35,290 --> 02:22:38,229
which use a combination of the two

3108
02:22:36,550 --> 02:22:40,449
that's like when you get things you know

3109
02:22:38,229 --> 02:22:42,069
a popular method for example as a modern

3110
02:22:40,450 --> 02:22:44,501
method would be material point methods

3111
02:22:42,069 --> 02:22:47,261
which are mixed mixed methods that use

3112
02:22:44,501 --> 02:22:50,800
the mix of the two cellular automata is

3113
02:22:47,261 --> 02:22:52,690
just one word for the update step on an

3114
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:54,880
oil Arian update model so if you have a

3115
02:22:52,690 --> 02:22:57,069
grid that has quantities represented on

3116
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:59,290
the grid cellular automata is a thing

3117
02:22:57,069 --> 02:23:01,331
that says look I just look at the

3118
02:22:59,290 --> 02:23:03,609
neighbors to this grid and I have a

3119
02:23:01,331 --> 02:23:06,040
basically binary composite rule that

3120
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:08,560
just gives me like here's the output of

3121
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:10,390
the thing it doesn't involve actually

3122
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:12,630
solving anything on the grid or even

3123
02:23:10,390 --> 02:23:15,190
attempting to solve anything on the grid

3124
02:23:12,630 --> 02:23:17,619
real fluid dynamics is basically

3125
02:23:15,190 --> 02:23:19,899
cellular automata taken up a notch right

3126
02:23:17,620 --> 02:23:21,431
it's you actually have equations that

3127
02:23:19,899 --> 02:23:23,591
you're trying to solve and you try to

3128
02:23:21,431 --> 02:23:26,440
structure your grid update step to

3129
02:23:23,591 --> 02:23:28,211
produce actual approximations to

3130
02:23:26,440 --> 02:23:30,819
solutions of equations on the grid that

3131
02:23:28,210 --> 02:23:33,460
you want to be true water in particular

3132
02:23:30,819 --> 02:23:36,011
this is important because water is an

3133
02:23:33,460 --> 02:23:39,100
incompressible fluid as opposed to say

3134
02:23:36,011 --> 02:23:41,950
smoke which is not what that means is

3135
02:23:39,101 --> 02:23:42,880
water when you push on it it comes out

3136
02:23:41,950 --> 02:23:45,810
the other end right

3137
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:48,639
can't become more dense it has to move

3138
02:23:45,809 --> 02:23:50,079
if you push on one end of water it comes

3139
02:23:48,639 --> 02:23:52,209
out the other end that's just how water

3140
02:23:50,079 --> 02:23:54,939
works it's incompressible it can't be

3141
02:23:52,209 --> 02:23:56,589
made to occupy higher densities in some

3142
02:23:54,939 --> 02:23:58,720
places and lower densities and others as

3143
02:23:56,590 --> 02:24:01,360
opposed to say smoke or other gaseous

3144
02:23:58,719 --> 02:24:03,188
phenomena so as a result it's very

3145
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:04,899
important that you have something that

3146
02:24:03,189 --> 02:24:06,670
approximates some kind of fluid

3147
02:24:04,898 --> 02:24:08,289
simulation if you actually want to

3148
02:24:06,670 --> 02:24:10,569
simulate water because it has to

3149
02:24:08,290 --> 02:24:13,990
simulate the effect of fairly rapidly

3150
02:24:10,569 --> 02:24:15,610
propagating the water across the grid so

3151
02:24:13,989 --> 02:24:17,170
that things when you push on one side

3152
02:24:15,610 --> 02:24:18,909
they need to come out the other side and

3153
02:24:17,170 --> 02:24:20,228
they can't just get denser in the middle

3154
02:24:18,909 --> 02:24:21,489
and kind of stick there which is

3155
02:24:20,228 --> 02:24:24,010
something this cellular automata would

3156
02:24:21,489 --> 02:24:26,228
generally do so I guess what I would say

3157
02:24:24,010 --> 02:24:27,550
is what you're talking about

3158
02:24:26,228 --> 02:24:30,309
is exactly what we're talking about

3159
02:24:27,549 --> 02:24:32,949
fluid Sims are fundamentally like the

3160
02:24:30,309 --> 02:24:34,959
you know the next level of cellular

3161
02:24:32,950 --> 02:24:38,439
automata already it's not a fair

3162
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:42,039
assessment John would you say you know

3163
02:24:38,439 --> 02:24:43,530
it's not exactly my area of expertise

3164
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:47,800
mine either

3165
02:24:43,530 --> 02:24:54,670
so what Casey said is fine as far as you

3166
02:24:47,799 --> 02:24:56,559
know okay next question is do you have

3167
02:24:54,670 --> 02:24:58,329
any hard and fast rules about creating

3168
02:24:56,559 --> 02:25:02,369
tools for team members to use things

3169
02:24:58,329 --> 02:25:09,579
like everything must be undoable etc

3170
02:25:02,370 --> 02:25:11,680
well I got mad once when somebody did

3171
02:25:09,579 --> 02:25:15,789
some basic stuff that wasn't like

3172
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:17,950
especially when like somebody who shall

3173
02:25:15,790 --> 02:25:20,470
not be named right now in part because

3174
02:25:17,950 --> 02:25:22,060
you shouldn't ever shouldn't even be

3175
02:25:20,469 --> 02:25:24,609
talking about this in public at all but

3176
02:25:22,059 --> 02:25:27,129
something that happened that that made

3177
02:25:24,610 --> 02:25:34,479
me kind of upset was somebody decide

3178
02:25:27,129 --> 02:25:36,789
okay there's a way there's a general

3179
02:25:34,478 --> 02:25:38,889
system that I've been using for enemy

3180
02:25:36,790 --> 02:25:42,160
management going back many years right

3181
02:25:38,889 --> 02:25:43,989
and actually at handmade con this one

3182
02:25:42,159 --> 02:25:45,430
time I talked to Casey about it a little

3183
02:25:43,989 --> 02:25:47,648
bit because we were talking about

3184
02:25:45,430 --> 02:25:49,720
serialization and deserialization and

3185
02:25:47,648 --> 02:25:52,809
like I think I went into some details

3186
02:25:49,719 --> 02:25:54,609
maybe maybe I actually did a follow up

3187
02:25:52,809 --> 02:25:56,199
stream I think that's what happened was

3188
02:25:54,610 --> 02:25:56,710
I posted a follow up stream on YouTube

3189
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:58,780
because we

3190
02:25:56,709 --> 02:26:01,000
go into as much detail as we could but

3191
02:25:58,780 --> 02:26:04,600
you know anyway it is just a way of

3192
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:06,909
arranging how do you serialize how do

3193
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:08,890
you DC realize how do you memory manage

3194
02:26:06,909 --> 02:26:10,270
so like if there are strings on entities

3195
02:26:08,889 --> 02:26:13,420
that you need to be able to type in and

3196
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:14,950
change in the editor right like someone

3197
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:17,950
needs to know that that's a string that

3198
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:19,810
needs to get freed when the entity you

3199
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:23,409
know is destroyed or whatever right and

3200
02:26:19,809 --> 02:26:27,100
so how does all that work well you know

3201
02:26:23,409 --> 02:26:28,899
sometimes people make decisions that are

3202
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:31,120
really annoying so okay so for example

3203
02:26:28,899 --> 02:26:33,430
serialization and deserialization is how

3204
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:36,340
undo work so if you want to change the

3205
02:26:33,430 --> 02:26:38,350
texture map on an entity right and then

3206
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:39,639
you control Z that changed the entity

3207
02:26:38,350 --> 02:26:42,489
comes back and it looks like what it did

3208
02:26:39,639 --> 02:26:47,079
before because you undid the change to

3209
02:26:42,489 --> 02:26:48,940
the string field and then it looks up it

3210
02:26:47,079 --> 02:26:51,430
looks up the name of the texture like

3211
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:53,770
when you undo something it there's a

3212
02:26:51,430 --> 02:26:55,479
little like hey reinitialize this guy

3213
02:26:53,770 --> 02:26:57,220
because he came out of the undo system

3214
02:26:55,478 --> 02:26:59,228
and whatever whatever you might need to

3215
02:26:57,219 --> 02:27:01,599
do to be able to get him live again do

3216
02:26:59,228 --> 02:27:04,239
that and so for example the name of the

3217
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:06,550
texture map on the thing is in a string

3218
02:27:04,239 --> 02:27:08,379
field and then when you make the entity

3219
02:27:06,549 --> 02:27:10,929
live or whatever would you make it

3220
02:27:08,379 --> 02:27:15,750
active you look up that texture in the

3221
02:27:10,930 --> 02:27:18,300
asset list and then you put you put that

3222
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:20,770
texture

3223
02:27:18,299 --> 02:27:22,569
well whatever now you have a pointer to

3224
02:27:20,770 --> 02:27:24,130
a texture instead of a string and you

3225
02:27:22,569 --> 02:27:26,289
can use that to render the guy right

3226
02:27:24,129 --> 02:27:29,529
hopefully people out there know what I'm

3227
02:27:26,290 --> 02:27:31,720
talking very very standard thing so in

3228
02:27:29,530 --> 02:27:34,120
past engines I always did that as to

3229
02:27:31,719 --> 02:27:36,159
very explicit separate steps there's a

3230
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:38,560
string field and then you look up the

3231
02:27:36,159 --> 02:27:40,209
texture later because I like the clarity

3232
02:27:38,559 --> 02:27:41,769
of that and the lack of ambiguity now

3233
02:27:40,209 --> 02:27:45,009
for this engine we're doing some

3234
02:27:41,770 --> 02:27:48,159
experiments like well you know you have

3235
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:49,569
better metadata for things maybe we can

3236
02:27:48,159 --> 02:27:54,159
just realize that something's a pointer

3237
02:27:49,569 --> 02:27:56,079
to a texture and just not store the

3238
02:27:54,159 --> 02:27:57,809
string field but that introduced a bunch

3239
02:27:56,079 --> 02:28:01,270
of difficulties but you know somebody

3240
02:27:57,809 --> 02:28:02,920
decided to do that change and didn't

3241
02:28:01,270 --> 02:28:05,409
sufficiently think about it and it

3242
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:08,860
caused a lot of problems that that if it

3243
02:28:05,409 --> 02:28:10,418
were me doing it I like to think I would

3244
02:28:08,860 --> 02:28:12,609
have at least

3245
02:28:10,418 --> 02:28:15,279
the thought of most of those problems or

3246
02:28:12,609 --> 02:28:16,539
found them within the few days of

3247
02:28:15,279 --> 02:28:17,859
playing around with this major major

3248
02:28:16,539 --> 02:28:21,029
change that I would have done before

3249
02:28:17,859 --> 02:28:25,090
exporting into the team so for example

3250
02:28:21,029 --> 02:28:27,760
let's say you typo a text or name right

3251
02:28:25,090 --> 02:28:32,799
when you're in when you're in the editor

3252
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:34,418
and what happens does it give you an alt

3253
02:28:32,799 --> 02:28:35,799
text or back if it gives you an alt text

3254
02:28:34,418 --> 02:28:37,988
or back there's no record of what you

3255
02:28:35,799 --> 02:28:39,908
typed because there's no string field

3256
02:28:37,988 --> 02:28:41,770
and now how do you correct your typos

3257
02:28:39,908 --> 02:28:47,680
without retyping the whole frickin thing

3258
02:28:41,770 --> 02:28:49,359
right if something if a texture pointer

3259
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:51,879
goes into undo did you do the manual

3260
02:28:49,359 --> 02:28:57,010
work of pulling that back out of undo

3261
02:28:51,879 --> 02:28:59,949
right or did you just you know just say

3262
02:28:57,010 --> 02:29:01,629
oh it's fine just somebody asked to type

3263
02:28:59,949 --> 02:29:06,520
the text your name again if you undo it

3264
02:29:01,629 --> 02:29:09,060
right there was a third one that was

3265
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:09,060
important

3266
02:29:11,049 --> 02:29:15,009
what if you type the name of a texture

3267
02:29:13,420 --> 02:29:16,600
field first and then you want to hot

3268
02:29:15,010 --> 02:29:18,280
load the texture second which was

3269
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:20,829
something you could do before just fine

3270
02:29:18,280 --> 02:29:25,060
does that work now right so when you

3271
02:29:20,829 --> 02:29:28,478
make a change like that like at least

3272
02:29:25,059 --> 02:29:30,309
don't break things at least make sure

3273
02:29:28,478 --> 02:29:31,929
that everything is good especially if

3274
02:29:30,309 --> 02:29:33,728
the change that you're making is sort of

3275
02:29:31,930 --> 02:29:36,130
academic at some level like it's not

3276
02:29:33,728 --> 02:29:38,019
really academic it's like it's maybe a

3277
02:29:36,129 --> 02:29:39,519
little bit more efficient sort of or

3278
02:29:38,020 --> 02:29:45,579
like you don't have to have two copies

3279
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:47,380
of data or something but the the team

3280
02:29:45,579 --> 02:29:50,739
the artists and including me the

3281
02:29:47,379 --> 02:29:54,339
designer at the time wants to just be

3282
02:29:50,739 --> 02:29:56,619
able to do stuff and not not like have

3283
02:29:54,340 --> 02:29:58,299
scrap breaking on us all the time and so

3284
02:29:56,620 --> 02:30:02,340
when you make a change like that here's

3285
02:29:58,299 --> 02:30:06,879
what I would say is you shouldn't make

3286
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:09,760
changes to code that people use unless

3287
02:30:06,879 --> 02:30:12,728
you use that yourself and know what it's

3288
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:15,909
gonna do and know what the failure modes

3289
02:30:12,728 --> 02:30:17,529
are which is a little bit easier said

3290
02:30:15,909 --> 02:30:19,270
than done because everybody uses tools a

3291
02:30:17,530 --> 02:30:20,590
little differently I use the editor in

3292
02:30:19,270 --> 02:30:21,819
the game all the time I use it in a

3293
02:30:20,590 --> 02:30:22,989
different way than the artists do

3294
02:30:21,818 --> 02:30:24,039
there's a lot of things they do that I

3295
02:30:22,989 --> 02:30:26,648
don't do there's a lot of things I do

3296
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:29,340
that they don't do so it's very hard to

3297
02:30:26,648 --> 02:30:31,840
get complete coverage on that but like

3298
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:36,520
you shouldn't be messing that stuff up

3299
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:39,549
right like if you and then again an

3300
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:42,100
extra part of the problem is just even

3301
02:30:39,549 --> 02:30:43,478
though I tell people hey bug us if

3302
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:46,479
there's a problem they often won't

3303
02:30:43,478 --> 02:30:48,670
because they just work around it or they

3304
02:30:46,478 --> 02:30:51,279
know that we're all super busy and have

3305
02:30:48,670 --> 02:30:52,719
other stuff to do and so then you know

3306
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:54,819
we go eight months to a year with like

3307
02:30:52,719 --> 02:30:57,840
some major stupid problem that caused

3308
02:30:54,818 --> 02:31:00,639
everybody a lot of headache that like

3309
02:30:57,840 --> 02:31:02,889
could have been fixed in you know two

3310
02:31:00,639 --> 02:31:06,039
hours or something a year ago and it

3311
02:31:02,889 --> 02:31:07,329
didn't get fixed and then the more the

3312
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:08,890
more you're in an environment where

3313
02:31:07,329 --> 02:31:10,148
there's more of those problems happening

3314
02:31:08,889 --> 02:31:12,849
the more people just expect those

3315
02:31:10,148 --> 02:31:17,049
problems and won't notify you about them

3316
02:31:12,850 --> 02:31:19,450
right and so I don't know it's not easy

3317
02:31:17,049 --> 02:31:21,068
because at the same time if you're a

3318
02:31:19,450 --> 02:31:22,750
small independent developer there's a

3319
02:31:21,068 --> 02:31:24,459
reality on a limit to how much work you

3320
02:31:22,750 --> 02:31:24,609
can do so you really can't address some

3321
02:31:24,459 --> 02:31:28,179
of

3322
02:31:24,609 --> 02:31:31,328
sometimes for a while but you especially

3323
02:31:28,180 --> 02:31:33,998
don't want to be as an individual

3324
02:31:31,328 --> 02:31:37,840
engineer you don't want to be pushing

3325
02:31:33,998 --> 02:31:40,208
that in the wrong direction right you

3326
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:47,789
want to be making that stuff worse if

3327
02:31:40,209 --> 02:31:51,668
you do then it's not a good scene so

3328
02:31:47,789 --> 02:31:54,129
next question is are there any level

3329
02:31:51,668 --> 02:31:56,168
design ideas that involve realistic

3330
02:31:54,129 --> 02:31:58,590
fluid mechanics like conservation of

3331
02:31:56,168 --> 02:32:01,270
mass hydraulic jumps venturi effect etc

3332
02:31:58,590 --> 02:32:04,869
for this game though it's just not what

3333
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:07,180
the game is and then the last question I

3334
02:32:04,869 --> 02:32:09,159
think we had was what do you do when you

3335
02:32:07,180 --> 02:32:10,300
think that there is no solutions to the

3336
02:32:09,158 --> 02:32:13,148
problem you have

3337
02:32:10,299 --> 02:32:15,759
I give up cancel the game and quit the

3338
02:32:13,148 --> 02:32:17,260
game industry what do you think I mean

3339
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:21,969
that's what all successful people do

3340
02:32:17,260 --> 02:32:26,020
right I don't think I've ever actually

3341
02:32:21,969 --> 02:32:28,108
seen a problem where I didn't think

3342
02:32:26,020 --> 02:32:30,899
there was some solution to it because

3343
02:32:28,109 --> 02:32:33,039
fundamentally speaking games are about

3344
02:32:30,898 --> 02:32:35,378
you know usually finding the right

3345
02:32:33,039 --> 02:32:37,539
approximations to problem to solutions

3346
02:32:35,379 --> 02:32:39,760
like you know we don't really need to

3347
02:32:37,539 --> 02:32:41,800
simulate water as water actually behaves

3348
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:43,148
we just need to make something that we

3349
02:32:41,799 --> 02:32:45,818
think is aesthetically pleasing and

3350
02:32:43,148 --> 02:32:46,208
there's many axes you can explore to get

3351
02:32:45,818 --> 02:32:49,180
there

3352
02:32:46,209 --> 02:32:51,668
so usually you ask for an example yeah

3353
02:32:49,180 --> 02:32:53,619
from this questionnaire about what what

3354
02:32:51,668 --> 02:32:55,648
is an unsolvable problem that's a good

3355
02:32:53,619 --> 02:32:57,760
that's a good point

3356
02:32:55,648 --> 02:33:01,019
what would be an example of a problem

3357
02:32:57,760 --> 02:33:01,020
that has no solution

3358
02:33:09,511 --> 02:33:15,610
the halting problem yeah thankfully we

3359
02:33:14,079 --> 02:33:19,829
don't generally need that in game design

3360
02:33:15,610 --> 02:33:24,131
no even the halting problem right like

3361
02:33:19,829 --> 02:33:26,829
so all of these things have solutions a

3362
02:33:24,130 --> 02:33:29,890
tweet everyone agrees with that's the

3363
02:33:26,829 --> 02:33:32,261
best answer well I mean I knew I had

3364
02:33:29,890 --> 02:33:38,649
some less politically correct ones but

3365
02:33:32,261 --> 02:33:40,780
in terms of like actual non social

3366
02:33:38,649 --> 02:33:43,630
problems let's say right so like halting

3367
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:45,159
problem even seems impossible right but

3368
02:33:43,630 --> 02:33:49,060
the way that you approach that kind of a

3369
02:33:45,159 --> 02:33:51,399
thing is you you step back right and you

3370
02:33:49,060 --> 02:33:53,501
make your universe of discourse be a

3371
02:33:51,399 --> 02:33:55,329
thing that contains the halting problem

3372
02:33:53,501 --> 02:33:57,190
that is bigger so that you know how to

3373
02:33:55,329 --> 02:33:59,290
like deal with the halting problem you

3374
02:33:57,190 --> 02:34:03,041
know where it comes up and you know how

3375
02:33:59,290 --> 02:34:08,649
to you know how to employ it to solve

3376
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:11,470
things right so like I don't know like

3377
02:34:08,649 --> 02:34:13,949
like solving solving problems is not

3378
02:34:11,470 --> 02:34:13,949
always

3379
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:23,380
the thing that makes some people a lot

3380
02:34:21,939 --> 02:34:27,398
better than other people at solving

3381
02:34:23,379 --> 02:34:29,259
problems is the ability to not just sit

3382
02:34:27,398 --> 02:34:32,340
there and grind on the obvious things

3383
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:36,040
and to have some imagination about what

3384
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:37,600
do you actually do here to to improve

3385
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:40,569
this situation do we have a non joke

3386
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:41,710
answer to that I don't I don't think so

3387
02:34:40,568 --> 02:34:42,908
cuz I mean you said because you know

3388
02:34:41,709 --> 02:34:45,099
sometimes when people ask that question

3389
02:34:42,908 --> 02:34:46,959
I have some in mind yeah they're working

3390
02:34:45,100 --> 02:34:48,250
on their own game and they're like man I

3391
02:34:46,959 --> 02:34:49,809
was trying to do this thing and it

3392
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:51,850
didn't of course other times it's just

3393
02:34:49,809 --> 02:34:54,068
people want to ask a question right and

3394
02:34:51,850 --> 02:34:57,479
it doesn't doesn't make sense

3395
02:34:54,068 --> 02:35:05,680
I don't see a non joke answer really

3396
02:34:57,478 --> 02:35:08,158
well do I recall the tie I just saw a

3397
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:10,449
question going but that's off topic Oh

3398
02:35:08,158 --> 02:35:11,828
someone asked Casey you didn't give an

3399
02:35:10,449 --> 02:35:12,970
answer to the implementing papers

3400
02:35:11,828 --> 02:35:14,648
question you seem to be fairly

3401
02:35:12,969 --> 02:35:19,179
up-to-date with papers so I think you

3402
02:35:14,648 --> 02:35:20,528
are less skeptical so I think I actually

3403
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:22,389
answered this question at hand made

3404
02:35:20,529 --> 02:35:25,300
caught as well in the Q&amp;A session at

3405
02:35:22,389 --> 02:35:28,289
handmade con 2016 I actually have a

3406
02:35:25,299 --> 02:35:31,269
complete answer to it but for me I just

3407
02:35:28,290 --> 02:35:34,300
basically go and I crawl all the

3408
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:37,600
research for the past 10 years or so and

3409
02:35:34,299 --> 02:35:39,938
I look at it all and I basically go okay

3410
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:41,949
what are what is the breakdown of the

3411
02:35:39,939 --> 02:35:44,380
way that people are solving these

3412
02:35:41,949 --> 02:35:46,210
problems and usually you can luck out

3413
02:35:44,379 --> 02:35:50,049
and there'll be some survey papers which

3414
02:35:46,209 --> 02:35:53,228
you can use to like crawl rese crawl the

3415
02:35:50,049 --> 02:35:55,568
bibliographies for but even generic like

3416
02:35:53,228 --> 02:35:56,469
non papers that are just making some

3417
02:35:55,568 --> 02:35:59,289
random contribution in the field

3418
02:35:56,469 --> 02:36:00,908
typically have a giant related work

3419
02:35:59,290 --> 02:36:02,979
section that basically has a

3420
02:36:00,908 --> 02:36:05,889
bibliography that can get you most of

3421
02:36:02,978 --> 02:36:07,778
the way there and so I feel like

3422
02:36:05,889 --> 02:36:09,760
typically what happens is as you start

3423
02:36:07,779 --> 02:36:12,010
to read enough of these papers you get a

3424
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:14,500
pretty good idea of where the actual

3425
02:36:12,010 --> 02:36:16,238
seminal work was and it's pretty rare

3426
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:18,309
for seminal papers not to actually

3427
02:36:16,238 --> 02:36:20,859
explain how they frickin work it's

3428
02:36:18,309 --> 02:36:22,478
usually like later papers that don't

3429
02:36:20,859 --> 02:36:25,059
explain what the heck is going on and

3430
02:36:22,478 --> 02:36:26,379
they just like have a bunch of random

3431
02:36:25,059 --> 02:36:28,090
nom and clay chore thrown in for no

3432
02:36:26,379 --> 02:36:30,938
reason I think part of this is because

3433
02:36:28,090 --> 02:36:32,710
people who crack the problem first tend

3434
02:36:30,939 --> 02:36:33,670
to be the kind of thinkers who usually

3435
02:36:32,709 --> 02:36:35,559
can explain the

3436
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:38,350
problems other people most of the time I

3437
02:36:35,559 --> 02:36:41,829
find so by the time I've looked through

3438
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:43,510
enough of the back story I find there's

3439
02:36:41,829 --> 02:36:45,129
not that much that I can't grapple with

3440
02:36:43,510 --> 02:36:46,689
and then it's just a question of sitting

3441
02:36:45,129 --> 02:36:48,670
down and actually working through it on

3442
02:36:46,689 --> 02:36:50,649
a you know with pen and paper or code

3443
02:36:48,670 --> 02:36:51,670
right and it takes a little while like

3444
02:36:50,649 --> 02:36:53,170
you've got to sit down because

3445
02:36:51,670 --> 02:36:54,100
especially if fluid dynamics you're

3446
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:55,510
gonna see a bunch of partial

3447
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:57,520
differential equations and those aren't

3448
02:36:55,510 --> 02:36:58,809
my strong suit anyway so I got to sit

3449
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:00,069
there and go like okay like what's this

3450
02:36:58,809 --> 02:37:04,180
actually saying like oh okay I see

3451
02:37:00,069 --> 02:37:06,039
whatever so that part is gonna be slow

3452
02:37:04,180 --> 02:37:08,559
no matter what you do but you know

3453
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:11,710
generally I find it's fine and most of

3454
02:37:08,559 --> 02:37:13,359
the time I don't think of it I don't

3455
02:37:11,709 --> 02:37:15,399
think of that process is I'm gonna sit

3456
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:17,350
down and implement this paper I think of

3457
02:37:15,399 --> 02:37:19,629
that process is I'm using the research

3458
02:37:17,350 --> 02:37:21,399
to help me decide what I'm going to

3459
02:37:19,629 --> 02:37:23,649
implement and what I end up implement

3460
02:37:21,399 --> 02:37:27,069
menteng tends to not be from any one

3461
02:37:23,649 --> 02:37:29,770
paper it tends to be what I think will

3462
02:37:27,069 --> 02:37:31,299
then solve my problem using all of the

3463
02:37:29,770 --> 02:37:34,659
tools that all of these people have

3464
02:37:31,299 --> 02:37:37,420
discovered in their attempts because now

3465
02:37:34,659 --> 02:37:38,770
I get it right so typically I don't look

3466
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:40,750
at research papers as something to

3467
02:37:38,770 --> 02:37:44,460
implement anyway that's just not what I

3468
02:37:40,750 --> 02:37:46,719
do I tend to think of research papers as

3469
02:37:44,459 --> 02:37:48,789
educating me about what people have

3470
02:37:46,719 --> 02:37:50,559
tried so that then I can figure out what

3471
02:37:48,790 --> 02:37:52,530
I want to try and it saves me a

3472
02:37:50,559 --> 02:37:55,779
tremendous amount of time because I'm

3473
02:37:52,530 --> 02:37:58,409
basically getting all of their work that

3474
02:37:55,780 --> 02:38:00,340
I don't have to do because they

3475
02:37:58,409 --> 02:38:02,350
experimented with something and came up

3476
02:38:00,340 --> 02:38:03,460
with a thing and now I don't have to

3477
02:38:02,350 --> 02:38:05,319
spend the time expiring to come up with

3478
02:38:03,459 --> 02:38:06,849
that thing I may have to experiment to

3479
02:38:05,319 --> 02:38:09,809
cope with other things but not that one

3480
02:38:06,850 --> 02:38:09,809
because they already did it

3481
02:38:16,228 --> 02:38:23,379
so there's one more here it seems more

3482
02:38:21,398 --> 02:38:25,868
important that Stillwater remains still

3483
02:38:23,379 --> 02:38:27,488
in the entire still tile then flowing

3484
02:38:25,869 --> 02:38:29,770
water remains flowing in the entire flow

3485
02:38:27,488 --> 02:38:31,988
tile as long as there is some flow if

3486
02:38:29,770 --> 02:38:34,449
you want to sim you could pretend all

3487
02:38:31,988 --> 02:38:36,520
still squares are filled in and do sim

3488
02:38:34,449 --> 02:38:38,590
of the flowing squares only because

3489
02:38:36,520 --> 02:38:40,270
waves can be summed you can do an on

3490
02:38:38,590 --> 02:38:42,699
flowing somewhat still simulation with

3491
02:38:40,270 --> 02:38:44,500
all water tiles ignoring any flow they

3492
02:38:42,699 --> 02:38:47,828
may have add those two layers together

3493
02:38:44,500 --> 02:38:50,648
to get the final waves so that's again

3494
02:38:47,828 --> 02:38:52,270
that's not that dissimilar to what was

3495
02:38:50,648 --> 02:38:53,948
going on with the Nvidia paper right

3496
02:38:52,270 --> 02:38:57,850
it's just like a little bit better

3497
02:38:53,949 --> 02:38:59,800
version of that like if your constraint

3498
02:38:57,850 --> 02:39:07,059
was you have to use the code that's

3499
02:38:59,799 --> 02:39:09,908
already here and and honestly though you

3500
02:39:07,059 --> 02:39:15,868
might even so you know right now if I go

3501
02:39:09,908 --> 02:39:18,789
back to the this level um

3502
02:39:15,869 --> 02:39:23,909
well right now anything's real quiet

3503
02:39:18,790 --> 02:39:23,909
because I just started it but one of the

3504
02:39:23,939 --> 02:39:30,818
the KC's face on one of the things that

3505
02:39:28,510 --> 02:39:32,020
happens after it warms up a little bit

3506
02:39:30,818 --> 02:39:33,250
and by the way that's one of the

3507
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:34,988
annoying things about this particular

3508
02:39:33,250 --> 02:39:37,988
thing is like how long do you have to

3509
02:39:34,988 --> 02:39:40,988
run it before it's in a steady state but

3510
02:39:37,988 --> 02:39:42,760
you know like so the way we sim these

3511
02:39:40,988 --> 02:39:45,459
particles is the particles get

3512
02:39:42,760 --> 02:39:47,680
accelerated way extra if they're inside

3513
02:39:45,459 --> 02:39:50,259
the gameplay flow and then not so much

3514
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:52,658
if they're outside and of course they

3515
02:39:50,260 --> 02:39:53,920
have a continuous acceleration across

3516
02:39:52,658 --> 02:39:56,738
those boundaries because you want to see

3517
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:58,960
like velocity discontinuities but they

3518
02:39:56,738 --> 02:40:00,698
could just be heavily heavily damped in

3519
02:39:58,959 --> 02:40:06,099
a way that they actually aren't right

3520
02:40:00,699 --> 02:40:09,100
and so that would solve so this place

3521
02:40:06,100 --> 02:40:11,250
where it's among the worst so if you see

3522
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:11,250
this

3523
02:40:21,590 --> 02:40:25,729
the question then is you know you you

3524
02:40:24,649 --> 02:40:33,850
get something that's good

3525
02:40:25,729 --> 02:40:33,850
I feel like Johnson her net maybe dying

3526
02:40:34,180 --> 02:40:40,850
well I don't know what to say

3527
02:40:38,590 --> 02:40:42,110
now you're returning you have returned

3528
02:40:40,850 --> 02:40:44,569
John you're great you've been

3529
02:40:42,110 --> 02:40:47,110
resurrected I said basically everything

3530
02:40:44,569 --> 02:40:50,209
I think that I was gonna say there I

3531
02:40:47,110 --> 02:40:55,400
don't think anyone heard it okay

3532
02:40:50,209 --> 02:41:01,849
well it's just to say we could damp we

3533
02:40:55,399 --> 02:41:04,340
could damp the stuff artificially but

3534
02:41:01,850 --> 02:41:10,399
like there's a sense in which when you

3535
02:41:04,340 --> 02:41:12,350
do that you are you are implementing

3536
02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:14,059
things that are counter to the good

3537
02:41:12,350 --> 02:41:16,040
thing that you're supposedly getting out

3538
02:41:14,059 --> 02:41:19,819
of the system right and so then what do

3539
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:21,920
you you know you have to question your

3540
02:41:19,819 --> 02:41:24,020
your core thesis that this is a good way

3541
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:27,620
to do it if if you're then going and

3542
02:41:24,020 --> 02:41:29,510
subtracting a lot of that you know like

3543
02:41:27,620 --> 02:41:31,790
if I just ran a water Sam on the

3544
02:41:29,510 --> 02:41:34,069
background that might be a little better

3545
02:41:31,790 --> 02:41:36,440
actually than damping things because at

3546
02:41:34,069 --> 02:41:41,809
least then the flow directions would not

3547
02:41:36,440 --> 02:41:43,610
be super related but then would it just

3548
02:41:41,809 --> 02:41:51,649
be weird cuz it's going in a totally

3549
02:41:43,610 --> 02:41:53,659
weird direction I don't know so someone

3550
02:41:51,649 --> 02:41:58,309
had a kind of a interesting suggestion

3551
02:41:53,659 --> 02:42:00,020
that I think is worth mentioning sort of

3552
02:41:58,309 --> 02:42:01,639
broadened perhaps a little bit which is

3553
02:42:00,020 --> 02:42:03,920
could the riverbed play a more prominent

3554
02:42:01,639 --> 02:42:05,930
role and be more or less shallow and

3555
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:08,059
explain why water moves or doesn't and I

3556
02:42:05,930 --> 02:42:11,750
kind of like that idea it's like could

3557
02:42:08,059 --> 02:42:16,129
the under water features be structured

3558
02:42:11,750 --> 02:42:18,379
in a way to help explain why the water

3559
02:42:16,129 --> 02:42:20,479
does what it does and the only problem I

3560
02:42:18,379 --> 02:42:24,769
think you'd run into there is because

3561
02:42:20,479 --> 02:42:27,859
the river changes course based on player

3562
02:42:24,770 --> 02:42:29,600
action it becomes harder if the player

3563
02:42:27,860 --> 02:42:31,310
couldn't do that then you could try to

3564
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:33,860
construct the underwater area to

3565
02:42:31,309 --> 02:42:34,909
reinforce what's going on but that

3566
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:37,340
becomes harder when you can

3567
02:42:34,909 --> 02:42:39,430
when it can change well also the thing

3568
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:41,569
the thing to realize is the underwater

3569
02:42:39,430 --> 02:42:42,979
you know for these rivers that you can

3570
02:42:41,569 --> 02:42:45,739
see that are going right to left for

3571
02:42:42,979 --> 02:42:48,949
example if you draw what's at the bottom

3572
02:42:45,739 --> 02:42:51,140
of that empty square of stuff you know

3573
02:42:48,950 --> 02:42:53,360
it's substantially it's almost on the

3574
02:42:51,140 --> 02:42:58,520
next grid square you know at this angle

3575
02:42:53,360 --> 02:43:00,560
and so if you can see that clearly now

3576
02:42:58,521 --> 02:43:03,380
you start having features that seem like

3577
02:43:00,560 --> 02:43:06,079
coherent physical features that are in

3578
02:43:03,379 --> 02:43:09,439
the wrong place for you to like be

3579
02:43:06,079 --> 02:43:11,510
looking at them you know what I mean

3580
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:15,200
so like if you look at the the yellow

3581
02:43:11,510 --> 02:43:18,590
stones that are there sort of like that

3582
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:21,771
nook I have the water tuned right now to

3583
02:43:18,590 --> 02:43:25,000
be very heavily damping of them visually

3584
02:43:21,771 --> 02:43:30,200
you can see them if you look real close

3585
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:32,569
but you know part of that is just to

3586
02:43:30,200 --> 02:43:34,760
make it very clear like what what square

3587
02:43:32,569 --> 02:43:38,810
are these in and if you start to lose

3588
02:43:34,760 --> 02:43:41,479
that then the question is does this

3589
02:43:38,810 --> 02:43:43,159
thing help you enough to make that worth

3590
02:43:41,479 --> 02:43:45,529
it and the answer is probably no in that

3591
02:43:43,159 --> 02:43:48,440
case especially because we want it you

3592
02:43:45,530 --> 02:43:50,601
know we want to have custom like little

3593
02:43:48,440 --> 02:43:52,399
visuals along the bottom that help

3594
02:43:50,601 --> 02:43:55,790
create the setting for any particular

3595
02:43:52,399 --> 02:43:57,649
level and like now do those have to be

3596
02:43:55,790 --> 02:43:59,780
destructible or something in case you

3597
02:43:57,649 --> 02:44:02,000
make an ocean go over it like I don't

3598
02:43:59,780 --> 02:44:03,620
even know so I I don't think that would

3599
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:05,840
be high on the list of things to

3600
02:44:03,620 --> 02:44:08,120
entertain that said once you start going

3601
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:10,729
down these routes of alternative

3602
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:12,110
solutions to things sometimes you enter

3603
02:44:10,729 --> 02:44:14,569
a space where it's like oh I didn't

3604
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:16,280
think ideas like that made sense but now

3605
02:44:14,569 --> 02:44:21,020
I totally see how they do so I wouldn't

3606
02:44:16,280 --> 02:44:27,470
totally rule it out either so I think

3607
02:44:21,021 --> 02:44:31,900
that's all the questions okay so that's

3608
02:44:27,469 --> 02:44:36,229
it we we got away much lighter this time

3609
02:44:31,899 --> 02:44:38,119
there's only three hours that's less

3610
02:44:36,229 --> 02:44:42,170
than that if you count the twenty to

3611
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:45,800
twenty hours of messing with the stream

3612
02:44:42,170 --> 02:44:47,530
yes yes there was a lot of you trying to

3613
02:44:45,799 --> 02:44:49,029
not make OBS

3614
02:44:47,530 --> 02:44:55,690
all the frames yeah that was really

3615
02:44:49,030 --> 02:44:57,550
great alright alright everybody thank

3616
02:44:55,690 --> 02:45:00,190
you for coming by if you missed parts of

3617
02:44:57,549 --> 02:45:03,670
this the video will be up on YouTube

3618
02:45:00,190 --> 02:45:07,181
later on you can of course go to

3619
02:45:03,670 --> 02:45:10,690
handmade hero at twitch.tv slash

3620
02:45:07,181 --> 02:45:13,540
handmade underscore hero to see KC work

3621
02:45:10,690 --> 02:45:19,540
on really amazing water simulation

3622
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:21,311
everyday or not at all or not at all

3623
02:45:19,540 --> 02:45:23,261
yeah you're still doing light stuff now

3624
02:45:21,310 --> 02:45:25,601
right where is that yeah light

3625
02:45:23,261 --> 02:45:29,200
propagation is really hard to do good

3626
02:45:25,601 --> 02:45:30,340
and fast that's true it's it's I said it

3627
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:31,480
at the beginning I was like this is

3628
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:34,049
going to be the worst thing we have to

3629
02:45:31,479 --> 02:45:35,949
do and I was right unsurprisingly

3630
02:45:34,049 --> 02:45:38,140
alright well if you want to do light

3631
02:45:35,950 --> 02:45:39,521
propagation instead of water propagation

3632
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:43,511
you can go there they're pretty similar

3633
02:45:39,521 --> 02:45:46,710
except one has yeah well I won't even go

3634
02:45:43,511 --> 02:45:51,540
down that route they're that similar

3635
02:45:46,709 --> 02:45:51,539
alright bye everybody take it easy
