1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:05,190
hello everyone and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:11,820
here the show we coat a complete game

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:15,388
live on stream we I believe did all the

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,820
stuff we were gonna do yesterday one of

5
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,019
the bonus of these Krampus loft blitz

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,510
dreams is you get a lot of programming

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,618
timing yeah stuff done so we pretty much

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,840
finished everything up but I think all

9
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:27,629
the other thing actually works now so

10
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:32,219
the thing that we wanted to move on to

11
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:35,579
was making our UI system not look so

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,859
ugly you know we don't got to win any

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,439
awards because it's not actually really

14
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,600
user facing it's something only for

15
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,968
developers to use so you know you can

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,058
accept a lower standard of visual polish

17
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,010
certainly but we don't want it to be so

18
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,259
horrid like right now all we did was

19
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,780
sort of the the backbone wiry sort of

20
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,869
stuff and we haven't really spent any

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,299
time making it at all usable like it

22
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:03,659
needs to be cleaner looking and it also

23
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:06,179
needs to be perhaps laid out better and

24
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:09,030
and so on so so we've got some stuff we

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,400
want to do there that's just you know a

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,829
basic sort of coat of paint over the

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,710
thing so that's what we'd like to do on

28
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,539
this stream I'm gonna go ahead and get

29
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,009
started I'll show you in case you've

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,479
missed you know we've done a lot of

31
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,030
streams case you missed where we are on

32
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,459
that I'll show you where we are on that

33
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,890
and then just briefly explain sort of

34
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:34,139
what I wanted to do to to make it a

35
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:38,340
little bit nicer in that regard so going

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:42,239
to the current state of the code you can

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,710
see that if I if I use this here the UI

38
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,059
kind of pops up here you can see it's

39
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:48,899
totally bare-bones right it's pretty

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,549
ugly and it's just at 0-0 it's just at

41
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,820
the center of the screen and it just

42
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,409
draws it right and so that's not what we

43
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,258
want right we want something that's

44
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,729
gonna be maybe over here on the side or

45
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,450
something like you know what I mean like

46
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:05,188
we'd like it to be if I made it

47
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,380
fullscreen and we actually imagined us

48
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,929
adjusting some things you know we'd want

49
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,939
it to occupy probably over here we'd

50
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,150
want this line to be more legible and a

51
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,299
little bit easier to use

52
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,459
there we'd want these buttons to be laid

53
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,170
out a little more sensibly I would like

54
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,780
it to be harder for example to hit the

55
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:24,609
Save button I mentioned that before a

56
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,120
little harder to hit the revert button

57
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,859
so these are these are more serious

58
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,870
operations there are things that you

59
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:33,489
don't want to hit by accident undo redo

60
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,079
is it's probably fine but again I don't

61
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:37,209
want the size of the buttons to change

62
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:40,840
like that right so we just we've never

63
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:45,250
done any UI like work here that really

64
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,340
tries to make this stuff feel right and

65
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,669
so that's really what I want to do is

66
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:56,319
sort of try to improve the quality of

67
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:59,738
this and so that's what I'm gonna focus

68
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:03,219
on today if I have time I'd also like to

69
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:07,329
fix the positioning of these things to

70
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:08,919
be based on sort of screen agnostic

71
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:12,340
coordinates percentage based coordinates

72
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,949
or something similar to that because I I

73
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,859
don't like having to move these around

74
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:19,568
every time like that I want them to and

75
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:21,040
and that's not our that has nothing to

76
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:22,958
do with the EUI we were working on it's

77
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,939
just a thing that would be nice to have

78
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,408
in there so let's get started on that so

79
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:31,479
we're just doing sort of the visual

80
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,939
cleanup here and adding code to be a

81
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,590
little bit more sensible about how those

82
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:40,150
sorts of things should work themselves

83
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:45,098
out what I want to do is start by inside

84
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:47,379
the editor here I want to kind of make

85
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:52,179
some way of positioning this thing more

86
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:54,219
sensibly like I said so what I think

87
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,409
wants to happen here and I could be

88
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:58,539
wrong about that but just you know

89
00:03:56,408 --> 00:04:01,478
reading the sort of limited writing

90
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:04,269
that's on the wall in this case we sort

91
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:06,040
of have this notion of sections here and

92
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:09,269
you can sort of see this begin section

93
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:12,158
idea and I think what I want to do there

94
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:16,709
is I want to have that begin section

95
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:19,269
call probably I would like that to be a

96
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,278
sort of a tabbed kind of a thing almost

97
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,810
like I think I want to do something

98
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:30,079
probably like this where we don't

99
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,728
we don't really go through sections and

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,430
trying to get how we wanted that maybe

101
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:38,149
you want to do it like that I'm not sure

102
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,579
yeah I'm not sure whether I want that

103
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:42,589
inside or out but something like this

104
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:45,800
where we can kind of have you know this

105
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:48,468
window it would list what section it was

106
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,389
on the top and maybe if we added more

107
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:52,129
sections

108
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:53,810
you could pick which one you were

109
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:55,610
looking at at any given time right

110
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,899
because again I don't want this user

111
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,060
interface to take up much space on the

112
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:01,908
screen so I would like to be able to if

113
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,339
we added if we ever added another type

114
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:06,310
of edit in here that wasn't alignment

115
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:13,689
points that was something else you know

116
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:13,689
I would want to maybe have some way of I

117
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:20,449
would want to have some way to pick

118
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,490
between those without having to have

119
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:25,069
like fussy debug keys like I don't want

120
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,250
have to remember like oh it's f7 to edit

121
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:31,699
alignment points and f9 to do this and

122
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,589
you know that kind of thing so you know

123
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,300
we'll we'll cross those bridges when we

124
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:37,098
come to them more but I do kind of want

125
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,908
to make it so that it looks a little bit

126
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:43,009
more like that and then I want that to

127
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:44,449
kind of be wrapped up more in a window

128
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,778
and understand where it's gonna be

129
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:49,218
better than zero zero obviously right so

130
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:56,389
that's kind of what we're looking for

131
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:58,399
here okay so looking at this the the

132
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,050
code that actually does begin section at

133
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,079
the moment I'm just gonna say it's

134
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,550
always returns true just because that's

135
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,889
you know and maybe I'll write it this

136
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:11,329
way instead because it doesn't really

137
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,699
have anything else to do but we'll you

138
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:16,128
know go ahead and make that happen

139
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:19,250
inside the code that actually calls the

140
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:23,509
renderer so when I'm actually you know

141
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:26,810
using the editor when I go to actually

142
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:29,509
draw this begin layout call this is most

143
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,418
of the the problem here in terms of how

144
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:34,879
things are aligning themselves what I'd

145
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:37,959
like to do with that at least for a

146
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:42,029
start is just say well you know I know

147
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:44,500
the this thing is is inside a certain

148
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:47,079
rectangles worth of stuff right I mean I

149
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,110
have some idea you know roughly about

150
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,909
about how big maybe that is so if we

151
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,060
look at the WI here you know we've got

152
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,479
this default cliprect for example and

153
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,639
that default cliprect is gonna tell me

154
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:04,659
the board you know the the entirety of

155
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,009
the screen I believe I could be wrong

156
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,780
about that because I don't really

157
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:12,449
remember how we chose to specify

158
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:16,299
cliprect coordinates so I don't remember

159
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:18,250
exactly what those amount to so what I'm

160
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,650
gonna do at first is I'm just gonna go

161
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,629
ahead and well you know what let's just

162
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:25,799
live dangerously I'm gonna go ahead and

163
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:30,279
try just saying like default cliprect

164
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,000
min X right now and just to see what

165
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,439
that does

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,500
right I don't know what it will do and

167
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:44,379
also don't remember yeah um so I just

168
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,050
want that to see if that would peg me to

169
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:48,668
the left side of screen we should look

170
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,829
at how that's created there to see if

171
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:54,129
that's actually gonna be the case but

172
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:54,879
anyway alright so it looks like that

173
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:57,699
cliprect

174
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,629
is maybe in pixels potentially I'm not

175
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:03,250
sure so because that's still giving us a

176
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:05,889
value of 0 which would not be what I

177
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,589
would expect right so what we need to do

178
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,870
here is we need to have some kind of way

179
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:14,638
of figuring out what we could pass down

180
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,720
here that would actually give us the

181
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,960
that would actually give us the leftmost

182
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,860
border of the screen and in order to do

183
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:26,589
that I think we may we may need to save

184
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,689
right because it doesn't look like we're

185
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,879
saving that information anywhere in

186
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:34,389
maybe it's in the render group I'll take

187
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,399
a look but we need some way of saying

188
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:41,468
like what that pixel position would

189
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:46,419
actually be let me take a look here so

190
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:48,670
inside the render group we've got I mean

191
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:51,629
we could always reverse-engineer it from

192
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:56,439
the game transform certainly

193
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:59,230
but again not really what I would want

194
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,110
to do so I think you know again it just

195
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:06,370
might make more sense to say let's save

196
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:11,200
that data inside the WI for people who

197
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:14,080
want to use it right so looking through

198
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,250
here what I would want to do inside the

199
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,900
WI is I'd want to be able to put some

200
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:24,070
information in here about where those

201
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:25,990
screen corners are and probably the

202
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,030
easiest thing to do would just be like

203
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,169
to put a rectangle in here that are the

204
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:35,019
screen dimensions right like screen

205
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:36,789
space right and inside here we'll just

206
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:41,379
specify what those are going to be so

207
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:44,289
when we create that projection this will

208
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:46,929
be something that lets us position the

209
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:48,250
way what we want so then you know we

210
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:50,649
can't use the clip right because that's

211
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:55,980
an actual pixel space or whatever we can

212
00:09:50,649 --> 00:10:00,840
use this as our you know our roll I mean

213
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:04,779
it's it's really like UI space I guess

214
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,790
might be the way to say it so when I

215
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,370
actually go and make one of these Deb

216
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:11,469
you eyes what I want to do is I want to

217
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,779
save that information at that time

218
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,370
because we know what it is because we're

219
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:19,269
setting up the transform you can see

220
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,610
that right here and so we need to go

221
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:24,879
ahead and create something that's going

222
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:28,300
to have those balanced coordinates there

223
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:31,120
and we need to you know do some reverse

224
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:33,219
engineering to figure out what those

225
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,909
screen coordinates actually mapped to

226
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:40,000
you know what I mean so what I want to

227
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:43,809
do here is I want to set my UI space up

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,539
so that I can set them in and set the

229
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:50,529
max I can do that in a couple different

230
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:53,399
ways I could probably you know maybe the

231
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:59,169
best way to do it is something like this

232
00:10:53,399 --> 00:11:02,429
where we do a center dim because we know

233
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:03,629
that the center is zero zero right and

234
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:08,189
we

235
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:11,429
the width is with so what we want to do

236
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:14,009
at that point is just say well we don't

237
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:18,359
know what the height is but we do know

238
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:21,810
what the screen height we do know like

239
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,720
how big the screen was when we said what

240
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:27,119
the window height was and so if you're

241
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,930
actually doing a transform that's even

242
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,078
the whole way through

243
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:34,469
then you should end up with exactly the

244
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:38,250
right coordinates for this to be you

245
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:43,399
know height not sure what the is it just

246
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,399
is it to be twos or is it for reals yeah

247
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,699
so my assumption would be that this if

248
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,230
this is at the center and that's the

249
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:55,828
total dimensions this should just give

250
00:11:52,230 --> 00:12:00,180
us back the right at UI space you know

251
00:11:55,828 --> 00:12:02,458
famous last words but you know so that

252
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,948
way it'll always be pegged to the center

253
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:08,419
line and then you know this this sort of

254
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:13,379
region of the screen you know I mean uh

255
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:15,659
so yeah like that seems fine to me that

256
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:17,278
would be easy enough to edit so you know

257
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,110
I can pick things over here and then in

258
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:25,438
here I can you know do whatever I want

259
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:28,589
to do seems fine so that's all well and

260
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:32,088
good I now want to do some maybe a

261
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:36,899
little bit of like background in here

262
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:38,819
I'd like to sort of make a backdrop for

263
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,289
this thing and maybe put the title on

264
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:45,479
there so you know like that begins

265
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:49,438
section thing maybe that sort of allows

266
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:56,730
me to draw what this this stuff has here

267
00:12:49,438 --> 00:13:00,299
and maybe that section I'm just you know

268
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:07,649
sort of imagining my head maybe that

269
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:13,289
section piece is also like where I could

270
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:16,109
hide the save and revert so I'm just

271
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:19,658
thinking out loud here you know

272
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:24,939
if I have multiple sections maybe the

273
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:26,769
undo/redo and the save revert stuff you

274
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:29,649
know maybe those things can be can be

275
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:31,720
done that way and that would help put

276
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:33,970
those in a different location you know I

277
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,459
don't know now one of the interesting

278
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,048
things about undo redo right is that you

279
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,788
kind of want those available everywhere

280
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:41,769
so you know if I was looking at this

281
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:43,989
maybe what I would say is you know maybe

282
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:46,328
it looks a little bit more like that

283
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:57,699
and maybe we've got something more like

284
00:13:46,328 --> 00:14:00,278
this going on you know I'm saying

285
00:13:57,698 --> 00:14:03,698
so something where you have to actually

286
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:06,458
manually switch to like another section

287
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:11,639
of the user interface to hit one of

288
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:14,408
those other options might be better I

289
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:18,668
don't know that's just my thinking on it

290
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:22,028
I don't have a strong opinion but you

291
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:24,369
know something like this and so that way

292
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,139
you know the maybe the undo and redo are

293
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:27,759
always there they're in a row by

294
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:32,759
themselves and then you know the set

295
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:37,599
there's like a section that encloses

296
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:42,938
these things and there's a section that

297
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:44,769
encloses the the attach points and your

298
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:47,649
alignment points rather and you're only

299
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:51,428
ever seeing one of those at a time so

300
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:53,259
you can't really hit lever it by

301
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:55,808
accident from something from trying to

302
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:58,028
do undo redo or something save and

303
00:14:55,808 --> 00:15:01,889
revert being close to each other I don't

304
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:01,889
know much about how to fix that

305
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:17,039
I mean the poor man's solution would be

306
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:19,258
like this I suppose I don't know so let

307
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,059
me go ahead and put some tab stuff in

308
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,759
there basically so that we can separate

309
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,948
those two things out and you know that

310
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,009
way you know save and revert would be

311
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:30,389
pretty pretty distant from each other I

312
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:32,180
don't know if that's a good idea or a

313
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:35,278
bad idea but that's just something about

314
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:39,388
so I'm gonna go ahead and try try making

315
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:42,568
two tabs there the begins section and

316
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:44,579
section stuff so the IDs I'm gonna want

317
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:48,479
that same process that we were doing

318
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:50,278
before where we have these like IDs that

319
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,500
tell you what's happening here so we're

320
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:55,708
gonna want you know the dev ID from

321
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:59,578
pointer stuff we're gonna want that and

322
00:15:55,708 --> 00:16:07,559
I think you know in that case this

323
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:09,539
should be fine so making this section

324
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,008
that way I think would be reasonable

325
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,809
because now it would have a thing that

326
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:14,159
lets you you know you can use that to

327
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:16,619
uniquely identify what section you're

328
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:20,490
talking about and the same thing would

329
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:27,448
be true here so we'd have like you know

330
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:31,500
section name equals a line points and

331
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:36,179
here we just do dev ID from pointer

332
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,679
section name section name right and so

333
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:40,318
now we've got this notion that the

334
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,729
sections can actually be selected and so

335
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:44,639
what I want to do is go over to the UI

336
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,970
and say all right let's inside the dev

337
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,669
UI let's have some understanding of

338
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:54,060
which sections are active and which

339
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:58,799
sections aren't now there's an

340
00:16:54,059 --> 00:17:01,948
additional I guess there's sort of an

341
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,419
additional issue here that when you do

342
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:06,990
begin section you're going to have to

343
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:14,509
provide and that is what is the mutual

344
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:14,509
exclusion set for the sections and I

345
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:26,519
think that part is not that hard

346
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:36,119
do the part that's a little harder is

347
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:42,618
the is just figuring out how how you

348
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:42,618
want that picking to go so

349
00:17:54,829 --> 00:18:04,009
I don't really have a particularly solid

350
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:16,700
idea of how I would do that like what I

351
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:20,769
want probably is this I would probably

352
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:28,759
say here's a section picker right and

353
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:34,190
the section picker would the section

354
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:37,278
picker would like itself be a thing so

355
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:39,950
in the editor you would say I've got

356
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:42,950
this section picker that stores which

357
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,048
section is active so I can set it at any

358
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:49,580
time to like just to whatever I want it

359
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:58,339
to be so there'd be like WI section

360
00:18:49,579 --> 00:19:05,210
picker something like that and this

361
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:07,849
would just be yeah something like that

362
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,929
and so when you came through here you'd

363
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:14,269
say well you know here's I want you to

364
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:16,070
let the user pick from some set of

365
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:20,329
sections and I want them to do it right

366
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:25,099
here and that's probably right like its

367
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:26,750
own row but you know we you know we

368
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:31,278
might not even want to be its own row

369
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,990
you know maybe it wants to be something

370
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:34,638
else right look maybe it wants to be at

371
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,649
the end of this row so you got undo and

372
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:38,269
redo and then you've got a picker for

373
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:42,229
what section you're in you know I don't

374
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:43,700
know and so who knows what happens there

375
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,769
but you'd do something like this

376
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,149
and then when you come down to like

377
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:51,798
saying that we're gonna have sections

378
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:53,509
those sections would just be based on

379
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,798
you know they would just occur whether

380
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:58,250
based on whether or not they were

381
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:00,648
selected from from from this so you

382
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,298
would probably say like you know every

383
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:06,439
time you did that you would just say

384
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:08,639
here's here's the section picker that

385
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:14,150
controls whether I'm

386
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:22,710
active or not you know what I mean and

387
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:25,700
you know go from there that that's about

388
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,700
all I can think of

389
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:37,169
seem reasonable now it's a little bit

390
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:39,118
Squinkie because you need some way of

391
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:45,340
remembering what all the options

392
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:48,509
actually were so that's a little bit

393
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:48,509
harder and

394
00:20:54,808 --> 00:21:00,960
I mean the most straightforward way

395
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,379
would just be every time we encounter a

396
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,720
section we link those sections up with

397
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:08,849
the main section that's stored there and

398
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,649
then it knows what all the ones are to

399
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:12,209
pick from but that's a little more

400
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:14,548
stateful than possibly I would like

401
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,749
because you know I don't really want to

402
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:18,628
have to do a lot of heavyweight work

403
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:19,889
there for no reason so I'm trying to

404
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:25,199
think if there's a simpler way to do it

405
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:32,099
there if if you actually had each of

406
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:35,759
these sections wrapped in it's in like a

407
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:43,439
deterministic way you could do some more

408
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:46,999
clever stuff but I don't I don't see

409
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,999
that being really that good

410
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:06,769
so here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna be

411
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:08,539
perhaps a little bit too clever here and

412
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:11,269
I'm gonna try something I have not tried

413
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:14,359
before when doing UI stuff it's really

414
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:16,430
kind of ridiculous but I'm gonna see if

415
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:20,419
it works cuz it's just interesting and I

416
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:23,090
like this exploring new ideas so let's

417
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:26,420
suppose I introduce a notion here called

418
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:30,500
the WI picker just like we said before

419
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:37,730
right and the only thing it stores is

420
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:44,500
the current section IAD so what it says

421
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:51,799
is if I am you know if the users

422
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:56,990
interact with this section then what you

423
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:58,669
get is remember remembers what section

424
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,170
is currently looked at so it makes the

425
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,450
begin section called trivial to

426
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:05,450
implement because we just look at what

427
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:08,660
was the dev ID you're given and what was

428
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,370
the current one and if they're equal you

429
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:15,500
process the section if they're not equal

430
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:19,419
you don't process the section right so

431
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:22,779
that's a pretty straightforward way to

432
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:25,490
implement that operation

433
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:27,920
then what we need is a forwards and

434
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,230
backwards right we need some way of you

435
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,130
being able to select through the

436
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:35,960
different sections for example or to

437
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:41,090
pick from a list you know this that the

438
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:43,880
other thing and so if we want something

439
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:47,000
that does that what we would need to do

440
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,290
is be able to say well you know the user

441
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,609
starts interacting saying they want to

442
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:51,460
go to like the next section or something

443
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:55,579
we don't know what that is

444
00:23:51,460 --> 00:24:00,049
but we would know what that was if we

445
00:23:55,579 --> 00:24:03,019
just introduced one more variable here

446
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:04,940
probably going to the next one is

447
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:05,329
actually pretty easygoing the previous

448
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,380
one

449
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:08,379
[Music]

450
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:23,289
it's slightly harder but again only

451
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:23,289
requires one other variable so I think

452
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:27,308
it's just this

453
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,580
I know it looks weird that you can

454
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:43,920
implement the whole thing with just

455
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:52,769
those two but I think you might be able

456
00:24:43,920 --> 00:25:00,539
to let's take a look at that so at the

457
00:24:52,769 --> 00:25:03,809
outset when we do begin section we need

458
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:11,220
to take whatever the picker was right

459
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:18,240
oops and we need to take whatever our ID

460
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:20,940
is so obviously the result now is

461
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,980
trivial it's just going to take a look

462
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,710
to see whether or not the Pickers

463
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,599
current section ID and the section ID

464
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:32,910
that you're trying to operate on now are

465
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:34,529
the same if they are we're done now we

466
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:37,650
just need to lotta four going forwards

467
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:39,329
and backwards and sections and I think

468
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:43,860
all we have to do to do that is say look

469
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:48,529
if the Pickers current section is

470
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:51,959
invalid then it's just I will just

471
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:54,269
assume it's me so in an uninitialized

472
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,610
scenario we just become whatever the

473
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:58,889
first section is that in the list so if

474
00:25:56,609 --> 00:26:01,969
no one initializes us that's fine we

475
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:08,130
just picked the first section done right

476
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:11,249
if the Pickers current section ID

477
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,249
[Music]

478
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:27,150
equals the Pickers preception IV oh I

479
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:29,069
forgot so I did forget the variable that

480
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:33,330
I said we needed which was if we are

481
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:36,809
trying to move one forwards right so if

482
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:39,299
we're trying to we we need the control

483
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:42,539
variable that says what operation we're

484
00:26:39,299 --> 00:27:07,950
trying to do if we want to go forwards

485
00:26:42,539 --> 00:27:10,440
or backwards right so something like

486
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:13,400
this so then we can actually do

487
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,039
something where we said alright here's

488
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:25,259
here's what we're going to do we could

489
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:29,250
do something like this so we have like

490
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:31,769
the various things that you could do so

491
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:36,980
by default on startup it's going to be

492
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:36,980
this so we could just say hey if picker

493
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:44,369
move equals that well you know what I'm

494
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,359
gonna have one for each of those so

495
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:47,359
let's just do a switch

496
00:27:52,368 --> 00:28:02,009
so if it's an init then I just said it

497
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:04,798
if it's a keep I don't need to do

498
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:10,470
anything if it's a pre I'm trying to go

499
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:16,470
to the previous one and if it's next I'm

500
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:18,319
trying to go to the next one right so if

501
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,659
I'm trying to go to the previous one

502
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:28,710
then all I have to do is say well if I'm

503
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:40,980
the current one oh and by the way any

504
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:42,659
time we do one of these we're done so if

505
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,538
I'm trying to go to if I'm trying to

506
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:47,639
initialize then I just initialize right

507
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:49,429
and I've done if I come to the previous

508
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:54,778
one then what I want to do is say well

509
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:58,559
you know if the current section ID

510
00:28:54,778 --> 00:29:01,319
equals my section ID then I know that

511
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,210
whatever the previous section ID was is

512
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:06,118
actually the one that should be the

513
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:09,329
current section ID right so whoever came

514
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:12,388
in last is the one I want to move to and

515
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:13,408
similarly if in this case I want to go

516
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:19,229
to the next one

517
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:25,289
then if the current section ID I'm sorry

518
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:28,139
if the preception ID equals the current

519
00:29:25,288 --> 00:29:33,118
section ID should should have written

520
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:37,859
this way after all then I know that the

521
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:41,099
previous person was the current section

522
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:43,079
so I need to make the current section be

523
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:50,908
me because I'm the one who comes after

524
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:54,408
them right so I'm pretty sure that's the

525
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:54,409
entire implementation

526
00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:03,769
pretty simple requires two extra

527
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:11,629
variables one is the previous one and

528
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:11,629
one is what you were trying to do I

529
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:20,670
don't know what I think of that but

530
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:25,250
that's that's where we're at we could if

531
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,250
we want to make this even more

532
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:34,769
ridiculous I think we may you know no

533
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:38,039
just looking at it I'm thinking we may

534
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:41,039
not even really need that so if you look

535
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:42,779
at what these are actually doing here we

536
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,180
could have probably made those just be

537
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:46,680
interactions I don't know that I really

538
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,990
want to do that but you could have done

539
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:52,320
that and then this wouldn't be necessary

540
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:55,710
you just look at this oops you just look

541
00:30:52,319 --> 00:31:01,079
at the interaction in question and and

542
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:03,600
you would use that so yeah pretty simple

543
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:05,220
actually I think surprisingly enough if

544
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:09,149
you actually just think it through it's

545
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,460
actually very very basic so I do need

546
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,740
this concept of a section picker though

547
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:18,029
that's like a separate kind of a thing

548
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:21,660
that we've got um but really it's it's

549
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:25,619
sort of in a way not it's it's really

550
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:30,019
like entirely implementable in almost

551
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:36,839
exact same way as this code was you know

552
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:38,910
so we certainly can here just do what

553
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:45,379
was what was the thing called again it's

554
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:45,380
a UI section picker we can just

555
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,470
implement it basically the same way and

556
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:57,619
the difference here would be instead of

557
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,630
doing the Inc or Dec and instead of ever

558
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:03,699
we don't consider these being edits or

559
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:08,809
anything so what we would do here in

560
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:11,808
these cases is we would just say well

561
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:16,639
when we go forwards and backwards for

562
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:19,069
this thing we want to set inside the

563
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,250
picker what the move is that the picker

564
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:24,859
was going to do so in this case it's a

565
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:28,960
primo and in this case it's a next move

566
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:33,859
and off you go now

567
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:38,179
in this setup we need to be able to get

568
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:40,129
the name that we want to print and I

569
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:42,320
think we probably just want that to be

570
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,140
in here that's separate from the

571
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:49,519
implementation of how you pick stuff but

572
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:57,230
we probably just want like current name

573
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:59,900
in there right and so that's pretty

574
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:02,539
simple it just means that anytime you

575
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:08,210
call begin section we just need you to

576
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:20,599
pass that name in here and you know it I

577
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:24,048
guess fine and basically anytime you

578
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:28,219
assign something in here you would want

579
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:33,349
to set the name so anytime the picker

580
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:37,850
current section ID I guess any time

581
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:41,329
result is true then you want the current

582
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:44,750
name of the picker to be equal to the

583
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:47,119
name that's given here right and I you

584
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,190
know what I do I just want to do that I

585
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,808
don't I I don't really like care stars

586
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:56,090
so now that we have a string there I'm

587
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:58,490
just going to use it you know I would

588
00:33:56,089 --> 00:34:02,209
rather have it that way

589
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:06,679
so in here yeah this doesn't actually

590
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:09,730
need a label to text there and we'll

591
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,269
play around this a little bit more but

592
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,699
there we go

593
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:16,849
and I don't know that there's really

594
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:24,439
much else left to do here we just need

595
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:25,369
to be able to create a wrapped version

596
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,550
of that I don't remember what we called

597
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:30,550
that function I guess we called it rap Z

598
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:47,989
so go ahead and looking at what we've

599
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:49,790
got now well that was anticlimactic so

600
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:52,279
what I'd like to do is is go and debug

601
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:54,440
that see why we can't get our left and

602
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,349
the rights going there like when I click

603
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:01,250
on that I wanted it to execute the move

604
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:06,190
there and so you know looking at this

605
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:06,190
here when we do pick our move next I

606
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:16,039
feel like that should have worked

607
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:16,039
[Music]

608
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:40,240
question is why didn't it so hmm the

609
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:48,220
initialization part worked correctly

610
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:51,779
because this got set so that's good when

611
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:54,759
we get a picker move breathe

612
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:58,930
we're looking to see whether the current

613
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,340
section ID equals our section ID and so

614
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:04,029
that's basically saying if this result

615
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:07,210
would be true and if it turns out that

616
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:09,250
it is true then we move to the previous

617
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:11,440
one right which is whatever the last

618
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:15,519
person through this path would have

619
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,929
called and we said to keep that feels

620
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:21,759
like that should have worked so I'm not

621
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:28,199
sure why it didn't I don't know

622
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:33,790
oh because there is no other section I

623
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:36,509
didn't select anything yeah all right so

624
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:36,509
it did work just fine

625
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:45,449
um so that's good and now we can kind of

626
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,849
like keep ourselves from accidentally

627
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:49,799
hitting anything there that might be

628
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:55,529
untoward which is kind of a good thing

629
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,910
right and it allows us to you know make

630
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:59,970
sure that you know we can you can hit

631
00:36:56,909 --> 00:37:03,449
undo and redo anytime we want but we

632
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:09,689
don't have to we don't have to worry too

633
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:11,309
much about accidentally hitting save and

634
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:16,340
then if I want to I can always go back

635
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:16,340
to the HHA and hit save or revert right

636
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:23,639
so that all looks good and so now I

637
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:24,630
think we're just down to the original

638
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:26,819
thing I was saying about just

639
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,920
straight-up beautification so trying to

640
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,990
clean all this up to look nicer and be

641
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,960
aligned and all that stuff right so just

642
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:36,809
basic typography and and CLE like you

643
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,750
know not really serious graphic design

644
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:46,710
of any kind but you know trying to

645
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:50,639
trying to be less disgusting so well you

646
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:52,559
know I don't really know exactly what I

647
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:56,519
want to do there but I mean the first

648
00:37:52,559 --> 00:38:01,500
thing I think I would do is inside the

649
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:05,909
layout a lot of these things when you

650
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:07,619
look at how they're being drawn you know

651
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,809
we're passing in a thickness for the

652
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:13,340
border so there's that there's like a

653
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:19,949
thickness for the border of those right

654
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:22,890
and you know same here I think I might

655
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:27,179
want that to be somewhat parametric so

656
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:31,440
like inside the layout I think maybe

657
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:36,029
here we would actually specify in

658
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:42,329
addition to these things like you know

659
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:45,690
like the border or thickness so there's

660
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:47,429
I don't know what I don't really know

661
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:50,639
what to call that but just like the the

662
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:53,309
box thickness right and so in here we

663
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,909
would just say well whatever the layouts

664
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:58,440
thickness

665
00:38:53,909 --> 00:39:01,798
is that's what we're gonna use and so

666
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,280
when we do like things like these they

667
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:11,960
all get that same thickness in basic

668
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,960
text element and so all of this stuff

669
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:19,680
including these buttons I want to sort

670
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:21,660
of follow that thickness rule so you

671
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:29,759
know this calls action button here and

672
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:32,038
an action button I really just want to I

673
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,530
want these to follow the thicknesses too

674
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:40,260
so like action button and boolean button

675
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:43,530
those both want that that as well I

676
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:51,690
don't really remember

677
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:54,359
to what extent those are used by the

678
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,039
debug system but again I don't care

679
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,308
because the debug system can set its

680
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:02,520
default thickness here to be different

681
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:04,890
as well so when we call a basic text

682
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:07,199
element here again I'm gonna say that

683
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:10,500
that like label should get that

684
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:15,659
thickness too so that all that stuff is

685
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:20,039
more systemic right so that you know

686
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:25,318
that that can all be kind of handled a

687
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:26,880
little bit so when you create one of

688
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:30,329
these dev layouts I'm gonna set it to

689
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:38,338
six by default you know when you when

690
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:40,829
you start a layout and then I'll just be

691
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:42,538
something that would do in terms of

692
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:46,260
giving things a little bit more of a

693
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:47,789
border there so that should happen on

694
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,250
these too now like those should be a

695
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:51,450
little thicker than they were

696
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:56,278
hopefully presumably you know I don't

697
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:58,500
really know so that's fine and then let

698
00:40:56,278 --> 00:41:00,480
me go ahead and look at if that makes

699
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,829
this stuff look a little bit better so

700
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,440
you can kind of see now that that's

701
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:06,750
that's a little bit more a little bit

702
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,068
more readable it's not great yet you

703
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,829
know

704
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:11,869
it's not perfect but it's better than it

705
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:15,259
was which is sort of what we're looking

706
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:21,048
for here cuz least now these things are

707
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:25,009
aligned and so on so the next step there

708
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:40,278
is I want to be able to do a little bit

709
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:41,809
more so I think that one of the problems

710
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:44,059
I'm having is like switching between

711
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:46,759
button and label is bad because I want I

712
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:50,209
want buttons you can't push to still

713
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:53,380
look like buttons so that you know that

714
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:56,028
they would be buttons in the case where

715
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,579
you like undo and redo I want them to

716
00:41:56,028 --> 00:42:02,989
always look like buttons I just want

717
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:04,969
them to have like a more grayed out like

718
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:07,548
you can't click this look but so that it

719
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:09,588
still looks like a button so I would

720
00:42:07,548 --> 00:42:11,989
like to do that I also want again like a

721
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:18,288
backdrop in here so I want this to be

722
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:20,150
like a solid window so that you can't

723
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:22,190
like I accidentally click off this all

724
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,259
the time right and I don't want that

725
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:26,119
like if I miss click here I don't want

726
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:29,088
that to actually for it to think that

727
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:32,449
I'm actually clicking like like to pick

728
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:38,798
like that so I want to change that as

729
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:38,798
well so that seems pretty good

730
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,349
two-parent prep like the way we do

731
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:56,199
boolean buttons that can probably

732
00:42:53,349 --> 00:43:00,730
improve as well there's a lot of stuff

733
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:04,289
to do here so I'm not sure where to

734
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,289
start let me start by

735
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:23,940
so that's an interesting case by the way

736
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:26,370
so there is one bug I just saw with the

737
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,019
way I was handling this so if you are on

738
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:32,039
alignment points and then you click off

739
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:33,929
you can't move to previous or next and

740
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:38,730
the reason for that is because you never

741
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:45,649
see this section so I guess you do need

742
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:58,260
one more thing which is that inside the

743
00:43:45,650 --> 00:44:02,130
picker you need a thing that's like you

744
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:05,450
need some way of saying if we never like

745
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:05,450
if we never saw

746
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:21,239
like if we never see the section that

747
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:23,219
we're supposed to be looking for like if

748
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:24,929
we if the current section goes away we

749
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:28,229
need to reset to a different section

750
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:39,358
yeah and I mean and that's actually

751
00:44:28,228 --> 00:44:53,639
harder so I guess the way I would do

752
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:55,650
that is this way it's a little weird but

753
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:58,679
if you think about it when you call

754
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:01,650
section picker you have the ability here

755
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:04,469
to just say well when I am doing one of

756
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:09,509
these section pick operations I know

757
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:13,798
that I could set current section exists

758
00:45:09,509 --> 00:45:15,719
to false in which case when I go through

759
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:27,389
all the rest it should get set to true

760
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:30,838
by someone else eventually like so and

761
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:36,739
it's a little bit Squinkie but like yeah

762
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:39,838
basically any time anyone is able to set

763
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:42,088
the current thing so if I moved to the

764
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:45,199
previous one here right like I would

765
00:45:42,088 --> 00:45:45,199
need to set it there as well

766
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:57,539
as long as someone sees that then when

767
00:45:55,019 --> 00:46:00,469
we do section picker we can say that the

768
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:03,059
next time around we can just look to see

769
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:08,129
you know if picker current section

770
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:18,559
exists what we can do here is just clear

771
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:18,559
that out oops

772
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:33,680
and if I zero that out then that means

773
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:35,660
that when you have that section get

774
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:39,109
deleted it will automatically clear it

775
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:40,339
right so that way you know I've got the

776
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:43,640
agent say I can't switch because that's

777
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:45,410
the only section at the moment if I

778
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:48,920
switch here you know I can go through

779
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:50,839
those all I want and then the other

780
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,389
thing I can do is now if I click off of

781
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,829
it I should still be able to well that

782
00:46:53,389 --> 00:47:07,489
should done it so I guess it didn't do

783
00:46:54,829 --> 00:47:09,940
that why didn't it do that Oh cuz I set

784
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:09,939
the wrong thing

785
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:21,349
so I think that solves that problem it's

786
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:22,880
a very weird way to implement a section

787
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:25,630
picker I don't don't mind telling you

788
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,700
but sometimes I like to try weird stuff

789
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:31,360
so there you go so now it reverts back

790
00:47:28,699 --> 00:47:31,359
right

791
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:44,359
okay so again button I wanted to be able

792
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:47,960
to have an enabled disabled on button

793
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:50,750
and so what assuming right now is it

794
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,179
does the enable/disable thing Action

795
00:47:50,750 --> 00:48:03,250
Button I don't know who calls action

796
00:47:53,179 --> 00:48:07,159
button exactly but I kind of don't know

797
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:09,679
that I really want it to be calling that

798
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:11,690
anymore so I think that's not going to

799
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,719
get called so I think what I'm gonna do

800
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:18,849
instead is here I'm gonna call basic

801
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:22,639
text element with the interaction and

802
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:34,219
with the the interactions here I think

803
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:36,279
what I might do is say you know if you

804
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:39,559
were gonna execute that execute it and

805
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:42,860
the enabled will set what I want the

806
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:47,210
background color to be and probably also

807
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:56,750
what this color would be so it's really

808
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:59,809
gonna be more like this and then these

809
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:04,460
colors are going to be set accordingly

810
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:10,579
so you know if you have a disabled

811
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:12,800
button it's it's you know why I started

812
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:15,230
editing the wrong case if you have a

813
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:22,610
disabled button then it's going to be

814
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:25,099
like not highlight able and and I guess

815
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:26,990
I'd keep that the bottom

816
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:30,529
it's not gonna be highlight of all and

817
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:33,439
the background color maybe also will dim

818
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:37,340
down somewhat from where it is so it'll

819
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:40,329
be like you know kind of more obvious or

820
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:44,769
you know what know maybe it's just gray

821
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:44,769
right like it's just a gray

822
00:49:46,929 --> 00:50:00,549
thing to indicate that you can't really

823
00:49:49,088 --> 00:50:04,599
click on it you know and that way the

824
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:09,599
enabled part just kind of works and it

825
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:09,599
won't change the button II miss of it

826
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:17,108
right so you can see now very clearly

827
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:22,510
too few buttons when they are available

828
00:50:17,108 --> 00:50:28,719
and unavailable there what happened

829
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:30,970
there that was that which buggy that was

830
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:37,199
weird so it's like the enables was not

831
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:37,199
quite set right or something

832
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:54,140
what's going on we got a we got to take

833
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:58,160
a look at that but either/or so let's

834
00:50:54,139 --> 00:51:04,248
suppose I just leave this as it is

835
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:09,469
and make maybe this look like this again

836
00:51:04,248 --> 00:51:18,078
I'm just kind of guessing here about

837
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:20,409
what would be good yeah that's a little

838
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,410
bit better

839
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:33,619
so like you can see that the undo button

840
00:51:31,728 --> 00:51:36,288
was supposed to light up but it didn't

841
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:39,979
and then when I click on that it still

842
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:42,440
allows me to click for some reason which

843
00:51:39,978 --> 00:51:43,669
I don't want it to do so I don't know if

844
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,979
I think that's because the interaction

845
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:54,798
has to be set to something else so it

846
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:58,248
doesn't actually occur so maybe I do

847
00:51:54,798 --> 00:52:00,768
want to do it this way and just say look

848
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:11,498
if it's not enabled then the interaction

849
00:52:00,768 --> 00:52:11,498
type equals WI interaction something

850
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:40,079
so that still lets me click on an

851
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:42,949
invalid on an invalid one and I don't

852
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,949
understand why

853
00:52:53,670 --> 00:53:00,570
right like I don't understand why that's

854
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,570
letting me do that

855
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:10,909
hmm

856
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:27,690
that's peculiar because if the

857
00:53:24,389 --> 00:53:29,159
interaction is none here then I

858
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:33,450
shouldn't be able to interact with any

859
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:34,679
time I rendered the thing gray you

860
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:36,329
shouldn't be able to click on it because

861
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,739
I'm saying specifically that I don't

862
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:40,858
want there to be any way to interact

863
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:43,529
with it right so it shouldn't allow you

864
00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:47,670
to click because there shouldn't be a

865
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:49,200
type unless we currently just have it so

866
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:51,480
that that type of interaction actually

867
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:55,250
works which would be weird but maybe

868
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,250
that is how we wrote it accidentally

869
00:54:04,028 --> 00:54:09,528
so like yeah in this case I think we

870
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:17,599
want to say is this interaction

871
00:54:09,528 --> 00:54:19,880
I guess that is true like it it does

872
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:35,539
actually create an interaction for a nun

873
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:38,180
but on the other hand it should never it

874
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:48,920
should never have set next to execute

875
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:51,948
though right so I'm still a little

876
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:54,438
confused like I don't really see why

877
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:57,048
that would be happening because it if

878
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:59,358
you set it to none it's not immediate

879
00:54:57,048 --> 00:55:02,239
button so it shouldn't actually do

880
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:05,078
either of those two things like the next

881
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:05,079
to execute part

882
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:15,280
[Music]

883
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,059
what did I knock over Oh I knocked over

884
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,060
the poor little owl

885
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:28,630
very good

886
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:31,179
so that's strange I don't quite get that

887
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:32,289
and I may have to debug back to find out

888
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:34,299
exactly what's going on there

889
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:37,320
not sure I follow I don't follow the

890
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:40,780
logic about why something that's set to

891
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:43,390
dev UI interaction none while that can

892
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:47,980
become the active interaction it should

893
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:55,089
not like produce results because the

894
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:57,460
executing one here you know that that

895
00:55:55,090 --> 00:56:02,620
result value would would never would

896
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:05,889
never come back true so I really don't

897
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:11,170
know what that's about I mean obviously

898
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:18,849
I can fix it here by not actually

899
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:22,420
filling this part in you know and that

900
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:29,409
should prevent it because now it can't

901
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:31,119
identify this one and we'll see if that

902
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:32,589
does do it or not because now I'm not

903
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,769
sure right because I don't follow the

904
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,769
logic

905
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,990
No

906
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:47,940
alright so clearly I just don't

907
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:52,829
understand what's going on here right

908
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:55,019
and so we should go ahead and compile

909
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:59,429
debug mode figure out how it is that

910
00:56:55,019 --> 00:57:04,559
we're able to actually click on a button

911
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:08,460
that itself is not you know should not

912
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:12,739
ever be available let's go ahead and

913
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,740
take a look at why that's happening

914
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:31,619
because I'm stumped so I'm gonna set the

915
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:36,890
debug mode we're gonna run and here we

916
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:41,819
are in edit land I'm gonna go to the

917
00:57:36,889 --> 00:57:46,920
point alignment points if I click on

918
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:50,130
this the undo button is not highlighted

919
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:56,849
so the first thing I want to do is just

920
00:57:50,130 --> 00:58:00,180
find out why so if I go to handmade

921
00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:03,029
in-game editor and I look at undo and

922
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:05,609
redo right what I'm expecting to see

923
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:09,420
here is undo available should be

924
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:10,800
returning true right and it's not so

925
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:14,250
what's the problem

926
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:16,530
if I look at the undo Sentinel it is

927
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:18,900
true that there's nothing on it if I

928
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:21,150
look at the in progress Sentinel there's

929
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:29,220
nothing on that either

930
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:34,910
and so it looks like it looks like that

931
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:34,909
edit got like swallowed up or something

932
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:52,099
so first thing we got to do is debug

933
00:58:43,699 --> 00:58:58,909
we're that way you see here so where is

934
00:58:52,099 --> 00:59:03,859
that so basically here inside this edit

935
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:06,440
a line point call so in here where we go

936
00:59:03,858 --> 00:59:09,710
in here and say match you know we we

937
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:13,159
request this match we say get a create

938
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:18,559
edit in progress right and it goes and

939
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:20,449
it gets it looks for one that matches

940
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,849
the one we asked for and you know if we

941
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:27,919
can't find it it gets it back puts it on

942
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:30,140
the in progress lane and then later on

943
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:35,030
when we're actually doing stuff here if

944
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:37,159
the interaction is over we do a push

945
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:40,220
first here so you know maybe the first

946
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:44,149
thing to ask for is like what's going on

947
00:59:40,219 --> 00:59:47,239
there right like why is that failing and

948
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:50,150
it looks like you know it's getting

949
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:52,159
called let's see what happens in the

950
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,809
situation where we are going to do this

951
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:58,009
that edit we're literally talking about

952
00:59:53,809 --> 01:00:03,190
so I go here and I click on this so that

953
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:03,190
end interaction never got into here I

954
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:12,068
have so so the interaction isn't

955
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:14,539
actually ending when the mouse goes up

956
01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:16,960
it's like this isn't happening or

957
01:00:14,539 --> 01:00:16,960
something

958
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:26,090
right so we must have this wrong

959
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:43,779
like we must have got that we must have

960
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,780
got this wrong

961
01:00:52,099 --> 01:01:04,439
so let me verify that's the case here we

962
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:07,559
are in in edit mode I click I switch we

963
01:01:04,438 --> 01:01:12,028
got there that time so now I'm gonna

964
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:21,798
click on this and we got there this time

965
01:01:12,028 --> 01:01:29,150
as well oh wow ok no I I get it I get it

966
01:01:21,798 --> 01:01:32,099
so because this is one frame behind

967
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:36,719
meaning we will set the thing to execute

968
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:40,278
and then it has to go and execute it it

969
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:45,889
won't have happened yet by the time you

970
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:55,559
get here and that's pretty tricky right

971
01:01:45,889 --> 01:02:01,170
so you will call this one edit late

972
01:01:55,559 --> 01:02:04,400
always oof that's crazy so what you want

973
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:07,108
to do in this case is you want to say on

974
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:14,489
execute like when I actually executed

975
01:02:07,108 --> 01:02:23,179
the thing then I move it and that's kind

976
01:02:14,489 --> 01:02:23,179
of crazy I don't love that

977
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:43,180
so if we wanted to handle that the most

978
01:02:40,269 --> 01:02:47,139
straightforward way we still can

979
01:02:43,179 --> 01:02:50,649
it's just not fabulous but when this

980
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:53,739
happens you do know that it happened

981
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:56,829
right because you're gonna clear that

982
01:02:53,739 --> 01:02:58,149
like you know inside WI right we've got

983
01:02:56,829 --> 01:03:11,170
the thing here where we're like next to

984
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:14,230
execute and it clears that right so

985
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:18,880
after you've done the execute operation

986
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:21,820
you can then you know you know whether

987
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:26,470
you needed to do that that update it's

988
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:29,230
just it's a little crazy so you know in

989
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:35,589
here you would actually do this you

990
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:38,469
wouldn't be doing it this way and really

991
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:43,539
the end interaction part here is really

992
01:03:38,469 --> 01:03:48,608
not doing anything so all you would add

993
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:52,210
is when you call the when you get to the

994
01:03:48,608 --> 01:04:01,179
end of this right when this is done you

995
01:03:52,210 --> 01:04:08,800
would say you know if you would run and

996
01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:11,969
execute right so you and maybe the

997
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,970
better way to put that would be here

998
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:19,349
so if you've run an execute and then

999
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:22,100
you're done with it

1000
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:28,170
then it's a time that you could do this

1001
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:30,329
right so when you come through here

1002
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:31,800
you're gonna do a bunch of things that

1003
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:34,559
you may need to do where you're gonna

1004
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:37,490
like set what you would executors you

1005
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,489
know who knows what

1006
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:58,869
and yeah I don't really love that so the

1007
01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:01,599
alternative to that is to change the way

1008
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:03,010
we're doing the execution a bit instead

1009
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,588
of having an execute we would actually

1010
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:10,470
just put that as something that directly

1011
01:05:05,588 --> 01:05:12,608
does the Edit which is just it's it's

1012
01:05:10,469 --> 01:05:14,319
harder on the rest of the code because

1013
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:15,429
you've got to actually then have a

1014
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,109
switch statement that I was like which

1015
01:05:15,429 --> 01:05:22,029
kind of edit was happening here and so

1016
01:05:17,108 --> 01:05:23,858
on right and then the other way is kind

1017
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:27,940
of nasty it's basically a thing that

1018
01:05:23,858 --> 01:05:35,710
says hey when you are done with a

1019
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:38,710
particular execution pass here then you

1020
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:40,240
need to do this operation and it's not

1021
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:49,000
the end of the world if you want to do

1022
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:51,189
that it looks kinda like in you know it

1023
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,309
would look kind of like this inside here

1024
01:05:51,190 --> 01:06:05,099
we do update and render editor at the

1025
01:05:54,309 --> 01:06:07,659
end of it we would look and say if the

1026
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:09,789
well we would do a couple things first

1027
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:12,879
after we do that pass this would move

1028
01:06:09,789 --> 01:06:16,960
out into here so this the place where

1029
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,660
this actually happens would be here so

1030
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:25,019
it would be that the editor has the

1031
01:06:19,659 --> 01:06:30,039
notion of what's being executed you know

1032
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:33,608
so that we would we would handle in here

1033
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:37,088
and we might actually not have to do the

1034
01:06:33,608 --> 01:06:38,500
next end to that that might not have to

1035
01:06:37,088 --> 01:06:43,420
happen anymore because we're handling it

1036
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:47,829
in this loop so then here what we would

1037
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:51,159
say is well if there was a to execute

1038
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:56,068
and now there isn't then we would do

1039
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:56,068
this so basically here

1040
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:08,349
if we're going from a state of executing

1041
01:07:06,909 --> 01:07:11,049
something to not executing something

1042
01:07:08,349 --> 01:07:16,239
then we're done and we should save all

1043
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:24,160
of the edits that we made right I mean

1044
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:25,449
it's not fabulous you know it's not my

1045
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:30,779
favorite thing I've ever done in the

1046
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:30,779
world but it would work

1047
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:48,640
all right so let's just say we did that

1048
01:07:41,949 --> 01:07:50,489
as dumb as it sounds so the way that

1049
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:53,368
would work is inside the in-game editor

1050
01:07:50,489 --> 01:07:57,578
it would now be the thing that controls

1051
01:07:53,369 --> 01:08:01,809
what is the what execution is occurring

1052
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:04,990
right and so in here when we would be

1053
01:08:01,809 --> 01:08:06,880
setting the UI stuff we wouldn't

1054
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:10,899
actually be setting the UI stuff we'd be

1055
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:19,449
setting the editor stuff and that's all

1056
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:22,270
fine that execution that occurs here we

1057
01:08:19,448 --> 01:08:26,979
then still need the UI system just to

1058
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:28,540
know what is being executed so if we

1059
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:30,579
look through here for the places where

1060
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:33,460
that's happening we would just change it

1061
01:08:30,579 --> 01:08:36,519
so that that's part of the layout and so

1062
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:42,219
when you begin one of these layouts you

1063
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:46,750
would just pass it what you wanted to

1064
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:49,149
execute there and so when the editor

1065
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:50,469
goes to actually draw it stuff and you

1066
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:53,108
make one of these layouts we would say

1067
01:08:50,469 --> 01:08:55,989
oh you know the like the thing you're

1068
01:08:53,109 --> 01:09:05,310
gonna execute is the thing that we tell

1069
01:08:55,988 --> 01:09:08,588
you to execute like I said not fabulous

1070
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:19,929
but that's just how that goes oh and

1071
01:09:08,588 --> 01:09:25,119
that is deadly interaction okay so this

1072
01:09:19,929 --> 01:09:30,219
is probably one of these or do we not

1073
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:34,869
have one of those now we did yeah so

1074
01:09:30,219 --> 01:09:41,939
that's ugly but UI code often is so you

1075
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:44,349
know there's that let's take a look here

1076
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:46,899
so I can still click on things that

1077
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:51,069
aren't actually available there it looks

1078
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:52,298
like you know maybe that's not what's

1079
01:09:51,069 --> 01:09:58,230
happening maybe that's just because I'm

1080
01:09:52,298 --> 01:09:58,229
clicking into empty space so we'll see

1081
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:10,050
but now that that's looking a little

1082
01:10:07,779 --> 01:10:10,050
better

1083
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:24,539
so let me go ahead and play with that a

1084
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,539
little bit more

1085
01:11:11,899 --> 01:11:16,879
so I think that may just be yes so

1086
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:18,649
that's not actually clickable I was

1087
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,600
wrong about that it's just that we don't

1088
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:25,989
protect you from clicking off of the

1089
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:33,260
selection so I think we're we're more

1090
01:11:25,989 --> 01:11:53,869
reasonable now right I think we're in

1091
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:58,310
good shape here okay so I think that's

1092
01:11:53,869 --> 01:12:13,119
all good what I'd like to do now is try

1093
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:17,900
to clean up that hip apron so this is

1094
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:20,989
probably what needs to happen so you

1095
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:23,750
know instead of none in the case of

1096
01:12:20,989 --> 01:12:28,099
something that isn't clickable it would

1097
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:30,079
actually be an op I think is what we

1098
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:33,170
need there so that it knows that it's

1099
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:35,149
not nothing it's it is something that

1100
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:40,279
you could have interacted with but in

1101
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:42,289
this particular case it's the

1102
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:44,179
interaction is to not do anything and to

1103
01:12:42,289 --> 01:12:47,090
prevent you from doing anything as well

1104
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:48,020
right so that you don't accidentally

1105
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:52,430
click off of it

1106
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:56,600
and so you know that's so there we go so

1107
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:59,329
that that's much better right so I think

1108
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:01,700
that's good and now I just want to make

1109
01:12:59,329 --> 01:13:05,479
sure there's an apron that does that

1110
01:13:01,699 --> 01:13:08,389
does that exact thing so that there's

1111
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:17,869
basically like one blanket element that

1112
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:20,320
would that would be the primary element

1113
01:13:17,869 --> 01:13:20,319
there now

1114
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:30,130
I think all I have to do in that case is

1115
01:13:27,349 --> 01:13:35,389
just make like a rectangular element

1116
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:39,769
that if the mouse is inside it it's just

1117
01:13:35,389 --> 01:13:42,288
a nun interactor so like if we look at

1118
01:13:39,769 --> 01:13:47,809
basic text element you can kind of see

1119
01:13:42,288 --> 01:13:52,478
how that's going here and this is the

1120
01:13:47,809 --> 01:14:01,340
code we would use for that I think right

1121
01:13:52,479 --> 01:14:15,530
so I can say in the in-game editor you

1122
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:17,569
know where's that way out so in here you

1123
01:14:15,529 --> 01:14:19,998
know maybe I want to have a thing that

1124
01:14:17,569 --> 01:14:24,429
lets me say you know this layout is

1125
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:27,548
actually a box you know

1126
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:27,548
[Music]

1127
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:53,670
and so what I would do there is pass a

1128
01:14:38,939 --> 01:14:54,408
rectangle like something that looks like

1129
01:14:53,670 --> 01:15:01,020
this

1130
01:14:54,408 --> 01:15:02,609
so inside begin layout you know which

1131
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,110
normally does that you could have

1132
01:15:02,609 --> 01:15:07,049
another version here

1133
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:13,799
that's a utility function that if you

1134
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:18,029
say there's a rectangle now you know

1135
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:21,659
looking at this you want to erect me max

1136
01:15:18,029 --> 01:15:31,939
has to have to actually obey rect min

1137
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:31,939
max so technically it would be this

1138
01:15:39,149 --> 01:15:55,089
right and so this is the box in question

1139
01:15:49,170 --> 01:16:11,230
and when we do this layout we would call

1140
01:15:55,090 --> 01:16:16,900
the normal layout function as well and

1141
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:19,179
the upper left corner would just be

1142
01:16:16,899 --> 01:16:28,179
whatever the boxes min X was and

1143
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:29,860
whatever the box is max Y was and that

1144
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:39,690
should do exactly the same thing but now

1145
01:16:29,859 --> 01:16:41,920
we're passing in the size so now when we

1146
01:16:39,689 --> 01:16:47,949
run this we should get the same result

1147
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:52,840
but we can now include a apron there

1148
01:16:47,949 --> 01:16:57,429
that would prevent it from anyone from

1149
01:16:52,840 --> 01:17:02,319
clicking in that region so yeah so you

1150
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:04,090
know we go in here and like that and I

1151
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:06,099
don't know how big we want that to be

1152
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:08,619
but you know we can sort of look at that

1153
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:15,329
a little bit more later I guess I don't

1154
01:17:08,619 --> 01:17:15,329
know let's see

1155
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:30,039
that's kind of weird

1156
01:17:41,529 --> 01:17:47,059
well maybe we'll do that later so if I

1157
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:48,980
want to draw that box in there then all

1158
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:51,289
I'm going to do is again take a look at

1159
01:17:48,979 --> 01:17:54,759
one of those like you know begin text

1160
01:17:51,289 --> 01:17:57,739
element I'm sorry basic text element and

1161
01:17:54,760 --> 01:18:00,280
the basic text element call is just

1162
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:05,840
doing one of these element rectangle

1163
01:18:00,279 --> 01:18:11,449
operations so if I want to capture one

1164
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:13,670
of those in here I should be able to I

1165
01:18:11,449 --> 01:18:17,119
should be able to do something like this

1166
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:19,579
now when this thing does one of these

1167
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:21,199
and I guess I got to move this down to a

1168
01:18:19,579 --> 01:18:27,439
place where it can actually call some of

1169
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:30,439
this stuff right we don't want to have

1170
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:32,419
to pass a dimension and have it actually

1171
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:34,009
like update the size of things though

1172
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:37,000
it's the only thing like we don't really

1173
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:40,730
want it to do a lot of this stuff

1174
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:44,689
because this is like trying to place

1175
01:18:40,729 --> 01:18:47,449
stuff it's trying to put things into

1176
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:51,349
locations and all these other sorts of

1177
01:18:47,449 --> 01:18:54,250
things why there are so many push recs

1178
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:54,250
here I have no idea

1179
01:19:09,409 --> 01:19:18,189
it's like drawing a black or what wood

1180
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:18,190
is not for

1181
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:41,020
does anyone know what this is supposed

1182
01:19:30,859 --> 01:19:41,019
to do like what is that code

1183
01:19:51,828 --> 01:20:01,308
oh that's four that's four if it's

1184
01:19:56,359 --> 01:20:09,198
sizable I see so that's if you want to

1185
01:20:01,309 --> 01:20:12,020
be able to size it what so it draws the

1186
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:16,899
border around the element okay all right

1187
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:16,900
okay sure I'll give you that

1188
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:26,779
so again just looking at all this stuff

1189
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:32,750
I don't think you know in this case we

1190
01:20:26,779 --> 01:20:36,948
would just do this stuff directly so if

1191
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:39,319
we call begin layout box we're gonna

1192
01:20:36,948 --> 01:20:43,328
automatically set our you eyes next hot

1193
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:43,328
interaction type to be

1194
01:20:55,180 --> 01:21:01,039
if the mouse is inside the rectangle

1195
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:06,409
that we have we're gonna automatically

1196
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:08,630
say that the next interactions type is

1197
01:21:06,409 --> 01:21:10,970
going to be no op because we don't want

1198
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:12,739
anything to happen unless you're

1199
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:17,150
actually over a UI element we want to

1200
01:21:12,739 --> 01:21:20,569
block any click through so we need to

1201
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:22,609
like if the element bounds now and so

1202
01:21:20,569 --> 01:21:25,630
figuring out what the element bounds are

1203
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:29,389
you can see here it does this

1204
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:32,329
calculation which is doing all kinds of

1205
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:39,170
nuts to move it around we already have

1206
01:21:32,329 --> 01:21:47,420
that stuff I think so I believe it's

1207
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:50,659
literally just the box right and then we

1208
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:58,970
would like to draw that area so we would

1209
01:21:50,659 --> 01:22:03,470
like to do a push rect so in here where

1210
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:07,159
we're doing this sort of thing we want

1211
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:13,699
to be able to drop that back behind the

1212
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:15,619
whole thing so would be this and I guess

1213
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:17,689
this doesn't need to happen here so it's

1214
01:22:15,619 --> 01:22:25,099
really just that's the entirety of the

1215
01:22:17,689 --> 01:22:27,679
code I think and this probably should be

1216
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:30,260
a parameter that you can set in case you

1217
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:33,800
want different colors there I'm gonna

1218
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:38,329
say it's just a translucent like you

1219
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:40,050
know dark backdrop and that's all there

1220
01:22:38,329 --> 01:22:43,278
is

1221
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:43,279
[Music]

1222
01:22:49,529 --> 01:22:56,288
let's see what happens here so there we

1223
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:59,409
go it's really interesting what happens

1224
01:22:56,288 --> 01:23:02,018
in this mode it's like the scaling is

1225
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:05,918
off I don't know what's going on there

1226
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:09,939
it's a good question so looking at this

1227
01:23:05,918 --> 01:23:12,849
I would like the area here to be a

1228
01:23:09,939 --> 01:23:14,860
little bit more compressed we'll take a

1229
01:23:12,849 --> 01:23:16,840
look at that in a second

1230
01:23:14,859 --> 01:23:19,779
but otherwise I think we're good so I

1231
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:21,159
would like to a couple things first of

1232
01:23:19,779 --> 01:23:26,139
all this should probably be a little bit

1233
01:23:21,158 --> 01:23:29,708
darker 0.5 is not really was not doing

1234
01:23:26,139 --> 01:23:31,809
it for me there and I would like the

1235
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:34,719
upper corner here to have maybe the

1236
01:23:31,809 --> 01:23:40,449
thickness respected sort of an a

1237
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:42,578
duplicate sense maybe so it's sort of

1238
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:45,698
like something to happen in here I'm not

1239
01:23:42,578 --> 01:23:46,958
sure what the value should be maybe it

1240
01:23:45,698 --> 01:23:49,708
shouldn't be the thickness maybe it

1241
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:53,469
should but I'm just gonna have a border

1242
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:57,538
inset there probably just to make things

1243
01:23:53,469 --> 01:23:57,538
a little bit easier to see

1244
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,690
all right

1245
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:21,310
so it's seems good you can notice I

1246
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:30,400
can't click on anything in here which is

1247
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:33,370
the goal so that seems pretty good what

1248
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:36,099
I will say is the it would be nice maybe

1249
01:24:33,369 --> 01:24:38,500
if this was a little smaller so we might

1250
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:40,870
want to try and condense how this is

1251
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:44,140
being drawn so it doesn't take up so

1252
01:24:40,869 --> 01:24:49,019
much space changing the size and percent

1253
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:52,170
Peas would be probably a good start so

1254
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:52,170
you know

1255
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:35,750
something like that and then this could

1256
01:25:32,779 --> 01:25:45,590
be knocked over a bit right so instead

1257
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:50,960
of zero zero it could be like whatever

1258
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:53,140
the MINIX is you know could be more like

1259
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,140
that

1260
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:29,610
so I think all that's good I might put

1261
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:32,520
the delete here the parent stuff I may

1262
01:26:29,609 --> 01:26:33,719
just make that a toggle this doesn't

1263
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:52,980
really even need to be there so I think

1264
01:26:33,719 --> 01:27:07,469
that label can go away so I'm gonna put

1265
01:26:52,979 --> 01:27:20,129
that here I'm gonna take that out of

1266
01:27:07,469 --> 01:27:21,750
here entirely and this for editable

1267
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:24,109
boolean's I might change the way those

1268
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:24,109
work

1269
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:36,869
what I probably want to do there inside

1270
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:41,359
the WI is I'd like the Edit of a billion

1271
01:27:36,869 --> 01:27:41,359
to not do this

1272
01:27:47,979 --> 01:27:59,229
I think I just want it to be a button

1273
01:27:53,979 --> 01:28:03,599
that has different colors depending on

1274
01:27:59,229 --> 01:28:07,979
the circumstance you know so it's it's

1275
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,980
maybe something more like this

1276
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:33,820
I mean it would be nice to use the

1277
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:35,740
button code so I wonder if maybe I could

1278
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:37,599
just have those B parameters to it

1279
01:28:35,739 --> 01:28:39,909
default parameters to it that you could

1280
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:48,850
specify actually because it would be

1281
01:28:39,909 --> 01:28:53,099
nice if you could just do this right

1282
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:53,100
it's a lot simpler if that's the case

1283
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:13,110
so if I was to call through to this one

1284
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:13,110
and you know I just wanted a different

1285
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:17,549
highlight or something I don't know

1286
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:27,759
don't have a good idea for this one I

1287
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:40,759
mean I guess one thing we could do here

1288
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:43,578
is say you know take take what was going

1289
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:51,070
on and it just merge them together into

1290
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:53,808
a single button piece of text so that

1291
01:29:51,069 --> 01:30:08,509
the way that this is working it's just

1292
01:29:53,809 --> 01:30:09,889
like and I guess we could even have that

1293
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:13,789
be based on the veldt you know the

1294
01:30:09,889 --> 01:30:16,809
person could pass that those in has the

1295
01:30:13,788 --> 01:30:22,448
values to I don't I don't know I'm I'm

1296
01:30:16,809 --> 01:30:22,449
not thinking of anything here sorry

1297
01:30:58,309 --> 01:31:05,949
yeah weird the rest of the stuff go

1298
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,948
though what what did I do

1299
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:16,639
how come none of these came through

1300
01:31:12,469 --> 01:31:25,849
there so was it just because I got rid

1301
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:28,449
of that string like what happened to

1302
01:31:25,849 --> 01:31:28,449
editable type

1303
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:44,909
let's try that

1304
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,960
yeah so that's reasonable

1305
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:20,989
and I might make the color of that

1306
01:32:20,029 --> 01:32:29,149
change too

1307
01:32:20,989 --> 01:32:30,859
I don't know so inside here it would be

1308
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:33,529
nice if if the if it stayed the same

1309
01:32:30,859 --> 01:32:37,549
size so that's a little bit annoying but

1310
01:32:33,529 --> 01:32:43,130
you know I don't like the fact that it

1311
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:48,680
shifts in here when we call button I may

1312
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:54,350
say look you can set the backdrop color

1313
01:32:48,680 --> 01:33:07,010
if you want to and that'll let you set

1314
01:32:54,350 --> 01:33:09,050
this here and for this one here it'll

1315
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:12,500
just if you're disabled it'll always go

1316
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:14,750
to gray for the moment anyway so then

1317
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:16,159
when we do an editable boolean you could

1318
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:21,079
set the background color based on the

1319
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:23,819
value so like at the end of this we can

1320
01:33:21,079 --> 01:33:25,390
say well you know it can be this or this

1321
01:33:23,819 --> 01:33:28,579
[Music]

1322
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:36,590
so maybe we'll do like okay you know

1323
01:33:28,579 --> 01:33:39,289
it's it's it's green if you if you have

1324
01:33:36,590 --> 01:33:41,210
it set and it's red if you haven't or

1325
01:33:39,289 --> 01:33:44,949
something so you kind of know like green

1326
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:44,949
means go red means stop or something

1327
01:33:53,890 --> 01:34:01,060
in both cases I'd want it to be full'

1328
01:33:57,710 --> 01:34:01,060
Alfred don't want to be see-through

1329
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:10,469
I don't know why I keep closing the apt

1330
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:10,469
to ash but I just leave the app running

1331
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:21,550
it does seem like maybe they're a little

1332
01:34:18,698 --> 01:34:26,669
too dark there to like the text I just

1333
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:26,670
mean so yeah it seems like maybe this

1334
01:34:29,429 --> 01:34:33,810
should be more like a seven-five

1335
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:51,989
I do think for the because our our live

1336
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:54,000
code reloading does have that string

1337
01:34:51,989 --> 01:34:59,279
rebasing problem that's kind of annoying

1338
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:01,020
I wonder if we should like just not do

1339
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:30,479
that anymore so when we unload the game

1340
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:31,830
code here because it's just annoying to

1341
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:33,899
have to constantly deal with that so if

1342
01:35:31,829 --> 01:35:36,090
we just never unload the library then we

1343
01:35:33,899 --> 01:35:36,869
wouldn't have that problem and then we

1344
01:35:36,090 --> 01:35:44,220
don't have to worry about it as much

1345
01:35:36,869 --> 01:35:46,649
right all right so it's a little bit

1346
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:49,140
hard to read against that backdrop still

1347
01:35:46,649 --> 01:35:53,059
I think so I kind of want to make maybe

1348
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:59,220
the backdrop be a little bit dimmer so I

1349
01:35:53,060 --> 01:36:03,480
the I'm just kind of looking at the Debu

1350
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:05,340
i code here so like the default maybe on

1351
01:36:03,479 --> 01:36:09,500
this you know it should just be a little

1352
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:13,470
darker so maybe it's you know more like

1353
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:20,270
more like that just not so bright you

1354
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:20,270
know what I mean actually do it

1355
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,719
that doesn't actually seem to be looking

1356
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:19,590
so that doesn't really seem to be doing

1357
01:37:15,939 --> 01:37:19,589
the reload what did I do wrong there

1358
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:41,970
is there a reason why we cannot we

1359
01:37:37,170 --> 01:37:44,100
cannot get code reloading anymore cuz

1360
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:45,990
not freeing the library should still be

1361
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:47,910
fine right like it should be able to

1362
01:37:45,989 --> 01:37:50,429
still do its reload like it normally

1363
01:37:47,909 --> 01:37:52,229
would like it can still go through here

1364
01:37:50,430 --> 01:38:01,310
and reload the file yeah

1365
01:37:52,229 --> 01:38:04,229
oh no it can't

1366
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:07,170
interesting so if we want to be fancier

1367
01:38:04,229 --> 01:38:16,589
there we actually have to move it to

1368
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:19,369
different temples every time that's

1369
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:19,369
interesting

1370
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:48,349
so here where we do this temp game code

1371
01:38:44,988 --> 01:38:51,998
DLL flow path we would actually have to

1372
01:38:48,349 --> 01:38:51,998
have a way of cycling those

1373
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:25,069
yeah so that's definitely trickier and

1374
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:42,460
and so I think what we'd want to do

1375
01:39:40,029 --> 01:39:47,800
there is keep trying to move it to a new

1376
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:50,408
file name until we couldn't anymore but

1377
01:39:47,800 --> 01:40:01,300
I think that's worth doing right so if

1378
01:39:50,408 --> 01:40:04,868
you look at how this works here we would

1379
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:07,840
need some way of like adding to that

1380
01:40:04,868 --> 01:40:10,210
like making that file name be able it's

1381
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:13,179
a sort of increment and go forward so it

1382
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:15,429
can you know go up by one or pick a

1383
01:40:13,179 --> 01:40:17,949
random number that it sticks on the end

1384
01:40:15,429 --> 01:40:21,849
of that right because we want to be able

1385
01:40:17,948 --> 01:40:26,439
to say look if you if the current dll

1386
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:30,849
still in use that's okay we'll just keep

1387
01:40:26,439 --> 01:40:35,948
on using it and copy the newly built dll

1388
01:40:30,849 --> 01:40:38,050
to a new location and run that right so

1389
01:40:35,948 --> 01:40:41,710
if you look at how this is going the cat

1390
01:40:38,050 --> 01:40:43,119
string this part of things here right we

1391
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:46,480
need to be able to stick a number at the

1392
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:50,130
end of that or something it's just some

1393
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:52,328
monotonically increasing thing I and

1394
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:54,639
this I don't know if this has the

1395
01:40:52,328 --> 01:40:57,029
ability to call shares does it let's

1396
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:57,029
find out

1397
01:41:06,039 --> 01:41:14,479
yet does so we could convert this to

1398
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:17,450
using format string now and that would

1399
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:19,069
make this a lot more powerful so we

1400
01:41:17,449 --> 01:41:21,170
could just have an incrementing number

1401
01:41:19,069 --> 01:41:25,609
there and we wouldn't need to use cat

1402
01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:29,510
strings anymore for example right so in

1403
01:41:25,609 --> 01:41:33,429
here where we're calling this we would

1404
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:35,840
just say you know where we've got these

1405
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:37,460
source and stuff and we would get the to

1406
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,730
do desk bounds checking would be done as

1407
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:43,189
well because format strings does that so

1408
01:41:40,729 --> 01:41:46,879
if we were to say look we want a format

1409
01:41:43,189 --> 01:41:48,919
string that's like this and that and we

1410
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:52,489
are then saying that the things that

1411
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:55,779
we're passing are these that's actually

1412
01:41:52,489 --> 01:41:55,779
pretty easy to do

1413
01:42:02,309 --> 01:42:12,179
in fact yeah so like if we just get rid

1414
01:42:07,618 --> 01:42:15,750
of this entirely and then we call format

1415
01:42:12,179 --> 01:42:19,078
string and we say here's the death count

1416
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:22,800
here's the dest we've got two things we

1417
01:42:19,078 --> 01:42:25,198
want you to compat on there a and B and

1418
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:28,079
so here's all we need you to do with

1419
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:43,049
that so the file name part that's just a

1420
01:42:28,078 --> 01:42:45,658
rap Z this other part here is not a rap

1421
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:47,340
Z that's actually something where we

1422
01:42:45,658 --> 01:43:01,198
want to you know do whatever this

1423
01:42:47,340 --> 01:43:02,819
nonsense is right something like this so

1424
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:05,578
then that can concatenate those together

1425
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:09,590
for us and what that means is we should

1426
01:43:05,578 --> 01:43:09,590
be able to what's the question here oh

1427
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:16,520
for crying out loud

1428
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:31,569
so that should work just fine I would

1429
01:43:27,729 --> 01:43:37,500
think and now we have the ability to

1430
01:43:31,569 --> 01:43:46,359
optionally Inc you know tack on a like a

1431
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:48,250
variable there that if we want to have

1432
01:43:46,359 --> 01:43:50,469
something that just keeps trying to move

1433
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:53,229
to another location it just will

1434
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:56,890
it'll get slower as it goes potentially

1435
01:43:53,229 --> 01:44:01,259
but that's okay but we could actually

1436
01:43:56,890 --> 01:44:03,520
keep the you int there so it might not

1437
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:08,579
and so what I think we could do here is

1438
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:13,240
just say alright this situation here

1439
01:44:08,579 --> 01:44:17,050
we're not gonna actually do that the way

1440
01:44:13,239 --> 01:44:19,869
that we were doing it there so instead

1441
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:22,970
you know we're gonna do something like

1442
01:44:19,869 --> 01:44:22,970
[Music]

1443
01:44:23,819 --> 01:44:42,699
we're gonna do something like let's save

1444
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:46,390
this and then what we're gonna do is say

1445
01:44:42,699 --> 01:44:46,989
if unique equals zero we don't print

1446
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:58,470
anything

1447
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:58,469
and if unique equals anything else

1448
01:44:59,170 --> 01:45:13,328
we're gonna call right tack that on I

1449
01:45:04,288 --> 01:45:17,078
mean I think that should be fine

1450
01:45:13,328 --> 01:45:19,779
well you know what though it's not it's

1451
01:45:17,078 --> 01:45:21,399
not that great I guess because file name

1452
01:45:19,779 --> 01:45:27,460
can't be there but that's probably okay

1453
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:32,979
we can probably just do it this way you

1454
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:42,250
and I mean so we're probably okay there

1455
01:45:32,979 --> 01:45:44,198
let me take a look yeah so what we want

1456
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:48,420
to do here is say this temp temp game

1457
01:45:44,198 --> 01:45:52,538
code DLL full path nonsense stuff right

1458
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:54,550
that thing is is uh is not gonna happen

1459
01:45:52,538 --> 01:45:57,389
no more right so that's out of the

1460
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:57,389
that's out of the mix

1461
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:20,829
so this when we go to actually do this

1462
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:22,420
load instead of having the temp DLL name

1463
01:46:20,829 --> 01:46:31,090
come in there it's gonna come in here

1464
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:33,399
and we're gonna need to pass a state in

1465
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:35,230
here that would allow us to actually

1466
01:46:33,399 --> 01:46:40,569
access the stuff we need but otherwise

1467
01:46:35,229 --> 01:46:44,919
this bit of nonsense it's gonna let us

1468
01:46:40,569 --> 01:46:48,519
pass a variable name and then what we're

1469
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:51,159
gonna do is inside here we're gonna keep

1470
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:55,500
trying to copy until we can't copy

1471
01:46:51,159 --> 01:46:58,500
anymore so we're gonna do something like

1472
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:58,500
this

1473
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:25,430
if you load if you're hot reload more

1474
01:47:22,699 --> 01:47:30,279
than ten and twenty four times you're

1475
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:34,039
gonna have to stop you have to restart

1476
01:47:30,279 --> 01:47:41,750
so yeah you go through the temp dll's

1477
01:47:34,039 --> 01:47:46,250
you ask for each one in series if this

1478
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:49,310
succeeds you stop if it fails you Inc

1479
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:52,819
the number so you're just gonna keep

1480
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:58,970
trying like to see if you can actually

1481
01:47:52,819 --> 01:48:02,289
copy the darn file and if you can then

1482
01:47:58,970 --> 01:48:02,289
you're good to go right

1483
01:48:08,829 --> 01:48:17,989
so inside the state wherever that saucy

1484
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:21,409
gentleman is so inside here right we're

1485
01:48:17,989 --> 01:48:25,909
gonna have a thing called temp DLL

1486
01:48:21,409 --> 01:48:29,809
number and then when you do went through

1487
01:48:25,909 --> 01:48:32,119
to build eggsy path filename blah blah

1488
01:48:29,810 --> 01:48:33,410
blah right you're gonna be able to pass

1489
01:48:32,119 --> 01:48:35,479
the unique there and then we're gonna

1490
01:48:33,409 --> 01:48:40,329
have one that's like if you don't want

1491
01:48:35,479 --> 01:48:40,329
to do that then then we just pass zero

1492
01:48:47,859 --> 01:48:54,409
right which will upend nothing so by

1493
01:48:52,699 --> 01:48:55,880
default it just works exactly the way

1494
01:48:54,409 --> 01:48:58,939
that it used to and nothing actually

1495
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:01,670
changes but if you are trying to use it

1496
01:48:58,939 --> 01:49:04,819
with that why is this all messed up okay

1497
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:08,659
there we go then it just works we need

1498
01:49:04,819 --> 01:49:10,069
to pass the win32 state here so because

1499
01:49:08,659 --> 01:49:16,430
that wasn't getting that before but now

1500
01:49:10,069 --> 01:49:18,489
it will have to and so let me go down

1501
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:23,050
and just look here at how that's working

1502
01:49:18,489 --> 01:49:25,639
the global wintered state yet so I

1503
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:27,380
assume the win32 state is actually

1504
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:28,460
cleared by default in fact we're not

1505
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:32,210
going through mr. so yeah it definitely

1506
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:34,340
is um so all we really need to do now is

1507
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:36,800
when we go to call that function it

1508
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:38,529
needs to actually get past the state

1509
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:51,380
information

1510
01:49:38,529 --> 01:49:54,859
I assume that's just state and then

1511
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:57,140
maybe that just works or maybe we delete

1512
01:49:54,859 --> 01:49:59,420
our entire file address file all of our

1513
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:04,460
files and our hard drive crashes who

1514
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:06,260
knows let's take a look so what we would

1515
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:09,140
expect to see now is in the build

1516
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:10,880
directory right here's the pill

1517
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:14,000
directory and all the garbage that's in

1518
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:16,520
there what you can see is there's a

1519
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,840
handmade temp DLL and so now what I

1520
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:19,490
would expect to see is if I make a

1521
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:22,279
change now right like I'm doing the

1522
01:50:19,489 --> 01:50:23,689
editor or whatever like I said and if I

1523
01:50:22,279 --> 01:50:29,689
make a change now to one of these things

1524
01:50:23,689 --> 01:50:32,000
I would expect it to like update and the

1525
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:33,500
handmade DLL will not get over Tammy

1526
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,220
10th Avila will not get overwritten it

1527
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:41,000
will actually just create another one

1528
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:43,220
which has a different number appended to

1529
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:48,579
the end it should be a beginning so it

1530
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:51,380
means like zero one underscore right so

1531
01:50:48,579 --> 01:50:53,869
yeah that's all we're talking about here

1532
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:57,650
so let's see if that actually works so

1533
01:50:53,869 --> 01:50:58,229
inside here like if I want to still tone

1534
01:50:57,649 --> 01:50:59,969
that down

1535
01:50:58,229 --> 01:51:02,729
little bit which I may want to write

1536
01:50:59,970 --> 01:51:06,690
like maybe I changed this to something

1537
01:51:02,729 --> 01:51:09,839
like that I should see that color change

1538
01:51:06,689 --> 01:51:16,399
eventually here hopefully it looks like

1539
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:16,400
it did and and then in here I should see

1540
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:32,119
yep there it is okay

1541
01:51:38,199 --> 01:51:47,470
I all right so I think we've mostly

1542
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:50,920
accomplished everything we wanted and I

1543
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:53,170
think we're good to go

1544
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:55,180
look I think we can now just actually go

1545
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:56,800
focus on implementation stuff I think

1546
01:51:55,180 --> 01:52:00,880
that's as good as I might want to move

1547
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:08,980
the the variably sized one here over to

1548
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:16,739
the over to the end and I also might

1549
01:52:08,979 --> 01:52:16,739
want those edit editable type things I

1550
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:28,090
might want those to sort of be together

1551
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:31,960
right probably maybe so it's more like

1552
01:52:28,090 --> 01:52:36,010
that so I think that's really all I want

1553
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:42,310
to do for other stuff they're like yeah

1554
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:44,530
so that and then that's probably good

1555
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:48,940
enough like you know we don't need

1556
01:52:44,529 --> 01:52:51,420
anything too fancy so probably we're

1557
01:52:48,939 --> 01:52:51,419
good to go here

1558
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:20,010
and maybe that unused will just be add

1559
01:53:24,569 --> 01:53:31,389
yeah like that the other thing is maybe

1560
01:53:29,738 --> 01:53:33,069
in the editor you know this thing

1561
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:34,619
shouldn't be proportional the window

1562
01:53:33,069 --> 01:53:36,849
size maybe it's just a fixed size

1563
01:53:34,619 --> 01:53:40,659
because it kind of is just a fixed size

1564
01:53:36,850 --> 01:53:47,800
sort of thing so you know maybe this is

1565
01:53:40,659 --> 01:53:50,590
like UI space men X plus however many

1566
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:53,860
pixels this thing is right like because

1567
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:55,810
it's not scalable it's just a fixed size

1568
01:53:53,859 --> 01:53:57,909
and it doesn't matter how big the window

1569
01:53:55,810 --> 01:53:59,739
is it has to be that size to fit the

1570
01:53:57,909 --> 01:54:01,899
junk in there that's in there you know

1571
01:53:59,738 --> 01:54:04,659
what I mean

1572
01:54:01,899 --> 01:54:08,789
and so not sure how many pixels that

1573
01:54:04,659 --> 01:54:17,260
should actually be it should probably be

1574
01:54:08,789 --> 01:54:19,119
another looks like 200 maybe but that

1575
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:20,739
make more sense because then it's just

1576
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:24,939
taking up however much space it actually

1577
01:54:20,738 --> 01:54:27,069
needs to fill itself up and then you

1578
01:54:24,939 --> 01:54:30,099
know then you're good to go

1579
01:54:27,069 --> 01:54:32,349
so you select one of these and that's

1580
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:39,850
the correct size there and then you know

1581
01:54:32,350 --> 01:54:42,390
you do that and it's fine right so that

1582
01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:42,390
seems good

1583
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,630
right

1584
01:54:51,069 --> 01:54:55,289
this should really be a little bit

1585
01:54:52,630 --> 01:54:55,289
longer though

1586
01:55:05,128 --> 01:55:09,958
I'm gonna go ahead and call that for now

1587
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:25,230
and we will go to QA

1588
01:55:58,170 --> 01:56:01,779
recently so the QT is not that good what

1589
01:56:00,489 --> 01:56:03,399
you just liked about it pretty much

1590
01:56:01,779 --> 01:56:10,750
everything I mean I don't even know

1591
01:56:03,399 --> 01:56:13,299
where to start if you compare the sort

1592
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:16,239
of the notion of what you would want to

1593
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:19,810
understand in other words I want to make

1594
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:21,819
a user interface right and you know

1595
01:56:19,810 --> 01:56:25,360
you've never used qt before so you're

1596
01:56:21,819 --> 01:56:27,429
you're coming to it and you know the

1597
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:29,829
first thing that you obviously want to

1598
01:56:27,430 --> 01:56:35,560
think about in terms of any API design

1599
01:56:29,829 --> 01:56:38,559
is literally everything the person has

1600
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:44,320
to learn to use the API is wasted time

1601
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:46,240
right because the goal of using QT or

1602
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:49,449
any other UI library for that matter is

1603
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:52,000
not to learn QT QT is worthless as a

1604
01:56:49,449 --> 01:56:54,189
thing of itself it's just a UI that it

1605
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,159
produces that you wanted so any

1606
01:56:54,189 --> 01:56:59,439
information you had to ingest or

1607
01:56:57,159 --> 01:57:03,670
anything that you had to learn to use

1608
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:04,899
that thing is cognitive overhead that

1609
01:57:03,670 --> 01:57:07,989
you could have been spending somewhere

1610
01:57:04,899 --> 01:57:09,339
else so someone comes to a system and

1611
01:57:07,989 --> 01:57:12,760
they're like I want to use this UI

1612
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:15,279
library it's just from the outset the

1613
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:17,110
goal is they know what the user

1614
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:18,699
interface they're trying to make looks

1615
01:57:17,109 --> 01:57:21,460
like like they're like alright I want

1616
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:24,849
you know list box here and I want to put

1617
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:26,170
some stuff in that list box and the

1618
01:57:24,850 --> 01:57:27,520
users going to click on it and whichever

1619
01:57:26,170 --> 01:57:30,190
when they click on there I'm going to

1620
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:31,630
make a box over here that shows you know

1621
01:57:30,189 --> 01:57:34,449
a different UI based on which one they

1622
01:57:31,630 --> 01:57:36,460
clicked on and that they know you know

1623
01:57:34,449 --> 01:57:40,119
they don't have to learn that they know

1624
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:41,859
what what they want it to be and so then

1625
01:57:40,119 --> 01:57:45,819
what you want to look at is what is the

1626
01:57:41,859 --> 01:57:50,889
process through which a a person learns

1627
01:57:45,819 --> 01:57:54,549
how to represent those ideas that they

1628
01:57:50,890 --> 01:57:56,860
have in their head in QT and that is a

1629
01:57:54,550 --> 01:58:00,100
nightmare I mean let me just show give

1630
01:57:56,859 --> 01:58:02,189
you a brief example of what that looks

1631
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:02,190
like

1632
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:10,110
it's been a while since I've looked at

1633
01:58:08,039 --> 01:58:14,819
QT so you'll have to forgive me it takes

1634
01:58:10,109 --> 01:58:20,750
me a while to get you know through the

1635
01:58:14,819 --> 01:58:25,710
various pieces there right but it's like

1636
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:29,760
alright so here's some stuff you know

1637
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:33,060
that's like I don't know let's talk

1638
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:36,690
about a calendar widget so I want to

1639
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:39,360
make a calendar widget here's the

1640
01:58:36,689 --> 01:58:42,769
documentation for the calendar widget as

1641
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:50,369
you saw I just clicked on it here right

1642
01:58:42,770 --> 01:58:53,430
and it's like all right where is all of

1643
01:58:50,369 --> 01:58:55,949
this stuff and what does it mean like

1644
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:59,369
how do I place the calendar widget

1645
01:58:55,949 --> 01:59:01,500
somewhere like I just want to make one

1646
01:58:59,369 --> 01:59:03,539
of these how do I put it somewhere or

1647
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:08,310
put it into a layout or something like

1648
01:59:03,539 --> 01:59:11,880
that right um and what you very quickly

1649
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:13,560
kind of end up seeing is that well

1650
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:15,510
in order to understand how a calendar

1651
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:17,550
widget goes about being placed somewhere

1652
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:19,020
you have to look at like all of the

1653
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:22,020
things that a calendar widget like

1654
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:24,510
inherits from right and so you got to

1655
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:26,940
start like you end up climbing right so

1656
01:59:24,510 --> 01:59:29,760
you're like okay okay okay okay so a

1657
01:59:26,939 --> 01:59:32,039
calendar widget doesn't have anything to

1658
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:34,140
do with like where the thing goes it's

1659
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:38,220
like a queue widget that says where the

1660
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:42,270
thing goes maybe right okay so what are

1661
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:44,579
the things that says how do I know how

1662
01:59:42,270 --> 01:59:52,320
do I place a qwidget somewhere right

1663
01:59:44,579 --> 01:59:55,050
like okay I guess I have to do you know

1664
01:59:52,319 --> 01:59:58,409
move maybe well there's something so

1665
01:59:55,050 --> 02:00:00,360
that that's got a in X&amp;Y in there right

1666
01:59:58,409 --> 02:00:02,970
that seems like a way I could do it so I

1667
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:03,689
guess I call move maybe on my calendar

1668
02:00:02,970 --> 02:00:06,690
widget

1669
02:00:03,689 --> 02:00:10,019
maybe I mean I don't know let's see

1670
02:00:06,689 --> 02:00:14,069
[Music]

1671
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:16,880
move okay it doesn't have any

1672
02:00:14,069 --> 02:00:19,710
documentation for what it does so I

1673
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:23,850
don't know it's a setter function for

1674
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:27,270
the property pause okay does pause say

1675
02:00:23,850 --> 02:00:29,190
where the widget is okay it's the

1676
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:32,370
position of the widget within its parent

1677
02:00:29,189 --> 02:00:35,759
widget so now I have to go well okay so

1678
02:00:32,369 --> 02:00:38,970
what's the parent widget like the parent

1679
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:40,860
widget I didn't set so I guess if I

1680
02:00:38,970 --> 02:00:42,539
create one of these cue widgets I

1681
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:45,809
probably have to put it inside a parent

1682
02:00:42,539 --> 02:00:53,399
widget so maybe I just call set parent

1683
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:57,900
widget or maybe not like I don't know

1684
02:00:53,399 --> 02:01:00,869
right I'm not sure those sorts of things

1685
02:00:57,899 --> 02:01:03,449
are not that hard to figure out right so

1686
02:01:00,869 --> 02:01:05,399
like you know I can stumble through

1687
02:01:03,449 --> 02:01:06,510
those and be like okay I get it right

1688
02:01:05,399 --> 02:01:08,279
like you know I know there's a hierarchy

1689
02:01:06,510 --> 02:01:13,710
here somewhere and it all works out

1690
02:01:08,279 --> 02:01:15,210
right once you start getting into things

1691
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:16,829
that are more complicated than that

1692
02:01:15,210 --> 02:01:19,170
that's not just like things you might

1693
02:01:16,829 --> 02:01:21,809
guess what they are like position this

1694
02:01:19,170 --> 02:01:23,430
structure becomes impenetrable because

1695
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:26,160
then you're like alright I need to know

1696
02:01:23,430 --> 02:01:28,230
what happens when like the person clicks

1697
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:31,380
on that date of you I need to make that

1698
02:01:28,229 --> 02:01:33,059
like do a thing over here so I need this

1699
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:35,039
guy to like respond to that thing that

1700
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:38,510
the other person is doing and you are

1701
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:41,130
just crawling through these docks just

1702
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:42,119
inundated with stuff that has nothing to

1703
02:01:41,130 --> 02:01:44,279
do with anything

1704
02:01:42,119 --> 02:01:47,250
right and you're just crossing your

1705
02:01:44,279 --> 02:01:50,909
fingers that you can find out what the

1706
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:52,800
magic set of crazy like parented things

1707
02:01:50,909 --> 02:01:57,949
inside things that are routed to other

1708
02:01:52,800 --> 02:02:01,770
things can possibly do right

1709
02:01:57,949 --> 02:02:03,179
that's just learning how to use it so

1710
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:05,520
that doesn't have anything to do with

1711
02:02:03,180 --> 02:02:08,130
whether it's good or bad even like as a

1712
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:10,890
library that's just that's your life

1713
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:12,510
from now on is understanding a bunch of

1714
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:13,140
crap that has nothing to do with your

1715
02:02:12,510 --> 02:02:15,960
user interface

1716
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:18,240
it's just implementation details because

1717
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:21,180
these people decided that a calendar

1718
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:24,380
widget was a widget and a dock widget is

1719
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:25,909
a widget and also other things are

1720
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:28,130
widgets and you have to know which ones

1721
02:02:25,908 --> 02:02:30,170
those were and alright and oh and by the

1722
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:31,909
way widgets are objects as well so

1723
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:34,158
sometimes you got to end up in here

1724
02:02:31,908 --> 02:02:36,408
looking at things all that stuff right

1725
02:02:34,158 --> 02:02:38,869
she's still learning a complete mental

1726
02:02:36,408 --> 02:02:40,519
ontology that has nothing to do with

1727
02:02:38,869 --> 02:02:41,779
what you were trying to do you just

1728
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:44,679
wanted to create a calendar widget and

1729
02:02:41,779 --> 02:02:47,090
you didn't care about any of that right

1730
02:02:44,679 --> 02:02:49,489
that's not even starting to talk about

1731
02:02:47,090 --> 02:02:52,219
the quality of qt that's just talking

1732
02:02:49,488 --> 02:02:54,709
about the cognitive overhead that QT

1733
02:02:52,219 --> 02:02:56,810
forces you to learn rather than you just

1734
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:59,630
being able to state what you were trying

1735
02:02:56,810 --> 02:03:09,289
to do um if we go to like something

1736
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:15,560
that's like a tutorial that's a meta

1737
02:03:09,289 --> 02:03:17,329
language let me let me try to open up I

1738
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:19,100
just want to load some sample code so I

1739
02:03:17,329 --> 02:03:22,519
can start talking about why I think it's

1740
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:24,199
bad in general which is to say assuming

1741
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:25,909
you're willing to accept the cognitive

1742
02:03:24,198 --> 02:03:26,839
overhead of a giant class hierarchy that

1743
02:03:25,908 --> 02:03:29,869
means nothing

1744
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:31,789
it's like irrelevant it's just how they

1745
02:03:29,869 --> 02:03:35,710
chose interface it but it's all exposed

1746
02:03:31,789 --> 02:03:35,710
so you have to understand all of that

1747
02:03:49,869 --> 02:04:02,479
let's say here right okay

1748
02:03:57,578 --> 02:04:04,038
so if you want to make a cutie thing

1749
02:04:02,479 --> 02:04:06,019
you're already in the thick of it

1750
02:04:04,038 --> 02:04:08,779
because you're just you're you're always

1751
02:04:06,019 --> 02:04:11,329
inheriting from and using all kinds of

1752
02:04:08,779 --> 02:04:13,399
C++ stuff so if you don't like C++

1753
02:04:11,328 --> 02:04:15,168
forget it right you can't use QT so you

1754
02:04:13,399 --> 02:04:16,339
got to buy into C++ first and assume

1755
02:04:15,168 --> 02:04:17,689
that you want to do that kind of stuff

1756
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:19,189
so your stuffs always gonna look like

1757
02:04:17,689 --> 02:04:21,139
this it's always gonna have a lot of

1758
02:04:19,189 --> 02:04:23,329
like an inherited style stuff happening

1759
02:04:21,139 --> 02:04:25,189
and that's just you know it is what it

1760
02:04:23,328 --> 02:04:29,359
is okay

1761
02:04:25,189 --> 02:04:32,209
so when you actually start using QT you

1762
02:04:29,359 --> 02:04:34,698
know you can see right here how the this

1763
02:04:32,208 --> 02:04:37,429
stuff starts to kind of work out right

1764
02:04:34,698 --> 02:04:39,918
there ends up being all of this garbage

1765
02:04:37,429 --> 02:04:43,248
where you have to constantly connect

1766
02:04:39,918 --> 02:04:44,809
things to other things like nothing in

1767
02:04:43,248 --> 02:04:47,149
it is immediate mode it's all like a

1768
02:04:44,809 --> 02:04:50,269
giant retained graph behind the scenes

1769
02:04:47,149 --> 02:04:52,488
where you have to wire all your crap up

1770
02:04:50,269 --> 02:04:54,679
together and they even have like three

1771
02:04:52,488 --> 02:04:57,109
processors you have to run sometimes to

1772
02:04:54,679 --> 02:04:59,389
make this happen I remember it was like

1773
02:04:57,109 --> 02:05:00,799
really ugly the project that I was on

1774
02:04:59,389 --> 02:05:04,219
that was actually using this stuff it

1775
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:05,958
was super heinous so let's try to get to

1776
02:05:04,219 --> 02:05:10,880
some actual code that actually does

1777
02:05:05,958 --> 02:05:15,859
something here right so you can kind of

1778
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:18,918
see like what is going on here starts to

1779
02:05:15,859 --> 02:05:20,988
get kind of squirrely like all right so

1780
02:05:18,918 --> 02:05:24,618
here's what they're claiming is the end

1781
02:05:20,988 --> 02:05:27,918
of the implementation of save as so I

1782
02:05:24,618 --> 02:05:28,759
create a queue file dialog and I pass it

1783
02:05:27,918 --> 02:05:30,349
myself

1784
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:33,918
which presumably is because we're

1785
02:05:30,349 --> 02:05:36,050
inherited from window right so then I

1786
02:05:33,918 --> 02:05:39,649
say well I'm gonna make this thing

1787
02:05:36,050 --> 02:05:40,969
Moodle I'm going to like I don't know

1788
02:05:39,649 --> 02:05:43,038
what set accept mode does it I have no

1789
02:05:40,969 --> 02:05:44,300
idea I don't remember I'm gonna you know

1790
02:05:43,038 --> 02:05:47,208
set some of the things then I'm gonna

1791
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:49,788
call exec and I'm gonna wait for a

1792
02:05:47,208 --> 02:05:53,918
return value I guess so

1793
02:05:49,788 --> 02:05:53,918
what is happening in here

1794
02:05:56,288 --> 02:06:02,288
what's happening I mean if you're a game

1795
02:06:00,130 --> 02:06:05,078
you've got to be running frames and

1796
02:06:02,288 --> 02:06:07,029
stuff what did what is happening like

1797
02:06:05,078 --> 02:06:09,279
this is actually gonna that's gonna stop

1798
02:06:07,029 --> 02:06:11,288
that's gonna go into their code and

1799
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:16,960
you're gonna be sitting here in the

1800
02:06:11,288 --> 02:06:22,988
middle of a save as loop what you can do

1801
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:27,219
right so now are you gonna make put this

1802
02:06:22,988 --> 02:06:29,768
on a separate thread like I don't know

1803
02:06:27,219 --> 02:06:33,519
right you certainly can't drop through

1804
02:06:29,769 --> 02:06:36,550
so the dialogue exact call you know is

1805
02:06:33,519 --> 02:06:37,719
blocking call basically I don't even

1806
02:06:36,550 --> 02:06:39,940
know what to make of that

1807
02:06:37,719 --> 02:06:41,819
right that's unusable already and we

1808
02:06:39,939 --> 02:06:44,828
haven't even gotten anywhere yet right

1809
02:06:41,819 --> 02:06:47,738
same here I don't know what that's

1810
02:06:44,828 --> 02:06:49,960
supposed to be you've got these weird

1811
02:06:47,738 --> 02:06:52,899
string wrapper things going on here

1812
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:54,760
this is again a blocking modal call your

1813
02:06:52,899 --> 02:06:56,138
app can't be doing anything while that's

1814
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:59,739
happening or you have to create a thread

1815
02:06:56,139 --> 02:07:03,219
right to have that happen then I mean

1816
02:06:59,738 --> 02:07:06,308
like just look at this look at all this

1817
02:07:03,219 --> 02:07:08,710
stuff right all of this kind of stuff

1818
02:07:06,309 --> 02:07:11,288
that's going on tons and tons of typing

1819
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:15,219
that's unnecessary right like what's all

1820
02:07:11,288 --> 02:07:18,670
this like I don't even know this is all

1821
02:07:15,219 --> 02:07:21,670
this code is just to create stuff all of

1822
02:07:18,670 --> 02:07:24,699
that is code that actually is now

1823
02:07:21,670 --> 02:07:26,199
retained so every time you change the

1824
02:07:24,698 --> 02:07:28,000
state of your program you've got to go

1825
02:07:26,198 --> 02:07:30,509
through and all this stuff has to be

1826
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:33,099
stored - right like you have to remember

1827
02:07:30,510 --> 02:07:34,599
what these things were if you ever

1828
02:07:33,099 --> 02:07:37,000
wanted to change them right I've got a

1829
02:07:34,599 --> 02:07:39,099
I've got to be able to get to all this

1830
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:40,809
stuff so it's not like I just have like

1831
02:07:39,099 --> 02:07:42,010
in our code where we just go like one of

1832
02:07:40,809 --> 02:07:44,230
the things that we want to do this frame

1833
02:07:42,010 --> 02:07:46,199
let's do them here you've got a retain

1834
02:07:44,229 --> 02:07:49,328
you know everything you've got to retain

1835
02:07:46,198 --> 02:07:50,888
uh if you're okay with retained mode

1836
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:52,090
then all right so you know looking at

1837
02:07:50,889 --> 02:07:55,210
this thing it's like I read I've got to

1838
02:07:52,090 --> 02:07:57,940
create an icon and maybe that's fine

1839
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:59,710
because you know maybe you know what

1840
02:07:57,939 --> 02:08:03,729
else you gonna do right you got to make

1841
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:05,319
an icon somewhere here I'm not sure what

1842
02:08:03,729 --> 02:08:06,698
the from theme stuff does but it

1843
02:08:05,319 --> 02:08:08,340
probably lets you like remap it or

1844
02:08:06,698 --> 02:08:10,179
something right so that's probably fine

1845
02:08:08,340 --> 02:08:12,550
so you're creating an

1846
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:14,560
come here and the action it looks like

1847
02:08:12,550 --> 02:08:17,320
has you know the string kind of bound

1848
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:20,500
with it and the action is bound on a

1849
02:08:17,319 --> 02:08:23,079
window so like whoever I am that's gonna

1850
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:27,310
presumably feedback through me I guess

1851
02:08:23,079 --> 02:08:30,130
right so now you've got like this sort

1852
02:08:27,310 --> 02:08:31,539
of key sequence stuff presumably you

1853
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:32,859
wouldn't have to do that maybe you do

1854
02:08:31,539 --> 02:08:34,029
have to do that which case that's kind

1855
02:08:32,859 --> 02:08:36,670
of bad but that's alright

1856
02:08:34,029 --> 02:08:38,409
you know load from there and then I'm

1857
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:40,560
gonna like attach you know the tooltip

1858
02:08:38,409 --> 02:08:43,359
to it that I want to display or whatever

1859
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:44,860
I've got this connection again that I

1860
02:08:43,359 --> 02:08:46,479
have to do in order to get this thing to

1861
02:08:44,859 --> 02:08:48,219
come back through me I have no idea

1862
02:08:46,479 --> 02:08:50,219
that's just wasted work there's no

1863
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:52,930
reason for that because you already have

1864
02:08:50,220 --> 02:08:54,909
one of them like you already have you

1865
02:08:52,930 --> 02:08:57,070
already had to create an action so why

1866
02:08:54,909 --> 02:08:58,569
you can't just test to see if the action

1867
02:08:57,069 --> 02:09:01,170
gets called I have no idea so I don't

1868
02:08:58,569 --> 02:09:05,229
even know what the point is of that I

1869
02:09:01,170 --> 02:09:07,630
guess that's to say instead of me having

1870
02:09:05,229 --> 02:09:11,859
an if statement I just want you to call

1871
02:09:07,630 --> 02:09:13,569
this if this happens right and then

1872
02:09:11,859 --> 02:09:15,369
finally you're gonna add them in so

1873
02:09:13,569 --> 02:09:16,539
what's wrong with that like maybe you

1874
02:09:15,369 --> 02:09:18,789
like retained mode you're like that

1875
02:09:16,539 --> 02:09:21,750
looks great it's horrible why because

1876
02:09:18,789 --> 02:09:24,220
every single last thing in here is now

1877
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:28,270
non-responsive nothing here can be

1878
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:31,990
dynamic right if you wanted this tooltip

1879
02:09:28,270 --> 02:09:34,000
to say open existing file only in the

1880
02:09:31,989 --> 02:09:36,099
case where you could open existing file

1881
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,529
and you wanted to say something else

1882
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:42,250
like file is not available or something

1883
02:09:38,529 --> 02:09:44,500
when that wasn't true now again this is

1884
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:46,810
stored state you have to keep in your

1885
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:48,340
program somewhere to reach in and set

1886
02:09:46,810 --> 02:09:50,740
the tool tips all the time and you have

1887
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:53,319
to set them correctly every time rather

1888
02:09:50,739 --> 02:09:55,779
than just you having a code path that

1889
02:09:53,319 --> 02:09:57,639
knows which one to do and it pops up you

1890
02:09:55,779 --> 02:10:00,639
know like this is why immediate mode is

1891
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:02,710
like always my preference for how you

1892
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:04,780
write the user level code for this is

1893
02:10:02,710 --> 02:10:07,569
that way you just have all the knowledge

1894
02:10:04,779 --> 02:10:09,909
already inherent in the path that goes

1895
02:10:07,569 --> 02:10:12,489
through the code you don't have to have

1896
02:10:09,909 --> 02:10:14,349
two separate paths one that creates the

1897
02:10:12,489 --> 02:10:16,869
standing structure and one that updates

1898
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:18,700
it same thing here maybe I want it to

1899
02:10:16,869 --> 02:10:19,779
call open window in some cases and I

1900
02:10:18,699 --> 02:10:22,119
want to call something else in other

1901
02:10:19,779 --> 02:10:24,269
cases in that case this is just dead

1902
02:10:22,119 --> 02:10:26,880
letter right all this is do

1903
02:10:24,270 --> 02:10:29,280
is wasting my time because now I just

1904
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:31,319
have to bind it to a function that is

1905
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:34,649
the function that would then see which

1906
02:10:31,319 --> 02:10:37,409
function I'm going to call right so

1907
02:10:34,649 --> 02:10:40,859
again it's just all of this almost the

1908
02:10:37,409 --> 02:10:43,859
entire thing when you start and you're

1909
02:10:40,859 --> 02:10:46,109
like a basic UI programmer you think

1910
02:10:43,859 --> 02:10:47,789
this maybe looks good because you don't

1911
02:10:46,109 --> 02:10:49,199
think of all the complexity you're

1912
02:10:47,789 --> 02:10:52,439
eventually gonna have in your shipping

1913
02:10:49,199 --> 02:10:54,599
app right but once you do all of these

1914
02:10:52,439 --> 02:10:57,329
things end up being irrelevant you have

1915
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:59,460
to fix them all later and every last

1916
02:10:57,329 --> 02:11:01,680
little one of these things is gonna be

1917
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:03,779
an update synchronization problem but

1918
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:06,390
you're going to have later and that's

1919
02:11:03,779 --> 02:11:09,059
why when you use an app like a QT app or

1920
02:11:06,390 --> 02:11:10,739
a c-sharp app because they follow these

1921
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:11,850
models that's why we get all those weird

1922
02:11:10,738 --> 02:11:13,889
things we're like remember the other day

1923
02:11:11,850 --> 02:11:15,450
we were just using it and the like one

1924
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:17,670
of the menus for the debugger was still

1925
02:11:15,449 --> 02:11:19,710
popped up even after I switched which

1926
02:11:17,670 --> 02:11:21,480
application I was using stuff like that

1927
02:11:19,710 --> 02:11:23,909
you get all the time because they're all

1928
02:11:21,479 --> 02:11:26,218
based on these standing data structures

1929
02:11:23,909 --> 02:11:27,809
that you just hope you wrote the code to

1930
02:11:26,219 --> 02:11:29,579
like update them properly for the

1931
02:11:27,810 --> 02:11:32,160
current state of your app but you never

1932
02:11:29,579 --> 02:11:32,809
do because no one can it's too hard

1933
02:11:32,159 --> 02:11:35,340
right

1934
02:11:32,810 --> 02:11:38,039
there's too many possible state changes

1935
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:40,980
that go in there so let's see if they

1936
02:11:38,039 --> 02:11:42,750
ever get to anything hmm

1937
02:11:40,979 --> 02:11:46,199
more complicated here cuz this is all

1938
02:11:42,750 --> 02:11:48,539
really vanilla basic stuff which any UI

1939
02:11:46,199 --> 02:11:52,139
library can you can do like it's not

1940
02:11:48,539 --> 02:11:54,689
gonna be a good test of whether this

1941
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:58,050
thing works well so let's see if we have

1942
02:11:54,689 --> 02:12:00,479
anything maybe that where they've got

1943
02:11:58,050 --> 02:12:04,619
like a like it like an actual

1944
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:14,039
interrelated user interface stuff that's

1945
02:12:04,619 --> 02:12:15,449
got to happen yeah so like maybe well

1946
02:12:14,039 --> 02:12:17,670
you know let's see how bad drag-and-drop

1947
02:12:15,449 --> 02:12:22,800
is I don't know it's probably not that

1948
02:12:17,670 --> 02:12:24,329
bad how bad could it possibly be that

1949
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:26,570
looks okay I wouldn't complain about

1950
02:12:24,329 --> 02:12:26,569
that

1951
02:12:30,719 --> 02:12:34,408
so let's see here

1952
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:48,840
trying to get down to where they

1953
02:12:46,260 --> 02:12:52,010
actually have this looks like mostly

1954
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:52,010
discussions and the code here

1955
02:13:13,630 --> 02:13:17,940
sort of more what I wanted to get to

1956
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:27,440
I have to page him back all my cutie

1957
02:13:24,118 --> 02:13:27,439
knowledge this is taking a little while

1958
02:13:50,899 --> 02:13:56,329
this is just a ton of code so I maybe

1959
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:58,640
this is a bad thing to look at it may be

1960
02:13:56,329 --> 02:14:00,890
hard for me to like give good examples

1961
02:13:58,640 --> 02:14:02,720
of how its problematic without actually

1962
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:04,850
going through a complex example that

1963
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:06,710
I've already looked at because this is a

1964
02:14:04,850 --> 02:14:07,700
massive amount of code if you look at

1965
02:14:06,710 --> 02:14:09,409
all the stuff that's in here so it's I

1966
02:14:07,699 --> 02:14:12,949
can't really assemble it on my head fast

1967
02:14:09,409 --> 02:14:14,090
enough to give a good example because

1968
02:14:12,949 --> 02:14:16,539
I've never seen this example before

1969
02:14:14,090 --> 02:14:16,539
right

1970
02:14:50,948 --> 02:14:58,729
here's a list of examples okay so let's

1971
02:14:57,139 --> 02:15:07,369
see if we can find something a little

1972
02:14:58,729 --> 02:15:09,649
bit more complicated here let's say we

1973
02:15:07,369 --> 02:15:12,800
want to animate something seems

1974
02:15:09,649 --> 02:15:21,559
reasonable right see what animated tiles

1975
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:24,289
is all right so here's our animated

1976
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:28,639
tiles code let's see what it's actually

1977
02:15:24,289 --> 02:15:30,920
doing so yeah you know we create an

1978
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:35,029
application and it looks like it's

1979
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:48,289
making a bit of graphics there which is

1980
02:15:35,029 --> 02:15:50,029
fine yeah so it looks like I mean I mean

1981
02:15:48,289 --> 02:15:51,109
I don't really want to rag on this too

1982
02:15:50,029 --> 02:15:53,090
much because I don't know how

1983
02:15:51,109 --> 02:15:56,448
high-quality this sample code supposed

1984
02:15:53,090 --> 02:15:59,779
to be but I mean seriously like you're

1985
02:15:56,448 --> 02:16:03,879
passing strings to say what this what

1986
02:15:59,779 --> 02:16:05,960
the values are that you want to have

1987
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:11,840
animated for this thing I mean I guess

1988
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:13,550
that's fine if you really don't care I

1989
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:15,079
mean I suppose it's okay so anyway it's

1990
02:16:13,550 --> 02:16:18,969
you know they're going through here and

1991
02:16:15,079 --> 02:16:21,519
they're creating like what amounts to

1992
02:16:18,969 --> 02:16:24,050
what's items count here in this case

1993
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:28,250
there's 64 of these things

1994
02:16:24,050 --> 02:16:31,310
I guess so they're creating 64 items and

1995
02:16:28,250 --> 02:16:33,940
they're creating points for each of

1996
02:16:31,310 --> 02:16:33,940
those is that right

1997
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:50,139
yeah uh and I mean just look at this

1998
02:16:45,879 --> 02:16:51,309
stuff this is the animation example I

1999
02:16:50,138 --> 02:16:52,479
mean this is how they're saying you

2000
02:16:51,309 --> 02:16:54,549
would animate stuff you know how we

2001
02:16:52,479 --> 02:16:57,399
animate stuff right it's very easy you

2002
02:16:54,549 --> 02:17:00,279
just have a little piece of code that

2003
02:16:57,399 --> 02:17:02,138
just says what the path should be you

2004
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:07,120
don't really have to do anything else

2005
02:17:02,138 --> 02:17:09,189
I mean it's nuts right it's all retained

2006
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:11,500
mode and these things are just horrible

2007
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:13,360
to work with I don't know I mean maybe

2008
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:16,299
people like doing things this way but

2009
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:18,250
it's so unresponsive I mean all of this

2010
02:17:16,299 --> 02:17:20,649
stuff gets created ahead of time it

2011
02:17:18,250 --> 02:17:23,229
can't possibly react to the user because

2012
02:17:20,649 --> 02:17:26,079
in order to react to the user you'd have

2013
02:17:23,229 --> 02:17:28,119
to recreate this entire thing so all it

2014
02:17:26,079 --> 02:17:30,010
can do is just like trigger something

2015
02:17:28,120 --> 02:17:32,440
that's gonna make a big gigantic

2016
02:17:30,010 --> 02:17:34,300
animation right and that animation

2017
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:38,349
cannot ever respond to the user because

2018
02:17:34,299 --> 02:17:39,579
it's been pre described not to mention

2019
02:17:38,349 --> 02:17:41,739
this fact that look at how much of a

2020
02:17:39,579 --> 02:17:45,309
pain in the butt this is to describe I

2021
02:17:41,739 --> 02:17:54,340
mean we're talking about a thing that

2022
02:17:45,309 --> 02:17:56,289
makes that right I mean it's one little

2023
02:17:54,340 --> 02:18:00,149
for I loop an assignment of cosine in it

2024
02:17:56,290 --> 02:18:03,730
and they had to do all of this stuff

2025
02:18:00,149 --> 02:18:06,340
create tons of standing structures they

2026
02:18:03,729 --> 02:18:09,638
had to use the position by making a name

2027
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:11,590
out of the position they had to go

2028
02:18:09,638 --> 02:18:14,138
through and set all these ease curves

2029
02:18:11,590 --> 02:18:16,420
and durations on everything they had to

2030
02:18:14,138 --> 02:18:18,069
add these animations to a group of

2031
02:18:16,420 --> 02:18:19,989
animations they had to create

2032
02:18:18,069 --> 02:18:25,059
transitions between them they had to

2033
02:18:19,989 --> 02:18:27,819
bind those to the buttons I mean and all

2034
02:18:25,059 --> 02:18:29,468
of its non-responsive so if we had done

2035
02:18:27,819 --> 02:18:32,440
this code right this code would have

2036
02:18:29,468 --> 02:18:34,229
just been called straight path so when

2037
02:18:32,440 --> 02:18:37,719
you actually went into it you could

2038
02:18:34,229 --> 02:18:41,468
change every time it was called anything

2039
02:18:37,718 --> 02:18:43,239
that you wanted about it right here

2040
02:18:41,468 --> 02:18:45,819
imagine what's gonna happen if all I

2041
02:18:43,239 --> 02:18:47,799
want to do is have a slider and this is

2042
02:18:45,819 --> 02:18:49,659
probably the most concise way I can say

2043
02:18:47,799 --> 02:18:51,670
yqt sucks this is true about everything

2044
02:18:49,659 --> 02:18:53,989
in it let's say I just want a slider

2045
02:18:51,670 --> 02:18:58,489
that says how big the circle was

2046
02:18:53,989 --> 02:19:01,519
right or you know how how many things

2047
02:18:58,489 --> 02:19:05,510
around the circle there were I would

2048
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:08,090
have to delete all of these and recreate

2049
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:11,389
them again every time you move the

2050
02:19:08,090 --> 02:19:14,120
slider right so it's like all of this

2051
02:19:11,388 --> 02:19:17,509
state including stuff that it's totally

2052
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:20,479
not stateful like this is not state you

2053
02:19:17,510 --> 02:19:22,849
never want this to be state everything

2054
02:19:20,478 --> 02:19:24,138
is state everything's an object and it's

2055
02:19:22,849 --> 02:19:26,659
all going that what if the animation has

2056
02:19:24,138 --> 02:19:28,579
a fit in memory what if I wanted an

2057
02:19:26,659 --> 02:19:31,099
infinite number of those things like I

2058
02:19:28,579 --> 02:19:32,510
wanted it perfectly smooth I don't know

2059
02:19:31,099 --> 02:19:36,200
like it's just it's nuts

2060
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:37,760
and everything's like that so you're

2061
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:40,670
always creating these huge standing

2062
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:42,920
structures they are so unresponsive so

2063
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:45,558
you end up with really brittle UI is

2064
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:50,450
that they can't react to what the users

2065
02:19:45,558 --> 02:19:54,769
doing you know I don't know it's not

2066
02:19:50,450 --> 02:19:56,510
good I would like to provide a more

2067
02:19:54,770 --> 02:19:59,050
complete answer because I could really

2068
02:19:56,510 --> 02:20:01,639
nitpick almost every last decision in QT

2069
02:19:59,049 --> 02:20:04,129
but that would require me to page it all

2070
02:20:01,639 --> 02:20:06,260
back in again right like but it's all

2071
02:20:04,129 --> 02:20:08,659
bad like every last little decision in

2072
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:13,190
here is bad pretty much there's there's

2073
02:20:08,659 --> 02:20:15,440
no good ones in here and you know it

2074
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:17,360
just all flows from the fact that you

2075
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:18,590
just there's a massive cognitive

2076
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:20,690
overhead because there's billions of

2077
02:20:18,590 --> 02:20:23,239
objects most of which don't do anything

2078
02:20:20,690 --> 02:20:28,399
they're just like meaningless sort of

2079
02:20:23,239 --> 02:20:30,530
API glue and you always have to create

2080
02:20:28,399 --> 02:20:33,529
them and string them together to get

2081
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:37,070
anything done which forces you to keep

2082
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:40,159
this massive backlog of Qt crap in sync

2083
02:20:37,069 --> 02:20:43,159
with your own stuff and it's just a huge

2084
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:45,680
nightmare so rather than just something

2085
02:20:43,159 --> 02:20:46,969
in an IM GUI style where you just go oh

2086
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:50,090
what do I need alright just draw this

2087
02:20:46,969 --> 02:20:53,449
right now you're building all of these

2088
02:20:50,090 --> 02:20:56,659
huge structures all the time and it's

2089
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:59,120
just really really onerous and slow for

2090
02:20:56,659 --> 02:21:03,770
coding and in error-prone is the other

2091
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:06,410
thing you know so that's my feeling on

2092
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:07,790
it again I wish I could give you a more

2093
02:21:06,409 --> 02:21:12,139
concise answer a long time so

2094
02:21:07,790 --> 02:21:14,210
used it and so getting down to more

2095
02:21:12,139 --> 02:21:16,149
specific concrete like let me show you

2096
02:21:14,209 --> 02:21:19,099
each thing they should have done and why

2097
02:21:16,149 --> 02:21:22,219
to disentangle it all would be a pretty

2098
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:24,370
big undertaking but trust me you can do

2099
02:21:22,219 --> 02:21:24,369
it

2100
02:21:47,459 --> 02:21:51,089
just made a new version for dump you

2101
02:21:49,350 --> 02:21:54,229
feel free to come back to this after the

2102
02:21:51,090 --> 02:21:54,228
Q&amp;A is ended oh cool

2103
02:21:59,379 --> 02:22:03,139
regarding the cutie slider example so if

2104
02:22:01,610 --> 02:22:04,610
I get this correctly and I'm doing one

2105
02:22:03,139 --> 02:22:06,229
just goes through UI elements and just

2106
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:08,620
draws them depending on whatever the

2107
02:22:06,229 --> 02:22:15,139
slider value says yeah exactly

2108
02:22:08,620 --> 02:22:17,210
so the point with I am doing RM GUI is

2109
02:22:15,139 --> 02:22:18,560
an interface point it has nothing to do

2110
02:22:17,209 --> 02:22:20,329
with whether you store stuff or not so

2111
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:22,430
an iamb GUI can still behind-the-scenes

2112
02:22:20,329 --> 02:22:26,409
store as much garbage as QT if it wanted

2113
02:22:22,430 --> 02:22:26,409
to right you could do that

2114
02:22:26,719 --> 02:22:31,340
the point is really whether or not

2115
02:22:29,420 --> 02:22:33,739
things are represented in code or data

2116
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:35,719
and generally speaking in a UI library

2117
02:22:33,739 --> 02:22:37,699
you want almost nothing represented in

2118
02:22:35,719 --> 02:22:39,649
data on the user side because if the

2119
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:42,920
user wants to represent things as data

2120
02:22:39,649 --> 02:22:47,510
they just can write they don't need you

2121
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:49,190
to do it so for example in a QT library

2122
02:22:47,510 --> 02:22:52,430
I'm just gonna in fact you know what I

2123
02:22:49,190 --> 02:22:54,079
should have started with this in a QT

2124
02:22:52,430 --> 02:22:58,420
library let's say I've got a list view

2125
02:22:54,079 --> 02:22:58,420
and there's stuff in the ListView right

2126
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:07,700
yeah here right so I've got a list view

2127
02:23:05,989 --> 02:23:10,219
and there's just there's things in the

2128
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:14,960
ListView right so the ListView has items

2129
02:23:10,219 --> 02:23:17,840
in it and I need to be able to add items

2130
02:23:14,959 --> 02:23:19,669
how do I add items here this is the

2131
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:21,979
classic QT thing I just want to add an

2132
02:23:19,670 --> 02:23:23,719
item to ListView where where is it of

2133
02:23:21,979 --> 02:23:25,039
course it's not here why would it be on

2134
02:23:23,719 --> 02:23:28,850
the ListView it's probably like you

2135
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:33,440
create an item and parent it to the list

2136
02:23:28,851 --> 02:23:36,670
view or something right yeah of course

2137
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:36,670
there's no add function

2138
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:59,280
here you go alright so here is an

2139
02:23:56,159 --> 02:24:03,659
example of what you have to do with a

2140
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:06,239
ListView right in order to just I just

2141
02:24:03,659 --> 02:24:10,979
want to add stuff to the listing view

2142
02:24:06,239 --> 02:24:12,809
look that's all I want to do this is not

2143
02:24:10,979 --> 02:24:15,500
the C code though I really want the C

2144
02:24:12,809 --> 02:24:15,500
code for it

2145
02:24:27,969 --> 02:24:42,699
here so take a look at this right what

2146
02:24:37,809 --> 02:24:52,359
happens in a program when you want to

2147
02:24:42,700 --> 02:24:54,700
make a list view I guarantee you all of

2148
02:24:52,359 --> 02:24:59,260
those things are represented in your

2149
02:24:54,700 --> 02:25:03,609
program somewhere already right so I've

2150
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:07,590
got all the elements in my game I want

2151
02:25:03,609 --> 02:25:11,850
to put a list view that lists them right

2152
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:15,040
so I already have all of the elements

2153
02:25:11,850 --> 02:25:18,309
now what I have to do if I want to list

2154
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:23,800
them in one of qts Lister's is I have to

2155
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:27,119
create an actual entry for every single

2156
02:25:23,799 --> 02:25:31,238
element in my game inside their list

2157
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:34,859
thing so now I've got two lists of

2158
02:25:31,238 --> 02:25:37,000
entities the one in QT and mine and

2159
02:25:34,859 --> 02:25:39,010
because that's a heavyweight operation

2160
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:43,420
because it's actually recreating a giant

2161
02:25:39,010 --> 02:25:46,079
you know 10,000 entry list thing in QT I

2162
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:48,790
can't do it every frame I'd better do it

2163
02:25:46,079 --> 02:25:51,549
conservatively so now every time I

2164
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:53,710
create an entity in my game I've got to

2165
02:25:51,549 --> 02:25:55,478
add to the QT list and every time I

2166
02:25:53,709 --> 02:25:57,488
delete an anaemic game I gotta delete

2167
02:25:55,478 --> 02:26:00,429
the right member of the QT list that

2168
02:25:57,488 --> 02:26:04,090
means my entities now have to either

2169
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:06,939
store pointers to the QT lists or I have

2170
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:11,109
to store a map that has a mapping

2171
02:26:06,939 --> 02:26:15,370
between the two I mean it's just

2172
02:26:11,109 --> 02:26:17,500
unusable bad right this is just horrible

2173
02:26:15,370 --> 02:26:19,870
design you don't ever want these things

2174
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:22,299
they force you to do all of this work

2175
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:27,489
for no reason all you want to do for a

2176
02:26:22,299 --> 02:26:30,398
list view is say hey look one of two

2177
02:26:27,488 --> 02:26:33,609
things either every frame I'm just gonna

2178
02:26:30,398 --> 02:26:36,189
call you and say here are each of the

2179
02:26:33,609 --> 02:26:39,909
list entries if I don't want to think

2180
02:26:36,189 --> 02:26:41,829
about it right or I just want to make

2181
02:26:39,909 --> 02:26:43,629
one call at the beginning that says

2182
02:26:41,829 --> 02:26:47,139
tell me the range of things you need

2183
02:26:43,629 --> 02:26:50,139
right and then I'll tell you just those

2184
02:26:47,139 --> 02:26:52,840
if it's too many - if there's a billion

2185
02:26:50,139 --> 02:26:57,819
of them right so we're just gonna use a

2186
02:26:52,840 --> 02:27:02,021
subset that's it right I don't want to

2187
02:26:57,819 --> 02:27:03,219
maintain QT widget lists that's

2188
02:27:02,021 --> 02:27:07,090
ridiculous

2189
02:27:03,219 --> 02:27:10,449
right like it's just not good and so

2190
02:27:07,090 --> 02:27:13,389
pretty much universally when when you

2191
02:27:10,450 --> 02:27:15,010
look at something you go oh you know

2192
02:27:13,389 --> 02:27:16,209
someone might think QT is good because

2193
02:27:15,010 --> 02:27:17,590
they look and they say oh look I can

2194
02:27:16,209 --> 02:27:19,299
just add things to list you and then

2195
02:27:17,590 --> 02:27:20,680
they show up they don't realize how much

2196
02:27:19,299 --> 02:27:22,539
of a pain in the butt it's gonna be once

2197
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:24,790
they're in an actual application that

2198
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:27,280
has all of its own state and is trying

2199
02:27:24,790 --> 02:27:29,440
to expose that state through the user

2200
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:31,720
interface it just completely falls apart

2201
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:34,390
and you end up doing like tons and tons

2202
02:27:31,719 --> 02:27:38,709
of work to micromanage the UI to get to

2203
02:27:34,389 --> 02:27:42,520
do anything reasonable you know it's

2204
02:27:38,709 --> 02:27:47,709
just bad so yeah I can't stand that

2205
02:27:42,521 --> 02:27:49,300
stuff regretting keeping audio-video

2206
02:27:47,709 --> 02:27:50,229
synced Wendy when you did the order

2207
02:27:49,299 --> 02:27:52,179
system you were very strict about

2208
02:27:50,229 --> 02:27:53,289
playing without losing one frame that

2209
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:54,399
was before you move to OpenGL and now

2210
02:27:53,290 --> 02:27:55,720
there's latency between when we're

2211
02:27:54,399 --> 02:27:57,459
issuing a frame until it's actually

2212
02:27:55,719 --> 02:27:59,139
rendered how are we gonna keep them in

2213
02:27:57,459 --> 02:28:00,310
sync I guess for Emily here something

2214
02:27:59,139 --> 02:28:03,369
huge deal but I'm curious area opinion

2215
02:28:00,310 --> 02:28:06,729
about how to keep in sync so actually

2216
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:09,760
you can't really keep them in sync on PC

2217
02:28:06,729 --> 02:28:11,920
as far as I know that was true even

2218
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:13,600
before we switch to OpenGL so the thing

2219
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:16,870
you have to remember is when we were

2220
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:21,069
using Windows before when we were just

2221
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:23,079
using it to display our bitmaps it still

2222
02:28:21,069 --> 02:28:26,829
goes through a compositor which can

2223
02:28:23,079 --> 02:28:29,289
still which still delays your

2224
02:28:26,829 --> 02:28:32,469
presentation so we weren't getting an

2225
02:28:29,290 --> 02:28:37,000
immediate display necessarily we were

2226
02:28:32,469 --> 02:28:40,510
just trying to limit the number of we

2227
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:43,299
were basically trying not to add any

2228
02:28:40,510 --> 02:28:45,190
additional frames of latency to the ones

2229
02:28:43,299 --> 02:28:48,489
that were already there so that hasn't

2230
02:28:45,190 --> 02:28:51,120
changed it's basically the same if you

2231
02:28:48,489 --> 02:28:54,699
want to try and get sync to be perfect I

2232
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:55,311
I don't think Windows really ever added

2233
02:28:54,700 --> 02:28:57,409
anyway

2234
02:28:55,310 --> 02:28:59,479
for you to do it I just don't think it's

2235
02:28:57,409 --> 02:29:03,229
possible I could be wrong about that but

2236
02:28:59,479 --> 02:29:07,939
I think it's not my recollection is that

2237
02:29:03,229 --> 02:29:14,239
on macaws it is possible so for example

2238
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:18,461
on on macaws I believe you can ask for

2239
02:29:14,239 --> 02:29:21,739
two timers one is like where we are

2240
02:29:18,460 --> 02:29:24,949
where when I submit this audio where

2241
02:29:21,739 --> 02:29:29,390
will it be played and the other is when

2242
02:29:24,950 --> 02:29:31,280
will the next frame be flipped to be

2243
02:29:29,390 --> 02:29:35,681
viewed on the monitor and you can

2244
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:35,681
actually try to line those up properly

2245
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:46,340
how that helps

2246
02:30:02,918 --> 02:30:06,199
thanks for the Lister example that made

2247
02:30:04,998 --> 02:30:07,488
it pretty clear where do you think it

2248
02:30:06,199 --> 02:30:09,078
comes from that people build those

2249
02:30:07,488 --> 02:30:11,118
reverse CBI's that don't give you much

2250
02:30:09,078 --> 02:30:13,549
less well yeah um it's because what they

2251
02:30:11,119 --> 02:30:18,199
do is they've just made the UI system

2252
02:30:13,549 --> 02:30:20,599
and then they just make you program the

2253
02:30:18,199 --> 02:30:22,158
actual stuff right so if you think about

2254
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:24,709
what someone's it's time to make a UI

2255
02:30:22,158 --> 02:30:27,228
library what they do is they go okay so

2256
02:30:24,709 --> 02:30:29,088
I need a ListView so obviously I need to

2257
02:30:27,228 --> 02:30:31,998
remember what each thing in the ListView

2258
02:30:29,088 --> 02:30:33,978
is so that's what I made and then I'm

2259
02:30:31,998 --> 02:30:36,619
like what's the API to that ok the API

2260
02:30:33,978 --> 02:30:38,208
to that is here user you tell me anytime

2261
02:30:36,619 --> 02:30:41,838
you want to make one of those things in

2262
02:30:38,209 --> 02:30:43,999
ListView right so that's the mentality

2263
02:30:41,838 --> 02:30:46,398
is like let me just completely expose

2264
02:30:43,998 --> 02:30:49,128
whatever I wrote internally as the API

2265
02:30:46,398 --> 02:30:51,648
and now you've got to do it QT APIs be

2266
02:30:49,129 --> 02:30:53,510
egregiously bad because because the

2267
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:55,818
programmers were heavy c++ audit

2268
02:30:53,510 --> 02:30:57,559
oriented style programmers you also get

2269
02:30:55,818 --> 02:30:58,788
all that class larga stuff that was how

2270
02:30:57,559 --> 02:31:01,068
they chose to do it internally as well

2271
02:30:58,789 --> 02:31:03,498
right so you get all that shoveled on

2272
02:31:01,068 --> 02:31:04,939
you as well but even people who don't do

2273
02:31:03,498 --> 02:31:06,199
that stuff they still have that problem

2274
02:31:04,939 --> 02:31:08,119
because they don't think about what

2275
02:31:06,199 --> 02:31:09,739
should the API actually look like to

2276
02:31:08,119 --> 02:31:11,748
this thing right like what would the

2277
02:31:09,738 --> 02:31:14,658
user actually want to say they probably

2278
02:31:11,748 --> 02:31:16,668
don't want to have to micromanage all of

2279
02:31:14,658 --> 02:31:19,338
my state they probably need some better

2280
02:31:16,668 --> 02:31:20,748
tools for just articulating to me what

2281
02:31:19,338 --> 02:31:22,818
the parts of the state are that they

2282
02:31:20,748 --> 02:31:24,588
care about at this particular time and I

2283
02:31:22,818 --> 02:31:26,930
should be responsible for doing the rest

2284
02:31:24,588 --> 02:31:30,379
of the work necessary to make all this

2285
02:31:26,930 --> 02:31:33,498
stuff work out right and so that's

2286
02:31:30,379 --> 02:31:35,300
really the the design mentality problem

2287
02:31:33,498 --> 02:31:38,539
and so most UI libraries have this

2288
02:31:35,299 --> 02:31:41,568
problem because they don't realize that

2289
02:31:38,539 --> 02:31:42,979
an api to the UI library shouldn't just

2290
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:47,118
be about you having to micromanage

2291
02:31:42,978 --> 02:31:50,019
everything the UI library does which is

2292
02:31:47,119 --> 02:31:50,020
what they usually are

2293
02:31:53,770 --> 02:31:57,140
if we're 10 minutes to bed why have an

2294
02:31:55,879 --> 02:31:58,609
immediate green sticker over the desktop

2295
02:31:57,139 --> 02:32:01,578
mobile market yet um so I think they

2296
02:31:58,609 --> 02:32:03,229
actually have I'm pretty sure I am

2297
02:32:01,578 --> 02:32:05,509
gooeys are actually now almost

2298
02:32:03,228 --> 02:32:07,788
everything and the reason for that is

2299
02:32:05,509 --> 02:32:10,520
because at some point and I don't know

2300
02:32:07,789 --> 02:32:13,129
why the web community got the I am GUI

2301
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:14,930
bug and so now my understanding is like

2302
02:32:13,129 --> 02:32:17,029
all that stuff like react je s like all

2303
02:32:14,930 --> 02:32:20,959
that stuff is I am now or at least

2304
02:32:17,029 --> 02:32:24,020
partially I am QT is not a common

2305
02:32:20,959 --> 02:32:27,619
application layer to use for most at

2306
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:29,930
most things you know that 99% of the

2307
02:32:27,619 --> 02:32:33,799
things people use today are not Qt right

2308
02:32:29,930 --> 02:32:47,748
and they're not retained mode either so

2309
02:32:33,799 --> 02:32:49,549
basically like these all of these things

2310
02:32:47,748 --> 02:32:51,738
these like JavaScript stuff like that's

2311
02:32:49,549 --> 02:32:55,520
all immediate mode they they went that

2312
02:32:51,738 --> 02:32:57,738
way so the answer is they have nobody

2313
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:59,629
who ever uses an IM GUI will ever go

2314
02:32:57,738 --> 02:33:01,850
back to using an RM GUI right it's like

2315
02:32:59,629 --> 02:33:05,509
it's horrible to go the other direction

2316
02:33:01,850 --> 02:33:08,029
so once communities get understand how

2317
02:33:05,509 --> 02:33:09,799
to do those interfaces they will that's

2318
02:33:08,029 --> 02:33:14,238
just a given

2319
02:33:09,799 --> 02:33:17,329
does that help and it has nothing to do

2320
02:33:14,238 --> 02:33:19,788
with whether you're a game or anything

2321
02:33:17,328 --> 02:33:20,719
else every UI should be responsive you

2322
02:33:19,789 --> 02:33:22,369
know it should be recipients should

2323
02:33:20,719 --> 02:33:25,028
respond to changing conditions as fast

2324
02:33:22,369 --> 02:33:25,029
as possible

2325
02:33:31,521 --> 02:33:35,581
so you have an array of some struct type

2326
02:33:33,931 --> 02:33:36,961
and each item has a name which is what

2327
02:33:35,581 --> 02:33:39,121
you want to represent as an item in the

2328
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:41,100
list for the end user to choose from

2329
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:43,109
would be a good idea to hand the UI some

2330
02:33:41,101 --> 02:33:44,641
pointer to the first name and specify

2331
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:47,190
some stride to the next or how would you

2332
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:48,931
do it it doesn't really matter usually

2333
02:33:47,190 --> 02:33:51,569
because you eyes don't normally display

2334
02:33:48,931 --> 02:33:53,971
enough things at once to hat care about

2335
02:33:51,569 --> 02:33:56,161
the push through so typically all you

2336
02:33:53,970 --> 02:33:58,081
really need is some way of windowing

2337
02:33:56,161 --> 02:34:00,511
what needs to get articulated on a

2338
02:33:58,081 --> 02:34:02,610
particular frame and then you can

2339
02:34:00,511 --> 02:34:08,551
usually just make a call per and it's

2340
02:34:02,610 --> 02:34:10,081
fine this is why websites are slow they

2341
02:34:08,550 --> 02:34:11,609
are trying to impose the I'm be a

2342
02:34:10,081 --> 02:34:13,649
paradigm to retain style and suffer with

2343
02:34:11,610 --> 02:34:14,671
performance let the compare data graphs

2344
02:34:13,649 --> 02:34:17,069
and find difference as an implied

2345
02:34:14,671 --> 02:34:19,860
changes to retain model yeah it's

2346
02:34:17,069 --> 02:34:21,421
definitely the case that if the web had

2347
02:34:19,860 --> 02:34:22,951
just been immediate mode to begin with

2348
02:34:21,421 --> 02:34:24,630
you would have had a lot better

2349
02:34:22,950 --> 02:34:26,430
performance I don't actually think

2350
02:34:24,630 --> 02:34:28,411
that's why websites are slow though

2351
02:34:26,431 --> 02:34:32,251
websites are slow for a lot of other

2352
02:34:28,411 --> 02:34:34,050
reasons and you know data graph

2353
02:34:32,251 --> 02:34:37,890
comparisons are probably not they don't

2354
02:34:34,050 --> 02:34:39,450
help but they're probably not the main

2355
02:34:37,890 --> 02:34:40,710
reason if you fixed that you probably

2356
02:34:39,450 --> 02:34:42,120
would still be pretty slow because

2357
02:34:40,710 --> 02:34:44,729
there's a lot of bad stuff going on

2358
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:47,280
there right

2359
02:34:44,729 --> 02:34:49,439
and by the way 0lp p.m. i'm not giving

2360
02:34:47,281 --> 02:34:51,001
these as good examples I'm just saying

2361
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:54,601
you were asking why people didn't change

2362
02:34:51,001 --> 02:34:56,041
to it they did everyone did nobody

2363
02:34:54,601 --> 02:34:56,761
thinks are I'm doing is good anymore as

2364
02:34:56,040 --> 02:34:59,100
far as I know

2365
02:34:56,761 --> 02:35:01,110
I'd like that days over the question is

2366
02:34:59,101 --> 02:35:03,360
just how the IM GUI stuff should work

2367
02:35:01,110 --> 02:35:05,431
and which ones are good because you can

2368
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:08,521
still make a very bad I am GUI right

2369
02:35:05,431 --> 02:35:10,890
it's not hard to make a bad API even if

2370
02:35:08,521 --> 02:35:16,671
the paradigm you pick is better it's

2371
02:35:10,890 --> 02:35:16,671
still bad right does that make sense

2372
02:35:18,968 --> 02:35:28,628
so I was in no way trying to just react

2373
02:35:22,338 --> 02:35:28,629
this is good I've never used it so

2374
02:35:34,828 --> 02:35:41,538
we do think annotation based programming

2375
02:35:37,078 --> 02:35:41,538
I don't think I know what that is

2376
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:13,680
I don't know what I'm looking at here

2377
02:36:12,329 --> 02:36:18,840
all you have to deal with is a single

2378
02:36:13,681 --> 02:36:20,550
job or a profession I guess what I would

2379
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:24,200
say is I don't know what this is so I

2380
02:36:20,549 --> 02:36:24,199
can't give an opinion about it

2381
02:36:30,799 --> 02:36:36,989
it doesn't I'd have to look at it more

2382
02:36:35,670 --> 02:36:39,299
carefully but it doesn't look like

2383
02:36:36,989 --> 02:36:43,140
actually a thing it just looks like

2384
02:36:39,299 --> 02:36:46,619
regular programming it just looks like

2385
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:48,329
programming I mean just because you

2386
02:36:46,620 --> 02:36:49,771
chose to call something annotation

2387
02:36:48,329 --> 02:36:51,601
doesn't change the fact that it's still

2388
02:36:49,771 --> 02:36:54,090
just programming it looks like you added

2389
02:36:51,601 --> 02:36:56,880
some stuff to your programming language

2390
02:36:54,090 --> 02:36:58,409
that just is now changing the

2391
02:36:56,879 --> 02:37:00,979
programming language isn't it is there

2392
02:36:58,409 --> 02:37:00,979
something else

2393
02:37:10,779 --> 02:37:14,270
all right anyway I'm gonna wrap it up

2394
02:37:12,828 --> 02:37:15,318
sorry I wish I could give a better

2395
02:37:14,270 --> 02:37:18,430
answer for the annotation a friends that

2396
02:37:15,318 --> 02:37:30,109
I don't really know what that is

2397
02:37:18,430 --> 02:37:31,729
so dr. gesture profiling huge websites

2398
02:37:30,109 --> 02:37:33,260
it's pretty common to see 100 500 most

2399
02:37:31,728 --> 02:37:35,358
like I've spent on things like relay

2400
02:37:33,260 --> 02:37:37,219
adding or recalc you see s cells or just

2401
02:37:35,359 --> 02:37:40,520
purely inside the JavaScript

2402
02:37:37,219 --> 02:37:42,349
I made a purely dear I am gooey WebGL

2403
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:43,670
web Bazin website it takes 0.5

2404
02:37:42,350 --> 02:37:54,439
milliseconds per frame to compute the

2405
02:37:43,670 --> 02:37:57,379
layout that's cool yeah I mean like I

2406
02:37:54,439 --> 02:37:59,449
said it I don't know I mean it's totally

2407
02:37:57,379 --> 02:38:01,879
possible that some websites are that way

2408
02:37:59,449 --> 02:38:05,658
other like I said I it's just there's a

2409
02:38:01,879 --> 02:38:08,929
lot of slow stuff on the web so you know

2410
02:38:05,658 --> 02:38:10,430
I'm sure some of it is that fact but I

2411
02:38:08,930 --> 02:38:14,510
think depending on the website you're

2412
02:38:10,430 --> 02:38:16,578
gonna have more or less of that it's all

2413
02:38:14,510 --> 02:38:18,020
I can say right like some websites are

2414
02:38:16,578 --> 02:38:20,270
gonna have a lot of that some websites

2415
02:38:18,020 --> 02:38:22,970
aren't some of it you know may have

2416
02:38:20,270 --> 02:38:25,789
nothing to do with the act of doing that

2417
02:38:22,969 --> 02:38:27,709
comparison and just the fact that

2418
02:38:25,789 --> 02:38:29,569
JavaScript itself is not very well

2419
02:38:27,709 --> 02:38:31,549
optimized for certain things and just

2420
02:38:29,568 --> 02:38:35,269
just the act of running the code is bad

2421
02:38:31,549 --> 02:38:37,340
you know because the codes written

2422
02:38:35,270 --> 02:38:38,869
poorly and that sort of stuff so it's

2423
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:40,728
just it's really hard to say I have no

2424
02:38:38,869 --> 02:38:43,430
idea but I don't doubt it right like in

2425
02:38:40,728 --> 02:38:45,198
the words I'm not saying that it's

2426
02:38:43,430 --> 02:38:47,119
probably not a problem I'm just saying

2427
02:38:45,199 --> 02:38:50,600
that it's it's probably one of many

2428
02:38:47,119 --> 02:38:52,100
problems you know I mean like some

2429
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:53,510
websites you fix that and maybe that

2430
02:38:52,100 --> 02:38:56,180
fixes the whole thing other websites

2431
02:38:53,510 --> 02:38:57,289
it's probably like like you could fix

2432
02:38:56,180 --> 02:39:00,430
that and then you still have ten other

2433
02:38:57,289 --> 02:39:00,430
things you gotta fix you know

2434
02:39:02,630 --> 02:39:15,411
I like the idea of that WebGL thing

2435
02:39:05,540 --> 02:39:18,649
though all right I'm gonna wrap it up

2436
02:39:15,411 --> 02:39:20,781
like it's just it's it's fun - I am GUI

2437
02:39:18,649 --> 02:39:23,171
WebGL is that's just cool like I like

2438
02:39:20,781 --> 02:39:23,171
that idea

2439
02:39:39,290 --> 02:39:45,140
please make a neutral nice people need

2440
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:48,559
to buy some games for Linux it's really

2441
02:39:45,139 --> 02:39:50,358
up to people to make that happen because

2442
02:39:48,559 --> 02:39:53,209
there's tons of people shipping games on

2443
02:39:50,359 --> 02:39:55,640
Linux like a lot of people tried and it

2444
02:39:53,209 --> 02:39:59,318
just doesn't catch on you know what I

2445
02:39:55,639 --> 02:40:02,568
mean it's it's a it's a social problem

2446
02:39:59,318 --> 02:40:04,340
not a development problem because people

2447
02:40:02,568 --> 02:40:09,019
tried like a lot of people ship games

2448
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:10,909
which then you can get a lot of games I

2449
02:40:09,020 --> 02:40:12,529
think it's not a big market you don't

2450
02:40:10,909 --> 02:40:16,850
it's not even worth the amount of time

2451
02:40:12,529 --> 02:40:18,859
it takes you to port usually and so it's

2452
02:40:16,850 --> 02:40:22,068
just there isn't enough of a market

2453
02:40:18,859 --> 02:40:24,229
there and the problem is probably that

2454
02:40:22,068 --> 02:40:25,340
like you know when you're talking about

2455
02:40:24,228 --> 02:40:26,358
market where you need to get a hundred

2456
02:40:25,340 --> 02:40:29,059
thousand people together to buy

2457
02:40:26,359 --> 02:40:33,290
something there just aren't that many

2458
02:40:29,059 --> 02:40:35,119
people buying games on Linux to create

2459
02:40:33,290 --> 02:40:39,350
those numbers for one individual game

2460
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:42,880
you know that seems to be the the main

2461
02:40:39,350 --> 02:40:45,140
problem and I don't know how you fix it

2462
02:40:42,879 --> 02:40:47,898
but if you could fix it that would be

2463
02:40:45,139 --> 02:40:50,599
pretty awesome because having Linux be

2464
02:40:47,898 --> 02:40:53,840
I've oftentimes I hoped I was hoping a

2465
02:40:50,600 --> 02:40:55,670
lot when the steam machines came when

2466
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:57,978
when CMOS was gonna be a thing I was

2467
02:40:55,670 --> 02:40:59,389
hoping that was gonna convince people to

2468
02:40:57,978 --> 02:41:04,849
do it it didn't really end up being a

2469
02:40:59,389 --> 02:41:06,889
thing but you know like I said tons of

2470
02:41:04,850 --> 02:41:09,170
games around Linux now it has not

2471
02:41:06,889 --> 02:41:11,629
created the market so it's not a lack of

2472
02:41:09,170 --> 02:41:15,529
games at the moment it's it's that

2473
02:41:11,629 --> 02:41:17,539
people aren't buying them and you know

2474
02:41:15,529 --> 02:41:19,370
it's not that no one's buying them some

2475
02:41:17,540 --> 02:41:21,319
people are but just not enough to create

2476
02:41:19,370 --> 02:41:25,189
a market that's that's really the only

2477
02:41:21,318 --> 02:41:27,049
problem and so that's why people just

2478
02:41:25,189 --> 02:41:28,520
don't consider it a priority so in

2479
02:41:27,049 --> 02:41:32,599
general what ends up happening is people

2480
02:41:28,520 --> 02:41:35,000
usually just like go to SDL and ship

2481
02:41:32,600 --> 02:41:36,229
that and don't really support it and i

2482
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:38,950
think that's mostly what you're gonna

2483
02:41:36,228 --> 02:41:41,778
end up seeing on linux right it's just

2484
02:41:38,950 --> 02:41:44,620
it's just not a primary platform it's

2485
02:41:41,779 --> 02:41:47,810
not gonna be till someone makes that

2486
02:41:44,620 --> 02:41:50,660
makes that happen socially it's entirely

2487
02:41:47,809 --> 02:41:53,029
social all you would have to do is get

2488
02:41:50,659 --> 02:41:55,640
those numbers up the first time someone

2489
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:59,570
a hundred thousand copies of an indie

2490
02:41:55,640 --> 02:42:01,340
game on Linux everyone will make Linux

2491
02:41:59,569 --> 02:42:03,610
the main platform like all you need is

2492
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:09,530
an example that the market is there

2493
02:42:03,610 --> 02:42:10,761
right and I don't know how you make that

2494
02:42:09,530 --> 02:42:13,971
happen but if you can make that happen

2495
02:42:10,761 --> 02:42:18,021
you just make that will be heard right

2496
02:42:13,970 --> 02:42:19,279
like you know you it's just a social

2497
02:42:18,021 --> 02:42:20,630
problem it's just a social problem

2498
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:22,190
convincing people to use it it's

2499
02:42:20,629 --> 02:42:24,379
obviously not a money problem because

2500
02:42:22,190 --> 02:42:25,761
Linux is free it is sometimes a

2501
02:42:24,379 --> 02:42:27,229
compatibility problem because Linux

2502
02:42:25,761 --> 02:42:29,120
doesn't always work so well on people's

2503
02:42:27,229 --> 02:42:33,699
computers laptops are a big problem on

2504
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:36,681
linux desktops usually are better right

2505
02:42:33,700 --> 02:42:38,150
so there there are some issues there too

2506
02:42:36,681 --> 02:42:39,440
but you know mostly it's a social

2507
02:42:38,149 --> 02:42:41,979
problem can you convince people can you

2508
02:42:39,440 --> 02:42:46,221
convince gamers to actually run Linux

2509
02:42:41,979 --> 02:42:48,850
and you know I don't know I don't know

2510
02:42:46,220 --> 02:42:51,590
how you do that but if you can do that

2511
02:42:48,851 --> 02:42:55,120
you'll you'll be a big hero if you can

2512
02:42:51,590 --> 02:42:55,120
do that right

2513
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:10,670
