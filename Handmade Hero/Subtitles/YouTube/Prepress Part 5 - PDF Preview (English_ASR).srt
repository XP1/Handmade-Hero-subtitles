1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,169
let me say one more thing before we

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,599
leave pre-press so one thing that can

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:11,820
really really screw you up and it

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,429
definitely screwed us up until I figured

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,710
it out

6
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:19,710
is when you are actually going to build

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,810
your release PDFs so the actual thing

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,689
you will be handing to the printer so

9
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,948
final your final pre-press your I don't

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,339
know what you want to call that but the

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,109
actual one PDFs that you're gonna call

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:36,149
you're gonna say to the printer okay go

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:39,120
like run the presses with these trying

14
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,379
to preview those PDFs and PDFs is

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,058
usually how the printer wants them cuz

16
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:45,808
got all the pages in order so there's no

17
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,099
like weirdness there right we had a

18
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:48,299
bunch of problems where we'd preview

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,239
them it looked all wrong and all this

20
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:54,269
stuff you have to make sure that you use

21
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:57,599
a PDF reader that understands embedded

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,980
color profiles and this is actually

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,058
harder than you might think

24
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:07,140
to find here is an example of sumatra

25
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:12,420
version 3.1 - which is only like a few

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,368
months old it's not very old if we were

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,799
to look this is actually now the

28
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:19,409
infinite right here so if i were to open

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,880
up meow the infinite in that and i don't

30
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,070
even know if I actually can but I'm

31
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:27,478
gonna try and see if Sumatra can

32
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:29,789
actually open it no you can't so

33
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:33,179
nevermind it's too big for it so let me

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,909
just use a test PDF then so if we were

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,259
to load a test PDF in it what is this

36
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:43,799
thing well this test PDF is a PDF that

37
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:47,989
was designed specifically for figuring

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:51,810
out whether your PDF reader is embedded

39
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:55,319
profile compliant so what it does is it

40
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,570
embeds several color profiles in two

41
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,319
different parts of an image and you

42
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:04,228
expect to see this right and if you see

43
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,029
something like this you know that your

44
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:08,068
system doesn't actually support that

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,348
right so it's kind of just an easy way

46
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,109
of testing it I wish I had had this PDF

47
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:14,689
when we started I would

48
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,210
have wasted a day try to figure out what

49
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:18,079
the heck was wrong I just didn't think

50
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:23,570
of it for some reason

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:26,860
so even recent very recent PDF viewers

52
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:30,560
may just screw up color profiling and

53
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:34,040
this is how you know what you want to

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,569
see is sumatra 3.2 this is the very

55
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,310
latest version the one that was after

56
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:40,370
three points so only the very latest

57
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,069
version this is what you want to see and

58
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,560
as you can see now we get the correct

59
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:49,189
image so we know it's actually listening

60
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,860
to those color profiles they also happen

61
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:54,709
to fix the fact that they can load large

62
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,209
pdfs now so it can actually load you

63
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,700
know the infinite so here is our color

64
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,520
pre-press file but unfortunately i can't

65
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:04,488
actually show you it in the old one but

66
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,989
if i was to be able to load it up what

67
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,270
you would see is that a lot of this

68
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,980
stuff like this looks great right it all

69
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,200
looks really good it would look really

70
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:14,209
pretty ugly like when you go especially

71
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,339
to some areas where the blue liked alt

72
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,959
like this right here that green would

73
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,909
all be messed up there's there's like

74
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,650
all kinds of stuff that will just look

75
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:27,139
absolutely horrid if you are not using a

76
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,530
viewer that understands how to take an

77
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:35,419
ICC color profile for CMYK and action

78
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:37,879
sway it properly so just be aware that

79
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:39,889
is something you want to make sure you

80
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,000
don't screw up I think that literally

81
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,129
did cost me a bag cuz that's like

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,139
thought I was building the PDF wrong and

83
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:50,959
you know you never really know what's

84
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:51,409
going wrong so caveat that keep that in

85
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,289
mind

86
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:56,989
make sure you have like a test PDF like

87
00:03:54,289 --> 00:04:00,798
this color profile test you can search

88
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,810
for that online as well if you don't

89
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,819
have one but just get one of those

90
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,890
that's sort of like canary in a coal

91
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:10,189
mine kind of a situation that'll tell

92
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,509
you if your previz process is busted

93
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,319
because otherwise you'll waste a bunch

94
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:13,819
of time trying to figure out why our

95
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,229
colors are wrong and it turns out it's

96
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,798
because the program doesn't know how to

97
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,798
do it right
