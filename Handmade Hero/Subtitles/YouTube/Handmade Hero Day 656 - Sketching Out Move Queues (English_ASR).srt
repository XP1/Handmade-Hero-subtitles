1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,318
all right hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,679
handmade hero show where we code a

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,559
complete game live on stream and we need

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,599
to

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:15,599
uh you know move things around

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,519
it's basically what's going on here um

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,600
we are sort of in like a little bit of

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:24,800
an interim area uh the code is

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,359
you know pretty playable right now for

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,320
engine feature stuff but we just need to

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,000
like

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,679
put in the sorts of things that i don't

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,439
normally do uh like you know

14
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,439
combat and those sorts of things these

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,759
are usually someone else's job

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,280
and not really something i'm

17
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,479
particularly

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,520
you know

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,959
well versed in so i don't have much in

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,359
the way of opinions about it but as you

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,878
can see right now um what we did on the

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,039
last stream is we sort of cleaned up a

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,558
little bit of how we're gonna

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
handle this stuff

25
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:59,759
and we

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,599
we made the gloves

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,000
because they used to be

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,118
um like things like the glove and also

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,719
uh like this this thing out here you can

30
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:12,719
see um there's like this skull thing

31
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,920
those were like floating creatures so

32
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,920
there were hopping creatures and

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
floating creatures and like the floating

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
creatures

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,200
were like the glove and the skull the

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,400
big skull uh and then there was this

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,159
little like skeleton thing here that we

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,000
had that hopped around and the hero

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,320
those were hopping creatures

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,040
and hopping creatures like move by a

41
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,798
transaction like base movement so they

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
basically query a square to see if they

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,479
can move into it and if they can they

44
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,039
will move into it and if they can't they

45
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,519
won't so it's it's like a very like

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,520
it's it's sort of almost turn-based it's

47
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,679
it's not turn-based

48
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,239
because it's happening in real time but

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,560
it has the same sort of semantics as if

50
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,959
you were just taking turns

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,840
uh at the frame level but it's it's

52
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,759
basically that right

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,840
um and we sort of didn't really have a

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,478
plan for what we wanted to do

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,079
uh you know what i mean we we

56
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,719
we didn't really know

57
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,919
oh sorry i forgot about the audio maybe

58
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,919
that's what we were gonna do today

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,400
oh yes i can't hear that i'm sorry i

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
tortured you

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
um

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,159
we were gonna move the audio to a

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,640
separate thread that's what we were

64
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,439
gonna do today

65
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,359
should we do that

66
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,039
i'm gonna do the movement first uh let's

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
do that let's do that next week i'm

68
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,519
gonna turn let me just turn off the

69
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,479
sound for you there

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,719
um

71
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,719
and uh and that way i won't i won't

72
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,560
torture you with that

73
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,878
so uh

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,959
there's two things that are happening

75
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,719
there and i guess i don't know exactly

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,400
how we would want to turn them off but

77
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,560
uh probably the easiest thing to do

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,719
would be to just not bother updating the

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,519
sample buffer

80
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,878
right

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,200
um so you know like the

82
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,719
the output playing sounds thing i should

83
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,799
probably put on a headphone so i can

84
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,759
make sure i don't torture you guys with

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,560
this

86
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,560
hold on a second

87
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,640
um

88
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,560
let me just see what happens here if we

89
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,639
just when we do the output playing

90
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,920
sounds thing we just don't actually

91
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,359
bother

92
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,798
so

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,040
output playing sounds

94
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,040
is

95
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,039
this code right here

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,719
gets called from here

97
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,039
uh and i just don't know can i do this

98
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,280
if the thing is i i may have to clear

99
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,840
the buffer because it may be garbage

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,360
right

101
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,519
um and so we'll hear what happens if it

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,519
is

103
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,399
nope

104
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,798
so that's an easy way right uh to just

105
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,719
if zero around that and

106
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,239
um you know one of the things i've done

107
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,239
recently that i kind of liked

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,878
um is i introduced a thing that's like

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,840
capital temporary like that

110
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,598
um and what i do is i'll do like if zero

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,200
and then you do temporary so that you

112
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,959
know that you didn't mean to do that

113
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,319
permanently it's just kind of a nice

114
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
thing

115
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,478
and you can put that on anything if you

116
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,240
just go into

117
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,000
like the place where you have the rest

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,600
of your stuff like your assert macro or

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,199
whatever like wherever you have your

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,520
sort of things that you do um you can

121
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,360
define like temporary as nothing

122
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,719
and then you can just put temporary in

123
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,879
places and if you then search for it

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,479
um you can find all the places where

125
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,000
it's used this is not a case sensitive

126
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,279
search here in fort cotter i don't think

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,120
so that's why you get a couple other

128
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,359
things but basically you get the idea

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
right

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,400
uh so i kind of liked that i probably

131
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,120
should have used that for a long time i

132
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,758
just

133
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,759
never really did for some reason um

134
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,000
but

135
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,279
it is something that i kind of liked

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
so yeah i don't know if i don't really

137
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,198
want to move the mixer today i don't

138
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,560
think that's what i wanted to do

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,879
that is what we sort of said we're going

140
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,199
to do last week but i think i'm like nah

141
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,000
nah i'm not going to do that today

142
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,720
um so what i wanted to do is i wanted to

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,038
just get some of the movement stuff

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,720
working better with like how these

145
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,719
entities are gonna move around

146
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,239
right now moving the hero actually feels

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
fine

148
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,478
um

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,879
you kind of just hold down the key

150
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,478
um till you get where you're going and

151
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,159
then you let go

152
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,240
and it feels fine

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,479
so i don't really think we need to do

154
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,840
much with hopping like we'll probably

155
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,680
clean up the code that does it

156
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,279
because we're kind of working on that

157
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,038
system now and we we probably want

158
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,478
things to be a little cleaner

159
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,560
for our own

160
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,318
uh purposes right

161
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,759
and we want to do a trailing edge

162
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
triggers of things like hopping so for

163
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,199
example the the

164
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,879
these lighting up before you land on

165
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,560
them right that's because the

166
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,079
transactional movement system currently

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,800
fires that event

168
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,680
when you start the hop right to take a

169
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,680
square

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,639
rather than afterward does this make

171
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,400
sense

172
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,879
um

173
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,000
so we really don't want uh to do stuff

174
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,319
like that so we want to clean up that

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,639
code a little bit but in terms of how it

176
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,400
feels right now it actually feels fine

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,759
it feels totally fine to use like i feel

178
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,159
like i could play it like this maybe it

179
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,160
needs some tuning um once i actually

180
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,160
start to do like combat maybe i'll feel

181
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
some issues there that i'm like i

182
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,919
probably should clean up this or that

183
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,400
but at the moment it feels pretty

184
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,839
reasonable to use so

185
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,439
really what we're talking about is like

186
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,719
things like the glove

187
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,439
so for starters i need a way to move the

188
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,280
glove around with the hero as the hero

189
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,759
hops around

190
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,918
and just make it you know like i want

191
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,919
the glove to basically just follow

192
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,918
wherever the hero is

193
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,918
um

194
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,879
it should just be locked basically like

195
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,759
i want it to feel more like an action

196
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,839
game

197
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,598
i didn't like the physics-y feel of it

198
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,519
before i was like yes this is kind of

199
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,918
interesting but not quite what i was

200
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,079
going for so what i'd like to do is i'd

201
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:21,680
like to have the glove be like right

202
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:25,038
next to the hero right uh at all times

203
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,360
and then i want to have it so that if i

204
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,560
when i actually do like a attack which

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,400
is like what i'm doing now

206
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,879
the glove kind of sweeps out a

207
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,638
prescribed pattern i guess

208
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,719
and you know maybe like

209
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,560
the me one of the things i had sort of

210
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,400
toyed with on the last stream is maybe

211
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,399
that pattern is sort of like

212
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,160
dependent on what glove you're using

213
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,720
like maybe some of them just go out one

214
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,199
square like a simple little punch like a

215
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,840
jab but then others maybe do like a

216
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,840
sweep like a pattern

217
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,839
um

218
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:19,038
you know so like the glove is basically

219
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:20,878
sweeping out like patterns on the tiles

220
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,719
um

221
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,720
and different gloves have different

222
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,720
patterns

223
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,319
you know

224
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,799
like if you think about it

225
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,839
like suppose that the gloves

226
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
just have

227
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,839
like some stats right

228
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,279
and the stats are like how fast like how

229
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,720
much damage does it do when it hits

230
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,559
things

231
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,800
how fast

232
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,159
does it go

233
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,120
right

234
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,799
um

235
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,360
and

236
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,399
and which set of squares does it go

237
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,399
through and you know

238
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,600
um

239
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,600
the other thing you could do is say

240
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,639
that's per square

241
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,480
so like

242
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,000
when we do

243
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,440
you know like i don't know i'm just

244
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,799
sketching this out here i'm not a game

245
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,080
designer this is not my freaking job man

246
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,838
somebody else should have to figure this

247
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
out uh

248
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,560
not me

249
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,919
so

250
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,359
yeah like engine programmers are not

251
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,000
supposed to have to be responsible for

252
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,839
this stuff so you know

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,278
someone else should have to do this

254
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,120
but the point is

255
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,320
so suppose the entity

256
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,399
right it's

257
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,800
like i kind of had this this idea last

258
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,120
time i think i called did a like a move

259
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,079
queue right

260
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,639
and

261
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,200
the idea behind the move queue was just

262
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:06,399
that you would stack up some things in

263
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,600
here so like for example if you were

264
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,720
going to

265
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,920
go ahead and

266
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,800
uh

267
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,000
do a a punch it would like add in the

268
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,958
punch

269
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,440
uh

270
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,679
squares that th that glove whatever that

271
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,959
gloves sort of move pattern is it would

272
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,439
add them in

273
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,199
and then it will trace those out

274
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
and that's just a given like that's it's

275
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,839
like you're it's it's sort of

276
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,240
it's a little bit dark soulsy although

277
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,920
you know i would i probably i don't love

278
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,959
that kind of thing so i would pr i would

279
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,559
probably add a thing where you can

280
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,159
recall the glove in the middle of a

281
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:43,518
punch

282
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,919
right uh i pro and and maybe like

283
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,600
sometimes you can't so maybe there's a

284
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,639
little bit of a dark soulsy thing for

285
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,639
certain parts of the move

286
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,600
uh and so basically when you get these

287
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,600
gloves we'd have different like code for

288
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,278
the gloves where we'd say well some of

289
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
the gloves put in like this pattern

290
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,559
something this pattern and maybe each of

291
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,639
these you know has other stuff

292
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,799
associated with it even so

293
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,879
you know when you put in a move queue

294
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,199
entry you have things like is it

295
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,240
interruptible but maybe you could also

296
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,120
have things uh right like

297
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,799
you know

298
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,200
a damage value

299
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,240
um or a speed value

300
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,440
right

301
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,720
um

302
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,640
i don't know

303
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,200
maybe those are f32s i don't know how we

304
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,120
want to do this uh

305
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,399
where like

306
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
you could imagine

307
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,200
that

308
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,759
as we do the gameplay it might be fun to

309
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,839
be able to create gloves where like the

310
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,679
first two squares don't really do any

311
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,240
damage or not very much

312
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,639
but then like the last square does or

313
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,440
something like that you know what i mean

314
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,120
um

315
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,639
so things like that

316
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,879
you know what i'm saying

317
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,879
uh

318
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,240
basically giving you ways to to make

319
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,800
choices when you're when you're sort of

320
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,799
kidding up

321
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,559
and also to like sort of provide that

322
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,360
kind of binding of isaac you sort of

323
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,599
feel where you like want to

324
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,079
have the runs be kind of

325
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,639
sometimes dramatically different like oh

326
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,120
in this game you know i had a glove

327
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,320
that's very like short distance but high

328
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,078
damage

329
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,120
and in this other one i had one that's

330
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,199
like you know very wide circles but very

331
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,799
small damage over the whole thing and

332
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,879
then another one i had one that like

333
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,479
basically couldn't do any damage like

334
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,759
near me but it could do a lot of damage

335
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,240
far away

336
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,559
right and so you know those would change

337
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,159
sort of the hopping patterns that you

338
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,078
have to use like how you're kind of

339
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,838
trying to move around and how you're

340
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,159
trying to like um

341
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,279
play against the enemies and that seems

342
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,360
like the kind of thing that's pretty

343
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,759
important in these sorts of games where

344
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,759
you're like hey we want to play randomly

345
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,720
generated dungeons

346
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,799
and

347
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,040
have like a different experience every

348
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,240
time that's not like always exactly the

349
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,519
same

350
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,959
uh if that makes sense

351
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,519
so yeah

352
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,039
um

353
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
yeah yeah yeah

354
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,159
let's see

355
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:16,298
what i would do is

356
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,298
[Music]

357
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,639
in the brain code when you go to do an

358
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,320
attack

359
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,839
i guess there's a question of what we

360
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,839
should do if the

361
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,838
like

362
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
just trying to think of like

363
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,560
what the actual gameplay would be

364
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,759
you

365
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,198
punch

366
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:48,480
it adds the things into the move queue

367
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:50,479
the glove is now in strike mode

368
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,159
so so let's do this first because i'm

369
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,680
not really a game designer right

370
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,639
uh

371
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,919
what i would mostly want to do is

372
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,519
do the

373
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,439
the most straightforward thing first and

374
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,480
then i guess try to feel how it feels

375
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,880
when i'm

376
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,839
doing it and see what happens

377
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:12,559
so like if you

378
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,959
for starters when you do an attack

379
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,198
it'll just always complete the entire

380
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,599
attack and you have to wait for the

381
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,759
glove to return to you right

382
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,519
so basically like you won't be able to

383
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,600
recall the glove is the first thing

384
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,759
we'll code we'll see what that feels

385
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
like and then assuming that i don't

386
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,639
fully like that because i i don't think

387
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,399
i will

388
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,799
i'll want a way for you to probably

389
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,440
recall the glove early

390
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,799
or at least for some gloves i would want

391
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,320
you to be able to do that so like you

392
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,838
know maybe some gloves that are very

393
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,120
powerful you can't do that so it's like

394
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,639
part of the downside of using you know

395
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,759
a particularly powerful glove or

396
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,680
something is that it can't be recalled

397
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,600
that's fine and whatever

398
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,838
um but

399
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,639
i

400
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,320
went will use what it feels like to not

401
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,079
be able to recall it to guide us to how

402
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,160
you will because i guess i don't know

403
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:07,359
how you would do it like for example

404
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,198
if you try to do an attack it puts the

405
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,480
attack in there while the glove is slow

406
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,519
motion

407
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,278
do i if i hit another attack like i try

408
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,839
to hit attack again

409
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,039
does that recall the glove

410
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,000
like would that be how you recall the

411
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,719
glove

412
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,958
and if you do does it also launch the

413
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
attack you requested or does it not do

414
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,559
that right

415
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,920
um

416
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,638
you know uh

417
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,958
does it just like cancel the attack

418
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,959
if you push an attack button but while

419
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,518
the glove is still out it just recalls

420
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,439
the glove and so you double tap

421
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,360
to recall and

422
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,560
restrike

423
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,399
right i mean there's just a lot of

424
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,399
different ways you could do that and i

425
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,240
don't i'm just having trouble like

426
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,240
envisioning what it will feel like so i

427
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,519
just want to do it

428
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,198
you know what i mean

429
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,440
and see because you may want to be able

430
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,120
to recall the glove without

431
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,240
launching a new attack

432
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,839
right

433
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,360
um

434
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,279
like you could imagine

435
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,800
you don't want the glove to hit

436
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,759
something it was about to hit so you

437
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,439
recall it and you don't really want to

438
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,519
attack anything you just want it to

439
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,199
cancel right so it kind of feels it

440
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,399
feels to me like you want the ability to

441
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,958
cancel

442
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,958
without

443
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,958
like

444
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,719
like oh i i sent this glove out to to do

445
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,480
a wide punch but it's going to hit this

446
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,480
barrel that explodes and i don't want to

447
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,039
do that yet because like the enemy like

448
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,480
hopped away and i want to like recall it

449
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,838
but i don't want to re-punch in a

450
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,120
direction i want to save the punch

451
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,560
because i want to time it for something

452
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,679
that's about to happen

453
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,919
right

454
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,638
so it feels like at least four

455
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,399
responsive gloves like gloves that don't

456
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,240
you know have the downside of

457
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,799
uncancelable or whatever right which

458
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,159
which would probably be a thing as well

459
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,758
for gloves that are supposed to be more

460
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:55,278
responsive i feel like you're gonna want

461
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,959
like more meticulous control and i just

462
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,480
don't know like

463
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,359
yeah i just don't know what you would

464
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,039
push

465
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,320
like i don't really want a separate key

466
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,638
but i don't know maybe you need a

467
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,639
separate key

468
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,720
i don't know

469
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,318
but it's too early to worry about that

470
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,078
let's just get the basic thing working

471
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,599
first and then we'll start to we'll

472
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,599
worry about that

473
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,359
and hopefully we'll be able to kind of

474
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,240
get a feel for what it should actually

475
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,240
be like you know what i mean um so we'll

476
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240
see

477
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,839
all right

478
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,919
well

479
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,759
um

480
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,000
yeah and oaks let me say one other thing

481
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,960
what if a glove has like aftertouch

482
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,319
right like what if one of the gloves

483
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,519
one of the properties of glove can have

484
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,240
is you can like

485
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,639
chain attacks on the glove so like i can

486
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,640
i can do like an up and then a right on

487
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,440
the glove and it'll do it

488
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,919
like

489
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,840
without coming back to me right like who

490
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,080
knows what other stuff there might be

491
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,359
that we want to do so yeah the more i'm

492
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,839
thinking about it the more i think like

493
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,199
i don't think like hitting an attack

494
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,038
button

495
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,000
should recall the glove

496
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,000
pretty much ever

497
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,160
um

498
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,160
you know what i mean

499
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,360
i guess

500
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,159
all right so let's just do it i don't

501
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,400
know i really don't so we're just gonna

502
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,320
try it here so if we look at some of

503
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,160
these you can see we've got like these

504
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:41,599
attacked uh nd sword stuff

505
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,200
so i don't really think that's quite how

506
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,678
we're going to

507
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,798
want to write it uh the d sword thing

508
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,240
is sort of correct like this v d sword

509
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,119
thing here

510
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,279
uh

511
00:18:53,119 --> 00:19:00,159
and attacked as two values are plausible

512
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,639
as what we want but it's d sword is not

513
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,400
really the word for it what we're gonna

514
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,759
want here instead

515
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,120
is more like two bases like

516
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,960
we're gonna wanna say okay

517
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,759
we have these movement patterns for the

518
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,798
glove and they're going to be written

519
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,599
probably like as if they go i don't know

520
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,839
like

521
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:25,279
up and down or something or to the right

522
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,079
then we're going to rotate those

523
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,480
patterns depending on which way you you

524
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,519
asked to to attack

525
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,480
the glove is going to rotate its pattern

526
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,400
into that direction right

527
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,160
so we're going gonna have a thing here

528
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,080
where we would do like

529
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,720
it'd be more of like an attack x and

530
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,720
attack y

531
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,600
that's which kind of square you know

532
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,880
which

533
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,119
um

534
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,400
movement direction we have for each of

535
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:59,038
the of the squares right that's more

536
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,038
what it would be

537
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,319
um

538
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,880
there's sort of another thing here and

539
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,880
in fact the move cue maybe

540
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,319
it may be more like this

541
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,319
and one of the things that's kind of

542
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,039
annoying about handmade hero is because

543
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:29,599
we originally did something that allowed

544
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,480
arbitrary like geometry if that makes

545
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,480
sense

546
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,480
um we don't really have a grid per se

547
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,558
so even though like the game looks grid

548
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,798
based it's actually arbitrary like those

549
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,480
squares could be completely

550
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,679
arbitrary

551
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,960
and so we kind of have this annoying

552
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,519
aspect here where this is not an integer

553
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,558
it's actually just a floating point

554
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,079
value

555
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,639
that says where you would want to go

556
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,558
kind of and you like have to sort of

557
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,960
look to see what you would hop to which

558
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,240
really sucks

559
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,720
but there's a lot of things that really

560
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,640
suck about sort of the way we did things

561
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,079
uh that's just the nature of the beast

562
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,960
and also being on stream where you don't

563
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:13,199
have very much time to fix things

564
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,240
so you know that kind of sucks but point

565
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,159
being the attack x attack y and attacked

566
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,880
values now there would be a slight

567
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,880
modification

568
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,918
for how we were doing things before so

569
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,319
when we look at those attack values

570
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,159
which are like this little thing here

571
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,678
and it kind of looks at like which but

572
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,039
buttons you pushed

573
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,280
um

574
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,440
i guess i don't know what you would do

575
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,960
if you push two attack buttons at the

576
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,000
same time

577
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,279
uh you know i guess we just else clause

578
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,798
this for now um although actually you

579
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,319
know even that's not really that

580
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:49,679
necessary because it's just it just

581
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,240
changes which one you're going to do

582
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,679
you're going to only do one of the other

583
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,839
uh so we don't really have a good

584
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,159
a good idea about like what we would do

585
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,480
there you know we don't really know like

586
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,360
like if you push two buttons at the same

587
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,839
time

588
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,918
i don't think

589
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,599
i think we just flip flip a coin right

590
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,799
like uh

591
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:15,359
i don't i don't hmm

592
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:20,038
like i don't know if what we expect to

593
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,038
do there is too

594
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,640
so you know what i take it back i i i

595
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,640
guess we do sort of know maybe

596
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,400
i'm going to maybe i'm going to maybe

597
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,440
call that a

598
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,000
future topic there because in theory if

599
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,200
we were going to do this where you

600
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,679
could

601
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,519
rapidly cue in things like you don't

602
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,320
have to wait and you want to do a like

603
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,200
upleft attack or whatever

604
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,399
um

605
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,279
i could imagine wanting that to be

606
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,280
a

607
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,279
like

608
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,960
i i could imagine wanting this to

609
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:28,558
actually be an event cue that you read

610
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,480
so when you look at game controller

611
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,839
input here you actually like look

612
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,880
through and see

613
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:38,000
now the problem is that you know the

614
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,960
super crappy x input stuff

615
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,079
which is like really really lousy

616
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,960
um

617
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,720
doesn't really give you a good way to to

618
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,400
say like what's the order in which these

619
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,679
buttons were pressed

620
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,759
um

621
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,960
you would have to just like pull at a

622
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,960
high frequency i guess

623
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,639
which makes like no sense because the

624
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,600
thing's usb so there's nothing to pull

625
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,038
it like sends it to you across a wire

626
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,519
it's really dumb

627
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,679
uh but that's just next input for you

628
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,679
so

629
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,440
yeah i don't know

630
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,320
we're gonna do it like this for now but

631
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,480
i do think this is a little bit bad um

632
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,119
or maybe a lot bad

633
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,079
uh as the case may be but we'll see

634
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:25,599
so if you push the up button then

635
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,558
you know the x in this case would be the

636
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,158
normal

637
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,599
um well

638
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
so i guess we have to decide how we want

639
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,199
to encode these

640
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,120
you know i think everything encoded as

641
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,120
if it's faded as if it's facing

642
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,038
rightward is probably the most sensible

643
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,759
thing just because that's how like math

644
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:44,480
works in circles angle zero

645
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,278
right produces a vector pointing to the

646
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,720
right

647
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,359
so we might as well try to keep with

648
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,000
that convention

649
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,839
uh so really action right let's order

650
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,880
these and let's order these in circle

651
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,918
order just to make it easier on

652
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,440
ourselves so action right um we would

653
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,320
expect that encoding to be the normal

654
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,400
encoding right the one where x is x and

655
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,399
y is y no

656
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,519
change

657
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,519
for up which would be the next one and

658
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,558
down would be last so it'd be it'd be

659
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:20,158
right up left down

660
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:22,720
for up we would now expect whatever was

661
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,320
previously the x should now be the y

662
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,640
right because now anything that was

663
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,639
going out from the hero in the rightward

664
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,400
direction it's rotated up so that it's

665
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,679
facing upward

666
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,840
so now that will be y x

667
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,278
um

668
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,720
i'm sorry y

669
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,400
on the other hand which was kind of

670
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,519
going up and down

671
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,080
up

672
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,319
y before is now going left which is

673
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,839
negative x right so again we're just

674
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,000
rotating around the circle this is

675
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,079
basically like sine and cosine

676
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
right you know what i'm saying

677
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,960
um so if

678
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,558
if you look at like

679
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,120
what these values are they're just the

680
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,960
sine and cosine of 90 degree angle

681
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,119
increments around right this is sine and

682
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,480
cosine of zero this is sine and cosine

683
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,278
of 90 degrees

684
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,679
uh now we want 180 so now you're flipped

685
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,679
around so now the x that was previously

686
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,640
going out to the right is going to go

687
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,559
out to the left and the y which

688
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,440
previously would have gone up is now

689
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:24,319
rotated around to face down right

690
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,278
again just sine and cosine is is always

691
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,278
all we're doing here right

692
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,840
uh and then the the final for the

693
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:33,278
uh

694
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,918
pointing downward

695
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,278
again so now like the x

696
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,840
uh

697
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,519
for for whatever is going in x is now

698
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,439
again going to go in y this time it's

699
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,480
going to to go downward

700
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,080
uh the y is going to come from the x and

701
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,519
again to go downward uh so i believe

702
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,759
that's everything let me make sure that

703
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,359
i've got it right i may have missed one

704
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,319
or i may have i shouldn't say missed one

705
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,558
i may have

706
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:01,119
bogarted one of them

707
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,839
all right so this is going out to the

708
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,399
right uh and up

709
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,079
right right and up it's it's that

710
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,519
direction

711
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:13,519
um right uh and this one is is uh

712
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:17,278
i mean it's really just

713
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,960
two axes that look like that right

714
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,519
it's like an l

715
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,240
so that's that

716
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,960
right now we need that we need to rotate

717
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,440
it

718
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,399
this way

719
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,720
so if we want to rotate it

720
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,479
we now get our y is coming out negative

721
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,558
x that's correct and our

722
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,599
uh our x

723
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,798
is

724
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,678
coming out

725
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,200
uh as y which that is exactly what we

726
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,200
expect yeah

727
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,399
rotate it one more time x is going out

728
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,440
negative x

729
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,719
yup and y is coming out uh

730
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,600
negative y

731
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,880
that's

732
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:57,278
also what we'd expect right

733
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,399
um and then finally rotated to facing

734
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,640
down

735
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,239
uh we go to

736
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,490
um

737
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,490
[Music]

738
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,319
x going out negative y and y

739
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,200
going out

740
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,720
regular x so that there was one error

741
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,880
there i thought that looked wrong and i

742
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,880
was right

743
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,240
i think that's it

744
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,240
um

745
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,079
that looks good to me

746
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,918
so then what happens is when we know

747
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:47,678
that we have an attack that did get

748
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,480
pressed uh then we're going to have to

749
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,278
uh

750
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,880
actually insert moves into the move

751
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:53,759
the move

752
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,360
cue

753
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,480
of the glove

754
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,639
if

755
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,640
it actually did attack right

756
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,960
so in that case

757
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,039
we need to say like all right if you

758
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,200
attacked

759
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,599
um then we need to do some like logic

760
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,480
here if that makes sense

761
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,639
uh and we

762
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,480
we need to push things on to the move

763
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,720
queue

764
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,720
we

765
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,558
we sort of have like

766
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,879
like a couple things we probably want

767
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,119
so

768
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,480
the move cue entries

769
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,879
which are here

770
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,798
uh they they would stack up as

771
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,559
individual movements

772
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,558
but we probably also want

773
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,200
like we might uh

774
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,440
we might want what is going on in the

775
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,440
chat

776
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,038
e of course enum is in c

777
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,038
what are you talking about

778
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,480
enums are in c

779
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,440
pretty much anything you see in handmade

780
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,038
hero is in c

781
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,798
except for

782
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,798
operator overloading

783
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,278
is not in c

784
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,759
and function overloading is not in c

785
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,640
we may use a thing for like profiling

786
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:39,119
that has a constructor destructor

787
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,559
there's like one thing

788
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,319
i don't think we really use anything

789
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,278
else you would have to add some type

790
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,119
defs

791
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:49,720
like like you know

792
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,719
this you would write these

793
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,879
like this

794
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,559
but other than that

795
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,120
that's basically it so pretty much like

796
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:04,879
it it would not

797
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:06,558
if you had operator overloading in a c

798
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,360
in c

799
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:08,720
uh

800
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,719
you know you're pretty much home free

801
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,679
for handmade hero would not be very very

802
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,679
difficult right

803
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,519
um

804
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,519
so yeah but enums are

805
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,519
have been in c for a very very very long

806
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,519
time

807
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:40,319
so uh back to our story so in here we've

808
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:42,079
got kind of two concerns we have one is

809
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,678
we need to like push moves on to the

810
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,960
move thing so like you know if you

811
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,559
imagined

812
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,278
right you've got like

813
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,759
some kind of like push move call

814
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,919
you know that you're doing here

815
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,480
and like whatever the weird pattern is

816
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,200
that you want the glove to push

817
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,360
uh

818
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,399
you would do that so you'd basically say

819
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:05,519
like okay we've got the attack x

820
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,518
uh the attack y

821
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:10,639
and

822
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,120
you know we've got

823
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,519
some movement that we want to do

824
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:19,038
whatever that is right it's like

825
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,399
we want to go out one

826
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,079
uh

827
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,319
and

828
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,639
or something like that and then over

829
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,639
i don't know

830
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,319
maybe something like that

831
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,038
so you'd go out two squares and then

832
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,359
over one square and then you'd return

833
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,359
right

834
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:45,678
i and all i wanted to illustrate here is

835
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,679
like so there's two things there right

836
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,880
one is the squares that it's going to

837
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,840
move along

838
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,840
but the other one is while you're doing

839
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,558
that

840
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:59,678
what if you want to chain moves together

841
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:02,639
so like i do that and i want to queue up

842
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,200
also after it finishes that i want to

843
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,240
queue up another move

844
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,960
that

845
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,599
tags on the end if this if this glove

846
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,798
has like double tap

847
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,000
right

848
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,879
um if that makes sense

849
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,240
so

850
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,559
double tap

851
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,558
is

852
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:30,480
double tap is a little harder because we

853
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,720
we need to decide how we want to store

854
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,960
the fact that

855
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,679
we

856
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,960
probably only want

857
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,880
a limited number of over like we don't

858
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,720
want you to just daisy train attacks

859
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,360
like five in a row

860
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,798
we presumably want the glove to have a

861
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,479
number

862
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:55,119
that is

863
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:58,159
the number of double taps it can do

864
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:00,319
before returning right

865
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,919
so presumably

866
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:06,558
we need some way of doing like a roll

867
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,559
check here like we probably want

868
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,800
like a

869
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:10,799
uh

870
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,598
there's like individual moves but then

871
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:18,559
there's sort of the overall move

872
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,599
like a move group count or something

873
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,719
you know

874
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,480
and so

875
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,078
you would do a thing where you do like

876
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,760
move group count

877
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,919
you'd increment

878
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,839
and then you would only

879
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:34,000
reset move group count when the move q

880
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:36,000
went all the way down to zero and the

881
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,679
glove like returned so it would it would

882
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,280
really be more like

883
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,800
you know if

884
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,079
glove

885
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,200
um

886
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,320
returned to hero or if

887
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,598
uh

888
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,480
glove

889
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,320
with hero or whatever right so so

890
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,559
you would have this kind of thing where

891
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,559
you

892
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:02,880
you can cue up two moves or something

893
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:05,199
uh and then any taps you do after that

894
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,400
just won't they're like ant

895
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,879
and you have to wait for the glove to

896
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,280
come back all the way back to you before

897
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,519
you can do something else

898
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,519
right

899
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,239
oh

900
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,800
oh man

901
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:27,039
stretch it out something like that

902
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,039
right

903
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:32,480
so i think we want to be respecting both

904
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,719
of those we want both of those things we

905
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,719
we don't want um

906
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,279
to just think about individual moves we

907
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,159
want to think about groups of moves and

908
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,680
then

909
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:45,838
in you know individual moves

910
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,838
so

911
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:59,838
um

912
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:35,119
i guess one problem i have is i'm not

913
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,400
sure what i would consider returning

914
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,440
you know like i said since i don't

915
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,320
really write this kind of code like

916
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,000
this game design stuff

917
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,160
i don't normally do

918
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,679
so i guess the question is what do you

919
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:51,440
consider

920
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:54,440
having returned to the hero anyway

921
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,440
like

922
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:01,200
is that a

923
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:04,720
two-stage process probably is it like

924
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,679
okay there's a radius

925
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,239
um

926
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:11,279
and if the glove is less than that

927
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,598
radius away from the hero and there's no

928
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,280
moves in the move queue

929
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,280
then it has returned

930
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:22,159
even if it hasn't made it back to like

931
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,960
its resting position it's it's the

932
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:27,519
radius at which you are allowed to like

933
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,240
start it going again

934
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,239
i mean that sounds

935
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,480
right

936
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,960
ish

937
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,240
um

938
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,639
maybe

939
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,480
i don't really know

940
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,640
again this is not my job

941
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,320
this is this is what game designers are

942
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,400
supposed to do

943
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,000
a lot of times they don't do it

944
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,599
like a lot of game designers are lousy

945
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,159
but it's their job

946
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,039
and you know it's not my job

947
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,358
so

948
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:22,239
lousy or not it's not my job

949
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:25,358
so i would say uh yeah there's probably

950
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:27,838
a radius there and you know i don't know

951
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,519
what we want to call um

952
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,320
this stuff but

953
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,559
there's probably going to be like

954
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,519
basically like stats that we want to

955
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,719
start having for various things

956
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,000
you know what i mean

957
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,199
like uh

958
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,639
we

959
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,399
we could just dump them all in the

960
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:47,400
entity structure

961
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,400
which

962
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,640
it seems probably less like what i would

963
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:55,838
want

964
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:59,719
um

965
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,719
because the stats

966
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,599
the stats are probably hand authored

967
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,000
right again this is where being game

968
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,240
designer would be good but

969
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,760
so in a roguelike

970
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,719
you

971
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,079
you

972
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:23,199
don't

973
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,880
really want all of the stats to be like

974
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,759
independently

975
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,680
rolled do you like like when you create

976
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,320
the gloves i mean i'm just trying to

977
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,679
think about like binding of isaac right

978
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,200
um i'm just trying to think of like

979
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:39,838
roguelikes that i've enjoyed you know

980
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,639
and if you think about that like

981
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:45,920
the the items are just the items like

982
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,920
there there aren't

983
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,320
there aren't like

984
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,800
randomly created items in the game

985
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,800
it's just it's just

986
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,280
it's just like a set of items that

987
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:09,358
somebody designs right

988
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,119
like you don't

989
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,279
you don't have like when you play

990
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,800
binding of isaac the items are all new

991
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,800
every time right

992
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,440
you play the same game with the same

993
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,680
items every time

994
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,720
there's just like

995
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,598
different

996
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,439
items that are the the set of items that

997
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,559
appear in that dungeon are randomly

998
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,559
selected

999
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,599
from the pool of existing of items that

1000
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,599
exist right

1001
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,039
so

1002
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:50,240
so that suggests to me that i would

1003
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:53,040
probably want like an authorable bank

1004
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:56,559
of like here's all the items

1005
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,159
like here's all the different gloves

1006
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:01,279
right

1007
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:03,440
and the gloves have their like stats on

1008
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,680
them

1009
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,240
and

1010
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,919
then yeah like if you then if you pick

1011
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:13,358
up modifiers

1012
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,440
the modifiers like are combined

1013
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,639
with the glove stats

1014
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,519
but they're all all of this always comes

1015
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,980
from like a group like a

1016
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,880
like a

1017
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:28,400
[Music]

1018
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,400
a bank of static

1019
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,639
yeah

1020
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,640
integers are not more efficient than

1021
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:41,039
floats by the way floats are far far

1022
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,838
more efficient than integers

1023
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:46,000
like

1024
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,000
by several orders of magnitude usually

1025
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:51,199
pun intended i suppose

1026
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,199
um

1027
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,039
like good luck finding a fuse multiply

1028
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:57,439
add for integer

1029
00:41:55,039 --> 00:42:00,480
on most chips but you now almost always

1030
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,679
have a fuse multiply add for float

1031
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,039
not to mention the fact that you don't

1032
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,039
have to shift correct for a scale

1033
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,560
um

1034
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,240
so

1035
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,199
yeah i don't know

1036
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,358
um

1037
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,439
i i don't like i said this is not my

1038
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,799
this is not my area i don't do this kind

1039
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,760
of code

1040
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,440
uh

1041
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,160
so i'm not sure where this stuff would

1042
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,400
go

1043
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,879
like we could just stuff it in the

1044
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,960
entity but it may make more sense to

1045
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,960
have the entities sort of have like

1046
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:32,719
basically like a just a like almost like

1047
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,599
a

1048
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,199
uh

1049
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,640
asset id

1050
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,679
you know what i mean

1051
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,519
um where the asset id just says like

1052
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,279
this is the stats

1053
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,199
that i have

1054
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,319
this entity has

1055
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:50,559
and then you know we iterate over

1056
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,960
if you've if you've collected items the

1057
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,159
players items like

1058
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,119
uh you know

1059
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,118
affect

1060
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,119
that

1061
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,880
so i don't know like i said not my area

1062
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,960
of expertise i would have strong

1063
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,519
opinions about this i'm sure if i was a

1064
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,039
game designer um as an engine programmer

1065
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:16,159
it's just not something i think about

1066
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:18,000
because it's like you know it's a it's

1067
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,960
preferences it's like

1068
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
what what would what does the designer

1069
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,599
want right like what does the designer

1070
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,199
think is good there so uh that's that's

1071
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,318
tricky for me i don't know but you could

1072
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:32,318
imagine like

1073
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,640
um some kind of a settings thing where

1074
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,400
we basically said like okay you know if

1075
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,799
we imagined

1076
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,680
sort of the stats that determine

1077
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,400
uh

1078
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:49,440
that these sorts of things can do

1079
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,440
there's like a

1080
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:58,159
there's like a max move group count

1081
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,160
thing which is you know this would be

1082
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,280
how many

1083
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,880
moves can cue

1084
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:11,359
back to back without returning

1085
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:14,079
um there would be some kind of a damage

1086
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,078
multiplier

1087
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:20,519
i guess it's a base damage value like

1088
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,239
i'm just thinking like the glove right

1089
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,239
so

1090
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,480
it strikes me that probably what you

1091
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,960
would want here for the gloves are like

1092
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,159
different type move types

1093
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,400
so

1094
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:48,399
um

1095
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,960
because you're gonna need a way to like

1096
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,160
explain this

1097
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,000
you know what i mean like okay so i'm

1098
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:59,759
just trying to think about it uh here

1099
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,480
visually right

1100
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,440
so suppose we create a glove and the

1101
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,599
glove

1102
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,920
has a pattern of squares that it's going

1103
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,079
to attack

1104
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,318
that pattern of squares

1105
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,079
it would be very easy if that's all i

1106
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:16,838
needed to communicate to the player was

1107
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,400
that you're going to pick up this glove

1108
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:20,239
right

1109
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,880
and it's gonna do like

1110
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,639
zero damage to this square one damage to

1111
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,599
this square and two damage to that

1112
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:29,519
square

1113
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,519
right like that's what the glove does

1114
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,318
um that's easy to articulate because

1115
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,078
when you go to get the glove you could

1116
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,800
just do a like you could do a thing that

1117
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,599
basically says like zero one two or you

1118
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,720
know

1119
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,160
uh

1120
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,559
empty

1121
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:49,759
green red right i mean you could think

1122
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:51,920
of many ways that that could be drawn

1123
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,079
that makes it very obvious

1124
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,358
you know

1125
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,280
but

1126
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:59,039
the part that

1127
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,560
would be very confusing to try and

1128
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,679
articulate later

1129
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,480
would be

1130
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:06,480
okay now i want items that affect that

1131
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,880
so so now the designer wants to come in

1132
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,039
and go oh and

1133
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,200
and like you know when you have that

1134
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:16,559
that sort of pattern well the final

1135
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:19,439
strike if you get this item you have a

1136
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,039
20 chance of getting double damage on

1137
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,318
the final strike or whatever right like

1138
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:24,079
that's the kind of thing a designer

1139
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,079
would do

1140
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,400
well how do you articulate that to the

1141
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,039
player because you all you did was just

1142
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,160
draw this thing for the glove this item

1143
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:36,880
is unrelated to the glove so how do they

1144
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:41,199
articulate to the player that this item

1145
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,280
affects this square of this glove right

1146
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,039
so to me it would make more sense i

1147
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,160
think to say that there are basically

1148
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:50,559
square classes right so maybe there's

1149
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,199
like three colors or three symbols or

1150
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,759
something so when you get a glove

1151
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:59,118
it has like you know diamond square and

1152
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,200
circle or or a b and c or one two and

1153
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,039
three right

1154
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,759
um and those are the different square

1155
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,759
types and so the glove has a base damage

1156
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,599
for each of its square types

1157
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,599
um each of the three square types or

1158
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,000
something

1159
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,079
and then items can say how much they add

1160
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,519
to each of the square types

1161
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,960
you know what i'm saying

1162
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:20,960
um so basically like

1163
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:26,879
i don't know if that i don't know if

1164
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,639
that makes more sense right to

1165
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,880
if you understand what i'm saying

1166
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:30,879
but

1167
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,079
and that way you can have like

1168
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,358
interesting gloves too that invert the

1169
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,760
normal pattern like you could have two

1170
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:40,078
gloves that are exactly the same except

1171
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,200
they have invert assignment to where the

1172
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:46,079
squares are so like the same items would

1173
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,039
do opposite things to those two gloves

1174
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,680
right

1175
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:50,480
like um if normally

1176
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:52,558
the

1177
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,480
c-square is the far square and the

1178
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,000
a-square is the close-square you could

1179
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,079
have a reverse

1180
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,639
like a inside-out glove or whatever

1181
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,000
right and it flips them around

1182
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,779
you know what i mean

1183
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,260
um

1184
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,260
[Laughter]

1185
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,400
frizzy i like that

1186
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,289
yeah

1187
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,119
um

1188
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:18,800
[Laughter]

1189
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,280
uh that's actually exactly what we

1190
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,800
should do the glove has six slots

1191
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,160
and if you fill them all you can snap

1192
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,960
your fingers and half of the world

1193
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:30,239
dissolves that's a very good idea

1194
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,679
was it six or five

1195
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:33,199
for some reason i thought it was five i

1196
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:37,358
didn't pay very close attention to those

1197
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,358
movies to be honest it's six

1198
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,558
i don't know

1199
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:44,558
um

1200
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:50,399
so anyway yeah i think that's how we

1201
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,240
would probably do it so maybe we would

1202
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,800
have a thing like

1203
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:55,919
uh move square

1204
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,119
type

1205
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,000
you know

1206
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,000
um and

1207
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:07,039
we would just have some of those

1208
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:07,039
you know

1209
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:10,480
so there would be like

1210
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,680
um

1211
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:16,679
sort of like an equation

1212
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,240
and you know probably these equations

1213
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,559
would be pretty standard

1214
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:28,558
like

1215
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,919
like they're just going to be like these

1216
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,000
affine things so we're like you know

1217
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,440
maybe there's like a stat eq

1218
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,559
where you basically say like hey there's

1219
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,800
the elements of the stat equation

1220
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,680
and there's three of them like x squared

1221
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,760
x and affine like

1222
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:50,239
x to the zero

1223
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,920
um or something like that so maybe we do

1224
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,519
more like this where we were

1225
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,559
anticipating that these are fairly

1226
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:56,480
standard

1227
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,720
and we basically look look there's just

1228
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,920
like the damage for those squares and

1229
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:02,799
you know maybe there's other kind of

1230
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,119
study cues that go in there

1231
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,640
who the heck knows i don't know

1232
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,640
uh and so

1233
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,639
then you could you could multiply these

1234
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,480
together in fact we could say that these

1235
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,719
are just v3s

1236
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,719
um

1237
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,720
that is probably the easiest thing

1238
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,119
you know

1239
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,118
something like that

1240
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,239
uh so you could basically take these

1241
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:39,119
things and just multiply them together

1242
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:41,598
uh

1243
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,720
so you know if you have a thing

1244
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,599
where you're

1245
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,719
uh or or add them you know however you

1246
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,079
want to do that i'm trying to think of

1247
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:51,558
like what the most straightforward way

1248
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,559
to do that is

1249
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,000
i'm trying to think of the most the how

1250
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,200
you would want to represent that well

1251
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,559
how we have to just write the code and

1252
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,879
back it out it's probably too

1253
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,079
presumptuous to actually put it in here

1254
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,920
right

1255
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,920
um but so you're going to have some

1256
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,200
random stuff like that kind of thing you

1257
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,280
know what i mean

1258
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:22,719
uh and the reason i say like we probably

1259
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,119
want to make this

1260
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:26,399
something that we have ways of composing

1261
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,079
is because there's there might be a lot

1262
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,240
of these right

1263
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,440
like you might have things like okay you

1264
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:34,479
know this

1265
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,960
this happens in is is there a poison gas

1266
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,480
cloud or is the are you in the water or

1267
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,159
whatever right and

1268
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,440
you would probably probably need to have

1269
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:43,039
like

1270
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,480
random expressive things that are going

1271
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,079
on in here

1272
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,400
so we would have some kind of a damage

1273
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,480
thing and that would be evaluated

1274
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,200
separately for each type of move square

1275
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,358
so when you are in a particular phase of

1276
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,118
the move anything that you hit

1277
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,799
in that square is going to have a

1278
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,960
different thing done than things in the

1279
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,440
other square right so there's just going

1280
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,760
to be like a

1281
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,440
kind of a trade-off there right

1282
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,480
um and i like that that seems good

1283
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,480
and then the question would be like

1284
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,480
i

1285
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,160
i guess what else we would need so

1286
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:28,160
there's there would be like stats there

1287
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:29,920
would also be like move

1288
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:31,199
patterns

1289
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,280
again i'm just trying to sketch out like

1290
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:35,199
thinking about what we've got

1291
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,519
we have move patterns and those are

1292
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,799
going to be like any set of things that

1293
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:41,039
is

1294
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,039
um

1295
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,280
supposed to be used with the move cue

1296
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,358
and

1297
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:58,040
presumably the things that go in here

1298
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:58,039
would basically be like

1299
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,318
hmm

1300
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,119
so the things that go in here are gonna

1301
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:15,519
then be yeah this is gonna be kind of

1302
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,960
annoying so we're going to have a thing

1303
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:21,199
that actually happens as

1304
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,199
you

1305
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,760
evaluate stats against entities and

1306
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,599
the question is like what kind of stats

1307
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,599
are we going to have is there just going

1308
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,559
to be a single damage number or are we

1309
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,880
going to have like status effects

1310
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,880
um

1311
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,519
something like binding of isaac has no

1312
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,720
status effects

1313
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,719
right

1314
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,719
i

1315
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,039
and i guess i don't have a strong

1316
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,039
opinion about that

1317
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:25,200
it seems a little bit unnecessary like

1318
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:27,119
it might just be like too complicated at

1319
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:28,639
that point

1320
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,318
like because now you have to think about

1321
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:32,318
like what the move patterns are

1322
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,160
and now you're also thinking about like

1323
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:41,118
status effects

1324
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,118
that are gonna happen

1325
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,639
i think the reason that i don't know

1326
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,480
that status effects make a lot of sense

1327
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:50,400
here is because

1328
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,639
the problem with status effects is they

1329
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,838
assume you have the ability to like

1330
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:58,000
actually equip

1331
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:01,000
let me just talk this out

1332
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
right

1333
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:21,480
so the way i would say is

1334
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,920
status effects are

1335
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,920
not going to be

1336
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,720
things you can

1337
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,240
adapt to right so would just be like do

1338
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:36,159
you end up getting a weapon that has

1339
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:37,199
fire damage or not

1340
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:38,639
right

1341
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,639
normally the reason things like that

1342
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:43,440
would be interesting in games

1343
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:45,279
is if you can have like a more balanced

1344
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,079
approach because you you know you take

1345
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,960
multiple weapons with you

1346
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,559
and you like plan for that or whatever

1347
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,159
or you're like oh i'm going into the

1348
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,720
area that has like a lot of poison

1349
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:58,798
creatures so i need to be able to wear

1350
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:00,078
my poisoned

1351
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:03,280
um

1352
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:04,960
resistance necklace or whatever right

1353
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,760
in

1354
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,318
a

1355
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:11,040
binding of isaac style game you don't

1356
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:13,039
have you only have one attack right so

1357
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:14,480
you don't have the ability to do those

1358
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:19,880
sorts of things

1359
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,880
and in this game i don't think

1360
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:38,400
however

1361
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,559
okay that said you do have the idea of

1362
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,240
hopping on the tiles and so maybe that's

1363
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,480
where that comes from okay so i would

1364
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,838
say we probably do have that actually

1365
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,838
so we are going to have a bunch of

1366
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:48,880
things here so so basically the move

1367
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,480
pattern

1368
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,039
whatever the move pattern is that we

1369
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,679
load up right

1370
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:59,440
um the move patterns are going to have

1371
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:03,199
to have like basically all of this stuff

1372
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:05,760
in there so we say the move pattern has

1373
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:07,199
which square type each thing is

1374
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,040
right

1375
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:14,639
and where those squares are

1376
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:16,000
and presumably that's basically like

1377
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,440
a thing that

1378
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,880
maybe gets copied directly i don't know

1379
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,880
if it actually would or no it wouldn't

1380
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,838
because it gets transformed first

1381
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,838
so there's a move pattern entry

1382
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,039
um and a move pattern and these are the

1383
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:29,679
things that we would actually have to

1384
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,679
have for an individual glove we'd load

1385
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:33,279
this out of here and we go and we don't

1386
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:34,719
really know what has in it because until

1387
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,880
we get further down we don't know all

1388
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,639
the things but we know at least

1389
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,680
it's going to have a concept of a move

1390
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:43,838
square type which is just like you know

1391
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:45,679
i want to be able to mark those

1392
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,599
uh so like the l shape we were making

1393
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:49,118
now i want to be able to mark like the

1394
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,039
ones that are close

1395
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,960
as a different type as the ones that are

1396
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:54,400
far for example that's the thing i would

1397
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,798
like to have

1398
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,240
to experiment with in the gameplay if we

1399
00:57:56,798 --> 00:57:59,519
end up deciding it's not that

1400
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:02,000
interesting we can pull it out but i

1401
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:03,519
want at least try it uh before i would

1402
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,039
decide that

1403
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:06,960
so uh

1404
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,838
the move pattern entries you know

1405
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,838
there's some entries

1406
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,760
in this thing and i don't know how many

1407
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,440
we have max i haven't thought about that

1408
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,240
we'll set that to whatever we actually

1409
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,200
want

1410
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:22,399
but then we've got like uh each thing in

1411
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:23,598
the move pattern is going to have a um

1412
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,480
a type

1413
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,359
and

1414
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,639
a

1415
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:30,159
delta

1416
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:32,078
right a normal a normal delta so a like

1417
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:33,679
rightward

1418
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,680
delta or whatever i don't know what we

1419
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:37,519
want to call this like a facing facing

1420
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:40,639
to the right

1421
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:43,199
um it would have a rightward delta

1422
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:43,199
rightward

1423
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:47,199
normal delta

1424
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:52,879
canonical delta

1425
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:53,679
right

1426
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,318
um

1427
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:57,118
and i think that's all there is in a

1428
00:58:56,318 --> 00:58:59,440
move

1429
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,119
pattern

1430
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,400
um

1431
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,760
i guess we'll throw in one more thing

1432
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,480
for good measure which is is it

1433
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,480
interruptible

1434
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,118
and maybe

1435
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:19,838
we would do something like

1436
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:24,479
that is the interrupt typical or hubble

1437
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,000
it's typical

1438
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:36,879
so

1439
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:47,199
so in general i guess i would say we

1440
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:48,719
we have move patterns

1441
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:51,199
right they

1442
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,078
look like this

1443
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:53,919
we

1444
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,720
know that we're going to have something

1445
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,480
that happens here but this could be we

1446
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,759
have no idea how this is going to work

1447
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,960
uh this is just gonna be something that

1448
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,760
like we

1449
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,960
start writing some code to evaluate

1450
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:09,200
these and some stuff happens right

1451
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,960
um so whatever happens there happens we

1452
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:14,399
don't know

1453
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,320
we probably need some things in the

1454
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:20,409
stats for like the speed of the glove um

1455
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,409
[Music]

1456
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,720
and i guess i don't know

1457
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:33,118
tk dev uh your suggestion is not

1458
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:34,239
useful

1459
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:37,760
um

1460
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:37,759
so i guess what i would say is

1461
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:43,760
i don't know what we want for speed

1462
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,200
stuff because again that gets down into

1463
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,440
the stat stuff which we don't really

1464
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:50,078
know what we want to do

1465
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:53,119
but i think this is roughly what we need

1466
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,318
so we need something where we can have

1467
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,358
patterns

1468
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,719
those patterns will get copied into a

1469
01:00:57,358 --> 01:00:59,679
queue

1470
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,639
um

1471
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:05,519
the queue will have computed

1472
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:08,078
what we're actually going to do

1473
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:09,679
based off of like something that we have

1474
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:13,839
no idea what it looks like that

1475
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,838
basically gets like um

1476
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,519
you munged down right so there's gonna

1477
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,880
be like gameplay code in here that i

1478
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:22,318
don't know how to write or what it looks

1479
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,720
like right because it's it's it's

1480
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:26,719
entirely game designery stuff like

1481
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:28,078
how how do you want to compute damage

1482
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:30,159
right like it's

1483
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,160
it's not really engine stuff it's more

1484
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:35,118
just like what what is

1485
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:37,118
gameplay stuff for that right

1486
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,960
um

1487
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,480
so what we want to be able to do there

1488
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,960
is just say

1489
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,920
okay we've got the patterns patterns are

1490
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,159
stored separately from statistics right

1491
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,000
patterns are just

1492
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,118
here's the flags

1493
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,119
like

1494
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,119
maybe that's only ever can it be

1495
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,039
interrupted or not

1496
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:00,960
but maybe there's other things that are

1497
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:04,799
important here who knows um like maybe

1498
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,400
for example another one would be like um

1499
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:08,400
like you could imagine putting something

1500
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,599
in here that's like uh ephemeral or

1501
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,639
something

1502
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,280
did that

1503
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,719
f fm

1504
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:18,160
mural

1505
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,159
again we gotta check the spelling here

1506
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:22,480
yeah uh

1507
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:24,399
so

1508
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,079
in here right you could imagine also a

1509
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,480
thing that's like this is allowed to

1510
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,920
phase through things and not touch them

1511
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,000
or whatever

1512
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,440
so you know again these are both

1513
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,440
completely experimental i'm just saying

1514
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,880
these are things we want to try in the

1515
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,400
game design but the point is that's

1516
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,119
where they would go so in the move

1517
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,480
patterns we can specify like oh

1518
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,720
here's like a pattern and it can do

1519
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,599
whatever random crap

1520
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:49,519
nothing in that specifies any stats

1521
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:51,440
because stats are some other thing that

1522
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:53,280
we don't know how to do right now

1523
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,280
um this is just saying here's the

1524
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,720
pattern and here's what the types of

1525
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,400
squares are

1526
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:59,759
i like

1527
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,639
would they be

1528
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,720
in one of several classes maybe there's

1529
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:06,558
only two classes maybe there's five

1530
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:08,639
maybe there's ten we don't know that's

1531
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:11,440
just like game design that we hope we

1532
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:13,279
won't screw up later

1533
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,358
that has to do with the stats

1534
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,920
uh then we have the actual move queue

1535
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:20,078
and the move queue itself

1536
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,240
is basically just a way of taking a

1537
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,318
pattern you would combine it with the

1538
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,519
stats that we don't know what to do

1539
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:27,358
about

1540
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:29,679
you would produce some value for each of

1541
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:31,119
the squares and then the squares then it

1542
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:34,318
just goes through those squares and the

1543
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,599
gameplay gets evaluated on each one

1544
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:39,199
right

1545
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:39,200
um so i think that's

1546
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,838
i think that's roughly what i wanted

1547
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,839
this part i don't know right like this

1548
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:47,920
part is gonna have to come

1549
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,558
through like figuring out

1550
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,519
what is happening with monster attacks

1551
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:55,280
right and we're just gonna have to like

1552
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:56,880
grind away at that

1553
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,119
at some future date so i don't i don't

1554
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,559
know what this looks like this

1555
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,000
it makes perfect sense right um but

1556
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,079
i i don't know

1557
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,920
um i have no idea what's going on out

1558
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,720
there also we have no idea what these

1559
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,440
would be but you know abc seems fine for

1560
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:16,639
getting started

1561
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:19,760
all right so i think that's all i need

1562
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:21,679
and um

1563
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,440
so when we do like these push moves so

1564
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,519
that's how this would work right so we

1565
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,280
would basically imagine we're going to

1566
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:29,280
get these move patterns from somewhere

1567
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,519
there'd be like an entry count in this

1568
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,519
thing

1569
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:39,598
and you can imagine we would basically

1570
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:42,000
have a move pattern here and we'd just

1571
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:44,880
make one of these as if we got it from

1572
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,480
somewhere which we didn't right

1573
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,920
um

1574
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,159
this would be like the attack pattern

1575
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,159
right

1576
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,440
uh and the attack pattern is going to be

1577
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,358
three things long and it's gonna have

1578
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,400
these in it right

1579
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:00,400
so these um

1580
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,798
these uh these moves

1581
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,960
uh there's

1582
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:08,639
i don't i don't know like i'll just

1583
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,639
assign them each a different square type

1584
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:13,279
for now so that we can if we want to

1585
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:16,159
start playing with that later we can

1586
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:18,640
um but then we have like the

1587
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,239
the type the delta and the flags so the

1588
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:23,719
delta

1589
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:23,719
are just these

1590
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:43,599
right

1591
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:43,598
uh and the flags

1592
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:50,159
we don't know but i'll just set them to

1593
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,559
interruptable for now because we know

1594
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:55,038
we're going to want to play with that

1595
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:57,200
um and so

1596
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,960
you know and you know i could even say

1597
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:00,078
like let's set it like this

1598
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,240
so

1599
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,000
we can actually play with that as well

1600
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:07,038
right we'll just see what happens so you

1601
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,559
can't interrupt it in the first square

1602
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:12,200
but you can interrupt it before the

1603
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,200
other squares or something

1604
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,599
i don't understand how the pattern is

1605
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:32,160
involved oh uh rational quarter i have

1606
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,519
some i thought you yes so what rational

1607
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,279
coder said like

1608
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:37,038
i totally agree that you don't want to

1609
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,720
go too far ahead but like you kind of

1610
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:41,760
have to sketch something out that you're

1611
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:44,078
going to type in because i don't

1612
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,079
have anything in here right there's

1613
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:49,200
there's nothing for like how gloves

1614
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:51,440
attack so i have to make something up

1615
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:52,318
to start with um

1616
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,079
and

1617
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:56,318
i know i want to try the pattern thing

1618
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,920
so that's what we did

1619
01:06:56,318 --> 01:06:59,358
uh we don't have to do it could get

1620
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,559
removed but

1621
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:01,920
i don't understand how the pattern is

1622
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,839
involved in the gameplay what is the

1623
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,119
function of pattern uh it's how a glove

1624
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,199
punches

1625
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,880
so basically like when you when you do a

1626
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,358
glove punch

1627
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,559
some gloves are just like they punch one

1628
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:16,719
square out other gloves will punch like

1629
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,519
and do damage out

1630
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:20,639
like two squares or three squares away

1631
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:22,480
right

1632
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:23,358
um

1633
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,960
and

1634
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:27,199
more importantly

1635
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,900
it won't just be gloves

1636
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:30,078
like the the um

1637
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,880
[Music]

1638
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,280
the

1639
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,400
enemies we would all would be the same

1640
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,640
encoding

1641
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,280
so basically that what we're typing in

1642
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:42,480
for gloves will also just be true of

1643
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:44,319
monstar right so monstar will have you

1644
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,920
know

1645
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:47,838
different attack patterns

1646
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,680
that they execute

1647
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:51,920
based on their like sort of random role

1648
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:53,199
of like oh it wants to attack now so you

1649
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,200
know or whatever

1650
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:57,759
that kind of stuff

1651
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:59,279
um so so these would probably be unless

1652
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,200
they really suck

1653
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,400
uh they would probably be what we'd use

1654
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:04,480
for everything

1655
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,760
everybody just does

1656
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,760
like

1657
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,200
they have moves they queue

1658
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,359
and

1659
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:13,759
probably like

1660
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,558
the monsters can't really interrupt them

1661
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,640
much

1662
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:18,239
so like part of that part of like

1663
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,480
playing the game is probably knowing the

1664
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:22,238
monster patterns right and knowing like

1665
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:24,158
oh when a monster is executing this

1666
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:26,479
pattern

1667
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:29,278
you know he has to do these three things

1668
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:32,238
so if i punch at this square

1669
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:33,520
that's like a good move right

1670
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:35,838
um

1671
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,839
and like yeah a lot like a chest move

1672
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:40,559
right so sort of like a real-time chess

1673
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:42,079
moves right like this is how the night

1674
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,679
works and this is how the bishop works

1675
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:45,359
and this is how the

1676
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,239
pawn works or whatever

1677
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,480
and

1678
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,479
um

1679
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,719
you

1680
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:56,719
you don't have like turn taking but you

1681
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:59,439
do know once someone initiates an attack

1682
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:01,359
that you are familiar with you know you

1683
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:04,238
have that predictability that like it is

1684
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,199
this attack so you can counter that

1685
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:07,838
attack

1686
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:07,838
you know

1687
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:24,479
so if we are going to attack uh then we

1688
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,960
are just going to try out this little

1689
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:27,838
thing we've got this fake attack pattern

1690
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,960
here

1691
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:33,679
and so then uh what

1692
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,039
oh someone's unhappy too many initialize

1693
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,838
or

1694
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:40,399
oh you're right you are sir

1695
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:42,158
this needed an additional

1696
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:44,479
i guess maybe i'll do it like that so

1697
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:46,798
the indentation is okay

1698
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,798
um

1699
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:51,359
so if we assumed that we had some kind

1700
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,359
of a place where these things were

1701
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,760
coming from right rather than being

1702
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,760
defined directly inline this is what we

1703
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,280
would get back so then we would have a

1704
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,159
little thing here where we just loop

1705
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:05,479
through and say uh you know okay for

1706
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:05,479
each of these

1707
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,198
this is probably move count and this is

1708
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,440
probably moves

1709
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:21,439
right

1710
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,040
and you can see like this would we'll

1711
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:33,599
just once we get this right you know

1712
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:35,439
once or or at least close to right

1713
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,960
um you can see this will just become a

1714
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:39,119
generic routine right where you'll just

1715
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,000
pass the attack pattern and it'll like

1716
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:43,198
push the transformed version on

1717
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,800
right so

1718
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:48,799
what we would do here is we'd loop

1719
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,800
through these we have the attack pattern

1720
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,238
we pull out like one of the moves and

1721
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:03,279
now we just translate that move which is

1722
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:04,158
encoded in like canonical form

1723
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:07,439
into

1724
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:11,119
whatever the actual move is

1725
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:11,119
so like in our move cube

1726
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:16,079
um maybe i'll call this source right

1727
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:19,519
um

1728
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:19,769
and then i've got a desk which would be

1729
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,040
the

1730
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:23,040
[Music]

1731
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:26,079
the translated version

1732
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:27,679
so the delta equals the canonical delta

1733
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:31,439
right so we

1734
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:33,029
we know we have an attack x and attack y

1735
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:35,279
so we just transform

1736
01:11:33,029 --> 01:11:37,198
[Music]

1737
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:40,000
the move

1738
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,678
from its canonical form

1739
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,840
direction right

1740
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:46,079
uh by just doing standard you know

1741
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:49,279
standard transform right

1742
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:51,519
uh the damage is the part we don't know

1743
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:53,039
so this is like

1744
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,040
hey this is the temporary thing i was

1745
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:56,238
talking about right

1746
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:57,679
we don't know

1747
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:58,879
um so we can just throw that in there of

1748
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,840
course well four quarter won't like it

1749
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:04,079
so we'll put it before the semicolon

1750
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,079
um

1751
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:09,519
so we have a damage we have a speed and

1752
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:12,000
those are the things like that like the

1753
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,600
stat system is gonna have to supply

1754
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,800
eventually like i don't know what these

1755
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,199
are so we'll just

1756
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,199
set them to just random values here and

1757
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:21,519
we'll figure that out later

1758
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:22,960
um and then we've got our flags i don't

1759
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,120
know why this is called interruptible

1760
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,679
still supposed to be called flags forgot

1761
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:27,679
to change it

1762
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,640
and so now hopefully you can kind of see

1763
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:34,158
what i was talking about right so this

1764
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,079
comes together pretty nicely so

1765
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:37,920
basically these are the kinds of things

1766
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:39,119
we would define like these little attack

1767
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,800
patterns

1768
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:43,840
and then when we go into the

1769
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,440
actual

1770
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:49,360
uh to issue like an attack for a monstar

1771
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:52,559
or uh you know well it doesn't matter

1772
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:52,559
for anything right

1773
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,400
um

1774
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,679
we translate them from their canonical

1775
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:01,759
like pattern into an actual like correct

1776
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:04,399
facing direction

1777
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,719
um for the for the entity

1778
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:06,719
and

1779
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:13,359
i think that's basically it

1780
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:13,359
right

1781
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:22,238
so this has to be predicated on

1782
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,080
a few things like

1783
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:26,238
you have to have room

1784
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:26,238
so

1785
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:33,158
if the entities

1786
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,158
move cue

1787
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,158
if the move q count

1788
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:39,359
for the entity

1789
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:41,759
plus the

1790
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:44,719
the thing that you're trying to do

1791
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:48,800
um that would have to be less than the

1792
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:51,600
size of the actual move queue so there's

1793
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,960
probably that's never going to actually

1794
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,800
be a thing

1795
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,679
because presumably

1796
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:01,840
we simply will always set this value in

1797
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:01,840
fact we may just want to do this

1798
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,718
yeah

1799
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:10,000
what what is

1800
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,000
what is happening

1801
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:12,719
ryan

1802
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,840
ryan what is this

1803
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:26,359
can somebody go ask ryan what that what

1804
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,359
is happening right now

1805
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:38,079
so oh it's showing me

1806
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:40,880
the definition of a cert

1807
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:42,399
but it's it has grabbed

1808
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,960
like the entire

1809
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:44,960
thing

1810
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,920
or something

1811
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:03,679
yeah okay so you can see like it's got

1812
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,399
this heads up thing down here i guess

1813
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:09,480
where like i'm on

1814
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:11,359
if i'm on a function

1815
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:13,759
[Music]

1816
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:15,039
it shows the prototype of the function

1817
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,400
that's kind of cool i didn't know that

1818
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:18,000
was there

1819
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:21,119
and then i guess it's just it's just

1820
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,119
failing look at that

1821
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:25,279
look at how fancy

1822
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,760
i seriously have never noticed that it

1823
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:27,759
does that

1824
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,239
i gotta set the color is probably better

1825
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:35,199
because you can't read it but

1826
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,879
um

1827
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:39,839
that's kind of nice isn't that that

1828
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,840
seems kind of nice

1829
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:02,000
anyway

1830
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:02,799
um

1831
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,319
so

1832
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,199
the point is

1833
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:09,359
ignoring all that uh move q overflow is

1834
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:10,879
probably something we want to

1835
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:13,519
warn on

1836
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,560
in debug because

1837
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,520
we

1838
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,600
this

1839
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:20,560
move group count thing

1840
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,640
is the gameplay restriction like hey if

1841
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,960
this glove has two aftertouch then you

1842
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:26,800
can queue up two moves

1843
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,239
but you should never run out of space in

1844
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,239
the move queue because the move queue

1845
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:31,919
should just be set to

1846
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:34,559
if the maximum length of an attack

1847
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,600
pattern is eight and the maximum amount

1848
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,600
of time of

1849
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,920
after touch you can have is three then

1850
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,399
the move queue should be 24 long right

1851
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,760
we we should never you should never

1852
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:46,879
actually

1853
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,039
um

1854
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,560
end up in a in a place

1855
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:52,640
where you

1856
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,800
um

1857
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,440
where you overflow the move queue that's

1858
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:00,159
probably just a bug right

1859
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:02,079
so what we'd like to do there is it just

1860
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:05,198
set that properly and so i'd if this

1861
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:05,920
ever tops out i'd rather get told about

1862
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:08,639
it

1863
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:10,560
in development mode than it just

1864
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,320
silently handling it and moving on

1865
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,440
because it's a subtle gameplay bug at

1866
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,920
that point

1867
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:18,000
right um as opposed to like a crash or

1868
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,158
something so you'd never really know it

1869
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
would just feel like something didn't

1870
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:24,559
quite happen and you might miss it so

1871
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,119
i'd rather have that like be loud and

1872
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,360
and stop everything

1873
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:29,359
um

1874
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:35,760
so we've got uh

1875
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:39,199
another condition here which is that

1876
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:40,719
um you would have to the move group

1877
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:43,719
count

1878
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,719
uh

1879
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:47,359
also why is this

1880
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,719
what's the error here

1881
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,360
oh it's not entity it's glove

1882
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:08,639
um

1883
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:09,839
so what we want to do here is just

1884
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,679
make sure

1885
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,880
that we

1886
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:15,039
always

1887
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,199
have enough

1888
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,479
um like the move group count for the

1889
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:20,479
glove

1890
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:22,879
we want to make sure that the movement

1891
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:25,678
move group count is always less than

1892
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,000
whatever our magical like way of saying

1893
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:29,840
what the stat is

1894
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,840
we don't know what that is but like it's

1895
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,159
gonna be a thing

1896
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,159
um

1897
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,800
and like this is where we now get into

1898
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:42,000
the part that i was saying like i don't

1899
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:45,520
really know what we're gonna do

1900
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,760
we need to evaluate we need to have some

1901
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:51,320
way of evaluating what the stats are on

1902
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,320
things and

1903
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,238
i do not really know um

1904
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,859
so i don't really know

1905
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:53,029
um

1906
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:53,029
[Music]

1907
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:57,759
should the if just be the assert no

1908
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:59,279
because if if we did screw that

1909
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:02,079
counting up we don't want the game to

1910
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:03,439
crash or something right

1911
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:05,198
that would literally just corrupt the

1912
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:07,839
entity table

1913
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:07,839
you know what i'm saying

1914
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:13,679
so so no definitely not you want to

1915
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:16,719
bounce check that

1916
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:17,600
uh that push

1917
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,800
um

1918
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,039
so yeah

1919
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:23,039
now we are at the part where we got to

1920
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,439
think about how yeah how we were going

1921
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:26,399
to evaluate the stats we don't care so

1922
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:29,359
much

1923
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:31,039
about what we're evaluating because we

1924
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:36,399
don't really know

1925
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:36,399
um but we do have the problem of

1926
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:48,719
how how are we going to when do we

1927
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,960
produce like the aggregate stats for an

1928
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:53,039
entity because like

1929
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,359
we're gonna want to sort of have the

1930
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:56,399
stats for the entity be based on things

1931
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,079
that

1932
01:20:56,399 --> 01:20:59,759
may be very like

1933
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:01,198
game play

1934
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,719
squishy right

1935
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:03,919
like oh

1936
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:07,600
you

1937
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:09,840
get a plus one damage modifier for the

1938
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,840
next five rooms

1939
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,199
and

1940
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:17,360
i

1941
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:19,439
get plus plus one to move square b

1942
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:20,559
damage

1943
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:21,599
uh

1944
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,239
or like

1945
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,400
the the glove is

1946
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:27,359
interruptable always

1947
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:31,039
for

1948
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:32,399
this period of time or whatever you know

1949
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:34,000
um

1950
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:36,799
when you want to add those kind of

1951
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,760
roguelike nonsense things

1952
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:43,360
uh you need like some kind of a coherent

1953
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:47,119
place where that happens and presumably

1954
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:49,039
we want to not do it just in time like

1955
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:51,198
presumably we want to do a thing where

1956
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:51,198
we

1957
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,029
where we just like evaluate everything

1958
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,199
at the head of the frame

1959
01:21:56,029 --> 01:22:00,960
[Music]

1960
01:21:57,198 --> 01:22:02,559
and produce one set of composite stats

1961
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,880
for the entity

1962
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,880
i'm guessing

1963
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,039
you know

1964
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:23,519
like i don't know my assumption is just

1965
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:25,519
like there should probably be a thing

1966
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,639
where we assume that

1967
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:30,960
at the start of the round right like

1968
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:32,159
before brains are

1969
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,039
like

1970
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:37,039
evaluated so before like you know you or

1971
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:40,238
the ais sort of like

1972
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:45,560
put in the commands for that frame

1973
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:45,559
i like i assume what we would want to do

1974
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:06,158
i assume what we would want to do is do

1975
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,600
that i don't know

1976
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:08,719
like i said i don't have stronger pants

1977
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,639
values because i kind of have to make it

1978
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:13,600
up as i go along because i don't do this

1979
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,600
type of code normally

1980
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:19,759
but like

1981
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,520
so you see this i mean this is basically

1982
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,400
the structure of the game update loop

1983
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,679
right

1984
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:26,638
so basically brains run first

1985
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,199
and they

1986
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:30,719
you know control what's going to happen

1987
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:32,158
on that frame like what things are

1988
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,119
trying to do

1989
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:34,879
um

1990
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:36,639
and then

1991
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,079
we do update and render entities to like

1992
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:40,639
flush everything out

1993
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:43,519
i could imagine doing like

1994
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:47,039
uh before

1995
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:50,159
like uh one more loop up here right

1996
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:53,198
that does

1997
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:53,198
that does the

1998
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,840
compute what the entity stats are for

1999
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,600
this frame or

2000
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:02,639
slightly differently

2001
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:05,039
at the tail of this so when we do update

2002
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:07,359
and render entities

2003
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:09,199
and we loop through all the entities

2004
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:10,319
we produce the

2005
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:13,760
[Music]

2006
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:15,119
statistics for the next frame at the at

2007
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,119
the end

2008
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:18,399
right

2009
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:22,039
um

2010
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:22,039
if that makes sense

2011
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,960
um

2012
01:24:58,238 --> 01:25:01,279
i guess i would say

2013
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:05,920
the

2014
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:05,920
the latter thing sounds

2015
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,840
i mean

2016
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:44,960
i again don't really have a strong

2017
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,719
opinion about it but i think what i

2018
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,399
would say is it seems to me like

2019
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:51,198
probably the smartest thing to do here

2020
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:53,359
would be to put that where you do update

2021
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:54,799
and render entities because you're

2022
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:56,559
always going to want to look at these

2023
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,719
stats all the time for all the stuff

2024
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,320
you're doing right

2025
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,239
and so presumably you just want to

2026
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:04,479
compute it

2027
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:07,479
that time

2028
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:07,479
now

2029
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:16,079
i feel like this is easier said than

2030
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,319
done because we sort of now have to

2031
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:23,079
address how we want to handle a bunch of

2032
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:23,079
things that current or previously

2033
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,760
we just haven't really looked at

2034
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:32,319
like for example we don't have any

2035
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,639
opinion on how we want

2036
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:34,639
our

2037
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:40,800
like how do you even get power-ups or

2038
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,000
items or things like that

2039
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,000
right

2040
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
um

2041
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,159
and i don't know i might want to think

2042
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:55,198
about it uh how much time are we going

2043
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:56,479
for

2044
01:26:55,198 --> 01:26:58,238
all right it might it's going to be

2045
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:59,759
pretty short today actually because uh i

2046
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:00,959
got a bunch of stuff i have to do before

2047
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,760
tomorrow so

2048
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:06,399
i probably won't go very long um i don't

2049
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:09,119
actually know what time it is but

2050
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:09,119
what time is it

2051
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:16,839
2 30.

2052
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,840
um

2053
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,840
so uh so i do think we kind of have like

2054
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,920
two separate we have two separate things

2055
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,560
we have to sort of do we've got to do

2056
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:30,880
the move q stuff which seems easier

2057
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:33,199
like i've mostly got that

2058
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,600
how i think that would work

2059
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:35,678
but the stats thing

2060
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,760
[Music]

2061
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,440
is harder because even just the things

2062
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,679
i'm thinking about right now i'm not

2063
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:44,719
sure what the most

2064
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:46,399
like sensible way is of doing those

2065
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:48,960
sorts of things

2066
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:51,359
uh in here right like

2067
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,119
again it's a case of like i'm sure i

2068
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:55,119
would have a strong opinion about that

2069
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:57,359
had i done this kind of code typically

2070
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:59,439
but i don't

2071
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:00,639
so like if you imagine what happens in

2072
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:02,238
here

2073
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:04,319
you

2074
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:06,879
you figure at some point you're going to

2075
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:08,079
pick up an item

2076
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:11,279
and

2077
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:11,279
the question is just

2078
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:18,000
um how does that item

2079
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:26,800
how does that item get its stats

2080
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:28,959
conferred to you so

2081
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,880
let's take the simplest possible case

2082
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,480
and work from there because that's you

2083
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:35,840
know

2084
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:38,839
we don't want to over complicate things

2085
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,840
um

2086
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:51,440
i would say

2087
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:57,840
imagine like we want the hero to pick up

2088
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,840
a hat

2089
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:03,519
so

2090
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:06,639
there's a hat

2091
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:08,400
and the hat

2092
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:11,359
is

2093
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:13,359
swappable so if the hero picks up a

2094
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:17,679
different hat

2095
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:17,679
they drop the hat they currently have

2096
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:23,119
right

2097
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:25,198
so they can only wear one hat at a time

2098
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:27,840
and they pick up different hats

2099
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:30,079
throughout the game potentially so you

2100
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,079
know one of the hats

2101
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:35,119
gives you plus one damage and the other

2102
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:38,319
gives you plus one speed or whatever

2103
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:39,760
so you want while you're wearing hat a

2104
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:42,000
you want plus one damage while you're

2105
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:43,360
wearing hat b you want plus one speed

2106
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,600
and you just want them to be able to

2107
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:47,839
switch at any time like when they hop

2108
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,840
over

2109
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:52,559
a different thing it should switch and

2110
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:54,800
your stats should change

2111
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,800
um

2112
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,920
i'm too tired today

2113
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:07,840
gary sleep

2114
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:07,840
and i didn't have any coffee

2115
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,399
well that's not true i had decaf coffee

2116
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:14,639
but that's same as not having coffee

2117
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:14,638
um

2118
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,399
so the question is

2119
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,079
those are obviously have to be entities

2120
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:22,960
so because they're going to exist in the

2121
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:24,960
world

2122
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:28,158
and you can drop them and they get drawn

2123
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:29,439
right so the hats are obviously entities

2124
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:31,679
the

2125
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:31,678
uh

2126
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:38,479
the entity system would presumably just

2127
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:40,799
need a thing that was like i'm carried

2128
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:40,799
by

2129
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:45,079
and

2130
01:30:55,359 --> 01:31:00,439
and then the question is just like how

2131
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,439
do we efficiently

2132
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,880
how do we efficiently say that you add

2133
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:10,359
your stats into the person who you're

2134
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,359
carried by

2135
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:31,119
one way that comes to mind is you just

2136
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,880
have like a ping-pong buffer where you

2137
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:35,760
basically say like entity stats

2138
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:38,000
ping-pong in this thing

2139
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,199
seems like over-complicated

2140
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,319
but you have

2141
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:44,759
you know

2142
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:44,759
if you don't want to do multiple passes

2143
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:49,399
i'm not sure what else you do

2144
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:02,000
because if you're going through all the

2145
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,520
entities and you want to go through the

2146
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,319
entities only that one time

2147
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,679
you know like you you only want to go

2148
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:11,519
through them

2149
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:13,840
of course are we already you know could

2150
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,840
we just do this when we initially do the

2151
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,840
unpack

2152
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:37,599
so i suppose i don't really know

2153
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:40,000
um

2154
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:42,719
there's sort of the world unpacking

2155
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,319
process here right there's

2156
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:49,319
begin sim simulate and sim

2157
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:49,319
and

2158
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:20,638
we we operate with entities like in the

2159
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:21,679
cache

2160
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:25,159
right

2161
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:25,158
and the sim

2162
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:09,440
so like

2163
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:11,919
since we rebuild this thing every time

2164
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:14,238
i guess the thing we could do here

2165
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,239
is

2166
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:21,678
we could just say

2167
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,679
okay we clear

2168
01:34:24,319 --> 01:34:27,319
hmm

2169
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,279
i'm just not sure i'm just not sure how

2170
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:37,279
you want this to work

2171
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:47,840
when we add the entity to the hash

2172
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:51,359
that's means this that the entity is

2173
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,710
gonna get operated on this frame

2174
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:54,399
um

2175
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:56,639
[Music]

2176
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:56,638
we

2177
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:03,520
we could clear

2178
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:03,519
a stat holder at that point

2179
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:08,960
and move

2180
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:11,600
i mean

2181
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:13,198
like here's the thing i was thinking i i

2182
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,840
don't know if i think this is

2183
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:15,839
particularly good

2184
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:34,238
so here's add entity to hash

2185
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,239
um

2186
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:40,000
and when it goes into the hash

2187
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,039
at this point you could do a thing where

2188
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,800
you said all right

2189
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:47,519
the entities

2190
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:50,520
like active stats

2191
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,520
um

2192
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:02,638
you could do something like this

2193
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,319
where when the entity gets brought into

2194
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:05,600
the working set of entities for a

2195
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:08,639
simulation

2196
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:10,639
it basically says hey okay we're gonna

2197
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:13,520
take all the accumulated stats for the

2198
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:14,560
entity at that point we're going to

2199
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,239
move them

2200
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,840
and say that they are now the active

2201
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:20,238
stats for the entity that will operate

2202
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:23,520
across this particular frame

2203
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:25,919
um and then we clear out the accumulator

2204
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,360
then when we update all of the entities

2205
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,600
when we go through the thing calling

2206
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:31,679
update entities

2207
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:34,079
we just say

2208
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,079
that

2209
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:39,520
if you are someone who affects another

2210
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:43,118
entity you accumulate at that point

2211
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:44,880
right so it's like one frame

2212
01:36:43,118 --> 01:36:47,439
that you know

2213
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,600
every frame you recon you recompute the

2214
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:51,519
stats as part of the sweep

2215
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,280
and then the next frame those stats take

2216
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:56,679
effect

2217
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:56,679
you know what i mean

2218
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:11,039
anyone

2219
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:20,198
anyone

2220
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,840
no

2221
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:28,719
that's just that's just a vague guess

2222
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,480
right

2223
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:34,359
that's just a vague guess

2224
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:34,359
so in the entity struct

2225
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:42,238
uh we would just have

2226
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:43,600
like whatever the stats are

2227
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:45,118
um

2228
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,800
that we keep

2229
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:49,839
which you know again we really don't

2230
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,840
know what that looks like

2231
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,760
there would be a thing that's like

2232
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:56,560
accumulation stats

2233
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,760
uh

2234
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:00,320
and

2235
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,320
active stats

2236
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:03,759
that are just things that you work on

2237
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:04,559
there

2238
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,280
uh

2239
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,280
and then

2240
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:15,599
we have the base stats up here right

2241
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,679
and so basically like every time you

2242
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,880
you kind of just like work through that

2243
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:20,319
have you considered dynamically

2244
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,600
calculating stats based on the current

2245
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:25,759
modifiers

2246
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:25,760
i mean that is what we're doing

2247
01:38:26,399 --> 01:38:31,279
do you mean every time you go to look at

2248
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:33,519
an entity's stat for any reason you

2249
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:35,840
recompute all the stats on the fly right

2250
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,840
there

2251
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:41,118
is that what you mean like the

2252
01:38:39,439 --> 01:38:43,678
like when you need want to ask a

2253
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:46,079
question about the damage you go iterate

2254
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,079
through all the entities that might be

2255
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:50,880
affecting the damage and you compute it

2256
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:50,880
just right there

2257
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:53,519
um

2258
01:38:54,399 --> 01:39:01,039
i mean you could do that but that sounds

2259
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:04,480
kind of

2260
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:05,920
risky right like as things start as more

2261
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:08,319
things start to happen on the screen

2262
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,560
you're suddenly potentially recomputing

2263
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:13,559
the same thing like many many many times

2264
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:13,560
right

2265
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:21,039
and furthermore you'd have to create

2266
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:23,118
acceleration structures specific to that

2267
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:25,039
because like how do you even know which

2268
01:39:23,118 --> 01:39:28,000
entities might affect it so you'd have

2269
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:31,039
to start keeping like a list

2270
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,960
like here's all the entities that

2271
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:36,479
are currently potentially affecting this

2272
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:36,480
person's damage level right

2273
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:44,399
i mean and why bother

2274
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:45,839
you know like why bother when you could

2275
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:47,279
just

2276
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,400
while you're sweeping over all the

2277
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:50,399
entities which you know you're going to

2278
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:51,089
do to do their update anyway why not

2279
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:52,479
just have them

2280
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:54,400

dump stats into anyone who they think

2282
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:58,879
they affect at that time

2283
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:01,359
and that way there's really no need for

2284
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,359
additional

2285
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:05,439
thought

2286
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,679
to it

2287
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:10,319
probably right i mean doesn't it seem

2288
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,800
just more sane to not do it that way to

2289
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:14,639
not to not have to have

2290
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,880
ways of quickly coming up with these

2291
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:19,760
values

2292
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,760
just in the moment

2293
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:23,839
so that you don't have to care

2294
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:39,279
they never get stale well they might i

2295
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,119
mean they might actually be

2296
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:44,079
you you still have the order dependency

2297
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:45,920
problem right so if you compute the stat

2298
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:47,198
when you ask for it

2299
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:50,319
well

2300
01:40:47,198 --> 01:40:52,079
what if a one of the other entities that

2301
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:54,158
would have affected your stats hasn't

2302
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:57,279
updated yet that frame

2303
01:40:54,158 --> 01:41:00,559
and you so when you go look and see oh

2304
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:02,960
that entity is gonna have it says it has

2305
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:05,920
five damage or whatever so you add that

2306
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:07,439
five damage into your computation then

2307
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:10,880
you get to that other entity in the

2308
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:13,118
update step and oh it turns out it died

2309
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,239
so it shouldn't have contributed right

2310
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:15,679
or whatever

2311
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:17,519
so

2312
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:19,840
you really aren't

2313
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,760
it's not really more correct

2314
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:24,239
it's just different right it's just a

2315
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:26,079
different order of operations but it can

2316
01:41:24,238 --> 01:41:27,759
still totally be wrong

2317
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:29,439
in exactly the same way this could be

2318
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:30,719
wrong because you'd have the opposite

2319
01:41:29,439 --> 01:41:32,960
problem here

2320
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:36,079
where it's like well

2321
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:38,158
you're going to use

2322
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:39,840
the previous

2323
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:42,158
like

2324
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,550
you're going to use

2325
01:41:42,158 --> 01:41:44,000
the

2326
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:45,199
[Music]

2327
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,319
post

2328
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:49,919
update state of the entity on the last

2329
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:52,238
frame always

2330
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,239
right

2331
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:56,719
and never

2332
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:59,839
the post

2333
01:41:56,719 --> 01:42:01,279
value from this frame

2334
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,719
maybe is

2335
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:04,960
better or maybe is worse but at least

2336
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:07,760
it's consistent whereas the just in time

2337
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:10,319
one you have no idea it just depends on

2338
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:13,320
the order of updates of the entities

2339
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:13,319
right

2340
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:27,519
in fact as i'm saying it i think there's

2341
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,679
actually a good reason not to do it the

2342
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,679
way you're suggesting because that would

2343
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:33,359
always be order dependent like which

2344
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:36,719
order do you update the entities and

2345
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:39,679
determines what the outcome is of that

2346
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:41,118
of those stat roles we're using the a

2347
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:43,279
definitive set of stats that get

2348
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:45,679
computed on the final frame seems a lot

2349
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:49,679
better because at least then it doesn't

2350
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:52,079
matter what order you ask the stats in

2351
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:52,079
you know

2352
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:57,118
so i think i'm kind of skeptical of the

2353
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:59,039
approach that you're saying now that i

2354
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:01,279
think about it

2355
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:03,519
i think that sounds more error-prone not

2356
01:43:01,279 --> 01:43:05,198
less

2357
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:07,360
whereas if you update the stats every

2358
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:08,960
frame

2359
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:11,039
in a

2360
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:13,520
double buffered way basically then you

2361
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:15,198
know that the stats for any given frame

2362
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,280
are what they are they don't change

2363
01:43:15,198 --> 01:43:19,279
based on where you are in the entity

2364
01:43:17,279 --> 01:43:21,679
update order you don't suddenly use a

2365
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:24,840
different set of stats halfway through

2366
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:24,840
you know

2367
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,439
so i think i think i would say that it

2368
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:43,920
does seem like that's something you

2369
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:48,719
would want

2370
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:48,719
i don't know hard to say uh but

2371
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,960
seems like it uh

2372
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:56,000
this

2373
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:59,359
is not really necessary because hey is

2374
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,359
that the only a tan two

2375
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,400
how many a tan twos do we have

2376
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:08,719
sadly we do have

2377
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:14,119
looks like we do have one atoms in there

2378
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:44,560
i see what we did here we just we just

2379
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:45,920
wanted to be able to do the orbit and

2380
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:48,080
pitch values

2381
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:51,840
reverse engineer them from where the

2382
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:53,600
camera currently was which is you know

2383
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,400
it's noble

2384
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,840
um anyway

2385
01:44:56,399 --> 01:45:00,399
so

2386
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:04,239
this thing is just

2387
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:08,559
the d sword y d sword x thing right

2388
01:45:04,238 --> 01:45:12,000
so the facing direction here i think

2389
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:13,280
we could probably just write down

2390
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,000
um

2391
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:18,479
but it is just the attack x vector so i

2392
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,359
think i think this can just be subbed in

2393
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:21,919
for this

2394
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:23,839
moment we shouldn't we should just set a

2395
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,960
separate value for that and not do it

2396
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:27,199
that way

2397
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:29,520
um

2398
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:31,439
sort of a separate issue but

2399
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,719
uh let's go back to what we were looking

2400
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:35,599
at here

2401
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:38,960
so we do want the glove

2402
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,960
stats um

2403
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:44,079
and maybe since we're going to be

2404
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:45,760
referring to these like lots of times we

2405
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:49,359
want to just call them instead of active

2406
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:52,719
stats maybe we just call them the stats

2407
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:55,719
it's that stats is a

2408
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:55,719
function

2409
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,119
it's it's in c time

2410
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:14,000
i like that we're loading c time as part

2411
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:15,039
of the uh

2412
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,158
dev

2413
01:46:15,039 --> 01:46:19,439
bell biv devotes set here

2414
01:46:18,158 --> 01:46:20,399
um

2415
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:21,198
okay

2416
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:22,638
so

2417
01:46:21,198 --> 01:46:24,638
i think maybe we just call it stats

2418
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:28,319
because that's what everyone uses and

2419
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:28,319
then there's like a stats of hume

2420
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:32,479
right uh

2421
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:34,319
and then the base stats are like a

2422
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:35,839
different thing right or whatever blah

2423
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:38,639
blah blah

2424
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:41,840
so in here we would do something like

2425
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:41,840
this uh

2426
01:46:44,319 --> 01:46:48,399
i'm i'm not gonna say that it's gonna

2427
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:51,440
look exactly like this because

2428
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:55,439
it's probably not

2429
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:58,000
uh but it will look something like this

2430
01:46:55,439 --> 01:47:02,198
right when we add the entity to the hash

2431
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,198
we would have like uh

2432
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:15,118
maybe like the get or or um

2433
01:47:15,279 --> 01:47:19,359
advanced

2434
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:21,118
entity stats or something like that

2435
01:47:19,359 --> 01:47:22,880
and so we would call

2436
01:47:21,118 --> 01:47:27,359
a function here

2437
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:27,359
that was just like advanced entity stats

2438
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:33,678
and i'll grab that out and put it here

2439
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:39,119
when we see that we do the little double

2440
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:39,118
buffer swap

2441
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:46,719
so we're good to go

2442
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:48,000
uh and that maybe goes into the entity

2443
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:48,800
side of things

2444
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,800
right

2445
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:51,800
so

2446
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,520
there's this

2447
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
and

2448
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,279
i guess

2449
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,079
then anyone can look at what those stats

2450
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:12,559
are

2451
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:12,559
like so

2452
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:19,119
and choose to make decisions about it

2453
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:19,960
um

2454
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:23,039
in

2455
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:24,800
fact you could even sketch out what this

2456
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:26,800
looks like at that point

2457
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,159
because now you could say

2458
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:31,600
well

2459
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:34,879
whatever the move pattern entries

2460
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,880
square type was

2461
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:38,079
you could do

2462
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:46,079
the glove stats

2463
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:48,719
um

2464
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:51,519
damage for that

2465
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:53,039
move square type

2466
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:57,199
right

2467
01:48:53,039 --> 01:49:00,840
so glove stats speed for that

2468
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:00,839
move square type

2469
01:49:01,198 --> 01:49:06,559
and and now it's actually sort of

2470
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:07,920
a thing

2471
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:10,159
um i'm going to get rid of the

2472
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:11,600
coefficient thing for now because hey

2473
01:49:10,158 --> 01:49:12,638
like

2474
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,800
i don't really know what we're doing

2475
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:16,639
here so i'm just going to say it looks

2476
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,000
maybe like that

2477
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:19,920
um and then we'll figure out how the

2478
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,439
coefficient stuff would work later like

2479
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:23,440
we'll figure out how to get something

2480
01:49:21,439 --> 01:49:27,039
fancier in there

2481
01:49:23,439 --> 01:49:29,919
when ready uh the entry count

2482
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:32,420
thing for attack pattern

2483
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:34,560
it's actually move count

2484
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:36,880
[Music]

2485
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,880
um

2486
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:39,678
same

2487
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:43,039
here

2488
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:44,960
and then the move cue entry dest

2489
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:49,519
this

2490
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,520
is actually the glove move cue

2491
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:53,440
first of all this should be a star we're

2492
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:54,840
writing to it

2493
01:49:53,439 --> 01:49:58,799
so there's

2494
01:49:54,840 --> 01:50:00,960
that but the move cue

2495
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:02,079
it's just whichever

2496
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,679
is

2497
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:05,679
actually this value

2498
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:12,238
and each time we push something on we

2499
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:12,239
want to advance that volume

2500
01:50:17,198 --> 01:50:19,519
all right

2501
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:25,920
so i think that's basically it the

2502
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:28,158
glove with hero following

2503
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:30,639
stuff is sort of like a separate issue

2504
01:50:28,158 --> 01:50:31,839
now and i don't actually know what we're

2505
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:33,520
gonna do with that so maybe we'll save

2506
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:37,279
that until next time but i think we're

2507
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:37,280
more or less where we need to be

2508
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:42,719
so i think that was good uh i'm sure

2509
01:50:40,238 --> 01:50:45,519
this isn't great because like i said i i

2510
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:47,840
don't write this kind of code

2511
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,520
for a living so

2512
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,960
i don't know

2513
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,920
but

2514
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,800
that looks like a solid enough stab

2515
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:58,079
and

2516
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:59,599
now we can go set some stats and try to

2517
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:01,840
like actually implement the move and

2518
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:05,960
attack stuff in some way and we'll just

2519
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:05,960
we'll see what happens right

2520
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:09,158
um

2521
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:27,759
i would say that if we just take the

2522
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:29,760
delta between these two so if we just

2523
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:32,639
said like

2524
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:37,039
hey there's a glove distance

2525
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:37,039
uh that's just like the length squared

2526
01:51:37,118 --> 01:51:40,319
um between

2527
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,840
wherever the glove is and wherever the

2528
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:46,238
body is

2529
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:49,440
um and if the glove distance squared is

2530
01:51:46,238 --> 01:51:51,039
less than you know whatever

2531
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:52,719
i don't know what it is

2532
01:51:51,039 --> 01:51:54,079
something like that

2533
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:57,960
then you're

2534
01:51:54,079 --> 01:51:57,960
you're back with the guy

2535
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:08,159
you know what i mean

2536
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:11,279
um

2537
01:52:09,198 --> 01:52:12,719
now this would presumably only happen

2538
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:14,158
when there wasn't anything in the move

2539
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:15,279
queue

2540
01:52:14,158 --> 01:52:18,079
uh

2541
01:52:15,279 --> 01:52:20,158
so right you're only going to reset it

2542
01:52:18,079 --> 01:52:22,800
if there's nothing in the queue and

2543
01:52:20,158 --> 01:52:26,399
you're back then you do this

2544
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:28,239
um and off we go now there's

2545
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:32,238
probably a few other little things in

2546
01:52:28,238 --> 01:52:34,158
here like okay if the move q count is

2547
01:52:32,238 --> 01:52:36,479
zero

2548
01:52:34,158 --> 01:52:36,479
um

2549
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:48,399
and you didn't attack

2550
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:52,320
you would want the glove to like find

2551
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:54,638
its way back towards the hero

2552
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:54,639
so

2553
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,079
like the actual target like basically i

2554
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:01,118
think we do next time is like okay now

2555
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:02,238
we're gonna actually start the movement

2556
01:53:01,118 --> 01:53:03,920
code because we kind of know how

2557
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:05,919
everything is going here

2558
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:08,239
um

2559
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:08,239
you know

2560
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:17,760
like set a return move when there's no

2561
01:53:15,118 --> 01:53:19,598
moves in the queue

2562
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:20,400
um or

2563
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:22,000
where

2564
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:23,598
does

2565
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,560
does the movement

2566
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:27,360
code

2567
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:30,159
live for that i don't know

2568
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:32,079
so i think that's basically it

2569
01:53:30,158 --> 01:53:33,839
um i'm going to say that's it for today

2570
01:53:32,079 --> 01:53:36,399
because like i said it has to kind of be

2571
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:39,360
a short day

2572
01:53:36,399 --> 01:53:42,319
that was a little

2573
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:44,079
it was a little bit like okay

2574
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:46,079
let's just try to poke around in here

2575
01:53:44,079 --> 01:53:48,399
and see what the heck makes sense but

2576
01:53:46,079 --> 01:53:51,679
that seems good

2577
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:54,319
i'm relatively happy with that uh and i

2578
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:56,480
think it'd be pretty easy for us to put

2579
01:53:54,319 --> 01:53:56,479
that

2580
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:00,639
to like use the same stuff for multiple

2581
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:02,960
things so i think enemies can use that

2582
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:04,880
as well

2583
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:06,960
and it'll be reasonable so

2584
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,639
all right

2585
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:10,880
that's about it

2586
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:13,359
um i'ma wrap it up

2587
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:16,639
thank you everyone for joining me

2588
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:18,079
and i will maybe find someone to raid

2589
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:20,400
maybe

2590
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:20,399
um

2591
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:26,639
i guess we'll see if john is streaming

2592
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:27,129
of course he's not

2593
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:29,199
um

2594
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:32,199
[Music]

2595
01:54:29,198 --> 01:54:32,198
well

2596
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:47,199
uh yeah

2597
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,118
i guess we're

2598
01:54:47,198 --> 01:54:50,559
we don't know so you're gonna have to

2599
01:54:49,118 --> 01:54:52,319
find your own thing

2600
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:53,199
and i'm sure you will

2601
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:55,279
and

2602
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:59,439
and i wish you the best of luck on that

2603
01:54:55,279 --> 01:54:59,439
stream take it easy everybody
