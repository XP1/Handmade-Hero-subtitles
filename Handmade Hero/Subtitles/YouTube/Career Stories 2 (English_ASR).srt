00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,339
hello everyone and welcome to the second

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,859
part of the career stories stream that

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,798
we're doing here I decided to break this

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:16,890
up into two parts because there was well

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:20,189
there was a lot of people who wrote in

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,960
and I just kind of wanted to get

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,089
basically everything that people wrote

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,070
into me I wanted to read all of it

9
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,329
because I thought it was all pretty

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,118
valuable stuff and pretty interesting

11
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,439
stuff that would help folks who are

12
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,119
interested in this sort of thing so if

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,738
he hadn't didn't catch the first stream

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,479
I would highly recommend starting with

15
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,599
the first stream these make sense

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,519
together so you know these hopefully are

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,039
posted in such a way you know check the

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,510
check the notes on the video and it

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,429
should tell you how to get to the first

20
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:50,159
one if you if you're not on a page that

21
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,869
has them both presented together but

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,689
definitely start with the first one this

23
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:58,468
is the second part of a two-part series

24
00:00:54,689 --> 00:01:01,439
on essentially career stories where I

25
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,588
asked people to write in and tell me

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:09,179
about their experiences changing careers

27
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:11,129
from one you know area of you know could

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,290
have been something close to programming

29
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,030
like information technology or something

30
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,368
like this or it could be something very

31
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,019
far from programming I you know

32
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,509
restaurant management or something like

33
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,908
this it did you know anything

34
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:27,000
construction work architecture whatever

35
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:31,229
it was went from a career in that or a

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,180
focus in that in their lives to actually

37
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:34,709
becoming a software developer or trying

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,930
to become a soft developer and failing

39
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,669
it was not just a request for success

40
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,189
stories it was just a request for

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,170
attempt stories and if you know it

42
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:46,589
succeeded great if you failed great you

43
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,680
know just tell us the story and the idea

44
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,700
was that people who are interested in

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,299
potentially doing this who you know or

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,129
maybe in the shoes of the people who

47
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,610
wrote in but just ten years ago or

48
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:02,009
something like that you know they could

49
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,420
sort of get something from these stories

50
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,209
and how did it go

51
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,618
what were the experiences like it was a

52
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,568
positive experiences a negative

53
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,020
experience what were the pitfalls is

54
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:13,179
there advice that could be passed along

55
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,810
or

56
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,939
just it just feels nice to know that

57
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,449
you're not alone in this transition that

58
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:24,158
other people have done it and here's

59
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:25,658
what they experienced and you know

60
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:27,878
sometimes it just makes a difference

61
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:30,158
just to hear other people's experiences

62
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,798
it doesn't necessarily mean you have to

63
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:34,479
take something from them explicitly it's

64
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:37,510
just there's sometimes something nice

65
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,298
implicitly about hearing about how other

66
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:44,188
people have done things and so that's

67
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:46,510
what these two streams are all about and

68
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:49,780
there was more information than I

69
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:53,138
thought could fit in one stream so last

70
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,878
week I read most of the sort of shorter

71
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,500
entries and a lot of the entries are

72
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,959
fairly long which is great because they

73
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,430
they kind of tell a complete story they

74
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,569
aren't just sort of isolated little

75
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,950
snippets of advice but you know there

76
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:07,598
was a couple that were very long and

77
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:09,548
that's like I'd like to read these two

78
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,048
because there's a lot of really good

79
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,239
information on this I thought let's just

80
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:14,680
break it up into two streams people who

81
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,158
are really interested in this can

82
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,040
therefore have you know the sort of

83
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,138
ability to completely take in all of the

84
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,209
things that people said even if they

85
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,099
were particularly lengthy because

86
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,919
sometimes the lengthy ones go into the

87
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:32,768
details that you don't get in a brief

88
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,540
one and that can be very valuable so

89
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,158
again please check out the first stream

90
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:39,878
it's got a little more explanation in it

91
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,798
and sort of is organized in a particular

92
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:43,780
way to kind of like give you a

93
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,150
perspective across a number of different

94
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,239
people's stories from sort of different

95
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:52,329
backgrounds and different or previous

96
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,219
careers this stream has I think there's

97
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:56,590
only two stories but they're

98
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:58,539
particularly long and then I'll they'll

99
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,039
be some just some commentary for me at

100
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:02,560
the end where I'm just gonna kind of

101
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:05,438
talk a little bit about sort of you know

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,750
what I what I took from these stories as

103
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,969
somebody who hasn't gone through this

104
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,829
and again going back to the previous

105
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:13,359
stream that was really one of the big

106
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:15,099
reasons that I asked for this

107
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:16,989
information is because I have no

108
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:20,348
personal experience to share here I've

109
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:22,569
never made a career change at all let

110
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:24,788
alone a career change of this nature and

111
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:27,069
so I didn't feel like I was in a good

112
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:30,039
position to really offer advice to

113
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:31,779
well but I often get asked to give

114
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,790
advice about that and I just have

115
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:35,829
nothing to say and so at the end of this

116
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,790
I'll sort of say here is my read on what

117
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:41,939
came in here's what I thought I learned

118
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,350
from what people said and you know

119
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,629
obviously take that with a big grain of

120
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,189
salt because all you know it's it was

121
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:50,110
just sort of my opinion for really I

122
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:51,579
haven't gone through it myself but I

123
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,139
thought I kind of tried to sort of

124
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:55,029
summarize a little bit and then talk

125
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,639
about a couple things related to that

126
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:59,289
which is just like if we wanted to do

127
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,050
some things to help people who were in

128
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,990
this circumstance what would they be

129
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,629
well you know based on what sort of I I

130
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,699
heard being said in multiple stories

131
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:12,540
what are the sorts of things you know

132
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:17,019
that might be useful that sort of thing

133
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,310
okay so let's go now to the two stories

134
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:21,279
that I wanted to read that we didn't

135
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:24,970
have a chance to read last week this

136
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,619
first one is from Seth batten and he

137
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,600
didn't provide a Twitter link or

138
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,569
anything but he did say he could

139
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,610
attribute it to him by name and he

140
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:36,670
writes in my software career started

141
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,889
about five years ago when I was 28 but

142
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,990
in my case it was not a sudden leap into

143
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,599
a new field for one thing I didn't have

144
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,120
a career before that I had a handful of

145
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,390
crappy office jobs unrelated to my

146
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,590
bachelor's which was not in computing

147
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,689
but more importantly I applied

148
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:55,359
programming to all my jobs leading up to

149
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:57,579
that point in all cases I was sitting in

150
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,980
front of a computer anyway and I needed

151
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:02,529
software to do my job there were ample

152
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,689
opportunities for improvement so I did

153
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,509
work to practice programming in spite of

154
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:09,519
not being a professional programmer I

155
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:11,560
automated data entry I found tools that

156
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,839
did the same job I was doing manually I

157
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,399
figured out how to turn nightmarish

158
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,289
Excel spreadsheets into recently

159
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,019
normalized databases so that their

160
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,510
upkeep took fewer years of my life my

161
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:24,069
bosses certainly didn't mind my work was

162
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,259
getting done faster with fewer human

163
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:27,790
errors they even let me dedicate weeks

164
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,189
at a time to business tool development

165
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,569
because it was obviously valuable my

166
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,219
co-workers loved that they hit their

167
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:35,259
Truscott are floated to the weird kid

168
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,500
with the shitty Linux laptop who liked

169
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:40,509
priming the magic before I go any

170
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,759
further about how I learned to do that

171
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:44,949
I want to point out that I should have

172
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,230
studied computer science in school my

173
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:49,479
co-workers at all crappy jobs asked me

174
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,939
why didn't major in it and I had no

175
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,560
answer programming was my hobby and

176
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,660
unaccredited independent study in

177
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,300
college and I didn't realize it

178
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:02,710
I passed my mandatory single C++ class

179
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,139
which is intro for non non si SE non CS

180
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:08,379
science engineers and business people ie

181
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,240
stupid C++ without ever opening the

182
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,430
textbook or even fully understanding the

183
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,050
problem before the lab final when

184
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,550
programming literacy was expected in

185
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,920
other engineering courses I never

186
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,780
struggled and before that I hacked on my

187
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,819
parents home computer until it broke and

188
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:23,799
then I fixed it I played video games

189
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:25,620
that required AI programming I cheated

190
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,939
at games by editing their content files

191
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,439
all of that is to say that I've always

192
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:31,540
loved programming and the only

193
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,879
difference is that now I live that pipe

194
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,160
dream of making my hobby into a job I

195
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,129
love software as a craft science and art

196
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,689
and I feel that way that way in spite of

197
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:42,339
still having to deal with the normal

198
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:44,860
business world crap now in software

199
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:46,750
engineering form I go home at night and

200
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,250
I still want to build programs and read

201
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,779
blog about engineering realities and

202
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,050
listen to experts of other disciplines

203
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,579
talk on Twitch because of that love I

204
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,990
think that before someone finds out how

205
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,459
to switch careers it's reasonable for

206
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,620
them to make certain that they really

207
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:01,149
want to I have a broad spectrum of

208
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,670
co-workers and without exception the

209
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:05,679
only ones I appreciate are those like

210
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,480
myself who absolutely loved the work I

211
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,310
have co-workers who studied computer

212
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,990
science because it's lucrative I have

213
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,850
other co-workers who realize that they

214
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,220
can do almost nothing and still be paid

215
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,750
by a large corporation and I have at

216
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,220
least one co-worker obviously studied

217
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,019
programming solely because his father

218
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,910
did who also works at my company

219
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:23,469
collectively these folks remind me of

220
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,970
someone who really loves the rock and

221
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,400
roll lifestyle but is unwilling to

222
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,410
practice anything related to music lots

223
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,819
of talk about architecture and local

224
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,620
meetup groups a fad programming

225
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:35,679
languages and participating about what

226
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,299
our team should do but awful at actually

227
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,459
doing the job because they don't like

228
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,409
the work I'm not trying to be negative

229
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,750
but to explain that a career switch may

230
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,089
not automatically make someone happy I

231
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,919
think that absolutely anyone can learn

232
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:51,009
to program and nearly everyone can

233
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:53,649
benefit from the skill like in my crappy

234
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:55,419
office job in my crappy office jobs but

235
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,578
that's a different topic from someone

236
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:59,889
saying everyone should start doing it

237
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:01,409
full time or even dedicate their home

238
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:03,759
hours to studying it in depth

239
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:05,438
programming's ability to be learned is

240
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,019
exactly the same as the ability to

241
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:09,789
change brake rotors or to apply makeup

242
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:12,220
to the face of a person before their

243
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:14,349
open casket funeral or to push a tiny

244
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,569
drill into a stranger's teeth in the

245
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,670
interest of dental health strict

246
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:20,558
possibility is not a good criterion for

247
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:22,868
career choice even if there's lots of

248
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:25,868
money to be made and the status quo is a

249
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:28,209
boring dead-end but here's why I believe

250
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:30,040
that's not a negative you don't have to

251
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,899
switch careers to figure out if you're

252
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,058
going to love it you can learn it

253
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:35,428
anytime for any reason and all it takes

254
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:37,899
is a project that you care about

255
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:39,669
likewise no need to get that bachelor's

256
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:42,039
degree you can learn everything you need

257
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:43,868
for free and if you really want a

258
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,028
personal trainer lots of people will

259
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:47,769
take your money for that purpose just be

260
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:49,869
aware that after a career switch you

261
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:52,659
will spend 50 percent of your work time

262
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:53,769
navigating social politics 25 percent

263
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,600
will be wrangling your incompetent

264
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:57,068
co-workers and managers that they don't

265
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,230
ruin everything your you've worked for

266
00:09:57,068 --> 00:10:01,058
and if you can still enjoy the remaining

267
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,589
fraction of your time door golden but on

268
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,719
the other hand if you're free to switch

269
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:06,490
into it you're free to switch out please

270
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,769
take note programmers who hate the job

271
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,678
just another leg of a lifetime of

272
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:14,259
experimental employment now back to my

273
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:15,730
experience my career switch involved the

274
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:17,980
first day of being laid off from a

275
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,620
crappy job and a job ad that was unique

276
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,819
enough to catch my eye

277
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,509
programmers needed no experience

278
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:24,789
necessary

279
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:27,129
quote unquote is what it said too good

280
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:28,899
to be true but it was genuine I won't go

281
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:30,699
into detail about the awesomely terrible

282
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:33,068
project that contributed to first

283
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:34,899
footnote here and when he put first

284
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:37,448
footnote here he's actually talking

285
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:39,879
about footnotes that he included at the

286
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:43,298
bottom of this entry and I told you it

287
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:46,569
was a very long entry not kidding

288
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:48,159
so here is the first footnote which I

289
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:50,528
believe I'm getting correctly because

290
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,389
they're not labeled it just says first

291
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:55,048
footnote so I believe this is the first

292
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:55,048
footnote

293
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:00,120
and this is called my entry level

294
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:02,009
project footnote lots of people can't

295
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,779
run a computer whatsoever and lots of

296
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,610
community colleges recognize that and

297
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,769
make it part of their curriculum they

298
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,139
teach people how to operate Word and

299
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,569
Excel and PowerPoint these classes need

300
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,069
course material and benevolent selfless

301
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,960
textbook publishers provide it for a

302
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,550
nominal fee the most outstanding

303
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,230
forward-thinking publishers had the

304
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:21,000
Epiphany that courses teaching computer

305
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,550
usage could use interactive digital

306
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,409
content which might just be better than

307
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:28,229
a textbook but only in this narrow case

308
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:29,909
of course and one of those publishers

309
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,710
wanted students to actually run the

310
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:33,809
office programs being taught as opposed

311
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,030
to one of those simulations that is

312
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:37,679
tantamount to a hidden picture game that

313
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,509
is they didn't want students to have to

314
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,669
click the magic spots in the right order

315
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:43,409
and press the right key and presto the

316
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,519
flash based image to excel in the case

317
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:46,230
that you did the right thing

318
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,779
had you been interacting with the real

319
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,580
software this one publisher thought very

320
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,589
rationally that if you want to teach

321
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,020
someone to click on something in a menu

322
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:57,570
maybe actually letting them click on the

323
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,460
menu was superior but surely if you run

324
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,710
Excel how could you possibly evaluate

325
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,180
their work or prevent cheating several

326
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,780
companies declined to bid on this

327
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:08,099
request but one company bid and adesh

328
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,139
additionally submitted a proof of

329
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,450
concept that was the company that hired

330
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:16,049
me one deploy an online learning

331
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:17,879
management solution system something to

332
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:19,919
keep track of student IDs in enrollment

333
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:21,689
in course progress yadda yadda to deploy

334
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,209
a desktop application that spawns office

335
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:26,520
processes based on content downloaded

336
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:29,490
from the LMS like template documents

337
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,399
instructions etc 3 hire a bunch of

338
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,080
a-holes to write VBA scripts that check

339
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,850
document contents serialize those

340
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,800
through some esoteric net component

341
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,720
transmit them to the desktop app via the

342
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,059
LMS and submit grades based on the

343
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,700
scripts results they hired four of us

344
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:46,679
and absolutely no one knew what they

345
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,720
were doing I just happened to be really

346
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:50,370
good at not knowing what I was doing so

347
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,660
they gave me a salary and let me write

348
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,179
code for the next stupidly complicated

349
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,980
project that was that footnote so now

350
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,689
I'm gonna jump back to the place where

351
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,950
we were he said I won't go into detail

352
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,230
about the awesome utility project I

353
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,970
configured to first footnote here that

354
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,980
was a footnote but the important part

355
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,050
was that the work was Microsoft Office

356
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,120
programming and that's second footnote

357
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:10,559
here so I'm going to jump down because

358
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,649
like I said I felt like reading all the

359
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:16,799
stuff just so you get what people wrote

360
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:19,019
in and this was ms-office programming

361
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,399
footnote this could be handy for anyone

362
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,439
who foolishly wants to follow my method

363
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,209
of breaking into software if you wrangle

364
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,730
spreadsheets for a really for a living

365
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,500
you can become a programmer today all

366
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,480
office programs expose their files

367
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,769
through a document object model exactly

368
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,990
analogous to how the latest greatest

369
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,509
waiver of Xmas ECMO script which is

370
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:39,450
JavaScript exposes the hideous spec of

371
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:40,588
HTML for office it's an interface in a

372
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,540
language called Visual Basic for

373
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:44,430
applications and the code editor is

374
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,129
honestly pretty good and it's built into

375
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:49,349
every office product everything is also

376
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:51,179
reasonably well documented on MSDN and

377
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,009
anything that can be done through the

378
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:55,379
GUI can be done faster and better by

379
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:57,419
programming nowadays if your company has

380
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:59,220
a domain administrator who is competent

381
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,838
these features will be disabled

382
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,730
except for the most trusted computer

383
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,470
professionals because when code can be

384
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,028
freely emailed them around of a managers

385
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,889
and it runs automatically when a word

386
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:10,769
luck is opened that is a recipe for

387
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:12,419
virus reading it happens a lot but if

388
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:14,370
your company is not so well protected

389
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,958
also very common and you can find the

390
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,549
hidden menu option our key combination

391
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,099
that accra activates the macro editor

392
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:21,899
Google knows how you can learn to

393
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,050
program using only the standard cube

394
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,360
drone tools go nuts make 500 rows of

395
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:29,759
rule 30 in Excel it's great but also

396
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,470
clearly lame instead make a recursive 30

397
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,778
mais generation algorithm using cell

398
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,160
borders as walls if you exceed the stack

399
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:37,019
limit of 99 you will need to implement

400
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,639
your own stack but don't worry you have

401
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,049
virtually unlimited memory available in

402
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,028
the form of a spreadsheet

403
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:43,708
I learned this Fred sheet magic from my

404
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:45,929
physics professor who was a big fan of

405
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,379
doing electric field simulations in the

406
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,149
grid

407
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:50,100
he accidentally contributed more to a

408
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:53,250
computing career than my CFS professor

409
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:57,959
surprise surprise ok back up to the main

410
00:14:53,250 --> 00:15:00,149
line all right let's see here it's hard

411
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:04,859
to jump back and forth I probably should

412
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:07,679
have done like a some kind of a in lines

413
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,080
them myself just a pre expansion all

414
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,699
right they needed macros they needed

415
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,050
them before the deadlines and all their

416
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,490
current engineers were dedicated to

417
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:16,889
finishing the project that would use

418
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,990
them as content and I had just spent the

419
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:21,208
previous years trying Microsoft Access

420
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,950
sorry tying Microsoft Access into

421
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:25,049
multiple other data sources and

422
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,730
producing procedural reports I wrote

423
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,859
scripts that populated spreadsheets for

424
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,450
me my work had to be usable by the 80

425
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,850
year old woman who did our accounting so

426
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:35,280
it was robust and reliable so I had the

427
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:38,639
right skill at the right time pure luck

428
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:41,189
however I can't end that this is that

429
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,319
that is true in all job searches rather

430
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,450
than saying step 1 learn Java step 2 get

431
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,310
paid to write Java the real goal is to

432
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,259
gradually increase software employable

433
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:51,179
experience you continuously gather

434
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:52,980
expertise and confident your ability

435
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:55,079
confidence in your ability to make

436
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,360
computers behave eventually a new

437
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,190
opportunity will pass by that allows you

438
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,649
to do more and learn more with software

439
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,690
and so a person bootstraps into becoming

440
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:06,360
a programmer it need not be a sudden

441
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:11,010
career switch at all regardless I was

442
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,779
very eager to career switch I had to

443
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:14,580
accept going from salary to hourly

444
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:16,980
though like I said I was laid off anyway

445
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,650
and I had to discuss with my spouse

446
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,139
about the implications of low income for

447
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,730
some time but obviously these are normal

448
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,559
job change concerns that should always

449
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,750
be part of a decision not something

450
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,489
special to software I knew that the

451
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,559
potential upside vastly outweighed the

452
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,629
temporary downside also it was such a

453
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,789
glowing opportunity I had to dive in I

454
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:37,320
should also note that I think it's very

455
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:39,569
important to not wait for the perfect

456
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,210
match opportunity to come by treat a job

457
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,250
as a challenge to be overcome expertise

458
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,019
is not required in order to be hired and

459
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,850
it certainly isn't required to stay

460
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,159
employed my co-workers that don't love

461
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,870
their job are perfect examples the only

462
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,519
requirement is that you are willing to

463
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,100
learn to solve the given set of problems

464
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,019
presented by the new job if people can

465
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,060
be hired after spending 12 weeks at some

466
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,579
ridiculous web dev bootcamp that

467
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:06,599
entailed ngi and ex nodejs

468
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,160
mano MongoDB and angularjs then a person

469
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,659
with real problem-solving skills can

470
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,820
certainly pick up the tech specific

471
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,500
stuff while on the job so never count

472
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,189
yourself out for lack of exact

473
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,190
experience

474
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:23,639
after that project they hired me onto

475
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:26,250
salary it was one of these a 16 li

476
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,050
trendy bespoke web project agencies as a

477
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,109
complete neophyte I was in heaven

478
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:32,789
every new WordPress deployment was a

479
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:35,189
chance to master some new aspect of

480
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:36,869
making Web Apps every person around me

481
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,759
was talented and wise and willing to

482
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:40,979
teach but best of all I was a

483
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,450
professional programmer I didn't set out

484
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,549
to become a master of the superficial

485
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,220
Internet and certainly and I certainly

486
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:48,809
don't think of myself that way now I am

487
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,360
a programmer who happens to know a lot

488
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:52,950
of minutiae about the HTTP protocol and

489
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,199
myriad other details that go into making

490
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,850
a web app I say this because I suspect

491
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,120
that amid the spectrum of programming

492
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:02,369
disciplines web is the most Craiglist

493
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,959
of them all I don't really know what he

494
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:06,719
means by that but here we go

495
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,809
idiots make shitty web pages and the

496
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,670
real programmers do X X is not a single

497
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,470
thing because all disciplines believe

498
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,860
theirs is the best or at least better

499
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,910
than web dev this isn't entirely untrue

500
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,169
programming for the web is close to the

501
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,210
bottom of the totem pole for a good

502
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,560
reason absolutely anyone can do it for a

503
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,079
reeving for a living

504
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,669
so absolutely anyone does and so lots of

505
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,230
poor skill can literally be found on

506
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:30,150
Craigslist for pennies on the dollar of

507
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,250
other software expertise so I guess

508
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,350
that's Craigslist in this case it's like

509
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,299
hireable on Craigslist I guess I was

510
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:39,269
never quite clear on that but you get

511
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:41,190
the idea but this does not mean that a

512
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:44,220
person who makes websites cannot develop

513
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,870
high level skills one now manager I know

514
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,250
was fond of describing programming in

515
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:49,500
the context of Zen in the art of

516
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,759
motorcycle maintenance any task can be

517
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,890
fulfilling if you pursue it to

518
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:56,190
excellence this is certainly true of web

519
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,870
dev regardless or of glory or status if

520
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,250
you are learning good skills it doesn't

521
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:01,139
matter what type of constraints you are

522
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,789
dealing with or how you arrive at good

523
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,310
programming fundamentals as confirmed by

524
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:08,159
experience do be sure to get diverse

525
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:10,589
ideas of what good means though isolated

526
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,450
study will only compound ugly solutions

527
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:14,970
into bad habits and you will develop

528
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,190
biases based on your environment this is

529
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,170
inevitable but none of that is a reason

530
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,330
to be picky about how to break into the

531
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,700
career because the specific job doesn't

532
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:27,899
set anything in stone and that cannot be

533
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,819
changed or overcome by effort after

534
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,140
about 6 months at the web project shop I

535
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:32,309
was offered the chance to make slot

536
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,590
machine software

537
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:37,169
I would be making games sort of mostly

538
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:39,089
in ogre 3d I haven't mentioned it until

539
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,039
now but I spent a lot of my spare time

540
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:42,809
making games before and after being

541
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,359
hired as a web dev third project

542
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:48,119
footnote so again here here's an

543
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:52,379
insertion from lower down in the text

544
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:55,739
making games footnote all the while I

545
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,020
was making better spreadsheets I was

546
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,789
also making games at home I'd become a

547
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:01,920
fan of XNA before it got to its

548
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:04,170
comically infamous state of vibrating

549
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,090
controllers and fart apps once that

550
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,529
reputation arrived I was sad because the

551
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:09,990
platform was such a beautiful dream

552
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:12,269
console games curated solely by peer

553
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,640
review no system like that existed

554
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:16,950
anywhere not even Android yet challenged

555
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,020
not even Android get challenged apples

556
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,180
gatekeeping of their device but you

557
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,769
could publish on to the 360 and no one

558
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,750
at Microsoft would try to keep you off

559
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,289
their proprietary platform absolutely

560
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,420
amazing

561
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:28,859
even today the most inclusive console

562
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,920
developer programs are still invite-only

563
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:34,019
or prohibitively expensive in my opinion

564
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,000
the crappiness of a lot of xbox arcade

565
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:37,589
titles was a testament to the excellence

566
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,750
of the framework design and it's

567
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:42,539
consequential ease of use any idiot

568
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,130
could and did make an Xbox game solely

569
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:46,409
by downloading a particular Visual

570
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,420
Studio add-on the tutorial content was

571
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,190
fantastic the framework itself was

572
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,230
opinionated just enough to trivially get

573
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,850
image images on the screen along with a

574
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,200
few other niceties like an asset

575
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:58,230
pipeline that could consume and draw a

576
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,529
few model formats and then he lists a

577
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:04,559
blog post here that I'll try to put up

578
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:06,629
as a reference if in the final post of

579
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,700
this that blog about how you can design

580
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,530
and a one-size-fits-all model class

581
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,569
spoilers you can't was written by the

582
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:14,220
lead of the project he was also a key

583
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:15,299
developer of allegro another game

584
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,069
framework of the past

585
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,419
he wrote excellent articles about how

586
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:20,009
software design works in support of

587
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,560
games I learned a lot from reading them

588
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:24,089
these days he leads a purely open-source

589
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,480
product at Microsoft which is still a

590
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:29,459
drawing library at and his writing is

591
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,019
still worthwhile because the framework

592
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,940
somehow was compatible with the Windows

593
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:35,099
Phone my one and only published mobile

594
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,720
title was on that platform it was pulled

595
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:38,399
three days later after copyright claim

596
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,420
that I couldn't afford to contest

597
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,160
cestlavie eventually I realized or I

598
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,090
guess c'est la vie I should actually use

599
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,490
my French pronunciation because

600
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:51,038
I did have to learn that in high school

601
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,679
sorry c'est la vie eventually I realized

602
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,869
that I didn't really want to chase the

603
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,580
indie success lottery or even break into

604
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:59,288
the traditional game dev discipline I'd

605
00:21:57,579 --> 00:22:00,699
like to making boring old robust systems

606
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:02,470
and I was proud of software that worked

607
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,179
well I still occasionally bang out a

608
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,130
prototype confirm or deny that an idea

609
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:07,870
is fun but I don't hold on to the notion

610
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,880
that I might go that way professionally

611
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:11,798
I love to gather knowledge from experts

612
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,450
though the contrasts and similarities to

613
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:15,069
be drawn between other types of software

614
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,569
is really interesting and it helps me

615
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,619
frame my own professional efforts in a

616
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,569
lots of different ways which is

617
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:21,759
invaluable but in the end I don't love

618
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:23,589
video games enough anymore also getting

619
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,940
paid hourly for a short while was hard

620
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:26,230
with the mortgage and children this

621
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,058
post-mortem in particular made me

622
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,919
realize that starving for my art would

623
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:32,829
be impossible it was it's a link to

624
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,149
gamma Sutra unrest autumn August

625
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:37,319
post-mortem of the Kickstarter success

626
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:39,548
and again I'll try to post these links

627
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:43,720
into the video comments for people who

628
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:46,690
want to grab them alright so let's go

629
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:58,419
back up to the main line text which

630
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:59,558
that's okay so now we're back to talking

631
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,850
about the ogre 3d project this

632
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:03,970
opportunity was interesting because I

633
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:06,038
wanted to bolster my knowledge of C++ MC

634
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,630
I love the idea of game development and

635
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:09,788
I thought free tips trips to Las Vegas

636
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,190
was a cool perk so I read the ogre

637
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:15,009
manual and ace the interview I totally

638
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,450
sucked a C++ but they knew and but they

639
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:18,398
knew that and didn't care because I was

640
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,720
cheap and presumably I demonstrated

641
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,668
ability to learn on the job which was

642
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,038
all that really matters but I rejected

643
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:25,570
that offer I had a very uncomfortable

644
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:29,890
feeling that I would not learn much at

645
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:33,308
that place the lead dev half of my

646
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:35,649
interview the lead dev I guess for half

647
00:23:33,308 --> 00:23:36,879
of my or the lead dev half of my

648
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,928
interview I guess he's talking about the

649
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,850
half of interview that was the lead

650
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:42,610
developer talking the lead dev half

651
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:44,408
mitred the lead dev half of my interview

652
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:46,808
didn't love programming which was just

653
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:48,399
weird to me I hadn't yet four of my

654
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:50,470
strong opinions about that quality and

655
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:52,418
being hired because of cheapness is

656
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,669
always dubious their office had an air

657
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:56,919
of sadness and the owner seemed like an

658
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:57,940
also they had strict policies of

659
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:59,860
not working from home

660
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,450
something about security concerns or

661
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:03,250
such which seemed ludicrous to me

662
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,808
perhaps I could have forced myself to

663
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,470
overcome all those obstacles but I'll

664
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:07,629
never know

665
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,250
instead I continued to learn to design

666
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,600
good database schema to transmit data

667
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,970
and well-defined structures and

668
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:14,019
frequently over a slothful medium and to

669
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,700
implement systems that could withstand

670
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:18,250
constant specification changes from

671
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,200
irrational customers CSS and JavaScript

672
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,548
for perpetual thorns in my side but I

673
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,080
did my best to study their best

674
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:24,639
practices and pass my reading through

675
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:27,308
the filter of software design ideals

676
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,590
after a time I saturated my ability to

677
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:31,690
learn while on that job and I left now I

678
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:33,428
use the last job skills to build a UI

679
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,440
that configures a proprietary file

680
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:39,548
system on top on top shell file server

681
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,048
appliance I am learning about more more

682
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:42,730
about block devices than I ever wanted

683
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:44,440
to know I can pick the brain of

684
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,509
developers who literally have punch card

685
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,970
stacks on their desks previously I

686
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:52,960
worked on the only previously I worked

687
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:55,058
on the only previously I worked on only

688
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,579
the trendiest of websites for seeking

689
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:59,668
out dog hotels near NASCAR tracks

690
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:01,659
programming careers are weird I

691
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:03,309
occasionally have regretted not getting

692
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,290
a formal education in computer science

693
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:06,519
but that education gap was almost

694
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:08,678
completely filled by the video game

695
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:10,509
lectures of Richard Buckland I'm sorry

696
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,519
by the video lectures of Richard

697
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,450
Buckland he is a faculty member at the

698
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:15,789
University of New South Wales

699
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:18,190
specializing in computer security he

700
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:21,039
also teaches a hell of a 101 series and

701
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:26,289
he gives the youtube link to that and a

702
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:27,579
102 and a 103 after the course of just

703
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:29,558
the lectures for the first-year students

704
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:30,939
not the assignments or lab work or

705
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:32,740
anything else my itch for formal

706
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,029
education was satisfied in addition to

707
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,429
being an exceptional teacher and a

708
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:38,048
thorough expert on basics he also frames

709
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:39,730
everything in terms of being happy with

710
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,500
your work being proud of how you spend

711
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,110
your life and perpetual learning he's

712
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,910
awesome and so then there's the

713
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,529
footnotes here that we already read and

714
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,380
then at the very end he just says abrupt

715
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:52,779
ending time to ship it that is the last

716
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,309
good software tip that I can think of

717
00:25:52,779 --> 00:26:01,480
and he's referring of course to both

718
00:25:54,308 --> 00:26:05,710
this this long story and the actual and

719
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,240
the actual story oh wait no did I jump

720
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,500
to the wrong place okay sorry I think I

721
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,380
jump to the wrong place I think that's

722
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,390
just the end actually I think that's

723
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,560
just the end I think

724
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,360
footnote actually goes with this thing

725
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,329
he's got separated here I think this

726
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,529
footnote goes with this and somehow am I

727
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:21,269
cut and paste put it in the right place

728
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:22,740
so never mind the abrupt ending part

729
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:23,160
save that for a second that's going to

730
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,680
come in

731
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:30,630
so the actual ending to Seth's thing is

732
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:32,340
just the that last line alright so

733
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,080
that's a very very lengthy story and

734
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:36,480
kind of goes into a lot of different

735
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,129
stuff but it definitely has sort of a

736
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,349
thing that I didn't hear talked about

737
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:45,000
very much in any of the other entries

738
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:47,189
which is just the idea of sort of like I

739
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,130
don't know what I want to want a cup of

740
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:52,350
like inch by inch in your way into

741
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:55,710
software development like basically just

742
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:58,919
saying taking any job you can that might

743
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,779
have some software room for doing

744
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,600
something with programming and keeping

745
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:06,539
broadening that definition out until you

746
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:10,439
eventually get to software development

747
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:12,119
right and most of the other entries that

748
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,799
I read really weren't that way they

749
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:15,809
started kind of they might have started

750
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,940
with a very entry-level position but

751
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:19,079
they weren't about like oh here's a job

752
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,549
that isn't supposed to be programming

753
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,139
but I figured out a way to do some

754
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:24,419
programming in it and convince my bosses

755
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,130
that was a good idea and I kind of like

756
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,870
broadened out from there that's kind of

757
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,240
an interesting technique and I don't

758
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:34,829
know how effective it would be you know

759
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,750
on a in a wider setting or you know how

760
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:38,730
oftentimes that could be made to work

761
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,099
but it is pretty interesting to hear

762
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,599
about it having worked once and it seems

763
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,359
like the kind of thing that could be a

764
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:46,829
potential thing that people could try as

765
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,750
a way of getting more programming into

766
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:50,189
their current job or taking a job where

767
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,940
they could do some more programming even

768
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,529
though it's not technically a

769
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,450
programming job as a way of building

770
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:57,619
that experience without needing to have

771
00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:00,380
that experience first to get the job so

772
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:02,819
I thought that was pretty interesting

773
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:09,900
alright now I want to go to our last

774
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:12,839
story which is actually kind of it's I

775
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,130
guess I should say it's set up in a very

776
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:15,629
different way which is one of the

777
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,490
reasons that I wanted to do it in the

778
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:21,380
second episode as well it's set up kind

779
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:23,740
of as like a QA if that makes sense so

780
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:28,690
let me go ahead and

781
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:31,359
and read this entry this one's from jr.

782
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:37,528
Smith and he provided a Twitter handle

783
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:40,209
it's at underscore s q UI RR r LW ID e

784
00:28:37,528 --> 00:28:42,038
so squirrel lied but there's underscores

785
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:45,250
beginning and 3 R's in squirrel which

786
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:47,859
normally there wouldn't be so if you

787
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,890
want to give a shout-out to him that's

788
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:52,538
the Twitter handle where you can do it

789
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,038
and he writes in though I did teach

790
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:55,538
myself a small amount of code and web

791
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:56,859
dev skills when I was younger I did not

792
00:28:55,538 --> 00:28:59,890
begin life as a software developer in

793
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:01,178
earnest till I was 24 and I'm now 30 I'm

794
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,440
sharing my story in hopes that it can

795
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:04,120
provide some guidance to someone else

796
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,100
looking to make the switch if you have

797
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,750
further questions I can be reached at

798
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:09,428
and he gives those handles so he says

799
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:11,500
first stop briefly outlined my own

800
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:13,298
experience so that whoever reads this

801
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,190
can hopefully draw some parallels to

802
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:17,259
their own situation and better realize

803
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,149
how they can make the switch if that's

804
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:21,879
not interesting I'm posting things I

805
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:23,500
found helpful below that and so then he

806
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,210
just has a list here he says in middle

807
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,788
school in high school he taught taught

808
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,308

809
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:32,528

college round one started as a CS major

811
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:36,819

dev job at an agency Baltimore based

831
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:14,739
agencies stayed for a year asked for

832
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:17,470
more responsibility and more money got

833
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:20,200
neither moved on return to school

while at agency working ft and going to

836
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:28,778
school ft is tough but doable full-time

837
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,490
I think is what that means DC area based

838
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:32,409
hotel chain only programming job I

839
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:36,579

are

842
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,090
you should run stayed less than a year

843
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,829
no real work was getting done seals

844
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,480
first Annapolis job agnostic about

845
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:46,158
Salesforce when I started turns out it's

846
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,538
rather dull but I did get my first

847
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,130
experience in what's considered the back

848
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:51,740
end of the stack which is very helpful

849
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,990
was let go as the newest person woodwork

850
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,880
dried out government contractor not

851
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,109
ideal but just purchased house shortly

852
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,299
before being let go

853
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:00,888
decided to stay here at least until

854
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:02,808
school finished and stay at a place

855
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:04,849
longer than a year site opportunities

856
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:06,528
lead capstone project for making a game

857
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:08,599
with Unreal worked with VR company

858
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:10,730
working with computer vision forestry

859
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,980
project doing Linux support InfoSec

860
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,509
startup work remote job isn't game Deb

861
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,399
but it's actually pretty awesome happy

862
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:19,429
to stay here while working games on my

863
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,259
nights and weekends and then there's

864
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:23,570
things says advice and Q&amp;A format and

865
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:27,940
that is the bulk of the entry and so

866
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:30,408
here is the QA that they wrote in

867
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:33,470
question what's the best way to start

868
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:35,419
learning answer most advice states pick

869
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,940
up an easy to learn language and go from

870
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:39,409
there I started by reading a C++ book

871
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,940
cover-to-cover to make sure I would

872
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:42,679
still find this all interesting before

873
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,840
making a switch don't worry about a

874
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:47,570
write language as it's almost always a

875
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,849
case of right tool for the job I found

876
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:51,379
it helpful to type code out of a book it

877
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:53,178
got me used to searching for typos

878
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,850
pasted errors whatever you do though

879
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:57,730
right actual code here's a list of

880
00:31:55,849 --> 00:32:00,648
resources that I have found to be handy

881
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:02,750
interview view prep cracking the coding

882
00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:04,638
interview programming questions dry

883
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,659
beyond belief but a good shortcut to

884
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:07,579
software engineering knowledge there's

885
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:11,149
even more painful than otherwise code

886
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:12,379
complete practical handbook I'm gonna

887
00:32:11,148 --> 00:32:15,079
post the links to all these because he's

888
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:18,289
got the Amazon links about web usability

889
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:19,609
but a handful but a helpful way of

890
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:21,019
thinking about software design too for

891
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:24,138
instance you don't want to make API

892
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:25,609
difficult for co-workers or yourself a

893
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:28,428
few weeks removed to figure out and/or

894
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:30,138
to work with and he has don't make well

895
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:32,298
you know I should just read the complete

896
00:32:30,138 --> 00:32:34,278
versions of these books because the

897
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:36,168
Amazon links that are cure don't

898
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:38,028
actually have the full titles and since

899
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:39,679
I don't know the full titles of some of

900
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:43,398
these books by heart I'm just going to

901
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,500
read them I'm just going to actually

902
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:47,719
open up the Amazon links here so I can

903
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,140
read the book titles as they actually

904
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,150
exist

905
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,440
on the actual covers so that people who

906
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,360
want to search for them who are

907
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,460
listening to this who maybe don't have

908
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:58,769
access to the links that will post with

909
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,480
them won't have trouble finding them

910
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:10,980
because there's actually quite a few of

911
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:12,299
them here okay let's take okay so like I

912
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,529
said the first one the interview prep

913
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,509
book is called cracking the coding

914
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:19,529
interview 189 programming questions and

915
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:20,789
solutions the DRI beyond belief but good

916
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:23,430
shortcuts are for engineering knowledge

917
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:24,750
that one is code complete a practical

918
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:27,750
handbook of software constructions

919
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:29,130
second edition the one about web

920
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,140
usability but helpful way of thinking

921
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:33,240
about software design - that one's

922
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,110
called don't make me think revisited a

923
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:40,049
common-sense approach to web usability

924
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:41,699
the the next one which I haven't read

925
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:44,009
yet is I haven't found a more

926
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,620
comprehensive game engine book and then

927
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:48,509
he lists Jason Gregory's game engine

928
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:50,250
architecture second edition jason

929
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:52,259
gregory by the way who was spoke at

930
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,470
handmade Comus year for those of you who

931
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:57,089
were there next ms don't become dogmatic

932
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,110
about patterns however it's useful to

933
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:59,970
see different ways of approaching

934
00:33:58,109 --> 00:34:02,399
problems to expand your own mental tool

935
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:06,269
and then he lists game programming

936
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,680
patterns by robert nistrim then he said

937
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:09,148
i read the third edition but the review

938
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,750
suggests that this one is even better

939
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:14,789
and then he lists fundamentals of

940
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:18,949
computer graphics fourth edition by

941
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:21,418
Steve Mahre and Peter Shirley and then

942
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:22,918
he lists of nine books he says quark and

943
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:24,480
sometimes have blinders on when it comes

944
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,460
to the importance of top-tier schools

945
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,869
and startups however it tends to be

946
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,610
slightly better than Stack Overflow for

947
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:31,049
answering questions like what are the

948
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:34,260
strengths and weaknesses of these ten

949
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,429
databases or how do I learn about X or

950
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,970
other questions that would take a while

951
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:41,000
to pick up on your own and Cora he's

952
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:43,559
talking about course the website Cora

953
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,289
Adrian courage is I don't know how to

954
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:48,418
pronounce his name Co you are our eg es

955
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:50,369
does excellent breakdowns of how teams

956
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:51,898
achieve certain graphical effects this

957
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:53,819
is especially useful when you're not

958
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:55,349
even sure what to call the thing is that

959
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,420
you're looking at make sure to keep an

960
00:34:55,349 --> 00:35:01,949
eye out for other game breakdowns from

961
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:07,460
him and that's a WEA DRI ANC

962
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:09,989
oh you are our age EES calm and this is

963
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,490
I'm assuming this is crowd double just

964
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:13,679
double check that I remember the name

965
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:16,229
right but yeah so this is a great

966
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,649
website because essentially what happens

967
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,920
here

968
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:22,050
is the person goes through and they

969
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,039
actually do like captures from the game

970
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:28,769
of like what was happening in DirectX or

971
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:32,130
OpenGL you know to look at actually what

972
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:34,230
happened for the game to produce the

973
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,838
rendered image that it produces and then

974
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,579
they go through and show all of these

975
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:40,889
sort of ripped apart pieces of the

976
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:43,289
pipeline so that you can really see how

977
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:45,179
a particular game does its rendering and

978
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:48,139
this is really great the only downside

979
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:50,759
is that there aren't that many of them

980
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:53,608
as you might imagine they take a while

981
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,290
but they're awesome so I would highly

982
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:58,980
recommend that looking at that side as

983
00:35:55,289 --> 00:36:01,409
well anyway next questions question was

984
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,429
school helpful a or answer broadly

985
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,319
speaking yes

986
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:06,029
I wanted to make sure I had a solid CS

987
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,400
foundation and the only class I regret

988
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,869
not taking was compilers it is important

989
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,730
to note that some students thought their

990
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:13,500
education ended in the classroom this

991
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,210
could not be more wrong a degree is

992
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,519
useful in opening career doors ie

993
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:20,250
potential HR person looks at resume and

994
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,420
expects basic competency but your career

995
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,369
will ultimately be defined by the

996
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,900
challenge of the jobs you take and what

997
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:26,940
you teach yourself through products on

998
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,380
your own time if you're not school

999
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,420
inclined you can still meet your goals

1000
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,680
but know that it will be much harder as

1001
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,869
you will have to work much harder to

1002
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,818
prove basic competencies but know this

1003
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:37,800
after your first or maybe second job

1004
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:39,838
most employers don't care where you got

1005
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,609
your diploma or even if you have one

1006
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,380
with the benefit of hindsight I would

1007
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:45,480
say that the major benefit of a diploma

1008
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,160
outside the education itself is the

1009
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,490
smooth transition to a proven track

1010
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:53,098
record what should I look for in my

1011
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:54,509
first job answer regardless of field you

1012
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,769
want to aim for a position that pushes

1013
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,720
your capabilities outside of your

1014
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:59,789
comfort zone if possible aim for a

1015
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:01,409
smaller company on smaller teams devs

1016
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:02,699
have to wear many hats you will be

1017
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:04,679
forced to learn a lot more than you

1018
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,809
would in a more specialized role for

1019
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:09,598
your first position or two you really

1020
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:11,630
want to aim for knowledge you really

1021
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,829
want to aim for knowledge or salary

1022
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,750
moreover once you have that proven

1023
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:20,220
track-record salary negotiation

1024
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:22,110
is much easier I'm not sure I understand

1025
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:23,549
that exactly it sounds like you want to

1026
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,050
aim for knowledge more so than salary

1027
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,460
but maybe I'm not sure maybe I don't

1028
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,220
really understand exactly what they're

1029
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,960
saying but either way but everyone needs

1030
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:33,000
to eat of course it's very likely that

1031
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,800
your first job won't be your first pick

1032
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,139
I found it helpful when making my peace

1033
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,730
with that fact to come into a job with

1034
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:41,069
sets of goals of what I wanted to

1035
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,079
achieve then once a once a year I would

1036
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,910
review those goals and if staying on

1037
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,920
still made sense so this is kind of

1038
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:50,159
interesting this this person is

1039
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,750
basically saying instead of just looking

1040
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,969
periodically to see whether I liked my

1041
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,050
job or kind of waiting till alarm bells

1042
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:56,759
went off in my head to see whether I

1043
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,220
wanted to move they actually came up

1044
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,860
with like what do I want from this job

1045
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:03,329
as part of their taking the job and then

1046
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,210
they would re-evaluate that periodically

1047
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:07,469
which sounds pretty interesting

1048
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,059
continuing for instance I knew I was

1049
00:38:07,469 --> 00:38:10,349
underpaid at my first gig but I also

1050
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:12,449
knew it would be a good experience at a

1051
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:16,259
way to get over that first tech job huh

1052
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:17,399
once a year once a year had passed and I

1053
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,050
wasn't seeking an increase in

1054
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,269
responsibilities or my bottom line I

1055
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,860
knew it was time to move on this pattern

1056
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:24,239
makes sense very early in the career but

1057
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,300
at some point you hit a salary level

1058
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,679
where you're not going to make much more

1059
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,630
we're not gonna make much more job

1060
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,279
hopping that's when it becomes time to

1061
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,960
focus on defining what you want to build

1062
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,660
in your career but that's a good problem

1063
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:41,190
to have question how did you navigate

1064
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:43,199
job hunting answer my father repeated to

1065
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:45,539
well two relevant things to me when I

1066
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,509
was younger one everyone is in sales

1067
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:49,800
into network network network I was

1068
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,480
resistant to the first point but you

1069
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,370
ultimately have to realize as I did that

1070
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,679
a resume and interviews are ultimately

1071
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:57,239
you pitching yourself to a company for

1072
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,919
all software engineering disciplines I

1073
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:01,399
suggest you follow Gale McDowell's

1074
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:05,099
excellent resume advice here and this

1075
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:10,369
pointer is to career cup.com so may its

1076
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:12,869
CA re er CU p comm slash re s ume

1077
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:14,369
formatting matters if you're sloppy on

1078
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:17,039
your resume you give the impression that

1079
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:18,539
you're sloppy in your work most jobs are

1080
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,079
found through networking seventy percent

1081
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:23,969
according to US News and World Cup for

1082
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,259
my current job in some side gigs I found

1083
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:26,849
all my past employment through

1084
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,620
recruiters and that's often not ideal a

1085
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:29,909
not an ideal situation for you

1086
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,400
even good recruit

1087
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:34,108
are interested more in drying ink hit up

1088
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,849
local user groups job fairs and the like

1089
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:36,779
be prepared for networking to happen in

1090
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:38,880
unexpected places

1091
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,160
as an example I found my current job

1092
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,838
after the nicest note possible I was

1093
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:44,848
hunting for jobs on Stack Overflow and

1094
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:48,480
was one of the last two candidates out

1095
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:49,769
of a 300 ish entry for a position we

1096
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,139
were asked to make a quick presentation

1097
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:54,030
on how we would architect a problem they

1098
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,769
were tackling sidenote they asked that

1099
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,599
we keep it brief so it wouldn't seem

1100
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:59,969
like free work some potential employers

1101
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,170
do this and you should avoid them they

1102
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:02,699
went with the other candidate

1103
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,190
she had one or two skills that I didn't

1104
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:06,868
but my contact liked my presentation so

1105
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,670
much that he offered to open up his

1106
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:10,858
network to me which directly led to my

1107
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,260
current gig so stay positive and

1108
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:15,858
remember that rejections aren't personal

1109
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,599
and that unknown now isn't a no forever

1110
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:19,949
on a related note you'll see entry

1111
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,470
listings asking for two to five years

1112
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:24,298
experience two takeaways one this is

1113
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:27,298
malarkey and usually written by clueless

1114
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:29,130
people to the hidden a skier is that you

1115
00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:30,838
have a product to talk about that you

1116
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,460
did of your own accord outside of a

1117
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:35,250
classroom assignment two to five years

1118
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,869
doesn't imply a salary position in terms

1119
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:40,349
of scope remember that small and focused

1120
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:42,539
is better question how did you handle

1121
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:44,640
the stress of the transition answer this

1122
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:46,619
cannot be said enough and I could stand

1123
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,739
to be better at it myself but eat right

1124
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:51,358
exercise and sleep there will be days

1125
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:53,729
when this isn't possible and some days

1126
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,619
you just need cake but you'll focus much

1127
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,960
more easily if you're rested and don't

1128
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:00,180
feel bloated and gross beyond that make

1129
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,920
sure you plan some relaxation time my

1130
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:03,838
wife and I try to get a half hour video

1131
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,849
games in before bed this is both

1132
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,920
relaxing and ensures we actually see

1133
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:09,359
each other this may seem obvious but

1134
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,278
make sure you spend some time with

1135
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:12,808
family and friends it can be easy to

1136
00:41:11,278 --> 00:41:15,449
lose sight of the bigger picture when

1137
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:17,460
focusing on a career transition if you

1138
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:19,379
go back to school for CS as part of your

1139
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,838
transition be kind to yourself schedule

1140
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,910
wise I once took graphics AI operating

1141
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,179
systems a computer architecture the same

1142
00:41:23,909 --> 00:41:28,858
semester while working a full time while

1143
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:30,659
working full-time and buying my first

1144
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:32,460
house there's always a trade-off between

1145
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:34,769
getting something done faster versus a

1146
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,269
less stressful but longer experience you

1147
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:38,818
have to figure out which one works for

1148
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:40,079
you but make sure you take breaks like a

1149
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:42,088
weekend dedicated to not being

1150
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,079
productive and just relaxing if you

1151
00:41:42,088 --> 00:41:45,449
choose the faster

1152
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,048
option you have to do this you're also

1153
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:50,218
likely to be on what to me you're also

1154
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,318
likely going to be one of the older

1155
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:54,028
students in the room it can totally feel

1156
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:56,458
awkward but there's going to be other

1157
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:58,440
older students I encountered other late

1158
00:41:56,458 --> 00:42:00,958
career switchers soldiers taking

1159
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,519
advantage of the GI Bill and more try to

1160
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,139
channel any awkward feelings you might

1161
00:42:02,518 --> 00:42:06,568
have into focusing on getting the work

1162
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:08,098
done quickly and well questions how do

1163
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:10,498
you handle feeling like your previous

1164
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:12,180
career was a waste answer in most cases

1165
00:42:10,498 --> 00:42:13,558
you likely hone skills that are

1166
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:15,538
absolutely transferable into your new

1167
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:16,979
career this is especially true of some

1168
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:18,920
of the soft skills like communicating

1169
00:42:16,978 --> 00:42:20,699
your ideas clearly taking feedback

1170
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,259
experiencing taking a project to

1171
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:23,939
completion and knowing when to admit

1172
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:25,619
you're wrong early in my career

1173
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,150
transition I was worried that the skills

1174
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,650
I was developing as a front-end dev

1175
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,930
wouldn't transfer the positions I wanted

1176
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,309
to work at but to work towards admit at

1177
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:33,958
least some of this was based off the

1178
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:35,369
unfounded belief that front-end

1179
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:37,798
development is somehow a less serious

1180
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:40,019
discipline you will likely switch roles

1181
00:42:37,798 --> 00:42:41,880
a lot during career even if you like all

1182
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:43,348
of those rules you should always look

1183
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,420
for opportunities to apply previous

1184
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:47,459
skills and knowledge moving forward in

1185
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,380
my case working as a front-end dev honed

1186
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:51,838
my ability to explain complex ideas

1187
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,369
succinctly and clearly without losing

1188
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,078
sight of the many small details

1189
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:57,809
good luck working in a design heavy

1190
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,369
field without that I have carried this

1191
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:00,778
over to projects where I'm not working

1192
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:02,699
on the front end and has been immensely

1193
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:04,528
helpful I would say your experience is

1194
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:08,818
definitely not without value even if it

1195
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:09,900
wasn't in tech next question how do you

1196
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:12,150
know if your career is headed in the

1197
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,769
right direction answer I found it useful

1198
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,568
to constantly reexamine my assumptions

1199
00:43:13,768 --> 00:43:16,978
and goals in my case I went back to

1200
00:43:15,568 --> 00:43:18,989
school determined to get a job in the

1201
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:20,218
game industry my long-term goal was to

1202
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:21,900
try and start my own company

1203
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:23,789
my assumption was that working for a

1204
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,798
studio would help accelerate me gaining

1205
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:28,799
the knowledge I needed to go off on my

1206
00:43:25,798 --> 00:43:30,778
own however I kept reading post Morden's

1207
00:43:28,798 --> 00:43:32,309
mortems of people leaving triple-a

1208
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:34,469
studios to start a small indie studio

1209
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,819
which is affected my plan that mentioned

1210
00:43:34,469 --> 00:43:37,769
a few problems that caught my eye

1211
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:39,659
many programs were focused in a narrow

1212
00:43:37,768 --> 00:43:40,978
aspect of the game so maybe my

1213
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,899
expectation of learning a lot of

1214
00:43:40,978 --> 00:43:45,239
triple-a studio learning a lot at tribal

1215
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,559
studio was not entirely correct moreover

1216
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:48,659
I learned that many studios have

1217
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,400
policies where any work you do on nights

1218
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:52,498
and weekends becomes their IP while you

1219
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,910
are their employee of course everyone

1220
00:43:52,498 --> 00:43:56,558
knows about this the crunch issue

1221
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:57,938
however combine that with the commute

1222
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,469
guaranteed to be over an hour and I

1223
00:43:57,938 --> 00:44:01,808
began to question when I would have time

1224
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:03,639
to work on my own project I ultimately

1225
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:05,890
was able to choose a new path to my goal

1226
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:07,838
by asking what happens if I don't join

1227
00:44:05,889 --> 00:44:09,608
the game industry right away this was

1228
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:10,869
hard for me to get over as I was pretty

1229
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:12,818
attached the notion of making the

1230
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:14,489
position before I turned 30 and I were

1231
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:16,869
tribal but a goal nonetheless

1232
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:18,548
however asking that question led to the

1233
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:20,259
more important question of what do I

1234
00:44:18,548 --> 00:44:22,538
need to do to successfully start off on

1235
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:24,338
my own I would need time to work on our

1236
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:26,259
project on nights and weekends coding

1237
00:44:24,338 --> 00:44:28,119
experience and money saved up so that I

1238
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:29,228
could finance the endeavor I decided

1239
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,430
that I could better achieve these

1240
00:44:29,228 --> 00:44:32,169
requirements by not immediately

1241
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:33,938
switching to the game industry to

1242
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,289
sweeten the pot I work remote which

1243
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:37,889
gives me back 10 plus hours a week

1244
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:40,180
because Maryland traffic is not great I

1245
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:42,518
definitely did not picture this change

1246
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:44,108
in direction when I started maybe you

1247
00:44:42,518 --> 00:44:46,149
won't know what your long-term goals are

1248
00:44:44,108 --> 00:44:47,798
when you start and that's okay try out

1249
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,389
several different kinds of projects read

1250
00:44:47,798 --> 00:44:51,518
up on current research watch different

1251
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:53,379
GDC or SIGGRAPH or other sig conference

1252
00:44:51,518 --> 00:44:55,028
talks sometimes seeing what other people

1253
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,459
are working on can help inspire some

1254
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:59,889
ideas of your own question any last

1255
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:01,088
thoughts answer what has helped me most

1256
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:03,098
during the stressful times

1257
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:05,048
was remembering that it was okay to not

1258
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:07,209
like where I was at a career wise as

1259
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:09,278
long as I liked where I was going and so

1260
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:11,159
far it has been absolutely worth it 10

1261
00:45:09,278 --> 00:45:13,509
of 10 would make him noxious least

1262
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:15,759
obnoxiously stressful career switch

1263
00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:18,519
again even if I had to face the same

1264
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:20,228
challenges abrupt ending time to ship it

1265
00:45:18,518 --> 00:45:21,968
that is the last good software tip I can

1266
00:45:20,228 --> 00:45:27,818
think of and again that's from squirrel

1267
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:32,170
ID underscore s q SS q UI RRR elw IDE

1268
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:34,358
and that's from jr. Smith so I believe

1269
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:37,449
that's all the entries that I received

1270
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:40,358
I've now read all of them and you've

1271
00:45:37,449 --> 00:45:42,959
heard everything that I've heard that

1272
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:45,699
that people wrote in and had to say and

1273
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:50,288
hopefully that gave you a pretty broad

1274
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:51,880
sort of you know set of experiences many

1275
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:54,160
of which are have a lot of different

1276
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,019
aspects to it most of the people who

1277
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,129
wrote in actually came from different

1278
00:45:56,018 --> 00:45:58,988
disciplines which I thought was really

1279
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:02,469
interesting there wasn't like one

1280
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:03,999
particular way that people sort of got

1281
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:04,568
into the software engineering and that

1282
00:46:03,998 --> 00:46:06,368
sort of thing

1283
00:46:04,568 --> 00:46:08,139
there wasn't one particular place that

1284
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:09,760
they were all coming from there was just

1285
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:11,199
a lot of different

1286
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:17,500
original careers that people made the

1287
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:19,000
move from so again this video along with

1288
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,829
the previous video should hopefully give

1289
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,170
you a wide set of different voices

1290
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:25,480
different people who came from different

1291
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:28,420
places and had different ways of talking

1292
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:31,690
about what they did hopefully some thing

1293
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:34,450
in there or the entire set taken

1294
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:36,550
together will be useful to folks who are

1295
00:46:34,449 --> 00:46:39,250
trying to make this transition I am

1296
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:40,930
going to take a quick break now and then

1297
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,329
I'm going to do sort of basically the

1298
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:45,730
third video in this series which is just

1299
00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:49,299
a very very brief discussion of sort of

1300
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:52,409
stuff related to this that was based on

1301
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,410
sort of my takeaways from it
