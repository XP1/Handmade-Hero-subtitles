00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,679
hey everybody casey muratory here i am

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,040
looking to do some videos for promotion

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,599
of our kickstarter we're doing a

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,519
kickstarter from yao the infinite book 2

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,199
our graphic novel series if you like

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,880
cats and space or just cool graphic

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,000
novels please check it out the links in

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,839
the description below and i asked around

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,079
what i could do that would interest

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,160
people and one of the things people said

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,679
is please go over your streaming setup

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,439
because people thought the lighting

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,358
looked really cool and that the sound

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,879
quality was really good and first of all

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,640
i'd like to say i'm delighted to hear

16
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:37,119
that because it is a super cheap setup

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,120
the lighting and sound proofing of this

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,159
setup are about as cheap as you can get

19
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:45,119
the whole thing is probably 120 bucks

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,718
total and i wish i could say that there

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,199
was something magic to it but basically

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,079
all i did was do the simplest possible

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,600
thing and just follow some cinema style

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,000
procedures to get good lighting so i can

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,920
show you how it's done let me show you a

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,679
video from my point of view so you can

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,359
see how it's set up what you can see

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:08,799
here is it's just led strips stuck to

29
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,840
moving blankets in a cube around where i

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,159
stream the key light is kind of a large

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,000
horizontal light to sort of evenly light

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,640
the face and then the fill light and the

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,200
rim light are done sort of vertically so

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,840
that they give a good contour to the

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,640
face and believe me my face needs all

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,159
the help it can get so if you've never

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,759
done cinema lighting before just go

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
watch a tutorial but once you kind of

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
know how to place lights for cinema

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,000
style lighting uh really all you gotta

41
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,599
do is get yourself the moving blankets

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,078
and some of these the moving blankets

43
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,319
will cost you 40 to 60 dollars for a

44
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,000
full set you can get four or six moving

45
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,679
blankets in a set usually you want to

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,599
get some kind of heavy ones if you can

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,200
because they deaden the sound well but

48
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,798
you hang those up however you can it

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,240
depends on the room you might have to

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,000
spend a few more dollars if your room

51
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,000
doesn't have really anything to hang

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,599
them from you may have to buy like a

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,519
curtain rod or something one or two

54
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,359
curtain rods to hang them from so your

55
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,798
price will go up a little bit but if you

56
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,319
have a room you can already kind of just

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,399
like clip them to something or tie them

58
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,399
to something you can save the money i

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,800
use actually little tiny clips to clip

60
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,439
them but you know whatever works for you

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,160
uh you get yourself some of these and

62
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,479
these light strips you have to buy ones

63
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,079
that you know won't have a resonant

64
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,000
frequency with your camera because

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,080
that's something that can easily happen

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,439
uh i found that these particular light

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,640
strips that i'll link in the description

68
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,120
below don't resonate with cameras like

69
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,719
high quality cameras so those are ones

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,080
that i like to use but if you can find

71
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,318
one that doesn't resonate with a camera

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,239
that's really all you need now inside

73
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,079
each pack of these i'll open one up so

74
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,878
you can see it essentially what you're

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,879
gonna do is you're just gonna take this

76
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,199
piece that it comes with right it's just

77
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:52,560
a basically a roll you can see there

78
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,959
it's basically a roll of led lights and

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,959
it's got a little like ir receiver on

80
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,800
the end of it all you do is you just

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,039
plug this into a light socket and then

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,599
you take the little handy uh remote

83
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,679
control that they give you and you can

84
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,919
just set the lighting to whatever you

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,000
need it to be the remote control has

86
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,839
tons of settings so you can make it

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,680
brighter or darker you can make it

88
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,840
different color lighting so you can have

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,360
you know different themes and so on and

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,360
let me just show you

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
what each of the lights does in my setup

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,879
so that you can get a sense for them but

93
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,919
then you can also feel free to play

94
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,158
around with this it doesn't have to be

95
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,280
set up exactly the way i have it

96
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,560
so first let's just isolate just the key

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,479
light which is the one that's

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,799
illuminating most of my face

99
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,639
so first i'll turn it off so you can see

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
what happens you see how most of the

101
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,238
light is now gone like i'm basically

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,598
entirely in shadow it's like spooky

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,480
casey right

104
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,719
um and if i isolate it so if i turn off

105
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,560
all the other lights you can see it's

106
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,560
actually totally usable kind of by

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,878
itself but it's just kind of boring and

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,039
it's a little bit shadowy it's just not

109
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,878
that great and one of the other things

110
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,039
that you can see is it's the one that

111
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,479
reflects in my glasses you may say oh

112
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,560
why is that happening because i don't

113
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,000
know if you're like me i don't like you

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,759
see a lot of youtubers that use those

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,280
circular lights i really don't like

116
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,280
those because it shows up in their eye

117
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,438
as a little circle and it just looks

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,878
kind of spooky so i actually like this

119
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,359
much better but you might say well in

120
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,639
your glasses it kind of does a nasty

121
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,759
reflection

122
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,079
yes that's why normally i don't talk

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,919
this way i'm normally doing this because

124
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,759
i'm doing programming so it's set up for

125
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,279
this direction and you can see that i've

126
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,479
placed the light so that they don't

127
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,359
actually do

128
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,680
that reflection for when i'm actually

129
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,520
doing my streaming so you do want to be

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,959
careful not to place your lights in

131
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,478
places where they're going to reflect

132
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,519
off something that the the viewer can

133
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,758
really see

134
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,599
or if that is going to happen you could

135
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,600
maybe make them a little denser and a

136
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,120
little dimmer so that it looks just more

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,320
like a natural light but again that's

138
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,240
something that you usually have to worry

139
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,839
about because when you set up your uh

140
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,360
your streaming setup wherever you're

141
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,799
gonna normally be pointing you can

142
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,840
usually place the light so that doesn't

143
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
happen

144
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,439
okay so that's the key light and setting

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,759
it up is really easy again i like it

146
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,839
large so that it gets a nice clean wash

147
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,439
over the face without it being too like

148
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,839
pinpoint

149
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,000
let me go ahead and turn back on the

150
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,799
other two lights so there's that fill

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,038
light

152
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,720
and there's the rim light uh and if i

153
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:18,959
now turn the key light off you can see

154
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,440
the other two lights very clearly and

155
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,279
i'll just turn each one on and off in

156
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,560
series so you can kind of see what they

157
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,799
add so first here is the fill light

158
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,600
which is kind of giving the the side of

159
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,160
my face that's not doing the sort of uh

160
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
sort of blue rim lighting uh it's it's

161
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
giving that side more contour right

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
because otherwise you wouldn't be able

163
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,799
to really see that side of the face and

164
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,079
then the uh the rim light right is just

165
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,319
trying to do uh that sort of uh blue you

166
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,000
know i don't know filmic style lighting

167
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,240
on the side to kind of give it just more

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,240
a little more drama to it right so

169
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,079
without that you kind of lose that now

170
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,840
you can see them both with the fill

171
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,478
light i'm sorry with the key light as

172
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,198
well if you'd like here is uh each one

173
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,038
turned on and off individually so the uh

174
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,560
backlight or the fill light depending on

175
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,159
how you want to call that one you can

176
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,918
see that one turning on and off there

177
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
just so you get a sense of what it does

178
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,159
for the contour here's the rim light

179
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,519
turning on and off

180
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
right

181
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,719
and again there's with both of them

182
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,199
so really that's all that's going on

183
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,280
it's just led strips stuck to moving

184
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,919
blankets that are around me it's an

185
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,679
incredibly cheap setup a hundred and

186
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,279
some odd dollars is about as cheap as

187
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,280
you're gonna get for something that

188
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,279
looks this good most of the other kind

189
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,198
of lights you buy are really clunky and

190
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,879
you'll spend a lot of time and money

191
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,800
actually mounting them as well because a

192
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,159
lot of times they don't have really good

193
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,079
mounts or they're flimsy or they're

194
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
gonna take up space on your desk another

195
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,478
really great thing about this setup is

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,639
it's kind of all out of your way it's

197
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,399
just a little sort of curtain setup that

198
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,160
sits around you and it doesn't take up

199
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,000
any space on your desk it can't fall

200
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,680
over uh there's nothing weird that's

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,680
gonna happen now the other cool thing

202
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,120
about this uh with this setup you kind

203
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,160
of can make your own lighting

204
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,918
environments you can program these leds

205
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,080
to have multiple settings so for example

206
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,560
i can go like switch them around if i

207
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,560
want to have red you know light on my

208
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,319
face or something like that i just can

209
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,720
you know i can have a blue

210
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,439
light or whatever i want to uh i set

211
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,039
these up to do a standard dramatic film

212
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,959
style lighting because that's what i was

213
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,719
looking for but you can actually create

214
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,239
anything you want and you can also

215
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
remember the settings because the

216
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,680
program like you can program the

217
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,919
settings into the remote control and it

218
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,680
will then reset to those when you want

219
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,680
so you can get your streaming setup and

220
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,800
maybe you have one or two of those and

221
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,519
so on

222
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,918
that's really all there is to the setup

223
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,000
as far as mic and camera is concerned

224
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,519
the mics don't matter much you can get

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,598
really good sound if you have this kind

226
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,038
of isolation with the moving blankets

227
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,719
you don't need to spend very much money

228
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,000
on a microphone i actually use a

229
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,840
microphone that's a couple hundred

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,439
dollars because i happen to have had it

231
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,598
from a long time ago it's a really old

232
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,360
microphone but you can use a cheaper

233
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,878
microphone for sure and still get really

234
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,439
good audio quality

235
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,000
camera wise i don't have any tips this

236
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,719
is an expensive camera it's a sony a7

237
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,120
and expensive cameras make things look

238
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,000
better better lenses just make things

239
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,759
look better um a 35 millimeter camera

240
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,279
back with a good lens is gonna make

241
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,879
things look better

242
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,638
this lighting will make things look

243
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,800
really good even with the webcam but

244
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,038
it's never gonna look as good as if you

245
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,879
get a real camera the lens so i wish i

246
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,560
could say there was a way to do that

247
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,560
part cheaply but there isn't the

248
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,639
environment you can do dirt cheap the

249
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,120
camera i don't have any tips that's why

250
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,519
i didn't post a video saying here's how

251
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,918
to get a really cheap camera set up

252
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,839
because that part uh you're on your own

253
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,360
if anyone knows better ways

254
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,640
i'm all yours but

255
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,159
with this lighting setup you should

256
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,838
still be able to use a fairly cheap

257
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,600
camera and have it look good but it

258
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,279
won't look this good that's really all

259
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
there is to it you don't have to do

260
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,720
anything complicated just put up the

261
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,040
moving blankets stick the led strips to

262
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,720
them and then tweak the led strips until

263
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,319
they are the right brightness and the

264
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,639
right color for the look that you're

265
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,200
going for now you have to make sure

266
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,958
again don't get led strips that might

267
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,759
resonate with your camera so always

268
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,518
order like one set of led strips first

269
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,519
and make sure they work with your camera

270
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,679
before ordering more i've definitely

271
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,360
seen led strips that will blink really

272
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,838
nastily they like flicker like a

273
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,680
fluorescent light against the camera and

274
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,920
you don't want that so make sure you get

275
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,919
ones and i'll put the ones that i use in

276
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,838
the link below and i'll also put the

277
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,599
moving blankets in the link below that's

278
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,880
really all there is to it again please

279
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,680
check out our kickstarter if you get a

280
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,080
chance uh it's a great comic

about cats in space and a lot of other

282
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,160
cool stuff uh book one was awesome and

283
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,919
the print looks awesome and so i think

284
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,759
book two will be just as good you can
