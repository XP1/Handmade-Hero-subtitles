00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:12,869
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,750
hero sure we code a complete game live

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:20,009
on stream yesterday I did sort of a i

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,059
guess it was impromptu because i didn't

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,189
know we were going to go into it and

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,278
quite so much death but i needed to

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,259
explain some matrix math in order for

8
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,439
people to understand sort of what i was

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,660
doing and in a particular part of the

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,460
code and so i gave a pretty complete

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,919
explanation actually of how to do

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,950
matrices work for geometric transforms

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,600
and how the inverse and the transpose of

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,180
them are related in sort of a bunch of

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,840
other stuff that you would need to know

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:51,628
if you were doing 2d graphics work and

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,359
needed to do some rather advanced well i

18
00:00:51,628 --> 00:01:00,058
guess not rather advanced i'm going to

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:02,308
use the phrase basic advanced stuff you

20
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:03,329
know plenty of people write 2d games and

21
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:04,588
things without really ever knowing

22
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,079
anything about a matrix but as soon as

23
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:08,789
you want to do something fancy kind of

24
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,920
even that need to know this stuff it's

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,049
not advanced per se but it's more

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,150
advanced than not knowing i guess not

27
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,500
trying to say that any other way so

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,830
anyway we've come to the point hopefully

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,069
if you watched the stream that we did

30
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,239
that talked about that now you know that

31
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,819
the only thing we have left to do now is

32
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,209
show how if we want to do a full inverse

33
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,669
of a 2d matrix a two-by-two matrix i

34
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,949
should say how do we do that and i'm

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,129
going to kind of show how that works

36
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,629
today and this is going to be not very

37
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:42,060
much fun for me certainly because this

38
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,009
is the kind of stuff i hate as far as

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:50,118
doing math is concerned oops gonna have

40
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,118
to reboot my Milt in there see here

41
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,009
there we go run

42
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:14,250
and so here we go on day 3 20 with

43
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:16,519
inverting a 2 by 2 matrix I was

44
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,500
basically going to show how to do this I

45
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,439
from first principles kind of and it's

46
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,330
just a lot of fussy math we're doing

47
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:28,199
only a 2 by 2 matrix so it's as easy as

48
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:31,739
possible which is nice it's a you know a

49
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,780
1 by 1 matrix would just be a scalar but

50
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,640
you know it's still a bunch of fussing

51
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,900
math term so I'm going to do it and

52
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,818
hopefully I won't make too many math

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,289
mistakes along the way feel free to use

54
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,419
computer algebra package when you're

55
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:43,739
actually doing stuff like this but I

56
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,958
kind of want to show how it works out

57
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,579
just so people can see it once all right

58
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,939
so if you remember from yesterday what I

59
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:53,129
what I said was you know we had an

60
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,079
equation that looked like a P equals P

61
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,598
Prime and we actually wanted to solve

62
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:59,760
for P so we needed to be able to

63
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,369
multiply both sides with the inverse of

64
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,530
this transform a inverse this guy right

65
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,289
here and so that's going to give us this

66
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:11,759
equation now we know that a inverse AE

67
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:13,560
Quilly identity matrix right so this

68
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,289
goes away and we're just left with P

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,599
equals a inverse P Prime and this is the

70
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:20,729
occasion occasion that's good this is

71
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,349
the equation we wanted to solve and so

72
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,108
in order to solve it we obviously need

73
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:28,979
to know how to produce a inverse and so

74
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:32,069
that is where we are at today so what we

75
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:34,979
want to do is say well if I had an a

76
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:38,818
matrix and let's say it's just a b c d

77
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:40,409
like so if i have an a matrix and i

78
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,649
would like to produce the inverse of

79
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:47,370
that a matrix well i've already kind of

80
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,950
shown you everything you need to know to

81
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,810
solve for what that actually is from

82
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,399
first principles if you want to just

83
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,530
work out how to do a matrix embrace

84
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,169
yourself you actually know how to do it

85
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,459
and let me explain why and then I'll

86
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:00,989
show you how to do it that way and then

87
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,810
we can also see some some kind of

88
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,349
shortcut approaches that you can follow

89
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,129
but let's just take a look at this so

90
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:11,099
here's my a Maitre

91
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,150
and what I said yesterday in when we

92
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,530
were just talking about what the

93
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,520
definition of the inverse was and what

94
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,000
the definition of the identity matrix

95
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:22,259
was we said some some very basic things

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,970
which is just that a inverse times a has

97
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,620
to equal the identity matrix right

98
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,770
that's the definition of the inverse

99
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,860
that's what we know has to be true and

100
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:34,370
so if we have this equation you'll

101
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:39,060
notice that this is a matrix equation

102
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:41,519
where we have a two by two matrix times

103
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,430
another two by two matrix equaling a

104
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,229
known quantity just you know the

105
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,290
identity matrix is is just a known

106
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,420
quantity it's that right and so if we

107
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:55,830
take a look at what this is well this is

108
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,449
a equation that has for it this is an

109
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,829
equation that some so has four scalar

110
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,750
equations in it right because a

111
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:02,789
two-by-two matrix so it's four scalar

112
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,819
equations right one for each slot in

113
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,650
this matrix multiply and we know all of

114
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,599
the values in the a matrix that's what

115
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:12,209
we're given to start with so we have

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,920
four unknowns in the a inverse we don't

117
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:15,599
know what the members what those four

118
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,540
elements of Andres are we have four

119
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,460
knowns and a four nodes in the eye so we

120
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,990
have four equations in four unknowns

121
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:23,969
essentially as you'll see in a second in

122
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,009
case you don't believe me which means we

123
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,440
can just solve this right we can just

124
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:32,789
solve it it may be a lot of fussing but

125
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,860
we have what we need right so take a

126
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,600
look at what ends up happening here so I

127
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,220
have an a inverse matrix I don't know

128
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,840
any of the values of this a inverse

129
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,020
matrix right I have no idea what they

130
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:47,219
are so let's just say we have X Y Z W

131
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:50,189
are the the terms of my inverse matrix

132
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,160
right so this is my a inverse here and

133
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,509
then I've got my a matrix right and I'm

134
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,950
going to make my amex just kind of big

135
00:05:54,509 --> 00:06:00,539
because we're going to be room for our

136
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:05,579
Terms down here right and my my a matrix

137
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:08,879
I just said was a b c d okay so what are

138
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:11,729
all the terms of this product here right

139
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:15,360
and I know again that this equals the

140
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:17,330
identity matrix 1 0 0 1 0 right there

141
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,590
you go

142
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:21,180
so what are the terms you know how to do

143
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:25,589
makeup so I've done tons of times on

144
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:32,939
handmade hero so I've got ax plus cy in

145
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:41,219
here I've got AZ plus C W right I've got

146
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:43,980
be X plus dy and I've got bz plus d w

147
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:52,500
right those are my dot product terms

148
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:55,980
right ax cy AZ CW be why ooh I made a

149
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:01,079
mistake there be why glad i checked be

150
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:03,509
why DW oh no i didn't know that's that's

151
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,879
nonsense I did it right first time be X

152
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:12,449
my fine little Mike Ross was just a

153
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:13,860
little bit off be X dy DZ DW ok so I

154
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,209
produced all of the dot products like I

155
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,410
said matrix multiplication you could

156
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:19,049
think of was just a series of dot

157
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,970
products every column with every row and

158
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,579
that's what we've got here and so

159
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,880
hopefully you can see now why this why I

160
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:29,629
say we have four equations because this

161
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,920
is what we are left with right and

162
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,930
obviously if I'm saying that this matrix

163
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,120
is equal to this matrix then each of

164
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,150
their elements must be equal so I

165
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,340
actually know that ax plus C y equals

166
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:44,789
one right I know they have to be equal I

167
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:48,679
know that BX plus dy has to equal zero I

168
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:53,340
know that AZ plus CW has to equal zero

169
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:57,030
and I know that BZ plus DW has to equal

170
00:07:53,339 --> 00:08:00,539
what right so I know the a's the bees

171
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:03,509
the Seas the DS right I know the ones

172
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,990
and zeros so I have four equations and

173
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:11,159
only four unknowns X Y Z W so we can

174
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:13,470
solve this equation strictly by back

175
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,660
substituting right we can actually just

176
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,820
go ahead and do it like I said it's a

177
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,910
pain in the butt but here we go right

178
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:23,879
let's just do it grid you know grin and

179
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,410
bear it and like I said without knowing

180
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,509
it without need to know any trickery or

181
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,060
any you know special stuff about linear

182
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:31,050
algebra just from what I already had

183
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,849
explained

184
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,918
you could have set this up and solved it

185
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,408
right because we know that that's what

186
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,528
has to happen if we want to find the

187
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:44,870
inverse matrix so yeah let's go ahead

188
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:47,399
and and I guess use the zero guys first

189
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:51,209
let's let's start with this equation

190
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,009
here we have BX plus dy equals zero so

191
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:56,969
it's trivial for us to solve this in

192
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:59,970
terms of let's say the X variable since

193
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,980
hey let's solve for x first why not so

194
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,940
we would know that that would be be x

195
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,940
equals negative dy right or X just

196
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:13,490
equals dy over I'm sorry x equals dy

197
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:16,410
over be right very very straightforward

198
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,389
so now i can plug that in i could plug

199
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:21,328
that into this guy up here I could say

200
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:24,328
okay I now know what X is so if I want

201
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:26,819
to solve for y well I've got an equation

202
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:28,139
in terms of Y an equation in terms of X

203
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,930
right and you can see how I'm kind of

204
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,879
doing this I'm just saying well you know

205
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:37,620
really because these don't have any

206
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:41,278
cross terms I could think of it as you

207
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:44,909
know as being two equations one in x + 1

208
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,799
+ y I'm sorry two equations in x and y &amp;

209
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:48,328
2 equation skin Z and W because that's

210
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,849
just how it happens to fall out right

211
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:53,189
you're only going to have x and y's on

212
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,139
this row there won't be any x and y's in

213
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,790
this row so when I go to solve I don't

214
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:00,689
have to think about that thankfully

215
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:02,939
right alright so i've got x equals

216
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,709
negative dy over B and then I can just

217
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,959
plug it back into here where I'll have

218
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:09,929
only wise right because I'll have ax

219
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,599
plus C y equals 1 well the X I now know

220
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:15,299
what it is so I can say a times negative

221
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:20,970
dy over B which is what I solve for

222
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:22,948
before plus cy there we go equals 1 okay

223
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:27,300
and so now I should be able to actually

224
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:31,799
solve for y I would have negative a dy

225
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:33,899
over B plus C y equals 1 you can see

226
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,389
here that I can pull out the y term

227
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:40,110
right I could pull out the y term here

228
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:43,559
and just get c minus ad over B equals 1

229
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,370
right and then I am left with just the

230
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,509
actual

231
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:51,360
answer for what why is which is just y

232
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:52,919
equals 1 over ad over B now big caveat

233
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,960
there that's if I didn't make a math

234
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,289
mistake i'm awful at doing math by hand

235
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:02,250
so you know what i should say is it's

236
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:04,169
something like c- ad over B modulo the

237
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:09,000
math errors that Casey probably meant

238
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:12,569
Casey probably had along the way but you

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,720
can see now that you've got a equation

240
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:18,450
in terms of Y and all knowns on the

241
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:25,110
other side because these a B D and C

242
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:26,730
those are all obviously pieces of those

243
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:30,899
are all things that we knew from the

244
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:32,430
original matrix right so yeah so let me

245
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,220
just quickly double check that because

246
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:38,939
like i said i usually make math errors

247
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:41,190
we have BX plus dy so I just subtracted

248
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,710
the dy to the other side like so and

249
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:47,430
then I / be so that's where my ex I had

250
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:51,180
a X plus cy I substituted in my negative

251
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:54,120
dy over be so at a and a plus C y equals

252
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:58,708
one there right so that's negative ad Y

253
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,480
over B plus CY and then I just pulled my

254
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,250
Y out I flipped the terms because this

255
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,320
one's negativeness was positive so I put

256
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,690
the sea first and the negative 80 / b

257
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:14,700
and then I ended up with this term here

258
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:20,130
right now it's worth noting that if I

259
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:22,980
wanted to I could sort of i could write

260
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:25,649
this as a combined fraction or i could

261
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:29,580
do a bunch of the things to this if I

262
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,539
wanted to like I guess I'm saying is

263
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,600
there's there's other ways I could

264
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,490
phrase this right because you know it's

265
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
a it's a 1 over right now but then

266
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,209
there's a fraction on the bottom so if I

267
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,060
wanted to kind of simplify this term a

268
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:43,829
little i could do so right and let me

269
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,719
just show you what i mean by that so if

270
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:49,290
I and again this is all caveat if I did

271
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,990
the math right one over this term right

272
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:53,699
here c minus 80 / be well if i wanted to

273
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,220
combine this fraction right i could

274
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,810
multiply this guy by b over b which is

275
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,960
you know equal to 1

276
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:03,629
and I could get B C over B right- ad

277
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,790
over be right so I could turn that

278
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:08,730
bottom into something that could

279
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:14,009
actually be done as a fraction so it

280
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:16,889
would become bc- ad all over be right i

281
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:18,960
mean that's that's just all i'm doing is

282
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,970
simplifying that bottom a little bit why

283
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,089
did i do that because now that I've done

284
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,399
that one over something over something

285
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,940
right I can just flip it I can get rid

286
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:34,528
of the one over now and just end up with

287
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:36,660
you know b over b c minus ad right so

288
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:39,689
that's really a simpler version of that

289
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:42,028
term be over bc- ad it's a it's a

290
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:45,000
cleaner version then this is where I've

291
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:47,519
got the one over there right so b over b

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,700
c minus ad if i did the math right as i

293
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,250
said before i now know that that's the

294
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,110
that why element of my matrix so here's

295
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,990
my a inverse I'm just going to rewrite

296
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,089
it here with the one that we know okay

297
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:07,049
so here it is down here what I say it

298
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:14,280
was be over bc- ad right so be over bc

299
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:17,219
oops p c- ad okay i'll make sense uh

300
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,779
okay so let's just continue with the

301
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,180
exact same process again like I said

302
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,889
this is just a lot of of like high

303
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:24,359
school alger homework I mean at some

304
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:26,069
level you could say this was this was

305
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,690
junior high school algebra homework

306
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,030
right were in pre-algebra they just made

307
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,670
you like move terms around for no reason

308
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:34,169
which honestly is what most of math is

309
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:36,389
before you go to college I suppose so

310
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:38,969
anyway we still have this equation here

311
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:40,699
x equals a negative dy over B or rather

312
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:46,560
I should say we have this equation here

313
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:49,950
BX plus dy we can plug in our equation

314
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:53,369
for y to solve for x now because we do

315
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:56,459
know that bx right Plus D times this

316
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:59,970
right which would be d b over b c minus

317
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:02,278
ad right is going to equal zero and

318
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,410
that's all in terms of X as well so if

319
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:08,639
you take a look at what happens there we

320
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:11,339
would have be x equals d b over b c

321
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,139
minus ad negated right i'm moving this

322
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,440
the other side and then I would be

323
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:18,899
dividing by be right so I'd have x

324
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,670
equals negative and you'll notice

325
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,709
there's a bee on top and I'm dividing by

326
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:27,269
a bee so those go away and I just be

327
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:29,280
left with d / bc- ad right so negative D

328
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:31,860
bc- ad now you'll notice something

329
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,089
interesting about that again keep I keep

330
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,610
always at the caveat to the math right i

331
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,490
am not strong with manual computation

332
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:43,320
but you can see our ex- d over bc my CD

333
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,730
that's really kind of similar right you

334
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:51,800
can kind of see that that's a pretty

335
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:51,800
similar term here right bc minus ad uh

336
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:59,849
it's got the same denominator right

337
00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:02,329
which is kind of surprising a little bit

338
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,670
right i mean it just seems a little odd

339
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,960
so even you know even with my shoddy

340
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,860
math skills we're starting to get

341
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,120
something that looks like it has a

342
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,490
little bit of structure here so maybe

343
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,750
that should give us some encouragement

344
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,299
but you know I'm just saying keep an eye

345
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,309
on that right alright so now let's do

346
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,959
the exact same thing with these

347
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:22,709
equations now those of you who are

348
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,470
particularly good at math will probably

349
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,470
note that we can probably shortcut this

350
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:32,580
a little bit because if you look at what

351
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:35,840
these look like right you can see that

352
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:40,500
they're essentially the same equations

353
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:43,620
almost except the ex sorry the AC terms

354
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,840
are the ones that equal one here and the

355
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,700
BD terms are the ones that equals 0

356
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,830
whereas in this one it's the same

357
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,040
equations but the zero and the one are

358
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:56,310
flipped right so essentially we could

359
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:59,730
just substitute we could flip the a B

360
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:02,579
and the CD right and the solutions to

361
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,500
the equations would be the same to see

362
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,959
what I'm saying because it's really just

363
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,000
the same two equations with Z in place

364
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:15,509
of X W in place of Y right and the zero

365
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,490
and the one flipped makes sense so we

366
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:20,099
could if we were so inclined jump right

367
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,319
to the conclusion that we're going to

368
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:25,168
get the same two terms here but with the

369
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,730
opposite set of letters but

370
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,739
I'm going to do it out longhand just so

371
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,749
you can see it like I said we should do

372
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:32,100
this once I think it's important to just

373
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:35,100
kind of see everything out once before

374
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:37,138
you start to do those little swizzles

375
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:39,719
and stuff so anyway do the same thing

376
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:42,538
idea before go to start with a0 term so

377
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,749
I've got an AZ plus C W equals zero

378
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:48,538
right I want to solve for one of these

379
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:50,700
and so i'll just start solve for the z

380
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:56,069
right so i'll have a Z equals negative

381
00:17:50,700 --> 00:18:00,690
CW or oops or Z equals negative CW over

382
00:17:56,069 --> 00:18:02,939
a ok so that's my my temporary term for

383
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,590
Z again it's in terms of W so I haven't

384
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,450
solved for Z yet I've just put it in

385
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,980
terms of W but now I could do the same

386
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,808
thing at it before which is my back

387
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,028
substitution right I could take be Z

388
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:16,230
plus DW and i can substitute it in there

389
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:18,419
right so i've got bz plus DW and that's

390
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,399
going to equal one right DZ plus two

391
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,350
equals one and so now i can substitute

392
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:25,288
in my Z term so what I've got here is

393
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:30,509
I've got be at times my negative CW over

394
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:33,419
a right that's my Z term plus DW equals

395
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:36,480
one well now I've got it such that all

396
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:38,309
of its all in terms of W so again same

397
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,019
exact process coming through so i've got

398
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:45,269
negative bc w over a plus DW equals one

399
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:47,249
again i want to solve for W so I'm just

400
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:50,128
going to pull the W term out i end up

401
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:52,409
with the D minus BC over a equals one

402
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:53,878
again like I said very similar equations

403
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:55,230
because we've just kind of reversed some

404
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:57,480
terms around but it's basically the

405
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,788
exact same system so it's no surprise

406
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,099
right that it looks exactly like this

407
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:06,028
guy here only with some of the letters

408
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:08,908
changed around right so again I can

409
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:13,138
finish solving for W i would get 1 over

410
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:15,960
d minus BC over a there's my inverted

411
00:19:13,138 --> 00:19:17,638
term right and like I said before we

412
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,409
want to try and simplify this down so

413
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:21,628
that we can see the structure in the

414
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:24,330
equation so I'm going to continue doing

415
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:26,428
exactly what I was doing before to get

416
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:29,668
this into the simplest possible form

417
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:31,769
again x a over a so i can combine these

418
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,778
two fractions well this guy is really a

419
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:37,798
fraction right but you get my point so

420
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:38,880
I'd have ad over a minus BC over a that

421
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:40,440
allows me to combine

422
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,090
terms so that would just give me one

423
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:52,529
over ad minus BC over a right and then I

424
00:19:45,089 --> 00:20:02,399
can finish the the sort of uninvent no

425
00:19:52,529 --> 00:20:04,829
uncle I can finish the D version of this

426
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,440
by flipping the fraction around just

427
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:10,079
flipping it over and getting ad minus BC

428
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,370
on the bottom and a on the top right so

429
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:20,669
I have a with ad minus BC there so let's

430
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:25,529
see here where my at ya so a over ad

431
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:27,810
minus BC and that was my was the term

432
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:33,480
out of solving for that was my w/a over

433
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:38,429
ad minus BC right so there's my w/a over

434
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:42,150
ad minus BC right uh and you know just

435
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,259
keep pay attention to this again like I

436
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,730
said you could see a lot of structured

437
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:47,549
there but it's not quite the same bottom

438
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,750
turn right but you know don't don't

439
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,829
worry about that too much because we're

440
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,150
going to get to looking at the structure

441
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:52,289
this in a second but just I was saying

442
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,540
like look at the similarity a little bit

443
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:57,389
there so now we've got our w terms so

444
00:20:54,539 --> 00:21:00,089
let's go back up to the equation that we

445
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,410
didn't use right that we thought we

446
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:03,000
didn't use but that we used as our

447
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,740
starter I should be circling this one

448
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,500
though we use as our starter here right

449
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,920
where we saw FC the AZ minus CW so if I

450
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:15,089
start with a Z minus CW again AZ minus

451
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:17,039
CW and now I substitute in my w I will

452
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:23,929
be able to solve for Z for reals this

453
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:27,809
time AZ minus C a over ad minus BC right

454
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:33,600
and that equals I lost it again it

455
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:35,250
equals 0 right okay so if I want to

456
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,019
finish solving for this guy I know I

457
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,369
have to solve for my Z well that doesn't

458
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:42,480
look particularly hard I'll just end up

459
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:45,839
with AZ and CA minus I'm sorry over ad

460
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,120
minus BC here right so I just need to

461
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,769
dissolve / my a but of course there

462
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,028
already isn't a so i end up with just

463
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:58,839
see / ad

464
00:21:52,028 --> 00:22:06,398
specie right and that's it so see / ad

465
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:09,728
minus BC C over ad minus BC right and

466
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:11,978
there's all my terms now what you'll

467
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:15,460
notice about these guys is if I wanted

468
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:17,129
to i'm pretty sure i have a math error

469
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,119
in here somewhere because i i'm

470
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:21,009
expecting this to be slightly more

471
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:23,618
symmetric with the minus so i think i

472
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:26,528
missed a minus which let's be honest is

473
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:31,209
pretty good for me like i said very very

474
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:34,148
bad at a symbolic math manually i always

475
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,979
do stuff like that which is why i hate

476
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:40,508
doing it right i really want the

477
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:41,919
algebraic blackboard program even for

478
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:44,229
when i'm working stuff out myself where

479
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,669
I just tell it what math operations I

480
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,899
want to do and it did it I don't know

481
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:48,339
why that program doesn't exist i've

482
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,168
always thought i should just write it

483
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:52,019
but does it because i usually don't

484
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,919
actually want to solve stuff for me

485
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:55,388
because a lot of times i'm working with

486
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,580
things symbolically that it that it

487
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:59,288
can't solve necessarily and i just want

488
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:01,298
to be able to manipulate the terms with

489
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:03,098
predictability and know that i don't

490
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:07,329
make a kill us error i really wish i had

491
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:08,229
that anyway um but point being you can

492
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:10,269
look at the structure this and i'm going

493
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:12,940
to check the math at second but even at

494
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:15,298
this point you can see that actually all

495
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,950
of these have the exact same divisor

496
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:20,079
minus the fact that some of them are

497
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,210
negative because if i wanted to i could

498
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:26,168
turn this into the same divisor just by

499
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:30,098
negating this term right if i have c /

500
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:34,359
ad minus BC right and I want that to

501
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:38,288
look like c over b c minus ad all i have

502
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:42,608
to do is multiply it by a negative 1

503
00:23:38,288 --> 00:23:44,950
over negative 1 which is right that's

504
00:23:42,608 --> 00:23:47,858
equal to one if i multiply that i would

505
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:51,069
just get negative C over negative ad

506
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:53,769
minus BC which is VC minus ad right so I

507
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:55,868
can produce this just by doing that I

508
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:58,509
can regularize it so that it has the

509
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:59,468
same bottom as the rest of these guys so

510
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:00,848
I'm going to go see if I can just

511
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:03,940
quickly find my matter because we're so

512
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:04,829
close almost had an error-free rum you

513
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,710
might as well go

514
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:12,028
broke right I mean come on so let's see

515
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:18,360
here where was I at so let's see we've

516
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:20,880
got well you know what actually here's

517
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:22,648
the easiest way to do it i suppose if i

518
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,570
was to convert these all to the same one

519
00:24:22,648 --> 00:24:26,879
let's convert them all to ad minus BC

520
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:28,859
right so what I would end up with in

521
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:34,528
that case is I would end up with a

522
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:43,949
matrix that would look like d / ad minus

523
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:47,369
BC be negative B over ad minus BC right

524
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:56,519
and then I would end up with c / ad

525
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:59,548
minus BC and a over ad minus BC right so

526
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:03,058
if i take that i should be able to

527
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:05,069
multiply it if i want to buy my original

528
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:06,778
matrix and i should be able to get the

529
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:10,829
identity right if i've done it correctly

530
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:12,450
right a b c d and i think i have a sign

531
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:15,480
error so i think this should show us

532
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:17,880
pretty quickly which pair of terms is

533
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,720
right and wrong or at least get us close

534
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,278
to that right so let's take a look so

535
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,230
say i'm going to multiply this down

536
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:26,759
right well they all have their gonna

537
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:33,269
have the same divisor so i'd end up with

538
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:35,398
ad right plus BC over ad minus BC right

539
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:39,000
that's what I would end up with and you

540
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:40,768
can see that this is slightly wrong that

541
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,919
should be a negative there in order to

542
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:47,700
make this equal one right so it looks

543
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,610
like this term is probably incorrect I

544
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:54,950
probably missed the minus as I suggested

545
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:59,990
right if that makes sense the next one

546
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:04,740
this would give me negative be a right

547
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:08,700
plus a B and that's perfect right ad

548
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:11,220
minus BC that's a B minus ay B that's 0

549
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,679
which is exactly what I wanted right so

550
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,798
those two terms look correct right so

551
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,640
these guys look good we know this guy is

552
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,440
wrong so we can just ignore

553
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,110
that for a second here and then let's

554
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,950
double check this guy so if we have cd

555
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:31,119
times this we would get negative b c

556
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:32,410
plus da equals ad minus BC and hey look

557
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,689
that's exactly what that is so that's

558
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,840
one so I think we know that these terms

559
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:40,299
are correct and we just don't know about

560
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:43,869
these terms here but it looks like this

561
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:46,930
guy is our error and hey that was I

562
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:50,469
think the guy that I did last so I guess

563
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:51,910
I just ran out of steam right this was

564
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,600
this was that guy right there so let's

565
00:26:51,910 --> 00:27:01,269
take a look I had AZ minus C W equals

566
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:03,759
zero is that correct AZ AZ ah well that

567
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:06,549
would that would do it looks like you

568
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,349
just copied it down wrong I can't fault

569
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,089
myself too much with that jumping all

570
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:12,639
over the blackboard here so it's really

571
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:15,849
a plus AZ plus DW so if we fix that bug

572
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,110
we get AZ plus CA a must be right when

573
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:19,029
this transfers the other side it becomes

574
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:21,069
the minus and that's where r minus

575
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:24,309
that's where we lost our minus that's

576
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:28,720
not too bad I'll you know I won't be too

577
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:31,029
hard of myself for that but that's that

578
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,549
tells us what we needed to know and now

579
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:36,369
we have finished inverting our matrix so

580
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:37,889
we actually have our matrix here and we

581
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:40,479
can write this actually in a pretty

582
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:44,410
compact way if we want to we could

583
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:51,519
really just say this is 1 over ad minus

584
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:55,240
BC and the elements are just d- be

585
00:27:51,519 --> 00:28:03,279
negative see a right so this right here

586
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:09,240
is our a inverse if our a is equal to a

587
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:11,500
b c d okay that's that's what we've got

588
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,579
and we just proved that worked because

589
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,140
we multiplied it out and got the

590
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:16,679
identity matrix so everyone's happy

591
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,410
happy birthday everything's great right

592
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,120
well what we can look at when we see

593
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,800
this is you can see very quickly now

594
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:26,829
that if you just wanted to remember in

595
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:29,470
your head how to invert a 2d matrix it's

596
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:31,029
actually pretty easy to remember this

597
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,440
guy right here has a special name that

598
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:36,849
we won't go into into two

599
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:40,110
detail but this is the determinant this

600
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:44,379
guy right here well actually that guy

601
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:46,389
and the determinant of a matrix of a 2d

602
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,920
matrix is just the product of the

603
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,170
diagonal minus the product of the

604
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,560
counter diagonal right so it's ad minus

605
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,550
BC so it's pretty easy to remember again

606
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,049
if you just want to remember how to

607
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:58,480
invert one without I can go through all

608
00:28:56,049 --> 00:29:02,950
that it's pretty easy to remember you

609
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,870
take this this diagonal multiply it and

610
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,460
subtract this diagonal after multiplying

611
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:08,439
it and you get the tournament one over

612
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,769
that determinant and then you just

613
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,450
multiply by the matrix effectively

614
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:15,940
flipped like counter transposed right

615
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:19,690
flipping it this way and negating the

616
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:24,309
the opposite diagonal right so that's

617
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:26,259
one way you can think of you kind of

618
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:27,759
like mnemonic Lee remember if you would

619
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:29,049
like to or you can just do it up by hand

620
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,670
or you can look it up or you can do

621
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:35,399
whatever you want but point being now

622
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:35,400
you can see where that comes from right

623
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:45,910
anyway so that's what we've got and hey

624
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:48,429
let's take a look at what actually

625
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,230
happens with this matrix if we want to

626
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,810
use it for the purpose that we said we

627
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:55,120
want to use it for which is computing

628
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:57,519
the UV coordinates right before we were

629
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:00,699
doing a transpose so let's actually look

630
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:03,190
at what the difference is here right so

631
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,440
before we did a transpose and we had our

632
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,600
screen space p right and we were

633
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,180
producing the U and V s right so before

634
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,799
we were we were saying like let's say we

635
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,350
have x and y so let's say we're doing

636
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:17,649
the vector XY the screen space X Y right

637
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:21,609
that's our RP so before we were doing

638
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,800
ATP to get our you and v's right that's

639
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:26,049
how we were doing it and what did that

640
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,089
give us right well that just gives us

641
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:31,629
the a transpose P right that just gives

642
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:35,289
us if the matrix looks like this ABCD or

643
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:37,060
whatever and you know what I guess well

644
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:39,730
we'll fill in what the values actually

645
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:42,220
are later I suppose because we know what

646
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:45,069
this this was the x axis and this was

647
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,269
the y axis of our transform right but

648
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:49,628
anyway if we have a trance

649
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:53,739
p and we're doing this matrix it'd be a

650
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:56,439
be right times X Y so it'd be ax plus B

651
00:30:53,739 --> 00:31:01,048
Y in the top and then we would end up

652
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:05,769
with C and D for the bottom right CX

653
00:31:01,048 --> 00:31:07,358
plus dy that would have been if we had

654
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:09,638
not transpose it I guess I should say

655
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:12,249
and so if we transpose it we're going to

656
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:14,829
flip those around so we're going to flip

657
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:18,819
the sea and the B but the A&amp;D stay in

658
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:26,168
the same place right so that would be ax

659
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:31,808
plus cy and for the bottom row BD right

660
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:33,809
so that's going to be BX plus dy so

661
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:38,229
that's what we would work computing

662
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:40,088
right if that makes sense and to our

663
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:43,690
credit we did actually still try to

664
00:31:40,088 --> 00:31:46,058
divide by the length amount there so we

665
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:49,509
were doing a compensation for the length

666
00:31:46,058 --> 00:31:52,749
of the x and y vectors but that's all we

667
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:57,548
were compensating for right and so the

668
00:31:52,749 --> 00:32:00,338
length of those vectors hmm we could

669
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,538
look at again we'll we'll take a look at

670
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:02,888
this I guess we should probably go look

671
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:04,868
at the code and put in exactly what

672
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:06,699
we're doing but let's actually just take

673
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:08,878
a look at what happens when we use our

674
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:12,269
determinant to do the actual inverted

675
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:14,618
the actual inverse operation here right

676
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:16,239
so if we were going to do that we will

677
00:32:14,618 --> 00:32:18,908
be multiplying by this matrix and then

678
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:24,838
dividing by this value right so our

679
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:38,049
final values that we would get would be

680
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:44,769
DX oops minus B Y over ad minus BC and

681
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:46,868
then negative CX plus a y over ad minus

682
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:49,378
BC right that's what we would actually

683
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:49,378
get

684
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:57,220
all right and if I wanted to flip this

685
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:59,288
around for just for good measure right

686
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:09,999
you could imagine I don't know how do i

687
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:14,138
erase your eraser e I could actually do

688
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:16,868
it the other way around and say a why CX

689
00:33:14,138 --> 00:33:17,709
right if I wanted to but I'm not going

690
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:23,079
to do that I'm gonna leave it in the

691
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:24,850
opposite order okay so this is the

692
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:26,798
actual vector that we would get back and

693
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:29,648
if we look at what these are we know

694
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:32,769
what the ABC and D are right because our

695
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:36,849
matrix was set up such that this was our

696
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:39,970
like our UX that the U vector right or

697
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:42,519
the x axis is X right XX I don't know

698
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:45,100
how we wanted to write it let's call it

699
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:48,308
let's call it ux for now and this was

700
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:52,148
our you why right this was our VX and

701
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:54,700
this was our V Y right so if i'm going

702
00:33:52,148 --> 00:34:01,528
to replace those then when i get is on

703
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:10,210
the bottom of these guys my a is UX

704
00:34:01,528 --> 00:34:15,909
right my D is V Y so it's you XV y minus

705
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:21,338
the BC right so VX you why or I guess we

706
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:28,119
could write it you y VX right so it's UV

707
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:32,619
it's like the it's the XY y X right okay

708
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:37,000
so same thing would be up here v y- you

709
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:41,740
y VX Zack same product and then on top

710
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:47,199
we would just have our d term which is V

711
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:53,469
Y V Y times the input x coordinate minus

712
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:57,909
our VX right at times the input y

713
00:34:53,469 --> 00:35:02,588
coordinate we get up there and for here

714
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:03,759
we would get negative you y times the

715
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:11,679
input x coordinate

716
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:14,320
+ v x times the input y coordinate so

717
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,940
that's the actual equation now for doing

718
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,450
the reverse mapping that we actually

719
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:24,400
wanted to do and so if we go back to our

720
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:28,239
code now we can actually take a look and

721
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:32,340
be in a position to hopefully fix our

722
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:35,949
bug so let's go ahead to handmade code

723
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:42,610
that's in the renderer and that's in

724
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:45,609
oops draw rectangle quickly and in draw

725
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:55,960
a rectangle quickly you can see where

726
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:57,789
we're actually doing this code here so

727
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,610
here's where we're convert well here's

728
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:05,800
where we're computing excuse me ru and

729
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:08,170
RV coordinates and we have to replace

730
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,430
this these computations with the correct

731
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:16,450
ones so let's go ahead and it's me blow

732
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:19,559
the project file there so let me go

733
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:19,559
ahead and pop back here

734
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:32,619
and let's load up already on it there we

735
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:34,869
go and so you can see that the body is

736
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:36,880
just doing you know the totally wrong

737
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:39,309
thing there right it's not like what the

738
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,680
opengl one is doing at all and so that's

739
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:44,409
the bug that we're trying to fix so if

740
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,779
we come back here and look at what we

741
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:50,139
were doing well we've got these sort of

742
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:53,560
n x axis stuff that's happening right

743
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:56,500
and you we were computing that up at the

744
00:36:53,559 --> 00:37:00,820
top here somewhere and next act there it

745
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:06,849
is so you can see here that we have one

746
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:09,160
over the x-axis length squared there and

747
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:13,420
we are multiplying so we respectively

748
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:16,980
good / whatever the length of the x-axis

749
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:21,190
is in addition to doing the basic divide

750
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:27,250
which I'll be honest I'm not sure why we

751
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:31,720
were doing let's take a look here I'm

752
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:33,760
not sure why we're doing it ah ah

753
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:37,689
because we want to map it into the 120

754
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,060
space right so when we do that inverse

755
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:42,429
transform their we want to first

756
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:45,309
compensate for however long the x axis

757
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:46,869
is but then we also want to divide by

758
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:50,529
the total length of the x axis to

759
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:55,059
convert our our length back to be 0 to 1

760
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:58,720
right uh so in in actuality there's

761
00:37:55,059 --> 00:38:02,019
nothing wrong with with us having sort

762
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:04,209
of done that done that part either and I

763
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:06,130
have to think for a second about whether

764
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:10,840
we need what we need to do therefore

765
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:14,890
that we didn't really handle that part

766
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:18,160
in the previous one did because our a

767
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:19,960
matrix no I guess we did in theory are a

768
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:24,549
matrix should be taking that into

769
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:27,340
account now I believe right so I think

770
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:29,170
we don't in theory if I'm not very much

771
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,809
mistaken and it's easy with this much

772
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:34,960
stuff to be mistaken I think where we

773
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:37,269
actually just can do this operation and

774
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:47,769
and be done

775
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:50,829
I believe right yeah so I think we don't

776
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:53,199
really need any of this stuff anymore I

777
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:55,710
think we can just use the x axis

778
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:58,809
components and the y axis components and

779
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:02,230
and do it now here's the interesting

780
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:04,590
part so what you can see here is the

781
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:07,809
term that we actually care about here

782
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:09,579
you know we can we can we can think we

783
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:11,799
can turn this into essentially exactly

784
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:15,279
what we were already doing because you

785
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:18,340
can see that we have our this is this is

786
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,260
our V term right this is the V output

787
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:24,640
and this is the you output that we were

788
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:27,940
trying to get so this term is constant u

789
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:31,199
XV y uy v x that's a constant we can

790
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:35,500
just compute that ahead of time and and

791
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:37,629
know and and be done right similarly

792
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,030
this at the top is just a dot product

793
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:43,090
right it's just a dot product with the

794
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:46,210
vector negative view y+ VX and this

795
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:49,390
one's the dot product with v y- VX right

796
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,340
of the incoming x and y so if we just do

797
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:53,440
the exact same math we're already doing

798
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,260
but just prep our vectors slightly

799
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,280
differently uh we can actually just I

800
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:03,550
think we can just keep the code

801
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,240
identical right because the n x axis is

802
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:10,960
is just needs to be prepped in this way

803
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:14,769
right so first let's compute that

804
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:21,099
determinant right and that's going to be

805
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:22,659
our are you a car x axis X right so I'm

806
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:31,440
just reading off this bottom term here

807
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:37,449
our x axis x times our y-axis y minus r

808
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:39,190
x axis y times our y axis X right that's

809
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:42,789
that determinant value that's under

810
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:45,429
there and now when we produce these

811
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:46,989
matrices we want to be very specific

812
00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:50,859
with these we don't want to do that

813
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:54,549
anymore we want to do ours

814
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:57,940
cific equation and our equation is for

815
00:40:54,550 --> 00:41:01,300
the for the x axis it's going to be v y

816
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:04,090
and minus VX both of them over the

817
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:07,900
determinate right and if this

818
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:10,750
determinant happens to be 0 right if the

819
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:13,119
determinant equals zero then that means

820
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,510
that we've got a very degenerate like

821
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:19,299
we've sort of collapsed our things into

822
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:21,220
into the same place so I feel like if

823
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,200
the determinant gets too low obviously

824
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:25,809
we also probably we don't want to divide

825
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,579
by zero so we could just stuff an

826
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:29,799
arbitrary value in there in that case

827
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:31,690
but we could also think about what that

828
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:36,460
actually means a little bit later like

829
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:39,700
to do Casey just don't draw if the debt

830
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,740
is zero it's close to zero because it

831
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:42,639
means it would be such a thin thing that

832
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:44,079
you wouldn't be able to see it anyway

833
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,059
probably but anyway that getting a

834
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,639
little head of ourselves all right so

835
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:51,820
that NX access again like I said it's v

836
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:54,549
y so that's the y axis Y component and

837
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:57,250
it's a you know over the determinant

838
00:41:54,550 --> 00:42:01,300
obviously and the other one is the is

839
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:08,559
the V axis X component sorry the y axis

840
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:12,670
X opponent over the determinate and yeah

841
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:16,150
and these by the way or not need any

842
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:21,789
more and then similarly down here we

843
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:26,250
would have a wait a second we missed

844
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,250
something here vxvy

845
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:41,319
let me read that again DX minus B Y so d

846
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:45,250
is V and B is you or is also v never

847
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:48,220
mind this is a and C so that should have

848
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:57,880
been you and you so these should have

849
00:42:48,219 --> 00:43:00,819
both been you right right I'm not

850
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:07,740
hallucinating there am I I don't think I

851
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:07,740
am yeah

852
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:16,818
yeah alright so back to our back to our

853
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:19,670
original story so that's going to be

854
00:43:16,818 --> 00:43:24,829
negative x axis x over the terminate and

855
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:27,230
x axis y the determinant ok so now

856
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:28,818
borrowing lots of stupid errors that i

857
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,710
may have just made that is what we

858
00:43:28,818 --> 00:43:34,969
actually want to do and then we are

859
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:37,250
still computing the dot products here

860
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:39,679
are just we're now just computing them

861
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:41,690
with different things right we've just

862
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,969
scaled and multiplied them differently

863
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:46,039
but we're still computing the exact same

864
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:48,409
equations there's really nothing else to

865
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,818
it so let's just see our first

866
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:51,230
depressing result because it'll probably

867
00:43:49,818 --> 00:43:54,108
not be right at all and you can see that

868
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:56,059
it's not so we've got some work to do

869
00:43:54,108 --> 00:43:58,098
obviously there but you know like I said

870
00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:05,989
it you know nobody ever said it was

871
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:07,789
going to be easy all right so we've got

872
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:09,709
a couple things to check the first thing

873
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:12,469
that I have to do is I have to make sure

874
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:15,619
that I think through whether or not we

875
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:17,480
need a squared scale in there right like

876
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,880
before I was a little bit nervous about

877
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,010
that because I was thinking about

878
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,269
whether it should be squared not I think

879
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,670
this should take care of it though

880
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:27,769
because the determinant itself is

881
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:31,369
effectively going to be doing basically

882
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:34,460
a squaring kind of an operation there so

883
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:39,789
dividing by this that seems like it

884
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:43,130
should do it so I'm not 100% sure that

885
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:45,409
we would need anything else for week you

886
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:47,838
know computing those UV coordinates in

887
00:44:45,409 --> 00:44:52,730
theory it should do the reverse mapping

888
00:44:47,838 --> 00:45:00,019
so that it's in the 0 to 1 space janae

889
00:44:52,730 --> 00:45:04,550
um I believe right i believe uh and so

890
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:07,550
yeah these guys I think are what I would

891
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:10,730
have expected us to dot with now let me

892
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:12,650
make sure that I'm not doing anything

893
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:15,010
weird down here I want to make sure that

894
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:18,980
I'm computing the right thing so we

895
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:21,619
musta get are you we mo PS with the N

896
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:26,298
axis and the py n

897
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:31,039
what is that p y NX so we do a mall and

898
00:45:26,298 --> 00:45:41,079
then we do them all so that's uh that's

899
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:41,079
all good i think this why

900
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:54,309
that looks that looks right that looks

901
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:55,840
all good to me all right and again sorry

902
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:59,079
if I'm not talking as much as I should

903
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,940
be we're missing a minus this is

904
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:03,670
supposed to be minus I copied it down

905
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:06,429
wrong there we go I copied it from my my

906
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:10,690
blackboard run alright so debugging this

907
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:12,309
is going to be quite the pain you know

908
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,019
the fact that we don't see anything yet

909
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:15,400
suggests to me that we've got like a bad

910
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:18,570
scalar sewing because we should at least

911
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:22,360
see stuff that's kind of messed up right

912
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:27,010
and so you know it feels like we're

913
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:29,820
super far off or maybe misunderst these

914
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:32,470
guys got used but i'm pretty sure that

915
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:34,660
that we're okay there now let me just

916
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:36,519
make sure they're also not used in any

917
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:40,179
other place but i'm pretty sure they're

918
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:42,929
not yes so these are only used for that

919
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:46,059
process right so that's all good and

920
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:47,559
we're already subbed out the origin so

921
00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:50,079
we're literally just taking these dot

922
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:53,289
products here and that's that's

923
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:56,500
literally it so before what we were

924
00:46:53,289 --> 00:47:01,239
doing is we were taking you know the x

925
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:03,039
axis and we were normalizing it by

926
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:05,109
dividing it by its length squared and

927
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:09,250
that's not that different from what we

928
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:10,720
were doing here to be honest right

929
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,480
because if you take a look at what that

930
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,500
would have been right previously

931
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,179
effectively what we were doing is we

932
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:23,079
were saying well okay previously we're

933
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:28,319
going to take x axis x squared plus X X

934
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:28,319
Y squared right and dividing you know

935
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:34,000
each one by its respective one of those

936
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,579
right that's what we were sort of saying

937
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,630
we were going to do and so I don't

938
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:51,250
really know why we wouldn't get anything

939
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:54,510
there and I think I may want to go I

940
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:56,679
guess I can't could step through this

941
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:58,540
I'm just trying to think if the easier

942
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:06,279
way to debug this will be for me to go

943
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:09,940
back up into to go back to the slow code

944
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:22,960
and draw it there that makes sense just

945
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:24,670
to see well i'm going to try stepping

946
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:32,710
through it like this so I'm just going

947
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:40,030
to I'm going to turn off optimizations

948
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:51,579
for the moment I'm going to go into this

949
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:56,410
code or try to anyway here it is I'm

950
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:58,630
going to step into here now hopefully

951
00:48:56,409 --> 00:49:02,230
we'll get somebody with just a normal x

952
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:07,050
and y axis one that's very simple and

953
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:09,820
we'll see right so there's the x axis

954
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:12,850
there's the y axis and hey they're

955
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:17,559
perfectly they're going in exactly the

956
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:20,349
same direction so that's nice and yet

957
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:21,579
and so hopefully that should that should

958
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:25,739
give us something reasonable to work

959
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:29,460
with let's see what the determinant was

960
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:29,459
there's the determinant

961
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,170
alright and let's take a look at what

962
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:43,250
hour n x axis is alright so we're

963
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:49,230
getting much too we're getting much too

964
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:51,570
tiny it's what i would say at least it

965
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:54,840
looks much too tiny although it's hard

966
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:57,809
to say i mean i guess with a thousand ya

967
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:04,200
know it looks like it's maybe 10 x off

968
00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:06,630
there it's hard to say but yeah so

969
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,539
thinking it through like it would be

970
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,470
nice if we just had a slightly easier

971
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:12,750
one that was a little bit more

972
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:15,989
normalized i suppose but you know even

973
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:19,949
as it goes if we take a look at what the

974
00:50:15,989 --> 00:50:21,689
x axis values are when we dot product

975
00:50:19,949 --> 00:50:24,750
with this it's going to be moving

976
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:30,000
basically that slowly right so it's

977
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:33,449
going to be a you know if that was a

978
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,760
hundred pixels let's say to go the whole

979
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:38,279
length it's actually a little more than

980
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,040
that so if you look at what that's doing

981
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,160
that's pretty close to what I would have

982
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:49,320
expected actually because if i dot

983
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:50,960
product with this you know I'm going to

984
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:54,930
get roughly what I would have expected

985
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,139
and then if i if i look at my n y axis

986
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:57,139
here

987
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:18,320
well okay so that's that's kind of

988
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:22,349
obviously incorrect there because this

989
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:25,170
means that neither of my axes have any Y

990
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:31,819
component to them which doesn't really

991
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:34,680
make any sense to me why did that happen

992
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,300
what's going on there right if you look

993
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:40,079
at what happens here both of them have

994
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:42,420
an X and no y component right but my x

995
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:45,170
and y axes were in different places you

996
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:51,090
would think at least I would think that

997
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:56,280
would give me a reasonable result there

998
00:51:51,090 --> 00:52:02,700
so i have y axis y at y axis x x axis x

999
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:12,900
x axis y you know what I bet I I bet I i

1000
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:16,079
bet i just can't copy y X Y X God you

1001
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,820
know usually it's the math that's wrong

1002
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,279
but here it's today it's just copying

1003
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:23,150
the math into the code that's wrong

1004
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,150
apparently

1005
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:31,840
let's try that again folks okay so now

1006
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,849
what are we looking at Hey look so

1007
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,700
surprised surprised we did all the math

1008
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:39,639
right apparently but we just typed it in

1009
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:41,469
wrong okay and so hopefully now you can

1010
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:47,920
see and let me go ahead and build in

1011
00:52:41,469 --> 00:52:48,909
release mode but I wish I just copied

1012
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,159
the math right that would have worked

1013
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:52,210
the first time it would have been great

1014
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,980
but of course that I have stared for a

1015
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:57,610
while so now you can see that our

1016
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:59,860
software renderer looks a lot closer to

1017
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:03,000
our regular render in fact it may look

1018
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:05,789
exactly like our actual renderer now

1019
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:12,250
let's go ahead and see if that's true

1020
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:15,309
right I'm going to go ahead and walk

1021
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:26,820
left wise across the screen so there we

1022
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:32,799
are perfect alright so that is that uh

1023
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:35,260
you know hopefully that hopefully if you

1024
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,210
take these three days together the day

1025
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,500
where we notice the bug they were I

1026
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,820
wrote out all the matrix equations and

1027
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,590
showed why the bug was happening and

1028
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:45,760
then today where we solve the equation

1029
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:49,450
and fix the bug you know I hope that

1030
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,800
kind of gives you a good idea where when

1031
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:52,269
people ask you know if your game

1032
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,650
programmer or whatever you need to know

1033
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:58,119
math or what should I do about learning

1034
00:53:53,650 --> 00:54:00,809
math um I hope that kind of shows just

1035
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:03,909
how important math kind of is like

1036
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:06,699
trying to hack that to fix that bug

1037
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:08,619
you'd never know you would have no idea

1038
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:10,239
what was wrong right I mean we wouldn't

1039
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:11,980
it would just be wrong you'd be like I

1040
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:13,869
don't even know you know I have noise

1041
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,429
but right but when you can go back to

1042
00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:18,099
the original Matthew like I've got this

1043
00:54:15,429 --> 00:54:20,529
transform I'm trying to reverse it I

1044
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:21,699
know that you know if I want to reverse

1045
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:24,160
the transfer might just solve the

1046
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:25,509
equation for the other term and then you

1047
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:27,250
look at what actually happens to the

1048
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,990
math even from first principles you need

1049
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,329
to know any tricks right I just solve

1050
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:33,429
those equations you didn't even need to

1051
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:34,809
know what to determine it was right you

1052
00:54:33,429 --> 00:54:36,549
just needed to know basic matrix

1053
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:39,578
multiplication and everything else was

1054
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:42,670
solved with with grade school algebra

1055
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:44,798
and boom you type in those two lines of

1056
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:45,789
code and everything's fixed of course

1057
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,170
you have type them in right which I

1058
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:48,759
didn't do but if you could sue me you

1059
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:53,920
can copy from your own math notebook

1060
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:56,048
into the code it's perfect right and so

1061
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,670
that's just a really cool aspect of

1062
00:54:56,048 --> 00:55:00,548
enter and I think a good demonstration

1063
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:02,079
of why understanding math had a pretty

1064
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:05,469
fundamental level at least the parts

1065
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:07,298
that we care about in in game

1066
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:10,568
programming is really pretty important

1067
00:55:07,298 --> 00:55:12,579
because you know you can fix bugs really

1068
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:14,949
easily and you know I didn't have to

1069
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:16,180
remember all I did was just invert that

1070
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:18,009
one matrix I could have typed it into

1071
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:19,449
mathematica you know because I knew

1072
00:55:18,009 --> 00:55:20,858
that's what I need to do and got the

1073
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,419
answer instantly way back my first saw

1074
00:55:20,858 --> 00:55:24,548
the bug could just done that looked at

1075
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,989
it and type those lines it right so all

1076
00:55:24,548 --> 00:55:27,728
the stuff we did it wasn't like this

1077
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,708
huge big ordeal all that stuff I did was

1078
00:55:27,728 --> 00:55:32,618
just me showing you so you would

1079
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:34,028
understand how it all worked but the

1080
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:35,349
actual process is trivial you just

1081
00:55:34,028 --> 00:55:36,759
invert a two by two matrix you could

1082
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:38,289
have mathematically that for you or you

1083
00:55:36,759 --> 00:55:40,119
can remember the determinant trick it's

1084
00:55:38,289 --> 00:55:42,700
right so this would have been a five

1085
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:44,528
minute fix if I hadn't gone through and

1086
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:50,618
explained the entire thing from start to

1087
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:52,298
finish right so knowing that math and

1088
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:54,309
understanding all of that just allows

1089
00:55:52,298 --> 00:55:57,458
you to immediately go oh right okay and

1090
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:59,469
the bug is fixed right whereas if you

1091
00:55:57,458 --> 00:56:01,598
didn't know what you'd just be forget it

1092
00:55:59,469 --> 00:56:03,068
I mean you'd never fix it right you'd

1093
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,259
have to hack something in and hope you

1094
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:12,190
could maybe you know monkey around with

1095
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:15,489
it or whatever um so I guess that's

1096
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:17,769
basically it I'm going to go ahead and

1097
00:56:15,489 --> 00:56:20,170
go to the QA because I don't know if

1098
00:56:17,768 --> 00:56:28,508
people have matrix Q&amp;A questions here

1099
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:29,619
but like I guess I just say I don't want

1100
00:56:28,509 --> 00:56:34,509
to get started on something in the last

1101
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:35,949
five minutes so you know if we don't

1102
00:56:34,509 --> 00:56:38,278
have any more cues and we won't but

1103
00:56:35,949 --> 00:56:38,278
anyway

1104
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:47,400
me below says selling off topic but any

1105
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:51,159
chance you could describe a little more

1106
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:56,039
what you'd want of an algebraic

1107
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:58,420
blackboard program uh yeah certainly I

1108
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:02,050
could say pretty easily what I would

1109
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:05,400
want so here's the problem i just

1110
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:11,310
described the problem and this is like

1111
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:11,309
why you know why I don't like

1112
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:22,719
Mathematica um so here's what happens to

1113
00:57:20,619 --> 00:57:25,239
me when i'm doing math right is i'm

1114
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:27,819
actually not that bad at symbolic math

1115
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:29,349
I'm not good I've seen people who are

1116
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,450
good and they're really good I'm not

1117
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:34,839
good but I'm not that bad at that I'm

1118
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:37,239
just bad at me I make mistakes when I'm

1119
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,950
you know simple mistakes I don't not

1120
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:40,929
know the right thing to do I just make

1121
00:57:38,949 --> 00:57:42,429
some mistakes but I I know a bunch of

1122
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:43,750
stuff i can do to like massage things

1123
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:45,159
into the right forms that i want and all

1124
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:48,519
the sort stuff so I kind of know what

1125
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:53,409
I'm trying to do a lot of the times but

1126
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:55,360
I have two choices right one choice is i

1127
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:57,609
can plug things into mathematica right

1128
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,110
and what does that look like well if I

1129
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:00,880
want to plug things into mathematica I

1130
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:01,990
gotta type some stuff and I don't

1131
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,490
remember the exact sense been a long

1132
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:06,969
time so use it but you know I'm like oh

1133
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:13,509
ok well here's my matrix you know mr.

1134
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:18,969
Mathematica right and you know then I

1135
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:21,850
say like I've got my P which is you know

1136
00:58:18,969 --> 00:58:24,669
X Y or something like that and then I

1137
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:26,289
type you know solve and I don't remember

1138
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:32,500
their syntax for solve but you know

1139
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:38,529
solve a p equals P prime or something

1140
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:41,130
and I i guess i have to put both of

1141
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:41,130
these in here

1142
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:53,150
ap equals P prime you know for 4p right

1143
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:55,278
okay so if I have a problem that's

1144
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:58,759
exactly like this kind that we just used

1145
00:58:55,278 --> 00:59:01,159
I think Mathematica is fine right you

1146
00:58:58,759 --> 00:59:03,829
can put this in here and what it will

1147
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:06,318
spit out to you is the scalar equation

1148
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:08,959
that solve this so it will output

1149
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,639
something that's like a bunch of scalars

1150
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:12,379
here like to you know the scalar

1151
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:17,298
equations for the two things so it'll be

1152
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:19,880
like oh yeah you know u equals blah and

1153
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:22,219
V equals blah which is the exact this

1154
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,690
stuff that we just wrote on the

1155
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:29,420
blackboard myself right it'll it'll

1156
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:31,400
output this and that okay and that's

1157
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,959
where like most computer algebra stuff

1158
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,639
like not just math I'm not picking on

1159
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:37,159
mathematics specifically but good jobs

1160
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:38,868
of general that's where it works okay if

1161
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:42,199
that's what I want but here's the

1162
00:59:38,869 --> 00:59:45,410
problem if I don't want it to drop down

1163
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:46,789
to scalar all bets are off so let's say

1164
00:59:45,409 --> 00:59:48,949
that I was trying to work out some

1165
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:50,839
really big matrix equation right and

1166
00:59:48,949 --> 00:59:52,849
there's you know there's lots of stuff

1167
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:57,199
happening so it's like oh yeah you know

1168
00:59:52,849 --> 01:00:03,410
this was you know a pry you know ap

1169
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:06,409
cross a you know some other vector ap

1170
01:00:03,409 --> 01:00:10,548
cross B times you know some other matrix

1171
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:12,978
here inverted and that was you know

1172
01:00:10,548 --> 01:00:16,849
added to some other thing and blah blah

1173
01:00:12,978 --> 01:00:19,939
blah right when I'm going to program

1174
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:22,489
this stuff i don't i'm not going to do

1175
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:24,769
some giant matrix equation in scalar

1176
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:26,329
right and furthermore i may not be

1177
01:00:24,768 --> 01:00:28,098
looking for the solutions to these

1178
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:30,410
things i may be looking for insights

1179
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:32,660
into how the problem works so what I

1180
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:34,788
want to do is I want to actually move

1181
01:00:32,659 --> 01:00:37,458
these terms around myself without ever

1182
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:39,680
dropping down to scalar using rules that

1183
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:42,288
I know are okay so I want to be able to

1184
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:46,429
say stuff like oh okay you know trust me

1185
01:00:42,289 --> 01:00:49,400
on this one PX cross B is equal to zero

1186
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:51,409
or something like this right the zero

1187
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,599
vector or something right I don't know

1188
01:00:51,409 --> 01:00:55,789
I'm just making stuff up like this

1189
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,610
and other things like oh you know like a

1190
01:00:55,789 --> 01:01:00,230
transpose B equals B transpose a right

1191
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:02,990
so I just tell it the things that i want

1192
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:05,690
to be true right and then I'm going to

1193
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:08,209
tell you what to do so i'll say stuff

1194
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:10,070
like oh can you reduce this term in

1195
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:11,780
vector notation at all using the rules

1196
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:13,190
can you like reduce it and maybe it

1197
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:16,370
comes out of something or I'm going to

1198
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:19,070
say hey I want to multiply both sides by

1199
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:20,679
B right and so it'll do it and get rid

1200
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:23,990
of that term and put it here right and

1201
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:25,849
so that way I could just I could work

1202
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:28,579
out the equations like I normally do on

1203
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:31,009
a piece of paper but without ever

1204
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:32,409
worrying about making a mistake right so

1205
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:34,940
the computers and let me make a mistake

1206
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:37,219
but i never have to drop down into these

1207
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:39,079
crazy huge scalar equations where I

1208
01:01:37,219 --> 01:01:41,299
can't see the structure anymore and and

1209
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:43,579
then our kind of useless to me at some

1210
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:46,220
level right so the more complicated

1211
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:48,019
matrix vector geometric algebra whatever

1212
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:49,730
else stuff you do the more useless

1213
01:01:48,019 --> 01:01:50,809
Mathematica typically becomes because it

1214
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:52,039
just generates these huge two other

1215
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:54,259
equations that don't tell you anything

1216
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:56,000
right you're like well that's okay if I

1217
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:58,820
just wanted to solve this one thing in

1218
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,739
scalar and type it in for an hour right

1219
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,450
but I don't want that i want something

1220
01:02:00,739 --> 01:02:04,519
that I can code using my own vector

1221
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:06,469
library using the vector ops like I want

1222
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:08,539
to code this as a cross product I don't

1223
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:10,129
want to have to look at Mathematica as

1224
01:02:08,539 --> 01:02:11,599
crazy set of scalars and start trying to

1225
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:15,230
pull out where the cross products are

1226
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:17,900
right so yeah so just an Augmented like

1227
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:20,030
notebook thing where it doesn't have to

1228
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:22,849
be like handwriting I am happy to type

1229
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:24,590
in the equations right I just then want

1230
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:26,239
to be able to manipulate them knowing i

1231
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:28,600
never made a mistake by the rules that i

1232
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:28,599
input

1233
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:47,500
thus Isaac just says q colon whoa that

1234
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:50,750
is not a question and I can't answer it

1235
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:52,789
error if a senior Tory will there be

1236
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:56,269
more things like this that require math

1237
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:59,050
in further parts of the game although it

1238
01:02:56,269 --> 01:03:07,329
was pretty basic my math is a bit rusty

1239
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:11,840
um well you know I don't know uh in in

1240
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:15,710
2d games you get a little bit of a buy

1241
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:19,910
on on the math there's oftentimes less

1242
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:23,179
demand for the math the harder core math

1243
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:25,639
in 2d and that's not an accident there's

1244
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:27,199
a lot of reasons for that oh one of them

1245
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:28,579
is that typically when you jump to 3d

1246
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:31,099
now you're doing a lot more real

1247
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:33,799
simulation because since you have full

1248
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:35,509
3d surfaces you can do like things that

1249
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,550
more closely approximate what happens in

1250
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:39,080
the real world so you you know more math

1251
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:41,210
comes in there because it's more physics

1252
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:42,980
basically but the other reason is that

1253
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:44,539
three dimensions is more than one

1254
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:46,449
dimension harder than two dimensions I

1255
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:49,759
know that's a very strange thing to say

1256
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:52,189
but for example a lot of things that are

1257
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,080
true in two dimensions aren't true in

1258
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:55,670
three dimensions and it has nothing to

1259
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,130
do with the fact that you added one

1260
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:59,990
extra dimension right because going from

1261
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:02,300
one dimension to two dimensions did not

1262
01:03:59,989 --> 01:04:05,109
change this thing but from true

1263
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:10,940
dimensions to three dimensions did right

1264
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:13,160
and for example rotations don't commute

1265
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:15,200
anymore in three dimensions right in one

1266
01:04:13,159 --> 01:04:18,109
dimension a rotation followed by another

1267
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:21,079
rotation rotation A Fella by rotation be

1268
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:23,090
produces a rotation see regardless of

1269
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:25,639
the order so rotation be followed by a

1270
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:27,710
also is see doesn't matter what order I

1271
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:29,839
do the rotations right if I rotate this

1272
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:31,760
far that way and then I rotate this far

1273
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,500
that way I get the exact same thing

1274
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,390
whether i did this first or this first

1275
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,460
right because it's all just a single

1276
01:04:35,389 --> 01:04:38,779
scalar it's just it's just the theta of

1277
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:40,849
rotation and no matter what i do i

1278
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:43,580
always get the same no matter what order

1279
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:45,230
i do the terms at 3d not true 3d has

1280
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:46,460
winding and so what ends up happening is

1281
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:47,960
you know if you rotate one

1282
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:49,099
and then rotate another way you'll be in

1283
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,199
a different position than if you did

1284
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:54,080
those two same exact rotations in the

1285
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,088
opposite order right tons of stuff like

1286
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,929
that is true in 3d a bunch of things

1287
01:04:56,088 --> 01:05:02,750
that like to apolog-- things break in 3d

1288
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:07,009
things about fundamental geometry things

1289
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:09,260
just become not true in 3d anymore that

1290
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:11,630
were true in 2d there's a bunch of stuff

1291
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:13,760
like computational geometry theorems

1292
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:15,200
that are just like this is you know in

1293
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,609
2d we know how to do it we know how to

1294
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:18,289
do it linear time blah blah blah and

1295
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:19,489
they're like in 3d it's unsolvable we've

1296
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:21,500
proved it's unsolvable or stuff like

1297
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:24,679
that right and so there's just these

1298
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,838
really bad things that happen when you

1299
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:28,789
come 3d so when you stick in 2d and

1300
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:30,799
that's why what people often ask me I

1301
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:33,108
don't do 3d I am a hero there's so much

1302
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,280
more stuff that comes in in 3d I don't

1303
01:05:33,108 --> 01:05:36,190
think anyone should ever write their

1304
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:39,830
first game in 3d I this is an awful idea

1305
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:43,190
you should always have to defer stet a

1306
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:44,690
bit of a body on the math a huge huge

1307
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:47,269
simplification on the asset pipeline

1308
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:49,820
blah blah blah blah it's important to

1309
01:05:47,269 --> 01:05:52,759
like get your fundamental solid first

1310
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:55,099
and then then go do it the 3d game after

1311
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:57,200
when you can just focus on the new stuff

1312
01:05:55,099 --> 01:05:58,820
you need for 3d without worrying about

1313
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:00,199
all the other stuff like how to make an

1314
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,820
enemy system and how to do memory

1315
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:03,199
management now too if you're trying to

1316
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,460
learn to be an engine programmer don't

1317
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:07,429
try to learn it all at once you'll just

1318
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,079
get discouraged right and so what I

1319
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:10,129
would say is to answer your question

1320
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:12,049
about how much more map they'll be

1321
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:13,579
they'll probably be other stuff like

1322
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:16,250
this certainly it's not the only time

1323
01:06:13,579 --> 01:06:17,480
that we do stuff like this we've already

1324
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:19,789
done some stuff like this and we'll

1325
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,619
probably do some more but it is a lot

1326
01:06:19,789 --> 01:06:24,199
lighter in a 2-d game right it's not

1327
01:06:21,619 --> 01:06:25,550
quite so much it's not all the time a 3d

1328
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:28,399
game you're doing this stuff kind of all

1329
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:30,609
the time a 2-d game it's less it's less

1330
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,608
so

1331
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:40,730
Brian wag do you consider math to be

1332
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:47,049
more of a tool to solve problems or more

1333
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:55,789
of a learning art to be mastered I don't

1334
01:06:47,050 --> 01:07:03,680
really know I guess I don't really think

1335
01:06:55,789 --> 01:07:11,900
about it in any particular way like I

1336
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:15,739
usually just think of math as a really

1337
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:17,568
good repository of very smart people who

1338
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:22,308
have tried to solve problems before and

1339
01:07:17,568 --> 01:07:24,889
this is what they discovered you know so

1340
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:27,859
I guess I think of it kind of like the

1341
01:07:24,889 --> 01:07:33,730
tool to solve problems that you

1342
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:38,029
suggested but a little bit more than

1343
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:41,990
just a tool right it's more like a way

1344
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:45,170
of looking at things and a way of

1345
01:07:41,989 --> 01:07:46,818
leveraging the knowledge of people who

1346
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:49,430
came before you and what they were able

1347
01:07:46,818 --> 01:07:52,880
to figure out which is not really the

1348
01:07:49,429 --> 01:07:56,149
same as just a tool right because the

1349
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,829
tool to solve problems part obscures the

1350
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:59,358
fact that it's also the thing that helps

1351
01:07:57,829 --> 01:08:03,490
you figure out what the problems even

1352
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:06,409
were to begin with like you know I don't

1353
01:08:03,489 --> 01:08:08,058
even I wouldn't even know that something

1354
01:08:06,409 --> 01:08:09,920
was a transformer that it could be

1355
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:13,730
inverted as a way of thinking about

1356
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:22,460
texture mapping if I'd never had that

1357
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:24,500
basis right so I feel like I feel like

1358
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:26,000
it's like I wouldn't just I while I

1359
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,079
wouldn't as I say I'll learn in art to

1360
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,238
be mastered because that doesn't really

1361
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:31,429
mean much to me I also wouldn't say that

1362
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:34,698
tool to solve problems covers it perhaps

1363
01:08:31,429 --> 01:08:38,630
as adequately or as completely as as how

1364
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:40,189
I actually view it building what I

1365
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:41,900
believe you want to turned up reduce

1366
01:08:40,189 --> 01:08:43,159
algebra calm automatic and user

1367
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:45,710
controlled suffocation expressing the

1368
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:48,909
calculus was like wow so someone maybe

1369
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:48,909
has has written it now

1370
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,829
possibly I don't know can't quite tell

1371
01:09:05,369 --> 01:09:08,699
yeah possibly it's hard to tell from

1372
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:19,770
just looking at this but that might be

1373
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:21,989
not to look at that sim block but I just

1374
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:23,700
wanted to note how your intuition of the

1375
01:09:21,989 --> 01:09:25,800
transform seemed really important at

1376
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:35,579
finding the bug way more important than

1377
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:37,710
typing the correct formula no wait I I'm

1378
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:42,840
not sure exactly what that means but I

1379
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:45,480
guess what I would say is I I will state

1380
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:47,550
the thing that I think that is closest

1381
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:51,299
to that which I definitely agree with

1382
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:55,079
and often try to point out especially to

1383
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:58,350
people learning math which is the

1384
01:09:55,079 --> 01:10:02,640
important part of math is learning what

1385
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:04,350
all the math does and how right and the

1386
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,200
reason for that is because like I said

1387
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:08,700
you know you all the all the actual

1388
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:10,349
solving we could have actually just had

1389
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:14,099
Mathematica do that right you got to

1390
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:15,390
learn the finicky syntax in that but it

1391
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,620
could have just produced the right

1392
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:21,210
answer for us right we just put in that

1393
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:22,409
thing right but knowing and this is why

1394
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:24,960
I say hopefully this is kind of like

1395
01:10:22,409 --> 01:10:30,059
what you were saying because I feel this

1396
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:32,880
way to knowing what a transform was that

1397
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:34,980
we were doing one that inverting a

1398
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,050
transform involves more than just

1399
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:39,989
transposing the terms blah blah blah all

1400
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:41,579
of that is systemic mathematical

1401
01:10:39,989 --> 01:10:43,829
knowledge that I know because I've

1402
01:10:41,579 --> 01:10:45,899
studied the math right and there's

1403
01:10:43,829 --> 01:10:47,550
really no substitute for that you can't

1404
01:10:45,899 --> 01:10:49,229
at the moment we don't have like

1405
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:51,180
artificial intelligence of this quality

1406
01:10:49,229 --> 01:10:53,219
or anything right you can't at the

1407
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:56,460
moment type into mathematica please tell

1408
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:58,530
me why I'm getting this bug right and so

1409
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:00,480
that's why I think it's so important to

1410
01:10:58,529 --> 01:11:02,219
know a lot of that math and I have a

1411
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:08,099
broad math knowledge is because a lot of

1412
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:10,260
times you know if you don't understand

1413
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:12,450
all of these things and you don't have a

1414
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:15,420
way of slotting the problems you see

1415
01:11:12,449 --> 01:11:17,969
into a mathematical framework then it

1416
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:20,550
doesn't matter you can't use

1417
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:24,868
math to help you if you don't know which

1418
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:27,989
math is involved right and so that to me

1419
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:31,978
is really the heart of the important

1420
01:11:27,988 --> 01:11:34,379
part of a math education is the broad

1421
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:37,079
understanding of all the different parts

1422
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:39,479
and how they work and if you can't

1423
01:11:37,078 --> 01:11:41,849
remember how to do them that's okay just

1424
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:44,369
look it up at the time right but you

1425
01:11:41,849 --> 01:11:47,699
need to remember that it did this thing

1426
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:50,698
or how this thing does this you know

1427
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:53,038
what it does because otherwise you can't

1428
01:11:50,698 --> 01:11:57,419
ever apply it and I actually see this

1429
01:11:53,038 --> 01:12:00,599
fairly frequently in programmers

1430
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:03,059
actually and it's a problem there are

1431
01:12:00,599 --> 01:12:07,800
people who have a much stronger math

1432
01:12:03,059 --> 01:12:09,659
background potentially than I do and and

1433
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,190
I'll see them not know how to solve

1434
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:13,348
something that they totally should know

1435
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:16,049
how to solve and the reason is because

1436
01:12:13,349 --> 01:12:18,960
they their math knowledge is too focused

1437
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:20,760
on how to actually work out the

1438
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,559
equations or something but they never

1439
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,030
were able to actually build a big

1440
01:12:22,559 --> 01:12:27,389
picture that allows them to do that

1441
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:29,130
slotting that's like oh I I've worked

1442
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:32,219
with this math enough to use your phrase

1443
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:34,469
intuition to have an intuition for it I

1444
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:36,118
know this is a transform I know things I

1445
01:12:34,469 --> 01:12:37,198
can do with the transfer my know things

1446
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:39,779
I can do with the dot product I

1447
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,998
understand how they work and maybe I

1448
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:43,288
forget I do the math at the low level or

1449
01:12:41,998 --> 01:12:45,569
something but I can always look that up

1450
01:12:43,288 --> 01:12:47,849
but what I need to have quick access to

1451
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:51,179
and to have instant ability to read is

1452
01:12:47,849 --> 01:12:53,038
that am I think am i working with one of

1453
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:55,139
these things is this important here

1454
01:12:53,038 --> 01:12:57,359
could I solve this problem used up by

1455
01:12:55,139 --> 01:12:59,328
applying this other thing might might I

1456
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:01,498
you know should I potentially try and

1457
01:12:59,328 --> 01:13:03,509
all of those things are really really

1458
01:13:01,498 --> 01:13:06,118
important so I don't know if that's in

1459
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:10,829
the same spirit of what you were trying

1460
01:13:06,118 --> 01:13:13,018
to say but that is true and and that is

1461
01:13:10,828 --> 01:13:16,259
really especially when I look at how

1462
01:13:13,019 --> 01:13:17,639
math is taught a pre-college at least

1463
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:20,699
and sometimes unfortunately in college

1464
01:13:17,639 --> 01:13:23,670
as well but pre-college anyway the

1465
01:13:20,698 --> 01:13:25,589
problem is the amount of math that like

1466
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:27,029
we learn in America for example up

1467
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:29,159
through high school at least in my I had

1468
01:13:27,029 --> 01:13:30,538
a went to a decent high school I mean so

1469
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:31,589
some people don't but I mean assuming

1470
01:13:30,538 --> 01:13:34,559
you went to deuce in high school

1471
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:36,779
the amount of math that I learned was

1472
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,760
actually pretty vast but I couldn't do

1473
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:41,039
anything with it right and it wasn't

1474
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:44,820
till after I get out and was working on

1475
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:48,329
programming and it was actually Chris

1476
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:50,429
hecker who i saw doing a lot of math to

1477
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:53,729
solve problems in programming that i

1478
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:55,800
realized that like oh if i just go back

1479
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:58,139
and look at stuff i even already know

1480
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:00,029
there's so much I can do with it but

1481
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:02,100
they never taught me how to look at

1482
01:14:00,029 --> 01:14:06,739
problems and figure out what math

1483
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:09,570
applied to those problems right and so

1484
01:14:06,739 --> 01:14:11,699
gaining that framework in your brain of

1485
01:14:09,569 --> 01:14:14,309
like looking at problems through the

1486
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:17,639
lens of what math is important here is

1487
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:20,370
the very most important part of a math

1488
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:24,650
education no question and the actual

1489
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:27,809
doing of the solving is secondary right

1490
01:14:24,649 --> 01:14:30,929
because you'll never get a chance to

1491
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:32,820
solve a math problem by hand even if you

1492
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:36,360
are gues all by hand if you didn't know

1493
01:14:32,819 --> 01:14:39,179
that was the problem you had right so

1494
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:46,500
that's totally true and I think that's

1495
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:47,909
very important thing to to remember the

1496
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,920
risk oh I actually just learned about

1497
01:14:47,909 --> 01:14:52,319
determinants in linear algebra do you

1498
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:56,250
think we will see them later on our

1499
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:57,750
determinants used often i would i would

1500
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,789
probably echo the same thing i said

1501
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:01,050
before determines are used pretty often

1502
01:14:59,789 --> 01:15:03,750
and they're used pretty often

1503
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:06,750
specifically because they have kind of a

1504
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:09,420
deep relationship to systems of vectors

1505
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:11,159
that you care about and want to do

1506
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:15,119
things with such as invert and other

1507
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:17,369
things like that however we have limited

1508
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:19,800
need for those in 2d so we probably

1509
01:15:17,369 --> 01:15:25,760
won't be seeing them pop up like that

1510
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:28,050
frequently but but yes they they are

1511
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:32,460
they're a very common thing that gets

1512
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:36,350
used in linear algebra and and its

1513
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:36,350
applications to 3d graphics certainly

1514
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:53,900
casta 5 do you get annoyed by some

1515
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:55,460
symbols meaning things and different

1516
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:57,859
things in different subcarriers a math

1517
01:15:55,460 --> 01:16:00,350
um no I don't really get annoyed by that

1518
01:15:57,859 --> 01:16:03,979
because like I said I'm not like a super

1519
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:06,590
strong symbolic math guy and you can see

1520
01:16:03,979 --> 01:16:08,059
that just when you watch me do equations

1521
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:12,170
on the blackboard I'm constantly naming

1522
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:14,240
things the same thing you know like I'll

1523
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:15,920
be like oh ok this is you and this other

1524
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:18,079
thing over here is also you and whatever

1525
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:20,840
so it's like I just am NOT rigorous

1526
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:22,579
enough at those sorts of things to get

1527
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:24,409
annoyed at other people not being

1528
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:25,519
rigorous enough of those things so hey

1529
01:16:24,409 --> 01:16:27,559
yeah these two branch of mathematics

1530
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,050
both use the same symbols and it's kind

1531
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:31,220
of confusing ok I make that same sick

1532
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:33,020
all the time certainly not get get

1533
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:35,320
annoyed might it be nice if it had been

1534
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:38,650
completely regularize the whole way sure

1535
01:16:35,319 --> 01:16:38,649
but you know

1536
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:07,489
let me just double check to see if there

1537
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:11,180
are any more q Collins cubic have said

1538
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:13,099
what about 3d with an isometric view the

1539
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:15,260
particular projection that you use for

1540
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:18,500
3d I'm assuming you're relating this

1541
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:21,590
back to the question of whether you know

1542
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:23,060
to 3d is harder than 2d once you're in

1543
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:24,770
3d all of those things are true

1544
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,880
regardless of what the projection is

1545
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:27,080
used for your camera the camera

1546
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:29,510
production has nothing to do with it

1547
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:31,640
right it's just whether you decided to

1548
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:33,800
start trying to do full 3d things with

1549
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:38,240
full 3d surfaces in full 3d lighting in

1550
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:40,279
full 3d physics right so you can always

1551
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:42,409
cheese out on any of those that you want

1552
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:45,199
to and still maintain some level of

1553
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:48,800
pseudo 3d ness in various ways and make

1554
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:53,569
things easier on yourself right but in

1555
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:57,140
general you you definitely have the case

1556
01:17:53,569 --> 01:18:00,189
where the more actual 3d you want to be

1557
01:17:57,140 --> 01:18:04,579
the more strenuous the math will become

1558
01:18:00,189 --> 01:18:05,750
and that that's just because 3d is

1559
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:10,519
definitely more than one dimension

1560
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:12,470
harder than 2d as I often say what do

1561
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:17,510
you think of Khan Academy as a math

1562
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:21,110
learning resource um you know I I

1563
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:23,090
haven't used it myself like I've never

1564
01:18:21,109 --> 01:18:25,219
gone and said I want to learn you know

1565
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:28,550
differ more differential equations let

1566
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:35,000
me go check Khan Academy what I would

1567
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:37,579
say is I suspect that it probably

1568
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:41,390
wouldn't like it very much and the

1569
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:43,069
reason for that is because I want to

1570
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:45,860
come at math from a programmers

1571
01:18:43,069 --> 01:18:49,429
perspective and I don't think they

1572
01:18:45,859 --> 01:18:52,189
generally do which is not a knock on

1573
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:54,050
them as a general math resource but it

1574
01:18:52,189 --> 01:18:56,750
is a bit of a knock on them for as a

1575
01:18:54,050 --> 01:19:00,670
programming resource right and so my

1576
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:02,720
preference would mostly be you know a

1577
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:04,850
programmer centric math learning

1578
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:07,640
resource would be what I would most want

1579
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:09,650
because a lot of times you know even

1580
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:14,020
though obviously math is math

1581
01:19:09,649 --> 01:19:16,549
what you emphasize and how you go about

1582
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:19,310
practicing and learning various aspects

1583
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:20,960
of it is definitely different depending

1584
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:23,780
on if you're someone who's you know

1585
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,460
trying to learn to solve proofs for you

1586
01:19:23,779 --> 01:19:27,408
know the end goal vs someone who's

1587
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,539
trying to compute things as the end goal

1588
01:19:27,408 --> 01:19:31,158
vs somebody who's trying to pass their

1589
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:41,149
college courses the end goal or whatever

1590
01:19:31,158 --> 01:19:45,619
right so thank you / Caleb yeah a 2-d

1591
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:47,899
game that's drawn in 3d is still a a 2-d

1592
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:49,969
game for the most part right but you

1593
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:52,399
still as soon as you even just do

1594
01:19:49,969 --> 01:19:54,140
drawing in 3d assuming that you're

1595
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:57,408
actually talking about drawing look

1596
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:59,079
meshes and stuff you know you've got to

1597
01:19:57,408 --> 01:20:01,369
start dealing with all of that

1598
01:19:59,079 --> 01:20:04,010
additional math now if you're talking

1599
01:20:01,369 --> 01:20:06,890
about a 2-d game that's drawn in 3d but

1600
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:08,869
the 2d everything still sprites you

1601
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:11,449
obviously get some by there as well and

1602
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:14,119
every everything you can collapse down

1603
01:20:11,448 --> 01:20:16,369
from 3d to 2d saves you some math right

1604
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:18,948
and as we saw on handmade hero you still

1605
01:20:16,369 --> 01:20:20,719
have difficulties but they tend to be of

1606
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:24,589
a different kind like our sorting thing

1607
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:27,230
for example is more hacky likes like

1608
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:30,800
programmer e stuff and less rigorous

1609
01:20:27,229 --> 01:20:33,529
math whereas the way we might handle

1610
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:36,730
depth stuff in 3d might have a lot more

1611
01:20:33,529 --> 01:20:36,729
to do with math right

1612
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:51,909
lq 144 recognizing the kinds of things

1613
01:20:50,168 --> 01:20:53,708
you're working with and the kind of

1614
01:20:51,908 --> 01:20:55,839
problem you are working on is a

1615
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:57,878
fundamental skill I'm not all that sure

1616
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,199
how to teach that directly though beyond

1617
01:20:57,878 --> 01:21:01,538
doing something like what you are doing

1618
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:07,029
here and or repeated experience with

1619
01:21:01,538 --> 01:21:10,509
solving problems I well yeah I mean my

1620
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:12,550
my feeling on that is just that it's

1621
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:18,159
pretty obvious to me how you would teach

1622
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:21,010
math in in schools if you cared about

1623
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:23,708
the actual useful part of math right and

1624
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:26,168
the way that would work is you would

1625
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:29,319
learn to do any particular thing in math

1626
01:21:26,168 --> 01:21:31,689
once by hand and you'd never really even

1627
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:34,058
probably be tested on it you would just

1628
01:21:31,689 --> 01:21:35,769
be able to use a computer algebra system

1629
01:21:34,059 --> 01:21:39,878
or something to do that work for you as

1630
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:43,570
soon as you knew how to do it right and

1631
01:21:39,878 --> 01:21:47,260
then all of your testing would always be

1632
01:21:43,569 --> 01:21:48,698
on here is a problem and you need to

1633
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:51,309
figure out what math you're supposed to

1634
01:21:48,698 --> 01:21:52,898
use to solve the problem right and then

1635
01:21:51,309 --> 01:21:56,590
you can use the computer system to solve

1636
01:21:52,899 --> 01:21:59,439
it for you and this is very very

1637
01:21:56,590 --> 01:22:03,219
different than the way these kinds of

1638
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:05,309
problems are given to you in school

1639
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:07,929
normally like in when I went to school

1640
01:22:05,309 --> 01:22:10,689
the problems were always grouped into

1641
01:22:07,929 --> 01:22:12,779
like the kind of problem they were so

1642
01:22:10,689 --> 01:22:16,179
it's like we're going to have a test on

1643
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:18,609
UD u substitution so you just know that

1644
01:22:16,179 --> 01:22:22,239
every problem that you got is a problem

1645
01:22:18,609 --> 01:22:23,378
on you know integration and it's an

1646
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:26,948
integration problem that's going to

1647
01:22:23,378 --> 01:22:29,998
involve au substitution so it robs you

1648
01:22:26,948 --> 01:22:31,898
of your fundamental practice of

1649
01:22:29,998 --> 01:22:34,688
identifying that this is what's supposed

1650
01:22:31,899 --> 01:22:37,570
to happen there because all you're ever

1651
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:40,239
practicing is just the mechanical act of

1652
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:41,859
applying UD u substitution which is

1653
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:44,168
something a computer can pretty much do

1654
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:46,779
flawlessly all the time like it's really

1655
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:48,389
not the case that a human is necessary

1656
01:22:46,779 --> 01:22:52,018
to do you do substitution like

1657
01:22:48,389 --> 01:22:55,779
Mathematica can do that just fine right

1658
01:22:52,019 --> 01:22:57,309
well my math mathematic can't do is tell

1659
01:22:55,779 --> 01:22:58,238
that what you were trying to do in this

1660
01:22:57,309 --> 01:22:59,800
case he

1661
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:02,109
is it integration in the first place and

1662
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,998
that you do substitution might be the

1663
01:23:02,109 --> 01:23:08,589
way to go I mean mad I can't sort of do

1664
01:23:03,998 --> 01:23:10,689
that second part a little bit right so I

1665
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:13,949
really feel like you know the way that

1666
01:23:10,689 --> 01:23:17,859
that sort of math should be taught is

1667
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:20,738
the students should never know what they

1668
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:23,920
are being tested on that's like crucial

1669
01:23:20,738 --> 01:23:25,479
and then nobody should care whether they

1670
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,658
can actually do it by hand or not

1671
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:29,979
because no one ever needs to do math by

1672
01:23:28,658 --> 01:23:32,049
hand anymore that's just not a thing

1673
01:23:29,979 --> 01:23:33,759
what we would care about is that they

1674
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:36,369
would know how to do it or where to look

1675
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,679
it up how to do it that they could get a

1676
01:23:36,368 --> 01:23:41,589
computer to do it or write the computer

1677
01:23:38,679 --> 01:23:43,989
program that does it right and save that

1678
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:46,690
for themselves right all of those things

1679
01:23:43,988 --> 01:23:48,129
great skills being able to like actually

1680
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:49,808
do the equation by hand is like

1681
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:51,340
completely irrelevant like I literally

1682
01:23:49,809 --> 01:23:54,248
have no idea why you would ever need to

1683
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:55,779
know it so it's exactly backwards like I

1684
01:23:54,248 --> 01:23:57,389
think we have it completely backwards

1685
01:23:55,779 --> 01:24:00,158
the way we're teaching it right now

1686
01:23:57,389 --> 01:24:02,469
we're teaching it as if we're trying to

1687
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:03,759
produce people from back in the day when

1688
01:24:02,469 --> 01:24:07,420
they used to have rooms full of people

1689
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:09,820
like solving equations because they

1690
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:11,649
didn't have computers to do it right and

1691
01:24:09,819 --> 01:24:13,689
that's who were like making and we don't

1692
01:24:11,649 --> 01:24:15,248
need that person right that that is just

1693
01:24:13,689 --> 01:24:17,498
not a skill that we fundamentally need

1694
01:24:15,248 --> 01:24:19,300
but what we absolutely do need is people

1695
01:24:17,498 --> 01:24:23,408
who look at problems and go oh I know

1696
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:25,059
what math could be applied here I don't

1697
01:24:23,408 --> 01:24:27,698
quite remember how to do it but let me

1698
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:29,380
go look it up right and that's a great

1699
01:24:27,698 --> 01:24:31,359
skill because you can always go look up

1700
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:33,998
how to do the math if you know what the

1701
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:35,529
math is but if you don't know you'll

1702
01:24:33,998 --> 01:24:36,998
never even know that you should be

1703
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:39,158
looking something up right you'll you'll

1704
01:24:36,998 --> 01:24:41,288
never even you'll never cross your mind

1705
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:43,089
to go look up how to do interval

1706
01:24:41,288 --> 01:24:44,738
arithmetic if you have no idea what

1707
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:46,150
interval arithmetic is and you don't

1708
01:24:44,738 --> 01:24:47,678
know that the problem that you're faced

1709
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:52,018
with can be solved by interval

1710
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:52,019
arithmetic right so

1711
01:24:55,449 --> 01:25:02,449
so yeah anyway uh but yeah and as an

1712
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:04,430
aside there is handmade hero actually i

1713
01:25:02,449 --> 01:25:06,979
think is a good math learning resource

1714
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:08,780
in a limited sense in that way that we

1715
01:25:06,979 --> 01:25:11,509
are showing how to apply math to solve

1716
01:25:08,779 --> 01:25:13,130
problems but you know most of em here is

1717
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:14,360
programming so it's not that good of a

1718
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:16,310
math learners because most of your time

1719
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:19,609
is not spent doing that you could

1720
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:22,760
imagine a series that was done that was

1721
01:25:19,609 --> 01:25:24,920
much more about let's not do a lot of

1722
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:27,590
programming let's do a lot of problem

1723
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:29,180
solving with very simple programming to

1724
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:30,980
actually like implement just the minimum

1725
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:33,200
thing we need to like prove we solve the

1726
01:25:30,979 --> 01:25:34,729
problem or whatever that would be kind

1727
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:37,399
of a cool serious like math learning

1728
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:39,919
serious that would be all about like

1729
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:41,479
finding places where the math is and you

1730
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,039
know like I said we do do that in Hamid

1731
01:25:41,479 --> 01:25:45,319
here I think that's great and I hope

1732
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:47,600
that exposes people to this kind of a

1733
01:25:45,319 --> 01:25:49,880
thing but you know if you wanted to

1734
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,739
learn math real well you would want a

1735
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,719
series that was just like all about that

1736
01:25:51,738 --> 01:25:54,829
and all about the math whereas hey

1737
01:25:53,719 --> 01:25:56,930
mahira is much more about the

1738
01:25:54,829 --> 01:25:58,670
programming than the math and we do the

1739
01:25:56,930 --> 01:26:00,739
math when we need it but we're not

1740
01:25:58,670 --> 01:26:02,899
looking for excuses to do math every day

1741
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:05,329
which is what you'd want kind of that

1742
01:26:02,899 --> 01:26:10,639
you know companion Sirius handmade math

1743
01:26:05,329 --> 01:26:17,539
or something right so all right I'm

1744
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:28,910
gonna close Anna closed down closing on

1745
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:30,350
down close it on down here thank you

1746
01:26:28,909 --> 01:26:31,699
everyone for joining me for life sort of

1747
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:34,039
handmade hero it's been a pleasure

1748
01:26:31,699 --> 01:26:35,179
coding with you as always if you would

1749
01:26:34,039 --> 01:26:38,029
like to follow along the series at home

1750
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:39,500
you can always p order the game on

1751
01:26:38,029 --> 01:26:41,619
handmade here or it comes to the source

1752
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:44,659
code so you could file a long experiment

1753
01:26:41,619 --> 01:26:45,769
for yourself we also have a forum site

1754
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:47,479
you can go to if you want to ask

1755
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:49,370
questions a patreon page if you want to

1756
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:50,809
support the video series we have a

1757
01:26:49,369 --> 01:26:52,399
schedule bot that tweets the schedule if

1758
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:54,739
you want to catch us live for the q and

1759
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:56,449
A's and just if you just want hang out

1760
01:26:54,738 --> 01:26:57,949
the chat and we also have a past

1761

episodes guide you can go to if you want

1762
01:26:57,949 --> 01:27:02,719
to catch up on things we did before

1763
01:27:00,189 --> 01:27:05,119
that's about it for today I will be back

1764
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:06,949
here tomorrow I do not remember what

1765
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:07,840
time I'll be honest with you I think

1766
01:27:06,949 --> 01:27:10,539
it's five

1767
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:13,090
let's find out check that schedule bot

1768
01:27:10,539 --> 01:27:15,250
yeah it's 5pm for those two weeks 0 5

1769
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:16,840
p.m. pacific daylight time hope to see

1770
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:18,189
you here for that until then have fun
