1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,798
this is sort of a little bit of a

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,990
personal session for me because I

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,519
everyone out there probably you know

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,320
some people are a lot younger than I am

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,868
obviously and are kind of getting into

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,519
the game industry but you know I can

7
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:18,899
remember when I first started working on

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,669
games when I was very little

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,259
obviously there were a bunch of things

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,600
that were kind of formative in like my

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,490
experience of making games and you know

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,960
being just a kid who is at home you know

13
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,029
typing away on the home computer and

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,830
whatever I kind of think back to like

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,058
what inspired me to do stuff or what

16
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,849
were the games I played there like I

17
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,498
really want to make that and by far the

18
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,838
one that like comes to mind for me the

19
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:41,129
most was Secret of Monkey Island and

20
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:42,179
there's this is true for a number of

21
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:43,890
reasons

22
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,658
one of the reasons obviously is just

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,128
because at that time I mean I think

24
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:48,748
there's many many people who consider

25
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,388
that like one of the defining games of

26
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:54,449
that time in gaming but there was also

27
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:56,100
the fact that as somebody who sort of

28
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:58,558
knew a little programming but was pretty

29
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,689
bad at it looking at that game and

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,849
looking at the other games that were in

31
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,558
its category at that time I could

32
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,420
actually see the difference in

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,968
craftsmanship on that one like even at

34
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,070
that time because I remember you know

35
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,599
right out of the box these things would

36
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:14,218
would ship and they would be like you

37
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,718
know The Secret of Monkey Island game

38
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:17,218
would be like this really fast fluid

39
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:19,649
experience and everything seemed to work

40
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:21,209
great and you would see like a year

41
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,409
later or something you'd play a similar

42
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,298
game there and you try to sing like

43
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,890
click to walk and it would wait a while

44
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,630
and then the guy would kind of do this

45
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,250
really weird path that didn't look

46
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,629
anything right and that's like even at

47
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,478
that time I was kind of like well like

48
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:35,339
this this is so much better than this

49
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,968
and I don't even know why and I'm not

50
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,189
sure I could do this but this is who I'd

51
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:42,809
want to be right like I want to be the

52
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,748
guy who makes Secret Monkey Island not

53
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,248
the guy who makes this other game right

54
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:48,539
and so when I was putting together the

55
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:51,390
the people who I most wanted to have

56
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:53,549
here my mind immediately went to that

57
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,170
and I was thinking like if if Ron wants

58
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,329
to come talk that would be like the

59
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,649
coolest thing ever and I was kind of on

60
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:00,328
the fence about it because I'm like well

61
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,200
I don't know like maybe he doesn't want

62
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,509
to talk about sort of stuff anymore

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,728
maybe he's not that interested in engine

64
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,890
program anymore and so I go look at what

65
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:08,909
he's doing and he's actually writing he

66
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,349
said because I thought that will be

67
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:11,819
parked like oh maybe he's like managing

68
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,219
that process he's like he's actually

69
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,590
writing a new

70
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:18,500
adventure games system from scratch

71
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,650
himself now right and so I was like this

72
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,389
is perfect so I can't wait to ask him

73
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,980
the questions that I've got here and

74
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:29,379
hear what he has to say so please join

75
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,379
me in welcoming one of my gaming heroes

76
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,670
so I have I have something just to prove

77
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:47,208
that I'm not making this story up for

78
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:49,879
crowd effect I have here in original

79
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,189
secret of monkey island mouse pad that

80
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,348
you gave me the first time I went to

81
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:57,729
visit you like had it in your office yes

82
00:02:54,348 --> 00:03:01,789
I had a stack of those I have kept it

83
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:04,639
and my actual secret of monkey island to

84
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:07,549
box which for some reason I still kept

85
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:13,458
this as well it even has the original

86
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:15,739
DRM people right here a decoder we when

87
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,209
was the last time you saw a game that

88
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:19,459
easy to decoder wheeler right they don't

89
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:23,299
make them like they used to so well back

90
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,830
then DRM was fun wasn't it wasn't just

91
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:26,500
something that was annoying it was

92
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,730
something that actually had fun with

93
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,680
they sort of thought about that process

94
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:32,899
I guess a little bit more how can we

95
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,340
make this something that's not so so

96
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,110
onerous I guess where's now these are

97
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,110
like look you're just going to deal with

98
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,700
it there's nothing and you don't

99
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,010
actually own it you're just licensed

100
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:44,419
whom you read it yeah I would not be

101
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:47,828
able to bring this today what anyway

102
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:50,059
you'd be violating several trademarks

103
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,890
well okay that's kind of scary I

104
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,009
probably shouldn't ask myself question

105
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:57,289
cuz I'll just get depressed but I want

106
00:03:55,009 --> 00:04:01,009
to start out by just saying can you take

107
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:03,500
us back just a little bit to you know to

108
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:05,389
sort of start things off I really want

109
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,370
to know about so maniac mansion was not

110
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:09,858
a game I ever had right I mean as a kid

111
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,849
you know I didn't actually have all you

112
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:12,230
know every game or anything like

113
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,939
nowadays it's kind of crazy when you're

114
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:15,289
adult you have money you can just get if

115
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,660
you want to see what maniac can actually

116
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,798
just get it but back then you know you

117
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,200
only had certain games so I never

118
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,478
actually got to play maniac mansion but

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,610
that was kind of the start of the whole

120
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:27,889
you know that's the whole adventure game

121
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,240
sort of like I want to say the sort of

122
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,370
the genre that you pioneered like that

123
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,918
way of looking click games playing click

124
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,350
games and so could you take us back to

125
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,049
sort of like right before that how does

126
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,550
this start happening like you know what

127
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,949
what was your experience at that time

128
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,270
why did you look at that and you know as

129
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,219
say I want to start making something

130
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:47,658
like this what you know and what was

131
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,099
your sort of like skills at the time

132
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:51,009
that made you think like I can you know

133
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:52,628
I can do this better or I want to go

134
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,300
do this thing so can you just give a

135
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:59,229
center stage yeah well I was hired at

136
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,418
Lucasfilm to to do porting I they they

137
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:04,088
had built some games on the atari 800

138
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:06,609
and they needed someone to pour it into

139
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:08,050
the commodore 64 that was primarily what

140
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,379
I did which Commodore suit before

141
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,930
programming so I was hired to do port

142
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,908
work and I got there and I became

143
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,168
friends with Gary Winnick who was an

144
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:22,538
artist at for the only artist at the

145
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:25,418
time it was just one yeah Gary

146
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:30,699
he did all the art for all the games it

147
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:33,459
was the only artist there and so he and

148
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:35,620
I became really good friends and you

149
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:38,799
eventually became roommates and we you

150
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,389
know shared a place together and we you

151
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,189
know did we wanted to make a game man

152
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:44,829
and at the time I kind of felt like

153
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:47,709
because I was a contractor at the time I

154
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:49,389
wasn't an employee and and you know I

155
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:50,619
felt like you know I want to get a

156
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:52,240
full-time job here and yeah I was

157
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:54,009
working at Lucasville right with Star

158
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,300
Wars and George Lucas and I know all

159
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,699
this stuff is like I don't want to leave

160
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,949
here and so I thought well you know

161
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,329
maybe if I actually you know pitch a

162
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:02,680
game and the game gets done then I'll

163
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:04,568
get hired out in full time and that

164
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,088
would be good so Gary and I started

165
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:09,699
talking about you know pitching a game

166
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:11,978
and we had this idea for this strange

167
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,990
kind of you know comedy horror game with

168
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:16,449
this weird family and you know we talked

169
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,908
about all sorts of ideas and we had like

170
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:21,399
no idea what the game was right we just

171
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:23,498
had we had a bunch of funny stuff we had

172
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,959
funny ideas and that was all that we

173
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:27,580
really had okay and and I think you know

174
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,199
if I look back through my entire career

175
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:34,418
I think the thing that drives me

176
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,069
creatively the most is fear you know

177
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:38,438
that's the second time submission today

178
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:41,468
and and it's and it's like when I get

179
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:45,399
like terrified of something it's like

180
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:47,139
all these creative gears kick in and so

181
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:49,749
I was I was looking at all these great

182
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,430
ideas that Gary and I had and I had no

183
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:53,769
idea what this game was and I was just

184
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,348
it was it I was afraid you know it's

185
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:59,139
like this fear was kicking in and we

186
00:06:56,348 --> 00:07:01,099
Christmas break came when we took we we

187
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,620
went on break and I went down the

188
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,260
to LA where my aunt and uncle live and

189
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,540
my eight-year-old cousin was there and

190
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,819
he had just gotten a you know candy

191
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,280
computer okay and he was playing King's

192
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:15,469
Quest okay I had never seen King's Quest

193
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,269
before right I played text adventures

194
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,610
you know and all that but I never seen

195
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:21,259
kinks was before and I watched him play

196
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,930
this thing and it's just everything just

197
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:26,509
fell into place it's like this is what

198
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,090
maniac manager needs to be it's it's an

199
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:31,279
adventure game so I came back after

200
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:32,869
Christmas just all energized and that's

201
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,319
when we just turned the whole thing into

202
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,209
an adventure game and so King's Quest

203
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,219
obviously looks quite a bit different

204
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:42,349
than maniac mansion because it's kind of

205
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,450
you drive the character around it's got

206
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,310
a text parser you know you type in kind

207
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:48,649
of the old infocomm style so it's quite

208
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,290
a different game so when you came back

209
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:53,089
having seen King's Quest it didn't go

210
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,340
like oh we'll just mix King's Quest and

211
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:57,109
we'll swap in our funny ideas and that's

212
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:59,509
the game we're going to make so how do

213
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,449
we get from I saw King's Quest which is

214
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:04,159
actually pretty different to Jimmy to

215
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,509
maniac mansion like what did that cost

216
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,250
to start looking like what was it did

217
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:08,629
you start making a king of quest clone

218
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,310
right away and then start deviating if I

219
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:12,860
might or did you iterate on it and sort

220
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,060
of like as a discussion first before you

221
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,900
start make anything of what how did that

222
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,850
happen the big thing was that I had

223
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,219
played a lot of text adventures and I

224
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,280
liked text adventures but I really did

225
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,650
hate the parsers because I felt like I

226
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,629
was always playing this game which I

227
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:32,929
called second-guess the parser okay is

228
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:35,899
that I knew what this thing was right

229
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,759
but but did the game call it a bush was

230
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,529
right plant or a tree I guess since

231
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,319
we're talking about trees yeah you know

232
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:44,600
what what was this thing and you know

233
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
maybe the designer had put in a bunch of

234
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,379
synonyms or something but maybe they

235
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,750
didn't get the synonyms I wanted and so

236
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:52,429
I said you know it's like I can see this

237
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,990
stuff I just want to touch it

238
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:56,039
I just want to click it I want to say

239
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,960
that's the thing I wanna I want

240
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,789
interact with and so that's kind of

241
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,230
where getting rid of the parser came

242
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,909
from you know it's like you know what we

243
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,950
should just get rid of the parser the

244
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,990
fact is that you know even sophisticated

245
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,910
adventure games probably only use like

246
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,100
five or six verbs anyway yeah right

247
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:12,629
there are all the synonyms for stuff so

248
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,889
we kind of went through we picked out

249
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,779
the verbs that we thought would be

250
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,970
useful in those we just put them right

251
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,589
on the screen and so you just click on

252
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,029
the verb and you click on the object and

253
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,290
that was kind of where the whole you

254
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:25,589
know point-and-click thing came from

255
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:29,189
well so how did you sort of do that

256
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:31,019
process though because you know was that

257
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,180
something that you thought of before you

258
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,409
started programming the game or is that

259
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,539
something that you sort of like did you

260
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:38,399
start making a parser and then go wait a

261
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:39,719
minute we could do this or did you was

262
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,009
this just like you came back from King's

263
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,090
Quest and we're talking to Gary and you

264
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:44,610
guys just kind of figured this out

265
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,680
before you even like started really like

266
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,509
what was that we knew we were dumping

267
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,789
the parser and we knew we were going to

268
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:52,049
the verb verb etre before I start

269
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:53,639
approach so that was just already in

270
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,990
your head from infocomm days it just

271
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,759
kind of clicked were you talking about

272
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,149
like we don't want to do that and and

273
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:02,100
Lucasfilm had done a game previously

274
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:04,860
called a base on the movie labyrinth and

275
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,440
they had done kind of a verb interface

276
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,820
it was like the spinning wheel thing

277
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,280
okay you know it was it was it was very

278
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,750
clunky and it was cumbersome but you

279
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,639
know that was that was a leaping off

280
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,769
point for us okay so we didn't come from

281
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,689
absolutely nothing it kind of came a

282
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:20,519
little bit from the labyrinth stuff and

283
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,260
so it was clear enough from that it's

284
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,789
like yes could work if we just do it a

285
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:25,889
little bit let's just refine it and

286
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,269
simplify it and and this will just be a

287
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:30,240
much better way for people to interact

288
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:32,519
with adventure games so now you've got

289
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,200
this sort of idea you're like okay we've

290
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,189
got the idea sort of for the story and

291
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,810
the sort of things that we want to have

292
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,220
happen and we kind of know that we're

293
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:39,929
gonna do like this verb interface sort

294
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,460
of thing where you click on stuff but

295
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:44,039
there's still a tremendous amount of

296
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,200
like you know what is how do we build a

297
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,309
game like this right because you're my

298
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,690
understanding there is you're coming at

299
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,129
it never having a look you didn't work

300
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,450
on King's Quest you don't know what the

301
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:53,879
internals of King's Quest look like hand

302
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,410
unlike nowadays you know a game like

303
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,939
King's Quest or something would be

304
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:59,279
trivial to write or something like this

305
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,540
back then you're talking about like you

306
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,799
know it's cutting but things are cutting

307
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:03,480
edge just having sprites move on a

308
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,649
screen it's like a whole thing so hip

309
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,688
pixels are cutting

310
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:09,058
yeah pixels are cutting-edge right and

311
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:10,318
so what's your process now how do you

312
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:12,389
sit down and set apart in this problem I

313
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:13,828
guess we can maybe also ask a little bit

314
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,629
like how did you get the game prove it

315
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:17,128
you work on a spare time what happened

316
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,990
there like like I guess we should say

317
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:21,300
before we start out you know Lucasfilm

318
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,188
back then look at some games it was a

319
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,618
very magical place in some ways right

320
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:27,928
there was there were but by the time

321
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:30,389
that we had pitched maniac mansion they

322
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:33,480
were like 15 people okay so it was very

323
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:35,278
very small and you know I think we we

324
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,170
were very lucky because I don't think

325
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,470
George Lucas knew he had a games

326
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:43,049
division and so right we had all this

327
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,970
amazing autonomy to do you know whatever

328
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:47,639
we really wanted to do and there was

329
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,589
really no official approval process the

330
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,539
way it work was you wrote you know

331
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,519
little you know one two three play to

332
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:56,099
design documents and we just passed him

333
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,078
around on paper and everybody took notes

334
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,569
and then things just kind of bubbled up

335
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,428
until everybody said hey this is really

336
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:04,409
interesting and then they kind of became

337
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:06,028
projects at that point so it's sort of

338
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:07,438
like an elaborate of buy-in sort of a

339
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:09,749
thing which like if everyone sort of

340
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:11,428
starts to think that this this paper is

341
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:13,439
one we should go with then we will yeah

342
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:15,808
exactly so there was no there was no

343
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:17,998
real pitch to the whole thing and so did

344
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:20,219
you start making the game before that or

345
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:22,319
did you did you start by making that

346
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,939
document go like you and Gary go okay

347
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:25,620
we're gonna start trying to pitch it

348
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:27,719
internally was that the first step then

349
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,308
yeah I was floating that design document

350
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,410
around and getting support for it which

351
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:33,328
is you know where the the verb interface

352
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:35,219
came from was kind of you making that da

353
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:36,928
service yeah but that was I mean that

354
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,730
was probably like maybe a two-month of

355
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:41,938
Tomb of the process of pitching that

356
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:44,188
around and then you know in in typical

357
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:45,958
fashion from a couple of guys that have

358
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:48,419
no idea what they're doing we just

359
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,828
jumped right into it Gary just started

360
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,928
drawing art and I just started writing

361
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:56,519
code and we had no idea where we were

362
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:58,350
going with stuff and you know and and I

363
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,240
think you know that's really kind of

364
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,639
where the whole scum system came from

365
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,589
the adventure game system because you

366
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,448
know we took this path where I was just

367
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:07,580
gonna write this whole game and 6502

368
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:09,109
assembly

369
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,750
right I mean how hard can that be oh

370
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,120
alright so I just I just started kind of

371
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,549
doing that and you know again that that

372
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,440
fear kicked in is I realize I've been

373
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:20,149
just totally in over my head with this

374
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,700
there's no way we're gonna be able to

375
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:24,230
get this done which was we're doing you

376
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,028
know a scripting language in an

377
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,310
interpreted language you know kind of

378
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:31,129
came from all of that okay so that

379
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:35,708
actually sets up like perfectly the

380
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:40,149
stuff I want to talk about a

381
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:42,439
professional give you a nice segue so

382
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,059
looking at that process right you sit

383
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,950
down and you're kind of going like okay

384
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:47,268
we've got to start with some basic stuff

385
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,740
we got to put some sprites on the screen

386
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:50,028
and presumably like LucasArts maybe

387
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,169
already have some stuff you said here I

388
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:52,610
could start drawing art for it

389
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,379
immediately presumably there's some kind

390
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,550
of pixel editing thing you can do or

391
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,899
whatever so he's kind of making some

392
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:58,939
assets and you maybe you're getting some

393
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,519
stuff on the screen at what point so

394
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,540
what it what started like how do you sit

395
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,129
down and start that process again it's

396
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:06,559
the part I'm kind of interested in is

397
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:07,578
you know nowadays if I said I need to

398
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,039
sit down and make a point click

399
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:11,899
adventure game I know what that is and I

400
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:13,370
know exactly how it's gonna run so I can

401
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:14,839
sit down and debate a bunch of designers

402
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,639
in my head or something that's or start

403
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,140
typing or whatever and maybe follow

404
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,028
John's approach and say I'll just write

405
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:22,009
the simplest thing but in this case we

406
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:25,458
don't even know what it is yet at all

407
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:26,899
it's a new job so what literally like if

408
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,979
you can remember I know this is kind of

409
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,179
a weird part developing process I can't

410
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,519
even remember stuff I wrote in stream

411
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:33,708
last week so I realized her but what do

412
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,328
you actually start sit down and start

413
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:37,669
with like what was the thing that we

414
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:39,169
just started doing can you give us any

415
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,088
insight because I'm really clear well I

416
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,189
knew that the structure of the game was

417
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:46,010
gonna kind of be based on these rooms we

418
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,570
call them rooms and objects ok those are

419
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:49,850
the two things rooms objects and the

420
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,278
actors those are the three things that

421
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,528
made it out so I kind of knew that I had

422
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:56,419
to do that I knew that objects had to

423
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:58,939
appear in rooms I knew I needed some

424
00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:00,979
system to be able to tag objects so when

425
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,570
you touch them with the cursor and you

426
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,940
know all that kind of stuff I knew I

427
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,250
knew that stuff you know in terms of the

428
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,110
language itself you know I really didn't

429
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,299
have idea what the language was gonna be

430
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,430
I mean I've kind of heard about lists

431
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:15,709
and I guess the people were using lists

432
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:17,750
for AI stuff and okay

433
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,759
I should probably use lists okay okay so

434
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,169
you know my language would looked very

435
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,299
Lisp like with lots of you know

436
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:26,120
parentheses and all that stuff on it and

437
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:28,250
I I just I very quickly just ditched all

438
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,529
that okay and I went to something that

439
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,330
was a little more see like okay for like

440
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,730
curly braces and stuff that was I think

441
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,650
a little more saner well how did you

442
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,149
make the decision so because this is

443
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:39,860
actually a mystery part too so when you

444
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:41,299
start working and you start coding up

445
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,300
the actors that sort of thing that's

446
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:46,759
sort of part of it I guess you could

447
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:48,079
start in 6502 right you could just start

448
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,950
making the hard coded versions but I

449
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,150
guess is what you're saying you you

450
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,850
actually started hard coding them

451
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:55,299
initially how did you first come to you

452
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,610
said fear essentially how did you first

453
00:15:55,299 --> 00:16:00,709
make that leap of like you know what if

454
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,710
I had an interpreted thing here this

455
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,210
would work because that's not again now

456
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,590
that might be an obvious issue because

457
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,810
maybe you have awareness of all these

458
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,730
things but at that time that is not an

459
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:13,250
obvious thing to think of necessarily

460
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,779
had you seen other games do this did you

461
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,070
have some experience in the past that

462
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,929
made you think this would be a good idea

463
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,030
like how did that thought come in yeah

464
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:22,759
that came from a guy named chip

465
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:26,269
Morningstar and he works at Lucasfilm

466
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:29,299
and he and another person of Lucas own

467
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:31,490
name Randy farmer they they went on to

468
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:33,979
create habitat which is probably the

469
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,810
world's first graphical MMO I remember

470
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,480
that and I mean chip was just like an

471
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:39,889
uber smart guy okay and you know I was

472
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,450
just kind of talking to him about the

473
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,769
whole problem and he just kind of said a

474
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,210
whining you do a scripting language

475
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,350
okay just something you threaten why

476
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,639
don't you do a scripting language so he

477
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,800
just knew about it from some other

478
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,629
situation yeah I mean you know at the

479
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,189
time he infocomm had a script yes right

480
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:53,899
I mean they didn't code their stuff and

481
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,190
you know Sierra had one is yeah so I

482
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:58,069
mean it wasn't something that was

483
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:00,920
totally and right for but you know

484
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,570
getting a whole you know compiled

485
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,709
scripting language working on a

486
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,309
Commodore 64

487
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:09,500
you know there's 64 K of memory FS

488
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:11,509
machine right and so that was you know

489
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,910
that that was something that went really

490
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:15,619
on a Commodore you know that I think

491
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,839
that was the leap I had to make was

492
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:20,519
building a whole interpreted language

493
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,779
that ran on this little 64 K machine

494
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,180
you know I kind of had to convince

495
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:27,690
myself a little bit that that was a good

496
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:30,539
idea yeah well and so in deciding to

497
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,190
take that step was really what you're

498
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:34,019
thinking there's like okay if we had a

499
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,970
scripting language it will be easier for

500
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,319
me to script or was that more of a

501
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,569
decision like if we had a scripting

502
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,939
language other people could start

503
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:43,379
tweaking a lot which because later on it

504
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,809
probably that that thing changed but a

505
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,820
tin maniac mansion what was that yeah in

506
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:52,799
in maniac mansion you know I was very

507
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:54,089
idealistic okay at the time and I you

508
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,379
know I kind of thought you know I'm

509
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:57,990
gonna build this scripting language

510
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,780
that's so natural you don't even have to

511
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,940
be a programmer right okay that I can

512
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,440
hire like writers right and they can

513
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,880
come and they can use my scripting

514
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,340
language and they can build these games

515
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,470
because this thing is just so brilliant

516
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:18,720
you know that it's it's not even like

517
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:21,089
programs they just describe the game so

518
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,210
so I mean that was kind of my initial

519
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:27,119
thing and and if you look at the scum

520
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:30,150
language you know the commands in it are

521
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:33,479
very verbose because I was trying to

522
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:36,090
make things be very clear about about

523
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,339
what was happening you kind of want to

524
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:39,990
look very English like yeah exactly you

525
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:41,459
know and so a lot of the commands in the

526
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,799
language are kind of like that but I

527
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,410
mean at some level you you just can't

528
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,720
get over the fact that whoever is doing

529
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:51,269
this needs to understand basic logic

530
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,039
they have to understand you know if if

531
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:55,139
then statements and all of this stuff

532
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,119
that goes on and there's just no way

533
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,440
around that yeah kind of stuff so you

534
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,629
know the language could be kind of

535
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,539
verbose and you know English like and

536
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,400
very freeform in its structure you know

537
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:07,859
you didn't you didn't pass a bunch of

538
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,019
anonymous parameters to functions you

539
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,569
know instead you said actor act and then

540
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:15,480
you could just put costume this and just

541
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:17,579
you know run on all of your stuff across

542
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,069
it so that's why it was it was a kind of

543
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:23,490
a verbose language and it didn't look

544
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:25,019
very programmer now you're gonna make

545
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,690
this scripting language for the game

546
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,730
obviously you know nowadays it's like oh

547
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,860
well you know we're gonna type the

548
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,929
script in the script window and then

549
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:35,308
the games running and we'll just alt tab

550
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:36,990
between them or they're on the same

551
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:38,278
screen and my multi-monitor right there

552
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,609
but we're talking about a Commodore 64

553
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:43,079
the situation here so how does that like

554
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:44,250
what what did that process of look at

555
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:47,398
the time to because now you're like okay

556
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,869
how are people making these scripts and

557
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:50,939
how does the turnaround time look like

558
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:52,768
and I think like again it may not be

559
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,090
that relevant to the to the programming

560
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,429
of it so much but it's kind of

561
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:57,538
interesting just to think back about how

562
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,159
ago screen there was how did that

563
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:02,519
process go what was that like at the

564
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:05,159
time well we we had a we had a wonderful

565
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:08,069
development environment and the the

566
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:10,260
Lucasfilm games group was was kind of

567
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:12,509
spun off or a part of the Lucasfilm

568
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:15,690
computer division which later changed

569
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:18,119
their name to Pixar ok so there's all

570
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,889
those people you know they all kind of

571
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:23,099
worked in our group and so we had these

572
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:25,769
like really really smart people and you

573
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:27,538
know Lucasfilm the hi entire company ran

574
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:30,329
on these big mainframe

575
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:33,750
you know fax machines you know uniques

576
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:35,278
machines and everything and one of the

577
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,929
things they did was they they built

578
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:40,558
these little things that literally

579
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:43,528
plugged my Commodore 64 into the backs

580
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:46,288
UNIX machine really I would plug the

581
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:48,388
thing in and then I worked on a UNIX

582
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:50,460
terminal on my desk and I had complete

583
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:52,798
control of the Commodore 64 I could

584
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,450
pause it I could download stuff to it I

585
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,720
could upload stuff from it so I never

586
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,970
programmed on the Commodore 64 it was

587
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,509
all done on these big UNIX machines I

588
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:06,179
which was very useful because scum was a

589
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:08,158
compiled like yes and so the compiler

590
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,440
ran on the UNIX machines it didn't run

591
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,659
on the commodore 64 so the whole

592
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,639
compiler and the art pipeline and all

593
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,950
that stuff just happened on the UNIX

594
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:19,079
machines and then we just download

595
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,610
everything in the Commodore 64 it was

596
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,949
nice because we could do a lot of hot

597
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:25,048
loading stuff right we could just run

598
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,399
things down to the machine you know

599
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:29,220
while I was running and this was you

600
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:31,528
know in nineteen eighties yeah right and

601
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,750
I was very very very different years a

602
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:35,279
lot like it is today but very very

603
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,319
than what was happening back then yeah

604
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,149
that's actually incredible so does that

605
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,460
mean that somebody who was working on a

606
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,920
particular room for the game could

607
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,509
literally have a UNIX thing open modify

608
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,100
some scripts and in a relatively short

609
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,970
period of time see the result almost

610
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:51,329
instantly

611
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,880
that's insane so that is insane yeah

612
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:56,250
because we would just we would just push

613
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,260
the script down and the other thing

614
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,839
about the scum system was you know the

615
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:03,269
comment of 6040 at 64 K a memory right

616
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:06,179
but a lot of that was taking up with the

617
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:10,230
program yeah and you know I actually had

618
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:13,650
only 19 K of memory free for all the

619
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:15,360
assets in the game okay and so you know

620
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,700
what I what I had done was I wrote

621
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,199
actually chip and written it because he

622
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,720
was starting to work on habitat at that

623
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,420
okay so he wrote this wonderful memory

624
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,819
management system where you know all the

625
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,650
assets in the game were kept on this

626
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:30,750
little heap okay and the system was

627
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,090
smart enough to understand that okay

628
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,819
this stuff's old no one's using it flush

629
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:38,069
it out and if I bring in new stuff just

630
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:39,480
spool the stuff out of memory while the

631
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:42,119
new stuff is brought in right that's not

632
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,099
a Commodore 64 right that all this stuff

633
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:45,569
is happening so you know the whole game

634
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,939
is just kind of you know almost

635
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:49,889
open-world continuously put all the

636
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,960
stuff that just spooled in from the

637
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,450
disks okay so I've made the debugging

638
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,100
very easy on the from the UNIX theme

639
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,080
because we had all these assets whether

640
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:01,469
they were art or scripts we could just

641
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:03,089
pump a new one down to the heap and it

642
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,860
would just it would just work right

643
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:06,779
there on the thing so it was a very very

644
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:09,209
quick development so you literally on

645
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:12,899
the Commodore 64 running on the

646
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:15,870
Commodore 64 had hot loadable assets yes

647
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,519
during without restart yes it just keeps

648
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:19,979
running and you could swap like the guy

649
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,700
with a new bitmap yeah that's that's

650
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,700
kind of crazy

651
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:31,329
I don't even know all right I have

652
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:33,549
trouble getting networking today yeah we

653
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:35,799
did have to recut it enter the room you

654
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:39,730
were in right so it wasn't just magical

655
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:44,079
we had to do a quick reload I'll give

656
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:46,059
that yeah Wow okay well so I guess

657
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,409
scripting language wise how did you

658
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,759
approach that problem I guess I should

659
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,230
keep track of time because that's kind

660
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:52,079
of wanted to talk about two things it

661
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,029
looks like we have plenty so we're good

662
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,710
so tell me a little bit about how you

663
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:58,240
approach the scripting language problem

664
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,200
because like you said if that was

665
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,190
something that sort of someone said hey

666
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,870
why don't you do a scripting language

667
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,610
like oh maybe that's a good idea how did

668
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:05,169
you know I mean even how to build such a

669
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,729
thing right did you have some experience

670
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,380
of scripting languages did you let go

671
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,730
get learn scripting there's just in 2031

672
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,320
days or whatever it is I'm sure there

673
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,880
was a popular book at the time like did

674
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:14,500
you like how do you even know how to

675
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,150
build one because you know again back

676
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,470
then we take it for granted now that if

677
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,610
I want to learn how to type it into

678
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,569
Google how do I build a scripting

679
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:21,309
language and there's some ones to toriel

680
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:23,859
that's not the case so what did that

681
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:26,529
look like well that looked like a couple

682
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:28,539
of things when you know before I got my

683
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:30,849
job at Lucasfilm back when I was in I

684
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:33,789
guess high school I got a Commodore 64

685
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:35,409
ok so that was that was you know I'd

686
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:36,909
learned programming on the Commodore

687
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,860
pets and some other stuff but the

688
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,330
Commodore 64 I got one of those and I

689
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:43,719
just thought this was you know an

690
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:45,460
amazing device but the one problem I had

691
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,049
with a Commodore 64 is it had really

692
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,539
great graphics had wonderful you know

693
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:52,089
sid chip for doing audio none of that

694
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:53,589
was accessible from basic right a bit of

695
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:55,209
it right right if you want to access

696
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:57,189
that stuff you did like peek and poke

697
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,960
commands yeah you know to hit the memory

698
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,360
and they're super super cumbersome yeah

699
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,579
and you know I thought will really be

700
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,799
nice if there was actually a basic

701
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:07,779
language on the Commodore 64 that could

702
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,730
take advantage of all these graphics

703
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:11,109
right and one of the things I realized

704
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:14,380
when is hacking around with the machine

705
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:16,299
is there's there's like 20 K of wrong in

706
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,510
the Commodore 64 where the basic

707
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:22,419
interpreter sets but there's 64 K of RAM

708
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:25,660
so you could you bank out the ROM and

709
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,250
then you have a 64 K of RAM to put play

710
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,380
with like if you don't need the basic

711
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,230
interpreter okay so basically normally

712
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,659
the 64 K when the machine starts

713
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,190
the 20k of Rahm actually gets moved into

714
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:37,200
the 64k of memory

715
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,480
no the ROM actually sits right above it

716
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,909
I've been seeing address okay but what I

717
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,190
kind of realized was that if I read a

718
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:46,470
bite out of the wrong and then I wrote

719
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,679
it back to the wrong it actually wrote

720
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,960
to the RAM underneath so what I did was

721
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,149
I went through and I copied all of the

722
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,419
basic ROM writing it right back out to

723
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:59,879
itself banked out the wrong now I had

724
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:01,799
the entire basic interpreter I see Ram

725
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,778
and you can modify and so I started

726
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,849
playing with it and I built this whole

727
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:07,859
extension to the basic language called

728
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:10,230
graphics basic okay and they'd added

729
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:12,479
sprite commands and line commands and

730
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,909
sound commands and I think I think it's

731
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,769
kind of where my love of languages yeah

732
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:18,269
and so when I started doing the scum

733
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:21,538
stuff I kind of had this whole

734
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:23,700
experience with with graphics basic you

735
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,679
know of what a language looks like and

736
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,298
how you know I understood how basic

737
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,830
interpreted the language because they'd

738
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:31,138
hacked into the whole thing and figured

739
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:33,720
it all out so when I was working on this

740
00:26:31,138 --> 00:26:34,979
gum system I kind of I knew you know

741
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,380
what it was like to go through in the

742
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,899
you interpret op codes and all that kind

743
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,909
of stuff that I had already done okay so

744
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:44,339
basically your experience with with

745
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:45,539
essentially disassembling basic yes we

746
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:48,388
would call which I did I

747
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:50,250
I printed out the entire basic wrong

748
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:52,589
okay I remember sitting on my bedroom

749
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,230
floor with these giant printouts and a

750
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:56,609
pencil you know writing comments because

751
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,409
I mean there wasn't it was not there

752
00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:01,019
were there were no comments right it was

753
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:03,090
just assembly and so from that you

754
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,038
learned how they had done their

755
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:06,599
interpreter and so now you knew here's

756
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,769
how I can make it interpret right that's

757
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:09,769
amazing yes okay

758
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:19,679
okay so you you sit down to make the

759
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:21,118
scum version of the interpreter and

760
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,469
you're just like okay so I'm kind of get

761
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:24,449
a patterned after what I learned from

762
00:27:22,469 --> 00:27:25,649
basic and we're gonna you know we have

763
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,538
the UNIX terminals so we're going to

764
00:27:25,648 --> 00:27:29,248
make the stuff that compiles down how

765
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:30,719
you know how long does that take to get

766
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:32,098
working like how when does that start to

767
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:34,019
come online like how much your process

768
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:36,950
was that uh you know that that took

769
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:40,048
quite a while you know I was saying it

770
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,669
it probably took me about a year okay

771
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:44,668
from the point that we started working

772
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:47,099
on it so we had a system that we were

773
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:49,739
actually building a game in and you know

774
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:51,358
I I mean I know this isn't actually true

775
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:53,249
but it feels like I almost got fired

776
00:27:51,358 --> 00:27:55,558
okay you know I definitely remember

777
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:57,358
being called into my boss's office and

778
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:59,548
having a talk okay

779
00:27:57,358 --> 00:28:01,858
about how long maniac mansion was taking

780
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:04,138
and is we're gonna turn into something

781
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:05,699
so it was definitely taking a long time

782
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:08,819
and I was I mean that was just pure

783
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,038
inexperience you know at building we

784
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:12,538
were trying to build well sure and it's

785
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,729
very ambitious for the time it sounds

786
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:16,729
like the hooking it up to a fax machine

787
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:23,338
so I want to take just before I move on

788
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,899
because I want to talk a little bit

789
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:26,308
about what you're doing now as well and

790
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:27,748
so I wanted to ask one other question

791
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:29,398
kind of to set that up a little bit

792
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,899
which is that one of the things that I

793
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:32,819
mentioned kind of in the introduction as

794
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:36,478
well is that one thing I noticed about

795
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:38,489
the the Lucas arts games kind of right

796
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:39,808
from the very beginning so I like I said

797
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:40,979
didn't ever have a chance to maniac

798
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,269
mansion but certainly in Secret of

799
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:43,649
Monkey Island and in everything that

800
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:45,628
sort of came at RIT until I don't know

801
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,888
maybe something like grim fandago where

802
00:28:45,628 --> 00:28:51,378
they went back to maybe like direct

803
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:54,658
control I felt like the click to move

804
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:56,248
implementation in those games was much

805
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,169
better than everyone else's click to

806
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:59,940
move in for an implication maybe that's

807
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,470
a complete misinterpretation of what I

808
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,769
saw but you're right

809
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:08,919
but I wanted to ask about that problem

810
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:10,058
specifically so at some point and I

811
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,159
guess I don't know what this point was

812
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:13,779
but at some point you decided I don't

813
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,130
want to drive this guy around I want to

814
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:16,480
just be able to click to move him now

815
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,610
was that's when you decided early on or

816
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,960
late on that was early on that was a

817
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:22,599
part of the whole point click interface

818
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,519
was we just okay to touch everything we

819
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,629
didn't have a mouse the Commodore 64 was

820
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:27,700
a choices a joystick

821
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,289
but you know we knew we wanted to move

822
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,970
the cursor around and everything was

823
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:33,099
just clicking looking screens you click

824
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,620
to walk okay so that original design

825
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:37,509
document either includes or when we were

826
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:39,009
making it we already had thought of we

827
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,470
don't really want you to drive the sky

828
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:42,640
we wanted to click OK which I guess

829
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,929
makes sense because if I already have to

830
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,429
be clicking on the menu things what am i

831
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:47,890
driving with like ant and so it's kind

832
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:49,240
of forces the issue a muster so you have

833
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,520
to approach this problem now it's like

834
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,798
okay this is actually quite different

835
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,750
than basically anything that I see at

836
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:57,250
games at that time all other games are

837
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,230
pretty much direct control whether it's

838
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,000
an arcade game or a Sierra game you're

839
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,380
driving the guy around so how did you

840
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,819
approach that problem initially was it a

841
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,289
big deal for you or was something just

842
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:07,839
did like what what was the mindset there

843
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:11,379
and how did that go well the issue is

844
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:13,240
obviously pathfinding yeah is I you know

845
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,070
I wanted I wanted to be able to click

846
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,750
anywhere on the screen and I wanted the

847
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:19,329
character to figure out how to get there

848
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,909
yes if it was possible for the character

849
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:23,470
to walk from point A to point B and he

850
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:25,240
had to walk around the table and between

851
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,620
some chairs and you know around the lamp

852
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,929
I wanted him to do that

853
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:30,279
right I didn't want him to walk in a

854
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,929
straight line and get stuck

855
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:34,240
yeah against the dining room table ready

856
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:36,750
walk around the table so that became you

857
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,730
know a you know a pathfinding issue and

858
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:42,490
you know I don't I don't exactly

859
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:46,419
remember kind of the genesis of you know

860
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:48,250
how how it all came about but we used

861
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:52,299
the system which was which we called WAP

862
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:54,519
boxes ok and and what it was was you

863
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:55,990
know if you think about the room yeah no

864
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,440
it's it's kind of a flat but think about

865
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,788
the floor then and I I would just put

866
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,769
these boxes and they were literally

867
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:05,558
squares ok because we didn't have the

868
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:07,298
CPU power to even have angled lines and

869
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:08,558
figure out you know the intersection

870
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:11,319
some kind of rectangle so they were

871
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,559
boxes you know the lock boxes and I

872
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:15,990
would just you would just I would just

873
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:18,450
them on the floor as many of them as I

874
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:21,029
needed and you know make sure that there

875
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,490
was an overlap you know on the lines

876
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:25,829
okay so all of the rectangles are

877
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:28,470
slightly overlapping is that what you

878
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:31,289
mean they're they share a pixel in

879
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,390
common so exactly overlap they they they

880
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:36,389
escalate at this point if you okay all

881
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:38,220
right okay yeah and then and so you have

882
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,350
all these boxes that litter the floor

883
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,809
about where you can walk now the hard

884
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:45,059
part is well how do you pass right right

885
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:47,279
and today I mean you just don't worry

886
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:49,679
right you do some a star thing you know

887
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,180
whatever it is but you just didn't have

888
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:58,590
the CPU on a wait 0.8 you know megahertz

889
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:00,269
and I was 6502 so you know that the idea

890
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:03,720
that he came up with is you just do a

891
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:06,089
lot of pre-processing and and so I had

892
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,819
all the boxes there was like box 1 2 3 4

893
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:11,789
5 6 ok and I had this two-dimensional

894
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:14,309
grid and you you look at the box you

895
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:17,099
were in so you were in box 1 okay you

896
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:18,480
wanted to go to box 8 okay so you just

897
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:21,049
you look up in the grid

898
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,420
you know box 1 I want to go to box 8 and

899
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:28,230
that number right there was the next box

900
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:30,330
you want to walk into ok so and so then

901
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,160
and I knew those connected they had to

902
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:33,869
right so then it was very easy to find

903
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,570
the connecting line and I would just

904
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:39,629
walk to the center point of the X Box

905
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:41,669
so that's like Dijkstra's algorithm did

906
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:45,230
you know that at the dawn so you fall on

907
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,230
just figured it out yourself

908
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,190
and worse than that in that little

909
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:52,559
matrix yeah that was something that we

910
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:54,750
we had to build by hand ok we didn't

911
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,759
that wasn't pre-processed we'd lay down

912
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,470
all the boxes usually we went to the

913
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,109
text editor and we lay out that little

914
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:03,360
grid of where you could go so it was it

915
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:05,699
was kind of a a cumbersome process to

916
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,939
set up walk boxes but end result in the

917
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,799
game yeah is instant so basically you

918
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,420
would click somewhere it would no that's

919
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,859
in well first of all it would just look

920
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,390
to see through all the boxes if in any

921
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,309
of these box it's not in the box you're

922
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,840
not going to go there or do try to go as

923
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:20,339
far close as it could he tried to do he

924
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,139
tried to cope classical so how did that

925
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:24,539
work do you find the closest box it was

926
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,740
it was a bit it was a vertical line ok

927
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:28,029
so it basically said like believe

928
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,680
searching until we

929
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:31,750
so I find a box there and then I

930
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,220
basically set some global you know not

931
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,480
global but some state for this actor

932
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,720
that's like this actress trying to go to

933
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,009
box blah so every time his box you know

934
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,180
every time I update his movement I go

935
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:42,279
what box is he in

936
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,600
figure out the direction to the next box

937
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,740
and go well how does that how are you

938
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,899
encoding stuff like that like what

939
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,910
direction go from box to box it was

940
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,769
really just straight lines okay and you

941
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:53,680
know you had to be clear careful in your

942
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:55,389
boxes because I knew that what what the

943
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,640
actor was going to do was go from the

944
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,980
point they were standing to the midpoint

945
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,960
of where the two boxes intersected and

946
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,700
so I just kind of had to make sure I

947
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,680
mean sometimes you know we'd have to put

948
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,960
a couple of extra boxes just to make it

949
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,940
a little bit you know feel right but it

950
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,699
was I mean it was pretty brain-dead you

951
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,200
know what I was trying to do that's well

952
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:16,418
so that's like a mystery that I've

953
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,750
wanted to know for I guess what 30 years

954
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:21,009
now thank you very much

955
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,179
yeah it became a little more

956
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,740
sophisticated you know by the time

957
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:26,050
Monkey Island rolled around we could do

958
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:28,000
trapezoids okay so the truck just to

959
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:33,220
make less boxes so yeah so we could do

960
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,619
like trapezoids it's slowly evolved so

961
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:39,969
let's jump forward now to thimble we'd

962
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:41,199
park right and you're going to this is

963
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:43,119
the only question I think that I've

964
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,529
asked you beforehand so I kind of a

965
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,918
little bit know the first answer but

966
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:49,380
everything else I don't know so you're

967
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,929
gonna make another adventure game and

968
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,490
obviously like I mean to to drastically

969
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,780
exaggerate if you wanted to you could

970
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:58,329
literally go get someone's

971
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,910
reimplementation of your thing which is

972
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:02,860
probably in the public domain now some

973
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:05,049
scummvm you could use so when you sat

974
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,900
down to make a new adventure game in

975
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,340
like what it was 2014 or 2013 we've

976
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,579
worked in December last year December

977
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:15,519
last year okay so so 2014 you're like

978
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:17,019
I'm gonna make a new one mmm how did

979
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:18,219
that decisions like hot what was the

980
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:21,099
motivator for that decision

981
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:22,750
the motivator was again it was Gary

982
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:25,239
Winnick you know he when I were just

983
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,309
talking one day about adventure games

984
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:29,529
and and we're talking about modern

985
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:31,090
adventure games you know versus kind of

986
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:34,510
the old classic point-and-click games

987
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:36,340
and it really kind of you know it felt

988
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,260
to me that adventure games have lost

989
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,940
that charm okay

990
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:43,000
they had back there okay and I really

991
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,470
wasn't sure why they had but if it just

992
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,929
felt like they kind of lost that charm

993
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:48,639
until Gary and I were talking about you

994
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:50,679
know what what that was you know maybe

995
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,179
it was just our innocence of the time

996
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:54,250
yeah it was that it was a brand new

997
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:55,210
genre and it was just magical yes

998
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,130
there's not anymore

999
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,510
we just when you said that charm you

1000
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,280
don't really even know what i'd loveo

1001
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:01,270
said you're just like i felt like there

1002
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,370
was a charm here and that term is

1003
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:05,259
definitely gone yeah I have no idea what

1004
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:07,000
that is and you know we were just kind

1005
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,370
of talking about that and we didn't

1006
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,599
really know what it was and you know we

1007
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:12,369
started talking about what we should

1008
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,409
just make a new one yeah we should make

1009
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:17,440
one exactly like we made them back then

1010
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:19,359
with the same sensibilities the same you

1011
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,190
know kind of art style everything and

1012
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,260
just see if we could capture that truth

1013
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:25,119
or maybe that charm was it has just been

1014
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:27,550
lost to time yeah you know in some way

1015
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,769
and you know so one thing led to another

1016
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,870
and we decided to do a Kickstarter for

1017
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:33,909
it okay you know Kickstarter is kind of

1018
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:36,940
based on nostalgia tend to do very well

1019
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:38,949
yes you know so so you know we figured

1020
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,869
well we've got kind of a perfect yeah

1021
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:42,639
opportunity to do this so yeah we did we

1022
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:46,000
just did a Kickstarter on it which was

1023
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:49,599
successful and we really have approached

1024
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,210
the game very much as let's just pretend

1025
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,949
we were back in 1987 and we're making a

1026
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,289
point and clicking okay let's just use

1027
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:59,230
all the same you know ideas that we had

1028
00:36:56,289 --> 00:37:02,349
back then and see if we can somehow you

1029
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:03,849
know we capture that that charm in kind

1030
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:05,409
of the way we design and the way we

1031
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,989
build it the way we kind of think about

1032
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:10,089
the game and so building a new system

1033
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:13,029
for it is kind of part of that whole

1034
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:15,400
mentality would that be an accurate

1035
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,830
statement meaning like we want to create

1036
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,840
a new VM for example because that's what

1037
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:22,630
we did and we're going to do that again

1038
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,910
it wasn't specifically that I mean I did

1039
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:26,800
spend a little time looking at current

1040
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,239
adventure gaming guys to see if any of

1041
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,450
them would do what I

1042
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:35,439
and I very quickly discarded that okay

1043
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:38,319
and I think I think most of it is I mean

1044
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,269
I love building game engines and I mean

1045
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,190
I kind of think in some ways just you

1046
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:44,019
know when I design a game it's really

1047
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:46,480
just an excuse to build a game engine

1048
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:49,929
that's that's all it really is right and

1049
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,849
so you know I think a part of that kind

1050
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:54,309
of recapturing everything was you know I

1051
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:56,680
you know it's like what we'd kind of

1052
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:59,679
promised to the Kickstarter backers was

1053
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:01,629
you know they can relive playing a

1054
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,460
classic adventures again kind of like

1055
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,559
you know that there was this game we

1056
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,720
made back in 1987 they've just been

1057
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:09,429
discovered right that they can relive it

1058
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,098
but but I think in a lot of ways it was

1059
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:14,879
more is more about us not to relive

1060
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:18,280
making it the the classic game again and

1061
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,930
you know I do love making you know game

1062
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,820
engines and adventure game images and

1063
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:23,500
that kind of stuff so so that that

1064
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,930
became a very enjoyable part of the

1065
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,030
whole process for me and so when you

1066
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:31,598
started building you know this this

1067
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:33,640
engine from for the new game what like

1068
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,010
and I guess it's a little bit difficult

1069
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:38,019
like I said you know I want to make sure

1070
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:43,089
I don't go too far over time or anything

1071
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:44,079
but like approaching that obviously

1072
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,730
there's a bunch of stuff that gets

1073
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,380
learned before this the I'm sorry after

1074
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,550
the stuff of maniac mansion right

1075
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,108
because you've got you went through your

1076
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,000
secret my key and secret Macallan to it

1077
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:53,319
and obviously there's other people also

1078
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,269
doing games like you know fate of

1079
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,250
Atlantis or something that are using

1080
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:58,570
your system so but the system itself is

1081
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,519
kind of growing and evolving so

1082
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,470
obviously what you just described and

1083
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:04,449
you know like you said triangular walk

1084
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:08,019
boxes or sorry trapezoidal lock boxes

1085
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:10,989
etcetera etcetera basically like you

1086
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:12,250
know from wherever that sort of ended in

1087
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:14,588
your wherever your thinking process

1088
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,940
ended and I guess maybe a humongous you

1089
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:18,338
maybe would have revisited a bunch of

1090
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:22,510
design ideas for internals there from

1091
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:24,730
that starting out now or is what you're

1092
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,560
building similar to the last thing you

1093
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,059
built that say humungous or something I

1094
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,170
don't know if that's the most current if

1095
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:30,429
that was like the most current

1096
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:34,088
architectural thinking that you've done

1097
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:35,440
the problem or whatever how similar is

1098
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:37,088
it would you say like how much is the

1099
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,280
same and how much of its different like

1100
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:40,500
what's what's the give me

1101
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,590
little ideas it's it's fairly similar

1102
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,170
okay you know I wanted you know I wanted

1103
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:48,059
the structure of the language to feel a

1104
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,730
lot like you know the structure okay

1105
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:52,529
this gum system had okay rooms are laid

1106
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,659
out and objects were laid out and

1107
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,730
objects had verbs and the way that the

1108
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:59,339
code for the verbs was embedded in the

1109
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:01,079
objects all that stuff I you know I felt

1110
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,050
would work really well for adventure

1111
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,840
game so I I definitely replicated you

1112
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:08,310
know all of that in the new system so

1113
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,320
I'm interested in one thing you said

1114
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:12,090
there the code for the verbs is embedded

1115
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,320
in the object so that means that when

1116
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:17,970
someone's designing something they

1117
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:19,950
design the I guess unpack that so don't

1118
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:22,139
know yet it's like well if you look at

1119
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:24,029
the code right you you would you would

1120
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:26,369
you know object and then you define an

1121
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,890
object object a front door okay

1122
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:30,809
curly brace yeah and then you'd have you

1123
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:32,789
know the name of the object and flags

1124
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:35,789
for the object and yeah variables for

1125
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:37,579
the object then inside of that you would

1126
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:40,980
then have a statement that says verb

1127
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:43,409
open okay curly brace and a bunch of

1128
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,719
code and a close brace so that was the

1129
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:48,599
code that got run when you opened the

1130
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,039
object okay that code got run and you

1131
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,179
know that that just always kind of made

1132
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:53,279
a lot of sense to me

1133
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:55,230
so closes structure it's sort of it's

1134
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,790
its own it's like a literal

1135
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,500
object-oriented programming like we

1136
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:00,449
literally have objects and they

1137
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,630
literally do encode the things they can

1138
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:05,730
do in reality in this game right if that

1139
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,369
makes sense yeah okay and so that's kind

1140
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:10,170
of just the the general idea when the

1141
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:11,969
designer script or whoever's coming in

1142
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,519
to do this particular presentation they

1143
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:16,769
think in terms of objects more in

1144
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,869
isolation in that way and is that so

1145
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:21,059
that you can make multiple is that is is

1146
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:23,670
it the standard maybe object-oriented I

1147
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:25,199
guess approach there where it's like the

1148
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,539
idea is that I can just code one door

1149
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,980
and and stamp them down or like why why

1150
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:30,960
do you like that I guess so what was the

1151
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:34,230
benefit I like that idea because it

1152
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,480
focuses kind of the the function of the

1153
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:39,780
thing in one place okay right if there's

1154
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,030
a a door or there's a key or there's a

1155
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:45,290
you know rubber chicken or whatever it

1156
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:46,910
just keeps everything compact together

1157
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:48,769
this is the rubber chicken of the pulley

1158
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:50,119
in the middle object right these are all

1159
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:52,039
the things that you can do with the

1160
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:55,819
object and the code is just right there

1161
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:57,800
close you know to it so it's basically

1162
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,180
like an organizational technique if you

1163
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,440
will it's like so at some level it

1164
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:02,210
doesn't actually matter whether the

1165
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,039
things embedded in this or not but it

1166
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,710
what does matter is I kind of want to

1167
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:08,449
know object all the things that can do

1168
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,699
because that's like sort of the way I

1169
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:13,579
want to look at this game thing right

1170
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:14,960
does that become like are there problems

1171
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:17,029
there because like thinking about like

1172
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,139
regular kind of code and maybe this

1173
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,930
doesn't happen as much in adventure

1174
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:22,309
games but like in in regular code you

1175
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:24,169
end up with problems where it's sort of

1176
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:26,179
the interaction between the objects is

1177
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,950
the complex part and so it's difficult

1178
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:29,599
to sort of partition it off into

1179
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:31,279
separate things is that not really a

1180
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,679
problem in adventure games or it is and

1181
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,480
I guess that's a question it's a problem

1182
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,549
I mean you know you're you're using

1183
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,500
objects with other objects and entries

1184
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:42,170
you know using key with the bit right

1185
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,090
and so you know you do have you know the

1186
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:47,269
door object and the key object at some

1187
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:48,800
point you know one of the twos use verb

1188
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:51,380
they're gonna get called and it's going

1189
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,690
to pass the you know the key into the

1190
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:57,440
doors use okay so you do you know you do

1191
00:42:53,690 --> 00:43:01,280
have to deal with all right but that on

1192
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,630
the whole doesn't isn't the like I guess

1193
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,510
what I'm saying is you're not so

1194
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:07,460
concerned about seeing the code

1195
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:09,410
organized that way like pairs of objects

1196
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,420
because that's the less common case I

1197
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:14,089
guess is that yeah I mean yeah I think

1198
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:20,059
about things as the object is the object

1199
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:23,030
and what can you not this was a four

1200
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:25,130
object area program I know I mean I

1201
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,110
don't think C++ it was anything more

1202
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,150
than a preprocessor at that time right

1203
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,680
so so I mean I didn't know anything

1204
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:37,599
about that that was just kind of the way

1205
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:41,359
that so you know working on the new game

1206
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,980
was there any big like and maybe the

1207
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,390
answer this is no because I guess you

1208
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,980
did have a lot of time to refine it

1209
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:47,420
since you know you actually did two

1210
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,860
whole company's worth I guess right you

1211
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,349
Lucas ones and the humongous ones what

1212
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,900
you both had an interpreter well I guess

1213
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:56,210
it's come both times but it's like your

1214
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,380
you know your evolves him your evolved

1215
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,599
scum I don't know what that

1216
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:03,349
some scum I've been evolving there it is

1217
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:06,950
it's wonderful so was there anything

1218
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:08,088
that you sat down on like the VM side of

1219
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:10,009
things or the scripting side of things

1220
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:13,429
was there anything that you went into it

1221
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:16,219
going you know yes I've done this a

1222
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:17,690
billion times but I really this time I

1223
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:19,818
kind of want to solve problem X we just

1224
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:21,170
never got it like was there anything

1225
00:44:19,818 --> 00:44:22,579
like that but you sat down thinking

1226
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,588
about or was it all the way just like no

1227
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,630
like we're pretty like I was pretty

1228
00:44:24,588 --> 00:44:28,068
happy with where we ended up you know at

1229
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,559
sort of like maybe at the end of the

1230
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:31,788
humungous titles I feel like I got most

1231
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:32,960
of the problems I want to solve or was

1232
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:35,210
there some things that you're just like

1233
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,278
this time I'm not gonna have problem

1234
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,449
extra this time I'm gonna fix this thing

1235
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:40,460
that always bothered me

1236
00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:43,098
does that make sense this question there

1237
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:45,798
was I don't think there was a big thing

1238
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:48,890
again you know I was trying to replicate

1239
00:44:45,798 --> 00:44:50,900
those yessuh games and I knew exactly

1240
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:52,969
what I needed to do to do that and I

1241
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,729
really did feel that the scum language

1242
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:57,288
did what it needed to do with that stuff

1243
00:44:55,728 --> 00:45:00,139
I mean there's you know the scum

1244
00:44:57,289 --> 00:45:02,180
language was compiled so you know you'd

1245
00:45:00,139 --> 00:45:03,650
make changes and you run a compiler and

1246
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:06,018
it would compile it and then you'd

1247
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:08,778
upload it you know now the compilation

1248
00:45:06,018 --> 00:45:10,399
just happens in the engine room right so

1249
00:45:08,778 --> 00:45:11,989
you with it there's a bunch of steps

1250
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,420
that have kind of been removed

1251
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:16,309
you know I no longer need a heap right

1252
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:19,159
because I basically have infinite memory

1253
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:22,400
you know it to work with so there's a

1254
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:24,318
bunch of things that are simpler to deal

1255
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,150
with but I always like the structure I

1256
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:28,548
like the way the multitasking work bents

1257
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:30,829
comment replicated all of that it just

1258
00:45:28,548 --> 00:45:32,509
it just it worked for me so so how did

1259
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:36,200
the multitasking work since come well

1260
00:45:32,509 --> 00:45:38,298
the monkey the multitasking with one

1261
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:40,728
scum you're they're basically scripts

1262
00:45:38,298 --> 00:45:42,798
which was a logistic functions right and

1263
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:45,288
and this is like we were saying in the

1264
00:45:42,798 --> 00:45:47,329
door if I have door open there's some

1265
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:48,829
code in here that would be sort of the

1266
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:51,170
type of thing we were talking about yes

1267
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:53,930
yeah so that's gonna execute in this

1268
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:55,818
commune right and but but the thing the

1269
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:58,098
thing that I you'll want to do with this

1270
00:45:55,818 --> 00:46:00,528
gun system was I wanted the objects to

1271
00:45:58,099 --> 00:46:04,160
be you know a little bit self-contained

1272
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:05,989
okay like if you know the clock needed

1273
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,848
to tick and it needed to move its little

1274
00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:09,949
pendulum yeah I just wanted to have a

1275
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,900
little piece of code that just moved

1276
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:13,969
right I didn't want to have to have a

1277
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,430
big state engine that you jumped into

1278
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:18,500
and you had to spawn out to all the

1279
00:46:16,429 --> 00:46:21,139
different pieces precisely I just wanted

1280
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,940
a little function so the one of the

1281
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:25,909
coolest things to me was the scum system

1282
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:29,059
had a do loop that had no until or while

1283
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:31,399
okay it was just do open brace close

1284
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:33,859
brace right and it would just run like

1285
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,599
right and so that script would just sit

1286
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:37,969
there and do whatever it needed to do

1287
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,260
and you could spawn off all these

1288
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:41,298
different scripts for all these

1289
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:43,520
different objects and really let the

1290
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:47,750
objects deal with themselves in a way

1291
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:50,719
and how do you do I mean I guess for the

1292
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:53,960
most part in in most circumstances

1293
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,608
you're describing these do loops I would

1294
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,349
know that I wouldn't have to execute one

1295
00:46:55,608 --> 00:46:58,848
if I'm not in the room with that object

1296
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:01,490
but I would imagine sometimes maybe I

1297
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:03,769
even do and so like how did you how do

1298
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:05,389
you manage the fact that we could have

1299
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:07,280
tons of objects doing do loops and which

1300
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:09,170
ones do I do now like what did that sort

1301
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,059
of look like I guess is that well there

1302
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,889
were two kinds of functions there were

1303
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:13,220
global functions and local functions

1304
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:15,348
okay

1305
00:47:13,219 --> 00:47:18,078
local functions were local to the room

1306
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:19,730
so when you left the room all of the

1307
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,470
threads running that were local

1308
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,940
functions just got killed killed right

1309
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:24,798
so you didn't have to manage that so

1310
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:30,500
only the global functions were the ones

1311
00:47:24,798 --> 00:47:31,940
that would and objects could implement

1312
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,710
global functions or local functions

1313
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,639
inside them so you gotta just say this

1314
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,769
is something has to happen all the time

1315
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:38,539
or something only happens when you're in

1316
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:40,699
the room with this particular object or

1317
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:42,650
whatever yeah like the clock ticking you

1318
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:44,568
only care about that I can see if the

1319
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,068
clock is there where another function

1320
00:47:44,568 --> 00:47:47,389
this may be you know waiting for the

1321
00:47:46,068 --> 00:47:49,279
shopkeeper to get back from looking

1322
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:51,139
regular swordmaster yes that's got to be

1323
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:56,329
a global function that's a surprise I

1324
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:58,068
see so all right so it's taking the

1325
00:47:56,329 --> 00:48:00,339
example that I asked before with the

1326
00:47:58,068 --> 00:48:02,779
walk system right the walk box and so on

1327
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:04,548
so tell me a little bit about your

1328
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,079
approach to that now right because like

1329
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,759
again at the time like we were saying

1330
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,068
like okay I got to make all the boxes

1331
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,559
and then we by hand put in like the

1332
00:48:10,068 --> 00:48:15,139
thing but the time you had gotten to say

1333
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,030
the like maybe the end of the loop sorts

1334
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:19,190
of slices say monkey Alan - were you

1335
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:21,500
still manually entering in the walk

1336
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,889
paths or did you already kind of yeah no

1337
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,440
we

1338
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:27,170
still manually okay so how about end of

1339
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,010
humungus we didn't we didn't have wok

1340
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:33,650
boxes because the characters in the

1341
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,810
humungous games they didn't really kind

1342
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:38,300
of walk around the rooms in the same I

1343
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:40,369
guess they kind of animated yeah yeah

1344
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,050
they were there were more animated stuff

1345
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:46,279
so they didn't really have to path fine

1346
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:47,930
okay so now in this game like I've even

1347
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,160
seen the videos assembly park with you

1348
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:51,319
walking the character round so obviously

1349
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:54,589
it is pathfinding guess so we have wok

1350
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:56,600
boxes yes so what do you still do wok

1351
00:48:54,590 --> 00:49:00,940
boxes do you still enter it manually no

1352
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:00,940
now I don't well I did for about a month

1353
00:49:01,059 --> 00:49:06,469
the first month I was manually remove

1354
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,900
myself a hand but yeah I mean the wok

1355
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:10,730
box is in you know in the in the new

1356
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,619
system for thimble we'd Park and there's

1357
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:15,260
still walk boxes but they can now just

1358
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:17,059
be incited polygons right right they

1359
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,680
don't have to be you know squares and

1360
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:21,769
trapezoids they can just be anything

1361
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:24,199
that we can really twist around yeah you

1362
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:26,239
know the objects and then you know at

1363
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:28,759
runtime you know you know it'll kind of

1364
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:33,919
split the you know those polygons up

1365
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:35,510
into okay so you like do a generic kind

1366
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,010
of polygon thing that you can make

1367
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:39,530
whatever you want right this is the

1368
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:42,350
walkable area and then we will go ahead

1369
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:44,510
and test light that for you and also

1370
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:46,789
figure out the connectivity that we used

1371
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:48,500
to by hand and then then from there the

1372
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:50,360
system is pretty similar yeah then it's

1373
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,980
it's actually very similar okay at that

1374
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,440
point you know the stuff that happens

1375
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:56,750
under the hood is it's just we've

1376
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:01,639
removed that that kind of human step

1377
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:02,690
that's just all done by robots all right

1378
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:05,569
so let me check how much time we got

1379
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:08,269
here I don't actually know so 518 I

1380
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:12,039
don't even know my handwriting is so bad

1381
00:50:08,269 --> 00:50:14,000
that I can't even read what I wrote down

1382
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:17,150
let's see yeah it's definitely not

1383
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,300
handwriting here oh this is five 20 it

1384
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:21,800
says I think we don't have to so correct

1385
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,150
me if I'm wrong but this was five thirty

1386
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,760
five that I was supposed to write down

1387
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:28,220
here right so we have we have easily

1388
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,470
probably twenty or thirty minutes left

1389
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:30,769
so this is this is pretty good okay all

1390
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:34,069
right

1391
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:35,539
so I guess

1392
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,010
I just kind of want to drill down in a

1393
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:38,329
couple things here that we sort of

1394
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:40,670
already talked about but that or there

1395
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:43,849
may be a little bit more a little bit

1396
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:46,039
more processing let's save so you now

1397
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:47,569
have a situation and I guess this would

1398
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:48,889
have been true for example going back to

1399
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,880
something like Secret of Monkey Island -

1400
00:50:48,889 --> 00:50:51,230
or something where you've actually have

1401
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,670
a fair number of people working on this

1402
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,980
game right so it's like there's a lot of

1403
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:56,960
rooms to create there's a lot of objects

1404
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,980
a lot of scripts to write that sort of

1405
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,570
stuff

1406
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:04,429
so what's the process like you know

1407
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:06,620
what's the toolset like for buildings is

1408
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:08,269
like like wok boxes for example right do

1409
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:10,309
you tend to do a lot of like rolling

1410
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:12,980
tools as necessary like was this a thing

1411
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:15,019
where you know I'm maybe maniac mansion

1412
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,340
I put in the coordinates by hand or

1413
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:17,719
something and then later on we make a

1414
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,100
tool for drawing like if you tell me a

1415
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:22,189
little bit about like the tooling up

1416
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:24,500
process as you sort of you know go

1417
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,240
through the various games especially

1418
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,860
because now I know you guys had like hot

1419
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,299
loading on a VAX or whatever I just want

1420
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,980
to know like like what did it actually

1421
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:33,440
look like to make this thing because you

1422
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,969
know there's a couple by the same token

1423
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,349
you were entering Lockbox things by hand

1424
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:38,449
so I have no idea I can't even guess

1425
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:39,409
where things would fall on your tooling

1426
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:41,599
level if that makes sense

1427
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:43,849
yeah we had you know by the time Monkey

1428
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,039
Island milk rolled around and and really

1429
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:47,599
that was because you bet that might be

1430
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:49,579
all rolled around will you know we were

1431
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,440
working on PCs okay we weren't working

1432
00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:54,259
on Commodores anymore so we had a lot

1433
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,869
more we weren't doing working on the fax

1434
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:02,000
machines at that point - we were doing

1435
00:51:56,869 --> 00:52:04,339
our coding and compiling on the PCs and

1436
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,630
were you still able to retain sort of

1437
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,059
the hot loading stuff when you move

1438
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,980
that's not as not as nicely really yeah

1439
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:10,219
yeah I mean a lot of that stuff went

1440
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,250
away

1441
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:14,750
does that develop you know not really

1442
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,610
just because there were so many other

1443
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:19,730
benefits okay when you're working on a

1444
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:23,120
Commodore 64 with 19km heat space yeah

1445
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:25,340
you know when you have suddenly 120 km

1446
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,859
deep space on a PC it's you know it's

1447
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,849
like Nirvana right so I think you're

1448
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,858
you're kind of

1449
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:36,048
to leave some of that stuff you know I'm

1450
00:52:30,858 --> 00:52:37,759
the right side so you know tool wise we

1451
00:52:36,048 --> 00:52:39,920
did have tools we we had our own

1452
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,900
animation tool that we did okay there

1453
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:48,409
was and we had our own character and

1454
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:51,108
ritual the tool that we laid out rooms

1455
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:57,889
was called flam everything followed the

1456
00:52:51,108 --> 00:52:59,960
scum okay like flam and mucus okay so

1457
00:52:57,889 --> 00:53:01,818
all right you know phlegm was the tool

1458
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,289
that you lay the rooms out in and you

1459
00:53:01,818 --> 00:53:05,268
know the basic who would bring the art

1460
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:07,670
in the all the art was done in D paint

1461
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:10,429
okay and so that would just bring in

1462
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:12,318
these you know lbm rooms in d paint and

1463
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:13,909
I would load him in and then you could

1464
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,518
go through you know with your cursor and

1465
00:53:13,909 --> 00:53:18,768
you would tag the objects on the screen

1466
00:53:16,518 --> 00:53:21,649
okay and you would lay down the lock

1467
00:53:18,768 --> 00:53:23,419
boxes so that was all done visually okay

1468
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,400
so there's basically like a markup

1469
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,289
process that happens in there and so

1470
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,389
what does that look like today so forth

1471
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:32,089
in building fit will be Park similar

1472
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:33,858
different I you know I I'm probably I

1473
00:53:32,088 --> 00:53:36,828
guess the most unoriginal person in the

1474
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:40,098
world I'd built a tool that you bring in

1475
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:42,680
Photoshop files and you mark objects and

1476
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:44,869
you lay down so it's it's like it is

1477
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:47,058
exactly the same process yeah it is well

1478
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:50,450
hey man if it works it works yeah okay

1479
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:52,460
and so what what sorts of stuff happened

1480
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:54,169
and and maybe the answer is people just

1481
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,969
got really good at it or what but what

1482
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,920
sort of stuff happened once you start

1483
00:53:55,969 --> 00:53:59,269
expanding even perhaps on me and Ike

1484
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,829
mansion I don't know but obviously it

1485
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:03,679
probably didn't have much of a much you

1486
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:05,869
could do about it but maybe later on you

1487
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,368
know that scripting sort of system and

1488
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:09,079
like the scummvm and all that stuff that

1489
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:11,329
you're starting to make a significant

1490
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:14,960
chunk of what happens in the game is

1491
00:54:11,329 --> 00:54:16,880
going through this system it becomes

1492
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,528
hard with no tools perhaps to debug

1493
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,479
problems like because we don't know you

1494
00:54:18,528 --> 00:54:22,639
know why did the clock stock ticking we

1495
00:54:20,478 --> 00:54:24,259
don't know right at what point or you

1496
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:25,969
know did you start having or did you

1497
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:27,739
ever have like tools for looking at that

1498
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:29,269
was there inspection that's our stuff

1499
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:31,190
how did like what what did that sort of

1500
00:54:29,268 --> 00:54:32,009
looked like yeah I mean once we didn't

1501
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:33,599
have the

1502
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:35,550
UNIX machines where we could yeah you

1503
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,559
know look at all the memory you know we

1504
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,910
had to do that on the PC okay so tell me

1505
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:40,920
a little of that so on the UNIX machines

1506
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:42,119
you would actually just sort of freeze

1507
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,220
the cameras to see for his execution

1508
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:46,529
mm-hmm and just you just inspect the

1509
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:49,349
memory respect the memory yeah okay that

1510
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:52,530
was that was pretty crude okay but by

1511
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:55,529
the time that the the PC version came

1512
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:57,660
about you know we all had kind of second

1513
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:59,040
monitors you know we bought like you

1514
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:01,769
know cheap black-and-white

1515
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:03,719
okay Achilles monitors okay and so we

1516
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:06,389
had you know the main PCB we had a

1517
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:08,819
secondary black-and-white monitor which

1518
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:09,779
we did all the debugging in okay and you

1519
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,970
know at that point we could do

1520
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,250
source-level debugger so you know we

1521
00:55:11,969 --> 00:55:15,809
could stop a we could single step in the

1522
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,550
source code would just show up on the

1523
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:19,079
secondary monitor and we could just you

1524
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:20,940
know through the lines in the source

1525
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:22,529
code so you actually had fairly ER

1526
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,809
that's on maniac mansion even know

1527
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:26,730
that's who never shipped on the PC yeah

1528
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:28,679
we never had that okay so that was on

1529
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:33,030
Monkey Island or that was that was

1530
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:36,539
started with Lulu's really the first

1531
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:38,010
full PC game okay and so at that point

1532
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:39,239
you guys decided hey we should probably

1533
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,770
have a debugger if it's tough there's so

1534
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:42,479
much it's hard to like actually figure

1535
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:46,309
out swinging on scripts let's do it here

1536
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,230
Simba we'd park thimble we'd park I

1537
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:51,179
don't have a source-level debugger no

1538
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:53,490
kind that's one thing I don't have that

1539
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:55,319
I hope to write you know someday so I

1540
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:56,969
can do that the debugging is a lot

1541
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,430
easier I mean the language is a lot more

1542
00:55:56,969 --> 00:56:01,889
dynamic so you know there's like a

1543
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:04,409
little little debug window which I can

1544
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:06,359
actually type in commands your actual

1545
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:09,059
language command I say you know call

1546
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,440
functions change variables and and you

1547
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:11,820
have some kind of dumping I assume so

1548
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:19,110
you like print out this object so you

1549
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:21,960
kind of it's back to printf okay so

1550
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:23,099
basically like in some sense now in

1551
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,510
thimble you park you rely and I guess

1552
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,289
that's typical like a top level or

1553
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:27,300
something like this to people called

1554
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:29,159
like the ability to typing code

1555
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,630
dynamically gives you the ability to

1556
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:32,069
sort of like okay well I can go in and

1557
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,930
if I'm wondering why something's doing

1558
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:35,160
something I can printouts in the state

1559
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:36,659
or I can also kind of twiddle with

1560
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,089
things and see if that you can choose

1561
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:40,679
what it was or you call functions can

1562
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:43,240
you kick their game into a certain state

1563
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:44,500
and do you do a lot of fun

1564
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:47,259
we park in terms of creating those

1565
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,880
scripts or do you like is that do you

1566
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:51,130
have people who are doing game scripting

1567
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,019
at is it is it more similar to like the

1568
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:54,309
monk down case right yeah and you're

1569
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:56,920
doing yeah there's one other person

1570
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:59,230
David Fox and you know it coincidentally

1571
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,240
he was the other scripture I mean II act

1572
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:02,530
mansion okay right so so it's exactly

1573
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:04,029
because yeah when it was the artist

1574
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,590
management right and I'm you're the

1575
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:07,300
management and scripting and David is

1576
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:13,360
doing the script it's like we're all

1577
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:15,220
just older and yeah so you he does

1578
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,650
probably the bulk of the scripting you

1579
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:20,019
know I my time is probably split between

1580
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:22,329
you know building the engine and doing

1581
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:25,030
scripting stuff although most of my

1582
00:57:22,329 --> 00:57:26,619
scripting tends to be more experimental

1583
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:28,480
stuff it's like I'll add some new

1584
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:30,550
feature and so I'll program a part of

1585
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,530
that and it needs that feature to see

1586
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:36,280
yeah we're David will then kind of go

1587
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:38,320
off and do more than that so are there

1588
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:41,350
any new features in the VM that you're

1589
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,880
using now there so that's built now that

1590
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:44,500
we're like very different from the

1591
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,390
scaling was there was there anything or

1592
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,400
is it like no no like it is basically

1593
00:57:46,389 --> 00:57:50,799
scum like I just kind of did you know a

1594
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,809
new take on the exact same thing or was

1595
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,340
there like have you experimented you say

1596
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:56,108
especially when we say experimental

1597
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,430
scripting for features are those just

1598
00:57:56,108 --> 00:57:58,539
features that used to be in scum that

1599
00:57:57,429 --> 00:57:59,889
you have an implant in yours yet or

1600
00:57:58,539 --> 00:58:01,630
those new features we're like I think it

1601
00:57:59,889 --> 00:58:03,819
would be nice if adventure games or

1602
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:05,950
players had this I mean there are a lot

1603
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,570
of new features just just to make you

1604
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:10,509
know in the language I've got coding

1605
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:11,920
things okay functions we can call you

1606
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:15,700
know the game is all kind of you know

1607
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:18,340
classic 8-bit you know art stuff except

1608
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:20,739
we have shaders okay and then do

1609
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:23,019
lighting okay so so the lights in the

1610
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:25,000
world actually project light okay out

1611
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:27,969
and they actually shade the characters

1612
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,909
as they walk ice engine and so you know

1613
00:58:27,969 --> 00:58:32,038
there's stuff like that this kind of new

1614
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:34,199
and you know so you know I create

1615
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:35,940
commands in the language to be able to

1616
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:37,318
control the lights because I see the

1617
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,900
lights to be able to blink on them all

1618
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:42,929
these other things so it's just tying

1619
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,940
you know all of these new you know

1620
00:58:42,929 --> 00:58:46,739
features that we have in the engine back

1621
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,858
into the scripting language and how all

1622
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:51,479
that kind of stuff works but what if the

1623
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:53,250
charm of old adventure games was that

1624
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,639
they didn't have lighting you're getting

1625
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,380
Europe

1626
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:57,960
you're ruining that one you know you

1627
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:00,450
never know right it's like I guess there

1628
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:03,500
was some though I guess when I when I

1629
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:06,838
did the Kickstarter it's like my goal

1630
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:09,630
was it wasn't to make a classic

1631
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:11,788
adventure game the way they were yeah it

1632
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:14,490
was to make a classic adventure game the

1633
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:17,010
way you remember them okay right because

1634
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:19,889
people don't remember those games

1635
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:22,260
exactly like they were right they they

1636
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:24,960
kind of extrapolate the graphics out to

1637
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:26,910
much better than they realize it and so

1638
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,630
I wanted to be able to kind of remain

1639
00:59:26,909 --> 00:59:32,879
true and pure to the 8-bit stuff I see

1640
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:34,798
but I'm not opposed to using shaders I

1641
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,960
see it's a really nice you know subtle

1642
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,670
lighting effects on everything because I

1643
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,909
think that's the way people remembered

1644
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:44,190
those game okay and that makes sense so

1645
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:46,798
it's kind of like saying we're trying to

1646
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:49,048
we're trying to reproduce your memory of

1647
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,400
Monkey Island not the actual Monkey

1648
00:59:49,048 --> 00:59:51,719
Island because the Accu Monkey Island

1649
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,269
you might be like ah that doesn't look

1650
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:56,219
so good exactly so we want to take that

1651
00:59:54,269 --> 00:59:58,259
away so it's got a walk I guess almost

1652
00:59:56,219 --> 01:00:00,808
like a fine line between it can't look

1653
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:02,278
like a completely modern game because

1654
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:04,170
then it obviously isn't Monkey Island

1655
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:05,579
but we can't go all the way back to

1656
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,930
exactly what it looked like because it's

1657
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:09,210
too far so you're kind of like in this

1658
01:00:06,929 --> 01:00:12,269
middle ground of trying to like nail

1659
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:13,798
what did you remember is the feeling is

1660
01:00:12,269 --> 01:00:15,929
this feeling feeling of dying those

1661
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:18,719
games and and you know we can certainly

1662
01:00:15,929 --> 01:00:20,730
do a little more with the hardware you

1663
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,828
know I can actually do scaling you know

1664
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:27,059
through the GPU and I can do stuff like

1665
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:28,470
that now that what's your approach been

1666
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:30,930
- this is kind of a little off topic but

1667
01:00:28,469 --> 01:00:32,548
I just kind of realized I hadn't even

1668
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:35,699
written this down what's your approach

1669
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:37,530
been to music over time because I feel

1670
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:40,348
like you know

1671
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:43,619
in in sort of the I want to say monkey

1672
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:45,750
island to maybe it kind of had very very

1673
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:47,550
advanced interactive music for its time

1674
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:50,130
period right I'm used system yeah the

1675
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:52,920
I'm use thing and and then like I don't

1676
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:55,079
really know what you guys did with the

1677
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,400
humongous titles necessarily because a

1678
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:58,980
lot of those actually featured more

1679
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,450
heavily sort of recorded like produces

1680
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:03,000
stuff which couldn't probably be so

1681
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:03,960
interactive but what's your what was

1682
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,858
your feeling about those such there was

1683
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,750
that something you really weren't that

1684
01:01:04,858 --> 01:01:07,889
interested in anyway and maybe some

1685
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,210
other people went off and did it or did

1686
01:01:07,889 --> 01:01:11,009
you care a lot about the music and

1687
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:12,900
what's your approach to it now can you

1688
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:14,160
give me yeah like I said this was never

1689
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,809
on the list but I just kind of thought

1690
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:17,899
of it and I was like should ask well I

1691
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:19,828
mean the I'm you system which did

1692
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:22,349
probably one of the most amazing

1693
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:25,260
interactive music systems I've ever seen

1694
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:27,150
okay and it was it was amazing and I was

1695
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:30,630
incredible to work and it was it was

1696
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:33,750
time-consuming we had you know one whole

1697
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:35,910
game scripter who did nothing but look

1698
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:38,219
in all the music really for stuff for

1699
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:40,920
mochi I own too so you know it was

1700
01:01:38,219 --> 01:01:44,909
intensive to do that kind of stuff but I

1701
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:47,130
mean is really became not possible with

1702
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,629
the whole digital revolution of stuff

1703
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:50,519
because I'm use was still just playing

1704
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:53,190
maybe steel and MIDI cards or whatever

1705
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:55,949
and when digital music hit the scene it

1706
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:59,010
really couldn't you couldn't do what I'm

1707
01:01:55,949 --> 01:02:01,379
used it anymore and and so I think it

1708
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:04,319
just kind of lost a little bit of that

1709
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:06,869
stuff but you know music the music in

1710
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:09,690
thimble we Park I kind of described as

1711
01:02:06,869 --> 01:02:12,450
fully modern I'm not a big fan of like

1712
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:15,599
chip tunes and I'm not a fan of that

1713
01:02:12,449 --> 01:02:19,679
stuff and and so I just I felt like

1714
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:22,740
music kind of embodies such a kind of an

1715
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:25,379
emotional tone fair game that I really

1716
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:29,429
just wanted the music to be to be full

1717
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:32,490
and really nice and do you think that

1718
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:34,889
like so is that something that's kind of

1719
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:37,379
missing nowadays in some sense would you

1720
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:39,598
say like your description of the I'm use

1721
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:41,849
system or or I guess the results of the

1722
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,950
IBEW system and having gone to digital

1723
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:45,599
and sort of losing most of that is that

1724
01:02:43,949 --> 01:02:47,039
something that you think we kind of need

1725
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,500
to get back at some point like as a

1726
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,849
technological problem like what or do

1727
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,590
you think the games don't really suffer

1728
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:54,299
much from not having that technology

1729
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:56,070
like what's what's your take on it as

1730
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,490
someone who's made games with and

1731
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:04,590
without yeah I I think really sadly I

1732
01:02:59,489 --> 01:03:06,929
think music is kind of ignored and it's

1733
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:08,579
it's too bad that it is I mean I'm not a

1734
01:03:06,929 --> 01:03:10,980
music person I don't know nothing about

1735
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:13,259
music sorry I could not I do not play an

1736
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:16,619
instrument I couldn't name the notes I

1737
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:18,210
tell you right so you know I kind of

1738
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:20,369
entrust that there are other people that

1739
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:21,990
do that kind of stuff very well but I

1740
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:25,019
really enjoyed working with I am you

1741
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:27,569
system I enjoy kind of interactive music

1742
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:29,340
you know the in the music the thing

1743
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,590
about the music in monkey on the - and

1744
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:33,720
the immune system was that was one

1745
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:35,280
continuous piece of music yes from the

1746
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:38,129
time the game started until the game

1747
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:41,190
ended and but as you kind of move

1748
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:43,320
through the world it just slowly changed

1749
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:45,030
to match the different rooms you were in

1750
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,010
the different areas of the game you ran

1751
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:49,830
and it was just it was seamless and

1752
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:52,470
flawless and I missed that yeah I miss I

1753
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:55,199
like having that that non-stop music

1754
01:03:52,469 --> 01:03:57,149
going on but it does need to emotionally

1755
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:59,309
change as you work your way through the

1756
01:03:57,150 --> 01:04:02,519
world and it just needs to happen very

1757
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:04,079
subtly so you don't realize that so

1758
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:05,369
what's your approach in timbal we Park

1759
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,949
to this we just kind of blend between

1760
01:04:05,369 --> 01:04:09,630
yeah I mean the pieces were the approach

1761
01:04:07,949 --> 01:04:11,939
that we're using the tempo we park as

1762
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:13,980
the musician is writing a whole lot of

1763
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:17,010
these little ten-second little pieces of

1764
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:20,219
music and he's writing them so they can

1765
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:22,620
chain so the end of one piece can chain

1766
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:25,409
to the beginning of you know virtually

1767
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:28,559
any other piece and I just have these

1768
01:04:25,409 --> 01:04:31,349
pools of music and I can just switch

1769
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:33,779
pools and so the most that you'll lag is

1770
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:36,690
ten seconds well it kind of finishes one

1771
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:38,790
piece and then transitions into another

1772
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:41,220
piece so we can do just kind of

1773
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:42,989
wall-to-wall me that's not that far off

1774
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:44,669
from my muse then it's time you sense

1775
01:04:42,989 --> 01:04:46,769
it's not I mean it's getting some of it

1776
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:50,780
but I'm you'd do it on a note by note

1777
01:04:46,769 --> 01:04:50,780
basis right we're here

1778
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:55,439
but that 10 seconds but so in some sense

1779
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:57,960
you are I guess trying to sort of

1780
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,250
recapture that same feel because

1781
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,869
obviously you know you could have done

1782
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:01,980
something worse like I fade one out and

1783
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:04,710
fade the other one in right so you're

1784
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:06,269
you're actually kind of going to a

1785
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:07,889
certain distance that actually minigames

1786
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:09,358
don't go like minigames actually will

1787
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:10,679
not have music that can change in that

1788
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:13,739
way they just kind of like fade in and

1789
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:15,719
out things or it's what we're trying I

1790
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:16,949
don't know how successful I'll be but I

1791
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:18,539
mean there's a lot of work for the

1792
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:21,419
musician right yes he has to make sure

1793
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:24,300
that that a whole bunch of pieces yeah

1794
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:27,119
kind of chain into other pieces too much

1795
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:29,670
abruptness yeah kind of carry over it's

1796
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,200
a lot of work on his part yeah all right

1797
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:32,608
well that's actually very interesting I

1798
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:34,500
didn't know that let's see let's see how

1799
01:05:32,608 --> 01:05:35,608
we're doing on time so I think we're

1800
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,800
kind of getting to where we should

1801
01:05:35,608 --> 01:05:40,650
probably start wrapping up I think I got

1802
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:44,070
actually most of the things that I

1803
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:47,820
wanted to ask but I will point out the

1804
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:51,140
fact that earlier in the day when Mike

1805
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:54,420
Acton was up here he wanted to know if

1806
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:56,940
creating cut scenes had always been a

1807
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:59,309
problem and he wanted to hear that from

1808
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:01,409
the person who did you guys even coined

1809
01:05:59,309 --> 01:06:02,969
that phrase yes I want to say you're

1810
01:06:01,409 --> 01:06:05,848
like the people who introduced the

1811
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:07,949
phrase cuts in history so tell me a

1812
01:06:05,849 --> 01:06:10,320
little well first we might as well since

1813
01:06:07,949 --> 01:06:12,679
this is this is entirely self-indulgent

1814
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:15,330
for me tell me how that comes about like

1815
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:17,509
games don't have cutscenes and now they

1816
01:06:15,329 --> 01:06:19,619
do what what happened I mean games had

1817
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:21,750
interstitials yeah games had little

1818
01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:24,660
canned animated sequences that was not

1819
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:25,739
something we created the word cutscene

1820
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:27,719
yeah that was something that we

1821
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:33,000
definitely coined and and it came from

1822
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:35,179
in maniac mansion you be playing the

1823
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,460
game and the game would literally just

1824
01:06:35,179 --> 01:06:40,199
cut away and show you what was happening

1825
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,059
in doctor friend's lab and Merced in his

1826
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:44,699
room or weird Ed's room or something and

1827
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:45,929
I mean it did it very crudely in the

1828
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:48,899
fact that there was just a little timer

1829
01:06:45,929 --> 01:06:50,699
running and you know when 18 minutes

1830
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:52,260
expired it was just no matter what you

1831
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:54,329
were doing right you could be writable

1832
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:56,010
of solving some really important puzzle

1833
01:06:54,329 --> 01:06:59,159
and we just cut away gotcha

1834
01:06:56,010 --> 01:07:00,720
and so they were scenes that cut away

1835
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:03,118
from the game yes they were called

1836
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:05,068
cutscenes and there was even a

1837
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,778
and in the scum language called cutscene

1838
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:09,088
okay and it was it was very

1839
01:07:06,778 --> 01:07:11,219
sophisticated command in that when you'd

1840
01:07:09,088 --> 01:07:13,498
run a cutscene it would kind of save the

1841
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:15,239
game state away right go off and do the

1842
01:07:13,498 --> 01:07:16,828
cutscene and when the cutscene ended it

1843
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:18,239
would just automatically restore the

1844
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:20,910
game state to where you might save

1845
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:23,518
before so it kind of takes the vm state

1846
01:07:20,909 --> 01:07:25,139
at this time dumps it go load this

1847
01:07:23,518 --> 01:07:26,608
entire state and then as soon as we're

1848
01:07:25,139 --> 01:07:28,230
done it's kind of like a you know an

1849
01:07:26,608 --> 01:07:29,369
excursion if you will where it's like

1850
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:31,079
and then we're just gonna like full-on

1851
01:07:29,369 --> 01:07:32,789
romp over that with the new thing yes

1852
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:34,499
okay okay so that's actually probably

1853
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:35,819
one of the harder things to implement in

1854
01:07:34,498 --> 01:07:37,588
scum because everything has to work

1855
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:39,900
right through that well that was I mean

1856
01:07:37,588 --> 01:07:44,608
that was definitely a sophisticated yeah

1857
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:46,889
yeah really powerful so Mike wants to

1858
01:07:44,608 --> 01:07:48,748
know where cutscenes always a foul like

1859
01:07:46,889 --> 01:07:50,278
like our cut seat where cutscenes I

1860
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:52,139
guess implementing them was but I mean

1861
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:54,298
for the artist creating them and that

1862
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:58,108
sort of stuff no no they weren't they

1863
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:59,608
weren't a problem okay because you're

1864
01:07:58,108 --> 01:08:01,828
doing something wrong I don't know what

1865
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:08,548
to say but somewhere between Monkey

1866
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:11,039
Island they weren't a problem because

1867
01:08:08,548 --> 01:08:13,528
they were all hand coded right right

1868
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:16,619
then we didn't have a tool that we built

1869
01:08:13,528 --> 01:08:18,810
these cutscenes on if we needed their

1870
01:08:16,619 --> 01:08:20,488
Sedna to walk around the room while she

1871
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:22,679
was saying something we literally had

1872
01:08:20,488 --> 01:08:25,138
code that walked her here then water

1873
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:27,658
there so we didn't have that came that

1874
01:08:25,139 --> 01:08:29,609
seemed you know ask that export problem

1875
01:08:27,658 --> 01:08:31,259
that you know cutscenes have today

1876
01:08:29,609 --> 01:08:33,719
because you know they're coming out of

1877
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:36,119
these big tools is that so I should ask

1878
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:37,198
that actually about the sort of we

1879
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:39,988
talked about the multi processing thing

1880
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:42,419
and creating cutscenes that sort of

1881
01:08:39,988 --> 01:08:43,858
stuff because my recollection again and

1882
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:46,408
it's been a very long time I guess since

1883
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:49,199
I played it but my recollection even

1884
01:08:46,408 --> 01:08:50,729
even in Monkey Island but I think almost

1885
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,250
certainly in muck down to there were

1886
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:54,869
definitely places where the the and

1887
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,338
putting away sort of what your

1888
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:57,448
definition of cutscene was there

1889
01:08:56,338 --> 01:08:59,130
there are definitely places where

1890
01:08:57,448 --> 01:09:01,528
scripted sorts of things happened in

1891
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:03,210
conjunction with the player still having

1892
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:05,880
the freedom to do things right so there

1893
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:08,130
were times when something relatively

1894
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:11,130
elaborate like this guy is gonna go walk

1895
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:12,600
off the screen and go somewhere we you

1896
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:14,619
didn't actually freeze the entire

1897
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,990
players ability to do stuff I remember

1898
01:09:14,619 --> 01:09:18,399
there being some concurrency there even

1899
01:09:16,989 --> 01:09:19,539
like I said as early as monkey on and

1900
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,869
maybe that's my memory being bad but

1901
01:09:19,539 --> 01:09:24,489
that's my that's correct

1902
01:09:21,869 --> 01:09:26,800
what did that kind of look like at that

1903
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:28,569
time because you know that's sort of a

1904
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,590
really hard problem especially you know

1905
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:31,090
again when you're talking about a very

1906
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:33,310
limited system that has a lot of

1907
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:34,810
constraints to even just do the basic

1908
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:36,070
stuff it does now we're talking about

1909
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:38,470
sort of this sort of thing that was like

1910
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:39,549
you know half-life 2 was struggling to

1911
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:42,400
do these sorts of things right so we're

1912
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:43,750
talking about how do we have the ability

1913
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:46,059
to script something that has to happen

1914
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:47,770
but we don't really know what the player

1915
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,700
was doing at this time was that

1916
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:50,200
something you guys thought a lot about

1917
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:51,309
or was it just because hey we tried to

1918
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:53,529
keep it so that really wouldn't be a

1919
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:54,610
problem or what like what was that leg

1920
01:09:53,529 --> 01:09:55,869
at a time because that must have been

1921
01:09:54,609 --> 01:09:57,639
that was a really early attempt to do

1922
01:09:55,869 --> 01:09:59,199
something like this and you know it went

1923
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,030
surprisingly well it's a really hard

1924
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:04,899
problem yeah because you know I think

1925
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:07,960
players intrinsically just want to

1926
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:11,139
up everything you do ok they just do

1927
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:12,789
yeah and so you know it's it's it's it's

1928
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,500
not that we could have the scene where

1929
01:10:12,789 --> 01:10:15,880
you know you're following the shopkeeper

1930
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:18,729
into the forest to find the swordmaster

1931
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:20,650
we really couldn't plan that the player

1932
01:10:18,729 --> 01:10:22,750
was going to do exactly what we wanted

1933
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:24,399
them to do yes follow behind him yeah

1934
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:26,079
stay in the back

1935
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:28,149
no it's not what players do when players

1936
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:30,189
want to run up in front of him yeah well

1937
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:31,449
other things so yeah I mean we had we

1938
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:33,579
had to do with it we had to deal with

1939
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:35,439
all that stuff and I think you know the

1940
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:37,989
way we solved a lot of that stuff is is

1941
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:39,669
you just cheat as much as you can okay

1942
01:10:37,989 --> 01:10:42,069
you know so when the when the shopkeeper

1943
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:43,840
is walking from his store to the certain

1944
01:10:42,069 --> 01:10:46,630
master he's not literally walking

1945
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:50,260
through those rooms right he he walks to

1946
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:51,940
the door and he leaves and then we just

1947
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:53,770
kind of do a little bit of timer stuff

1948
01:10:51,939 --> 01:10:56,559
there's just a timer running and so when

1949
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:59,140
you walk into the next room we just put

1950
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:02,110
the shopkeeper close to the exit and

1951
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:04,480
just have him walk off this possibly

1952
01:11:02,109 --> 01:11:06,250
camera and if the timer had went went

1953
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:07,839
too far then you just lost them you

1954
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,489
didn't appear ice it's just it's all

1955
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,800
about just creating weird little

1956
01:11:09,489 --> 01:11:13,449
shortcuts and cheating your way through

1957
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,400
the problem as much as you can

1958
01:11:13,449 --> 01:11:18,880
well I think we are just about out of

1959
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:20,439
time yet we are so thank you so much

1960
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,819
that was like that was extremely

1961
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:24,149
enjoyable don't feel like so many things

1962
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,149
I
