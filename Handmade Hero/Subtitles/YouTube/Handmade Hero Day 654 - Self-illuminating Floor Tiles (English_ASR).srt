1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
everyone and welcome to handmade hero

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,480
today we are going to uh just i wanted

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,120
to

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,359
we began to decide last weekend

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,079
that i didn't want to push the lighting

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,160
any further i think we can do more uh

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,160
and someday might do more but i think

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,640
it's looking quite nice now

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,640
and i think we can finish you know we

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
could basically finish the game with

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,000
this level of lighting quality um

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,080
because it looks nice and it shows us a

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,280
reasonable version of what we could

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,679
expect uh from any like final lighting

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,000
system i mean it looks really nice in my

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,920
opinion uh and you could balance the

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
game art this way

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,200
uh and then if you improve a few things

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,039
like there are some things you could

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,760
improve like the main thing is the

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,520
squariness here uh if we did improve

22
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,839
some of that someday i don't think

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,000
that's going to be a material issue for

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,120
us meaning i don't think we have to

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,960
really worry uh about that suddenly

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,558
radically changing the look of the game

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,799
in some way that causes us to have to go

28
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,319
back and redo a bunch of work

29
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,640
or anything like that

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,639
so my feeling is we could sort of leave

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,840
it here uh and not really go any further

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,079
uh with you know not really

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,840
go any further down the rabbit hole of

34
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,759
improving the lighting because it's now

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,000
quite nice i had originally said oh

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,280
maybe we'll just regress and not use the

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
advanced lighting but then when we

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,680
actually looked at just switching it to

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
2d it it really does work quite nicely

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,159
and looks great so i have no

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,920
i really have no concerns about that and

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,680
i'm i'm totally happy uh with it i

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,200
and you know i think there's some minor

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,560
improvements we could make in the future

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,399
to it but that's fine so i think it's

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,399
time to concentrate on other stuff which

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,478
is just like finishing up some world gen

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
stuff cleaning up that code and now like

49
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,599
we've decided we're not really going to

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,439
do 3d

51
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,839
uh so what that means is we'll be doing

52
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,758
2d tiles of

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,280
everything and so when you go down you

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,118
really be doing like a binding of isaac

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,239
go down where you like it teleports you

56
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,078
down right

57
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,519
uh and so in order to do that we're

58
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,879
going to want to

59
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,078
change the world generator to not really

60
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,679
use a z

61
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,799
um and so that's the one thing that i

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,439
want to do uh coming up next

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,400
before doing that because i know that i

64
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,000
want to do so i would like to be able to

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
have the

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,639
these tiles light up

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,280
and right now i don't actually think

68
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,598
that i have a way to say that some one

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,640
of these is self-illuminating

70
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:31,840
right

71
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,559
um

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,560
you know what i'm saying to you

73
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,200
so i don't actually know

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,719
um

75
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,560
if we have a way to do that and i would

76
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,400
like to do that right so that's the main

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,759
thing that i want to do

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,159
is make sure that i can do that because

79
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,598
i know that i need to use that and so

80
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,919
what we're gonna do is we're just gonna

81
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,000
go into the system and figure out what

82
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,518
has to happen uh it's really an input

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,680
side issue i don't think the lighting

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,519
system cares particularly much but when

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
the lighting system is basically parsing

86
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,319
what gets sent down to it uh that is

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
really the thing that uh that i wanted

88
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,079
to fix right

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,158
uh and so what i'd like to do is make

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,440
sure that that can be sent down

91
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,719
and uh and then after that we'll move on

92
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,039
and i don't know if we'll we probably

93
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,318
won't finish uh we probably won't we

94
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,519
might finish the lighting thing today

95
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,958
but we don't think we'll quite probably

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,200
have enough time to start the world gen

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,199
stuff but that's our agenda

98
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,439
so

99
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,199
so there you go

100
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,719
um also at some point we need to turn

101
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,359
off lighting like

102
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,680
this is going through the uh um this is

103
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
going through the uh the lighting system

104
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,080
which is not

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,560
good right um like our cut scene is

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,480
going to look like like absolute garbage

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,158
uh because it's going through the the

108
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,399
whole thing with lighting and filmic

109
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,878
response curves and stuff but these were

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
already balanced so that is you know we

111
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,318
probably need a way to turn that off at

112
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,598
some point it's not a high priority

113
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:05,039
right now but like yeah that's not um

114
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:08,639
that is not looking good right um

115
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:11,039
not not great not great guys

116
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,639
so anyway uh

117
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,280
if we look at what happens in the

118
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,358
lighting system when we

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,000
need to send down the

120
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,519
information for how lights are working

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,519
uh we currently have in the renderer you

122
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,439
know the primitives we have i think are

123
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,198
just not

124
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,639
really going to encode this

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,040
i think um and i again i like i'm not

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,199
really sure but when we actually send

127
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,360
down because it's been a long time right

128
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,199
like you know we only work on things

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,960
very sporadically on handmade heroes so

130
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,800
it's like you know it's not really in my

131
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,959
head most of the time

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,960
uh so when we actually send stuff down

133
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,359
you know we've got this sort of we

134
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,079
basically have like this this render you

135
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
know

136
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,639
uh

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,360
it's not really command buffer per se

138
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,519
it's sort of a command buffer light

139
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,400
um and we just kind of send down you

140
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,959
know what we're going to be doing

141
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,159
i i guess i actually split that off now

142
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,159
that i think about it um

143
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,719
did i not

144
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,879
yeah

145
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,159
so in here you can see i actually split

146
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,159
it off from the platform api because

147
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,400
it's its own thing now but you can see

148
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,199
on here that we have like

149
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,120
this sort of render group

150
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,520
that we use to submit things and it

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,800
basically fills out one of these render

152
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,038
entry textured quad things right

153
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
and the render entry texture quad thing

154
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,879
is really what draws everything it's a

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,520
quad count and it has vertices and

156
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,240
indices and it says what the textures

157
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,799
are

158
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,000
um that are going to be used you know

159
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,280
what i'm saying

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,600
uh and and that's really how the entire

161
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,638
thing works

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,560
the

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:02,400
vertex array offset right the vertices

164
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,399
that are being sent down

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,000
they are the things that encode like the

166
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,120
variance like the color variability

167
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,360
right uh and so in here

168
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,038
the first thing i don't really know is

169
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,800
what we did so

170
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,959
somewhere we actually do have something

171
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,840
that allows us to do

172
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,318
stuff that's lit right

173
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,159
and like stuff that that

174
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,680
doesn't respond to lighting that's like

175
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,199
um

176
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,079
doesn't respond to the light responded

177
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,079
is kind of the wrong word

178
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,800
we must be sending down something that

179
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,319
allows you to sort of self-illuminate

180
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,919
because that's presumably how the cut

181
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,600
scenes are working right

182
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:42,959
meaning when you go to the handmade

183
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,439
cutscene thing

184
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,799
um and this is sending down

185
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,399
whatever kind of quads you know it's

186
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,120
sending down

187
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,519
um i believe that what's happening here

188
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,680
like when we do push bitmap

189
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,159
is like we're encoding something that

190
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,319
says you don't need to light this thing

191
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,439
or or it shouldn't just be lit normally

192
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,199
and so that's the thing we have to go

193
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:07,279
see what we did there

194
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,199
um i'm guessing it has something to do

195
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,879
well the the healthy parameter was we

196
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,520
actually used so i don't know it must be

197
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,038
it must just be something we

198
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,198
do

199
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,439
for the entire set like if you don't

200
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
turn lighting on

201
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,360
or something like that right so let's go

202
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,520
take a look and see if we can reverse

203
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,080
engineer what the heck we did there uh

204
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,079
because i'm assuming we just it it turns

205
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,159
off for the it turns off for the entire

206
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,758
thing or something like that

207
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,280
uh so let's take a look so when we're

208
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,960
actually rendering

209
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,159
these command buffers that we send

210
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,758
through

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,599
uh pretty much everything goes through

212
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,520
this as far as i know

213
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,759
uh we only you know we basically just

214
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,279
have one big batch uh and that's it

215
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,720
we've got some of the things here like

216
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,318
you know we've got these depth peels and

217
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,599
stuff that we do but everything that we

218
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,598
actually render just goes through this

219
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,759
one path it's this path right here

220
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,079
where it just says like all right uh

221
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,160
send down all these vertices and go to

222
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,399
town you know what i'm saying

223
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,400
um

224
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,879
this one we use for cut scene stuff

225
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,520
this one we use for like texture rays

226
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,520
you know what i'm saying

227
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,759
as i blow my nose

228
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,478
um so

229
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,240
what we need to do now

230
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,399
is figure out

231
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,918
what we want to

232
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,120
what we want to use here for an

233
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,958
indication that something should be

234
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,720
self-illuminating

235
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,719
and it looks like

236
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,039
it looks like the lighting is always

237
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,319
sent down

238
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,519
here

239
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,200
that's the the actual updated lighting

240
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,519
and then in terms of whether it's turned

241
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,519
on or not

242
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,919
you know i i don't see anything here

243
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,120
that indicates that it gets turned on or

244
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,679
not though

245
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,919
so that's a little confusing

246
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,919
um

247
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,360
hmm

248
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,360
so yeah again i'm not really sure

249
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,320
i'm not really sure what's going on

250
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,320
there so let's take a look at the shader

251
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,838
what gets sent to the shader

252
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,320
so in the shader

253
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,720
i mean there's not much there right the

254
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,720
inputs

255
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,120
aha so there is one float 32 called

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,120
vertex emission

257
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,039
vertex emission

258
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,879
comes down through to frag emission

259
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,000
emission

260
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,399
so we are

261
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,078
actually sending this down or we claim

262
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,399
to be and maybe we added it to the

263
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,679
shader but didn't actually send it down

264
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,360
that's possible although the fact that

265
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,919
the cutscenes appear to be

266
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
self-illuminating would suggest that

267
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,439
maybe we do

268
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,800
so that's

269
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,240
that's a good question and i don't know

270
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,120
the answer to that question

271
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,200
uh anyway so if we look at where does

272
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,560
the fragmizion

273
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,879
uh where does fragmizion actually

274
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:42,719
get used

275
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:46,240
okay so what happens is we

276
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,240
we take the surface reflectance

277
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,120
and we pretend that if the frag emission

278
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,639
is sent down as you know basically it's

279
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,120
sent down as a linear interpolant

280
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,559
between whatever the lighting actually

281
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,278
is at this point and fulbright

282
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,679
so

283
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,120
i guess that

284
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,319
i guess that makes

285
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,200
sense i'm fine with that

286
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,200
uh yeah

287
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,360
i don't have a problem with that so the

288
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,879
problem though is that we do

289
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,800
we kind of have two things we're trying

290
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,799
to do here one is emission

291
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,920
one is emisian

292
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,078
uh

293
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,559
that is trying to be like

294
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,559
for the

295
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,720
what one is trying to be like the

296
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,839
cutscene emisian

297
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,519
and the other is if we just want like an

298
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,279
actual light

299
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,959
that is in the world

300
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:52,799
and the reason that i say that we kind

301
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:57,838
of have two different things

302
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:59,599
is an emissive source should come from

303
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,120
uh

304
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,120
the same pipeline as the rest of the

305
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,480
world rendering so it will go through

306
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,480
the filmic response curve right

307
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,039
but a cut scene

308
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,079
piece should not

309
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,958
and so the question is do we want to try

310
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,399
and

311
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,399
have like a

312
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,319
do we want to try and have this be more

313
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,440
of just a switch like hey there's two

314
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,440
different things you can do here

315
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,959
and and honestly i think that might be

316
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,959
the right

317
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,559
tax

318
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,000
so there's a couple of things that we

319
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,879
have to think about

320
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,078
um

321
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,879
one is are we ever going to want

322
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,278
textured self-illumination

323
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,159
normally the answer would always be yes

324
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:17,360
but in this case because we don't really

325
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,919
do complicated art in this game you know

326
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,120
it's kind of an art minimal sort of game

327
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,559
i don't know the way we're going to do

328
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,159
that because that would require having

329
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,278
some kind of an art processing pipeline

330
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,759
where we actually have a way of

331
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,360
producing information like that

332
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,000
like normal maps and self-illumination

333
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,639
all that garbage right

334
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,320
i so i don't know that the input is ever

335
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,519
going to be there for self-illumination

336
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,760
which would mean that it would be a

337
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,759
waste of time to do textured

338
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,879
self-illumination and if there

339
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,198
isn't going to be textured

340
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:48,159
self-illumination then it suggests that

341
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:50,799
really all we have is we're trying to

342
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:54,639
light something up

343
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:57,439
uniformly the whole thing whatever it is

344
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,759
lights up together right

345
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,760
um

346
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,880
and if that was the case you can see why

347
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,639
i'm considering this if that's the case

348
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,720
then you could just have frag emission

349
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,839
could just tell us one of two things it

350
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,000
could say

351
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,519
either we want to

352
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,480
do emission through the acs film curve

353
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,198
or

354
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
it could say we want to do emission

355
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,319
uh

356
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,320
that's just like cutscene it's just

357
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,320
direct

358
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:34,879
ah

359
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,039
so i don't know which one of those we

360
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,039
wanna do

361
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,360
i don't know

362
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,198
so where do we specify this let's let's

363
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,720
talk about that let's work backwards and

364
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,879
say what do we actually want to do here

365
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,000
so someone's supposedly submitting

366
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:04,320
fragmizion right

367
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,799
um someone is is

368
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,160
pushing down fragmizion

369
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:13,599
uh and we presumably want to go see what

370
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,838
the heck fragmizion is even encoded as

371
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,360
or how it's encoded it's coming in

372
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,160
as in f32

373
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,320
uh

374
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,078
so the quads

375
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,560
do we have like here it is textured

376
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,559
vertex

377
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:31,120
um so we have a u8 for a mission

378
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,039
uh and then we hey we have a reserved

379
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,000
element that's getting transferred

380
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,679
anyway

381
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,519
so i guess that's another thing we could

382
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,519
do is just send down a different thing

383
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,198
which is like kurt you know what output

384
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,519
curve you wanted

385
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:43,519
um

386
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,519
all right

387
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,319
uh

388
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,320
do we want that

389
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,000
i mean maybe we just do that

390
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,319
uh

391
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,040
you know i mean we're already we've

392
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,639
already got that in there so maybe we

393
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,639
just have another one so we have

394
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,240
fragmizion

395
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,680
um and then we also have

396
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,440
uh

397
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:25,198
besides emission we also have uh frag

398
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,399
mapping or something right or or frag uh

399
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:27,599
frag

400
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,440
frag tone

401
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,040
i like the phrase frag tone because it

402
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,759
sounds cool um

403
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,639
right so we could say that we just have

404
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,000
this thing called frag tone

405
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,000
and it comes

406
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,759
it comes in

407
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:54,000
to the vertex shader as another input

408
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,000
and it just gets passed through right

409
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,000
um

410
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,000
and that's it

411
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,480
presumably

412
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,838
if i still run if i run this thing now

413
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,640
presumably it would just work uh

414
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,558
because it's not doing anything right so

415
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,240
it shouldn't

416
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,359
shouldn't be a problem

417
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,720
uh and then in the cutscenes stuff like

418
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,958
yeah i mean part of the problem is we

419
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,640
don't know how that gets sent down it's

420
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,240
we got issues uh so we're gonna have to

421
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,799
go look at how we're specifying the

422
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,839
emission value to begin with because we

423
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,400
if we don't actually know how the

424
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,519
emission is being specified then we you

425
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,480
know but i'm assuming it's just

426
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,079
something that set in the render group

427
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,519
and gets slapped onto each vertex as a

428
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,839
thing

429
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,839
so

430
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,799
let's take a look at this

431
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:47,918
uh so when we come in here and we're

432
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,839
going to do the processing of uh the

433
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,559
actual you know

434
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,558
the whole like

435
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,399
we should probably move shaders to

436
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,319
separate text files because this

437
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,798
whole indentation thing is nightmare.com

438
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,599
my new web startup

439
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,119
um very promising series a

440
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,119
by the way

441
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,119
um

442
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,519
very proud i am starving right now by

443
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,759
the way can i just tell you that

444
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,759
um

445
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,960
i uh

446
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,160
i'm hungry and i want lunch but i want

447
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,440
to do this first

448
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,880
i

449
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,960
had

450
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,480
a shot of espresso

451
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,440
and a

452
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,400
nature valley registered trademark

453
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,679
oat

454
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,679
biscuit for breakfast

455
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,679
and now i'm hungry again

456
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,320
and

457
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,319
i would like to eat

458
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,640
right

459
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,640
um

460
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,839
that reminds me of another time that i

461
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,798
will not describe because it would go

462
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:11,279
into a very long rant

463
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:14,079
and that rant

464
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,918
is going to wait for another day

465
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,720
it's going to wait for another day when

466
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,160
i

467
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,200
really unload

468
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,480
um

469
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,880
it's probably going to be like a

470
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,319
produced rant

471
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,240
it's one of those things where one of

472
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,000
the things see here's the thing and this

473
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,240
is true you can just you can count on

474
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,240
this

475
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,200
um

476
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,839
like i never

477
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,639
forget

478
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,840
like like like on the grudge side of

479
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,679
things it's actually very hard

480
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,720
to piss me off

481
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,240
but once i have been pissed off

482
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,038
it will never

483
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,599
end

484
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,200
right that's that's kind of the way it

485
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,558
goes um

486
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,080
like like if i'm just complaining about

487
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,240
something that's fine and i'll move on

488
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,279
right but if i actually feel like i got

489
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,759
pissed off about something for real

490
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,759
i never forget so there's things that

491
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,240
like you know 15 years ago or something

492
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,759
i will remember

493
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,440
and it's like

494
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,839
it's not over

495
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,120
you may think it's over

496
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,720
because i'm just not

497
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,798
dealing with that thing right now it's

498
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,360
been like filed

499
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:32,558
but if you think it's over

500
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,678
you're really mistaken about that

501
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,798
right

502
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,480
like

503
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,158
there's only a few of these there's only

504
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,919
going to be like five of these in

505
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,600
history right

506
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,120
because it's actually really hard i

507
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,639
think one of the one of the nice things

508
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,319
about people who complain about stuff or

509
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,400
think everything sucks is it's actually

510
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,000
kind of hard to piss them off right

511
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,080
because they're already not in a state

512
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,679
where they think everything's going well

513
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,279
right so you know you they're just ah

514
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,038
yeah this is another crap thing yeah

515
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,720
this all sucks

516
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,319
and that's it right you move on it's

517
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,079
fine uh

518
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,439
but if someone actually pushes me to the

519
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,839
point where i'm

520
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,159
really pissed off in the real way

521
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,678
never it never gets forgotten so it's

522
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,120
still there

523
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,280
right

524
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:17,038
and it's just like yep

525
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:19,440
like someday when i'm 72 and you thought

526
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,679
it was over

527
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,720
oh my friend it is not over

528
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,519
so anyway

529
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,079
um

530
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,000
that that uh said about about uh

531
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,599
breakfast biscuits especially i was

532
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,759
thinking about power bar

533
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,719
uh but yeah uh i need to

534
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,879
eat something because we have probably

535
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,880
low blood sugar at this point

536
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,200
um and uh

537
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,320
yeah it's uh chat it is like opposite

538
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,480
buddhist

539
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,839
right it's i'm the anti-buddhist it's

540
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,360
because i'm italian

541
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,959
right i mean i mean

542
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:50,158
you know i i don't i don't want to be

543
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,319
racist about it i mean i don't want to

544
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,400
be racist against myself right i guess

545
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,279
which is what i'd be doing

546
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,038
but you know i mean do you really think

547
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,000
we have a history

548
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,480
of

549
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,720
of letting things go you know is that

550
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,360
you know if you looked at the history of

551
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,839
of like sicily or something

552
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,079
would you go like now there's a group of

553
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,839
people who really know how to just like

554
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,199
let the past be the past

555
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,558
yeah

556
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,200
yeah

557
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,200
you think so

558
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,000
no

559
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,640
doesn't really happen

560
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,558
oh no ryan i love the four coder lair

561
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,360
i'm i'm very happy you did that it

562
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,279
totally saved my bacon uh because

563
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,959
i i don't want to use

564
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,839
my stuff the the

565
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,240
molly

566
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,119
uh proprietary stuff i don't do on

567
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
stream

568
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,558
and it would have been really tough if

569
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,360
you hadn't have uh

570
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,119
uh

571
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,279
made the four chord a flurry layer it

572
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,279
was it was a lifesaver

573
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,960
you could piss me off many times right

574
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,639
and and and like

575
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,360
you're banked already right like you

576
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
know

577
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,918
what am i going to do you totally saved

578
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,120
my bacon already you know what i'm

579
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,320
saying

580
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,918
um

581
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,678
same with alan same with george i mean

582
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,000
you you guys all totally saved my bacon

583
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,440
i mean i i can't wha

584
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,798
i can't get pissed off right there's

585
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,000
nothing i could get pissed off about

586
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:09,918
cause it's like well all right you know

587
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,880
they already did you a solid how are you

588
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,880
gonna get pissed off at them

589
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,960
all right anyway uh

590
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,720
so

591
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,960
this is the situation that we have here

592
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,079
where we've got uh a lerp

593
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,759
where we're using like the fog you know

594
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,599
we've got a fog coefficient we've got

595
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,440
the emission coefficient

596
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,719
and what we're basically doing here

597
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,640
right is we're using these lerps to

598
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,720
basically create knobs you know like

599
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,159
producer knobs right

600
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,159
where you turn

601
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,720
up the

602
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,880
x whatever x is if you're trying to get

603
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,038
that effect for these pixels

604
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,440
or you turn it down right so you want

605
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:54,960
more fog you turn that up you want more

606
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:58,798
emission you turn that up sorry emission

607
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,679
you turn that up um and so i just don't

608
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,278
know what exactly uh

609
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,480
these all should be

610
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,880
but i do

611
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,519
think this is a reasonable guess is like

612
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,320
okay turn up the tone mapping turn up

613
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,558
the emission turn up the fog

614
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,720
that'll give us the way that we can like

615
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,200
tune for cutscene

616
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,079
light source right you know what i'm

617
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,038
saying

618
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,439
um

619
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,519
so anyway

620
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,440
so in here uh you can see that this is

621
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:32,079
the part where we're actually doing the

622
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,278
tone mapping right uh the fog is

623
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,119
we we

624
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,278
had that in there it wasn't really you

625
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,918
know fog per se it was kind of so we

626
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,200
could fade out like lower levels you

627
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,440
know

628
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,480
um and so right now it's a little bit

629
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,480
hard to say where that should be uh

630
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,880
you know in terms of these other

631
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,798
parameters you know does it happen

632
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,360
before or after a mission does it you

633
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:00,000
know where is this actually going

634
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,678
uh and that's kind of a little bit tough

635
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,159
to determine

636
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,278
so i'm not really sure what we want to

637
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,559
do here

638
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,880
exactly

639
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:08,879
um

640
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,600
that's a little bit tough

641
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,640
so what i might say is all right we've

642
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,480
got the emission coefficient coming down

643
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,400
that's turning this it's saying how much

644
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,120
you want to crank all the way to full

645
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,679
bright right which is one one one

646
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,158
um and

647
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,240
we then multiply the reflectance color

648
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,720
that comes in by that always so if it's

649
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,960
an emitter we're basically saying oh and

650
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,720
by the way the emitter also will always

651
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,120
take the color that you give it so if

652
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,159
you wanted to have a yellow emission

653
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:41,199
right

654
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,080
um

655
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,600
that's fine too

656
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,199
but uh

657
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,158
once we get to here

658
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,558
you know maybe we would say

659
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,520
maybe we would say fog is still always

660
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,000
applied because it would seem

661
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,359
to reason that you would do that right

662
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,640
also i don't know why we like we

663
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,879
probably had this in here when that was

664
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,960
still a four it it doesn't have to do

665
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,000
that anymore

666
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,600
um

667
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,278
i also don't know why fog would be in

668
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,480
rgba probably because it's an input but

669
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:11,759
it doesn't matter

670
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,240
uh anyway

671
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:17,200
so when we come through here this will

672
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,480
compute i think correctly most of the

673
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,000
time

674
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,558
i'm

675
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,359
[Music]

676
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,519
this would compute no matter what we set

677
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,759
the other knob to this would compute the

678
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,079
base value that we actually want so

679
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,440
really all we're trying to do here is

680
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,918
this part

681
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,519
is the part that we need to fix

682
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,840
um because this part is not

683
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,720
we don't want that to happen

684
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,599
right

685
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,960
so in here we've got this like film map

686
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:49,199
curve thing and and so i'm going to say

687
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,200
let's

688
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,839
let's call this like mapped

689
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,799
or mapped color

690
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,798
um so what i'm thinking is we just say

691
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,400
we compute this as a completely separate

692
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,679
value now

693
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,120
so it doesn't affect the actual like

694
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,000
unmapped

695
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,599
like unfilm mapped colored that you know

696
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,798
this one here

697
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,918
we compute it into a completely separate

698
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,918
variable

699
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,038
and then when we want to produce our

700
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,799
final surface reflection um and and

701
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,319
maybe we could actually call this like

702
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,639
something different like

703
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:24,639
um

704
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,720
uh final color or something like that

705
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,039
so we produce the surface reflect we

706
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,360
produce the mapped color and then we say

707
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,519
well the final color is going to be yet

708
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:47,119
another lerp

709
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:49,359
between the surface reflection

710
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,359
color which is the pure color that

711
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,000
hasn't gone through the curves or the

712
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,558
boost the amp light application

713
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,159
um we're going to use that frag tone

714
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,879
mapping to just say how much tone

715
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,240
mapping do you want now again this seems

716
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,080
like kind of unnecessary because it's

717
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,000
really mostly just gonna be a zero or

718
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,119
one but because everything else was done

719
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,599
on a dial

720
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,599
i mean

721
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,558
sure

722
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,798
right i don't know

723
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,278
so anyway uh i'm just saying look we'll

724
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,158
we'll just lurp up to the map color

725
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,000
right

726
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,399
now i believe that the default value for

727
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,558
this thing will always be zero

728
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,398
uh because we haven't set it to anything

729
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,240
so i'm imagining that if we actually run

730
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,000
this we will get yeah like we'll just

731
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,880
get the untoned mapped version of this

732
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,880
thing

733
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,679
is what we'd end up with right

734
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,480
uh

735
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,919
and if we hit escape because again it's

736
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,839
set to zero which means don't go through

737
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,840
the curve our cutscene is now okay

738
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,440
right like

739
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:01,440
at the edge of the wood

740
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,440
there was an orphanage that catered to a

741
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,440
group of limbless children

742
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,000
they were very sad

743
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,480
because without any limbs they could not

744
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,759
play outside or adventure into the

745
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,079
forest

746
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:21,200
for there were many demons there and

747
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:25,119
without arms to defend themselves

748
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,519
there was no way they would survive

749
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,558
uh this little grumpy boy that we see

750
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,158
through the window here is one of the

751
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,918
orphans uh he's going to be the hero

752
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,799
later but we don't know that

753
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:39,720
one of them

754
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,720
was constantly playing with toys

755
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,640
and imagining what it would be like if

756
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,519
he could go into the forest and fight

757
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,679
the demons there in particular little

758
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,960
pink godzilla for some reason and go

759
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,720
into it just what he thought of

760
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,759
every year at christmas time santa claus

761
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,839
who is a tremendous dick

762
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,640
came and gave them a hat because he had

763
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,959
no better idea of what to give people

764
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,880
who had no arms and legs

765
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,558
the kids didn't like it but santa didn't

766
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,799
care because he's callous and

767
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,089
imperceptive

768
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:15,918
but one year

769
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:20,240
[Music]

770
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:23,200
in the midst of a brutal storm

771
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,640
who should arrive but krampus

772
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,519
with his giant tongue meant for licking

773
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,799
naughty children and dismembering them

774
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,558
to put in his sack

775
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,720
the children were scared of course

776
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:40,079
because they knew that the arrival of

777
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,759
krampus could only mean one thing

778
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,439
and that thing was that they would soon

779
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,079
be dismembered for being naughty which

780
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,679
of course they were

781
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,720
however

782
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,640
on this particular day

783
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,880
the little child who always dreamed of

784
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,320
adventuring into the forest looked up at

785
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,960
krampus and said no

786
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,960
i will stand between you and these poor

787
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,440
children you will not terrorize them and

788
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,440
you will not dismember them

789
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,278
for they have no arms and legs anyway

790
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,558
what could you possibly gain from this

791
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,640
and krampus was so moved by the small

792
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:18,798
child's gesture

793
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,600
that out of his sack

794
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:24,000
he took a tiny glove

795
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,798
sparkling with magic

796
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,798
capable of moving on its own

797
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,839
and he presented it to the child who

798
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:33,759
looked at the hand in

799
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:36,158
wonder now it only took the child a

800
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,000
brief moment to decide exactly what he

801
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,799
would do

802
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,759
for with this hand he could now finally

803
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,879
go adventuring in the forest for all he

804
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,000
needed

805
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:52,159
was just a little bit of help

806
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,558
told a sword or perhaps just a box

807
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,559
and of course he already had a complete

808
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:59,038
selection of hats given to him by santa

809
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,879
claus across the many years

810
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,359
so all that remained was for him to

811
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,240
select one the correct hat for his

812
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:09,519
journey put it on his head and prepare

813
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,359
for the adventure of a lifetime

814
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,839
all right um

815
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,918
so anyway you know uh there you go

816
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,918
cutscenes working

817
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,919
i

818
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,399
oh yeah no this game

819
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,759
is gonna have so many hats in it it's

820
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,678
gonna be like the only thing that you

821
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:43,038
can buy with real money in the real

822
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:47,519
money auction house is going to be hats

823
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:50,798
right it's going to be portal 2

824
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,519
times 2 plus 2

825
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,519
minus 1.

826
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,159
so

827
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,798
why thank you for the sub gifting that

828
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,038
was very nice of you

829
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:08,158
was that because of of my

830
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:10,798
my amazing narration is that what your

831
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,200
way of saying that you do think that my

832
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,359
career as a voice actor is just waiting

833
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,278
to take off

834
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:20,558
is is that is that what that

835
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,798
benevolence gesture was meant to say

836
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,038
i can only really interpret it that way

837
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,759
i mean i mean how else could i interpret

838
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:26,879
it

839
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,200
um

840
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,440
right after that dramatic

841
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,360
moving reading

842
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,320
um well i wasn't really reading anything

843
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,678
but you know

844
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,918
if i had been it would have been

845
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,120
dramatic certainly i think we all know

846
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,278
um

847
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,278
so

848
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,558
you know

849
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,959
okay um so anyway uh i think we're

850
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,398
honestly i think that was basically it

851
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,519
like you know that was what we wanted to

852
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:54,558
accomplish on the stream besides the

853
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,839
reading

854
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,158
um

855
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,678
yeah my posh british accent is it may

856
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,039
not be terrible but the problem is it

857
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,038
doesn't it's probably not a british

858
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,599
accent right it's like probably like a

859
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,038
weird combination of british accents

860
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,878
i need a voice what i need is one of

861
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,398
those like accent coaches who's like

862
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,118
okay like which

863
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,039
you know which part of

864
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,399
of england are we talking about here or

865
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,039
which part of great britain are we

866
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,519
talking about like what what accent are

867
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,039
we actually doing you gotta like

868
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,119
you gotta pick one right you know

869
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,759
because i don't really know

870
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,679
the actual accents

871
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,000
that's the problem

872
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,878
um so gotta gotta get a gotta get a

873
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,639
voice coach gotta get a an accent coach

874
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,878
gotta call hollywood

875
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,878
um

876
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:44,638
all right uh

877
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,280
so

878
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,838
what we need to do now is just utilize

879
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,760
this variable so that we can turn up the

880
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,799
tone mapping or off the tone mapping and

881
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,639
all that sort of stuff at the

882
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,119
appropriate times

883
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,440
now i think that the lighting stuff is

884
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,599
already ha it has the ability to turn it

885
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,720
on and off um

886
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,079
and

887
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,919
you know that's how we're bracketing

888
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,400
those things so i assume that it's just

889
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,720
part of the render group at the moment

890
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,880
um and it's just kind of getting like

891
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,559
stuffed into those uh

892
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,880
oops i'm in the wrong i'm in the wrong

893
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,078
file

894
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,320
you're not gonna fix anything in the

895
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,320
wrong file son

896
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,000
you're not gonna fix anything in the

897
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,519
wrong file

898
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,920
uh so

899
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:28,838
i'm pretty sure there's like a lighting

900
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,880
like

901
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:32,400
switch i

902
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,760
you know yeah

903
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,838
so you can see like we've kind of got a

904
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,240
kill switch for lighting here

905
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:41,440
um and so when lighting is enabled we

906
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:43,519
need to turn up the tone mapping uh

907
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,280
curve right you can see

908
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,440
we got push occluder

909
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,359
uh we got pushing vertices all this

910
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,838
stuff right so here's our push quad

911
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,000
and inside push quad you can see that if

912
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:59,440
the lighting is not enabled we set the

913
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,920
emission to one automatically

914
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,079
so i think what we need to also do here

915
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,720
is set the tone mapping to the opposite

916
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,800
of that right

917
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:13,358
so vert emission goes in here and we

918
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,119
need to specify as well as that we need

919
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,400
to specify

920
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,200
uh tone right uh

921
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,079
uh

922
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:26,239
did we we probably didn't actually set

923
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,640
that did we um

924
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,639
tone

925
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,199
maybe store it here

926
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,358
that's a that's a great comment

927
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:40,358
maybe store it

928
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,358
here

929
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,319
so i wrote a comment i thought

930
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,199
as i've said comments are usually pretty

931
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,480
useless because they don't you won't say

932
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,759
what you actually need to say and

933
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,440
they'll get out of sync with the code

934
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,119
and stuff so you know i try to do

935
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,119
comments pretty specifically right

936
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:06,559
what the heck did i think i was right

937
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,799
maybe store it here how is that helpful

938
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:12,078
why did i stop to type that comment if

939
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,280
you don't know what it is

940
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,920
how are you going to know if you should

941
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,480
maybe store it there what is that how is

942
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,480
that helping

943
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,039
how is that helping

944
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
maybe store it here

945
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,838
thanks for matt for that theorem

946
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,480
i'll get right on it

947
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:40,239
no all right

948
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,679
oh jeez

949
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,319
so yeah

950
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:47,118
maybe sorry yeah maybe we will

951
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,559
in fact we did store something there and

952
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,880
left the comment

953
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,559
so that's good

954
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,400
right

955
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,880
um

956
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,480
oh so hey ryan you know people do that

957
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,559
with handmade hero if you go on to the

958
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,559
handmade hero github right now

959
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,239
it's got line attribution so it will

960
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,480
tell you which episode i made the

961
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:08,479
comment in on the handmade hero github

962
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,719
actually

963
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,559
it actually has that feature uh andrew

964
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,519
jdr made it

965
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,799
uh

966
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:19,039
uh

967
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,720
andrew johnson do you know who he is

968
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,039
he does the he does that like asset

969
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,519
management system that web-based

970
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,039
like fast asset management thing for for

971
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,838
movie people

972
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:29,838
you know i'm talking about

973
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,440
i don't know if you know who he is

974
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,839
yeah yeah him

975
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,358
he he made a like script that just like

976
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,519
automatically whenever the github gets

977
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,519
checked in it it produces like a new

978
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,039
version of the source code that has each

979
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,440
line it says

980
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:48,159
when it was made

981
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,079
um it's really cool so totally it would

982
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,399
be great if that was just built into the

983
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,240
system um because you know

984
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,320
the source code control system knows

985
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,319
that right it knows when you you did it

986
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:03,118
and of course since with this with each

987
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,039
check-in i include a day number so it

988
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,800
knows you know that that's all it really

989
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,320
needs right

990
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,560
so

991
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,000
uh anyway uh so if we have our vert

992
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,239
emission here

993
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,280
uh then it should be pretty easy to just

994
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:20,239
produce a vert tone value

995
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,400
and again this is being pretty sloppy um

996
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:25,279
because really you know if we were fancy

997
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,519
gpu people um we would we would split

998
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,440
these into streams that had different

999
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,239
run rates right

1000
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,720
so

1001
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,000
because we know that we only need to

1002
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,078
specify

1003
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
a few things for the quad like the quad

1004
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,880
only needs a couple of these

1005
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,159
um

1006
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,358
we never change for example the texture

1007
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:48,399
index the emission or the tone per

1008
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:51,119
vertex so those could have gone

1009
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,760
in a different stream

1010
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,160
and in that different stream

1011
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,280
we would then set it to only advance

1012
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,118
every four

1013
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,320
vertices right

1014
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,320
um or something like that

1015
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,879
you know what i'm saying

1016
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,960
um and

1017
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,800
and so we're we're being

1018
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,559
sort of flippant here and the reason for

1019
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,160
that is we're just not sending down very

1020
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,599
much geometry

1021
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,838
so because we're not sending down very

1022
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,039
much geometry we can get away with being

1023
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,719
sloppy here all of our gpu load goes on

1024
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,119
the fill rate side of things the

1025
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,959
geometry is like totally irrelevant so

1026
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,280
we can be pretty much as sloppy as we

1027
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,039
want here because we are never going to

1028
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,040
stress the vertex shader

1029
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,480
if we were thinking we would be in a

1030
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,239
situation where we would be putting

1031
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,199
pressure on the vertex shader you would

1032
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:45,279
not do this right

1033
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,519
so it's just worth noting like

1034
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,359
you know these don't actually need to be

1035
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,759
sent down per vertex because they don't

1036
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,000
change per vertex ever like we never

1037
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,200
actually use that feature

1038
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,679
so the vertone um is really at this

1039
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:02,879
point i don't think we need to support

1040
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:04,960
gradual anything

1041
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,280
with it so i'm pretty sure we can just

1042
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,480
say that you know the vert tone mapping

1043
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,720
is just going to be 255 and then if you

1044
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,400
if you're turning off lighting then it's

1045
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,039
not

1046
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,280
i think that's basically all there is to

1047
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,279
it right

1048
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,640
all right

1049
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,039
uh well i would have thought that would

1050
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,799
have worked did i pick it did i

1051
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,159
do it the wrong way or is our shader

1052
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,960
busted

1053
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,279
oh

1054
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,159
um

1055
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,960
we we didn't uh bind it we didn't we

1056
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,399
didn't actually bind that oopsie oopsie

1057
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,519
poopsies

1058
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,838
uh

1059
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,400
yeah like we we don't actually

1060
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,400
we are sending it down sort of but not

1061
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,000
actually telling the card we're it's

1062
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,480
right in the stuff that the card will

1063
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,079
pull down but we never told uh the card

1064
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,599
about it uh so

1065
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,079
uh whoops

1066
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,400
um slight mistake

1067
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:15,200
uh huge tiny mistake

1068
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,838
okay so that emission that vert emission

1069
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:20,239
uh that we claim is coming in here uh

1070
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:22,400
yeah you can see it right

1071
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,719
uh so what we need here is we need a

1072
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,720
tone

1073
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,200
a tone poem

1074
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:33,359
uh and we need to enable that

1075
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,719
that tone poem

1076
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,078
like so

1077
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:40,719
and we probably have a few places where

1078
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,119
that's going to want to get right in

1079
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:44,879
beginning end this is all just garbage

1080
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,559
like this is why i hate gp but all this

1081
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,280
is stupid you should never have to do

1082
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,759
any of this stuff this is just

1083
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,359
gpu programming is terrible and it

1084
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,400
always sucks

1085
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,199
and

1086
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,160
it's just this nonsense if you

1087
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,318
spend a lot of time doing this you can

1088
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,318
make these things be more system

1089
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:05,920
oriented meaning you can go in here and

1090
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,639
make your own like little system for

1091
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,159
like okay i you know bound arrays or i

1092
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:11,358
have a meta program that scans it and

1093
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:14,000
produces the correct

1094
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:17,039
it's all so dumb

1095
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,639
it's all so dumb right um and the other

1096
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,199
thing you can do is if you're targeting

1097
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,879
higher levels of of glsl than i think we

1098
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,239
are

1099
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,480
a smarter thing to do here is i think

1100
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,318
you can finally now say that just we're

1101
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,079
gonna define just like a struct in the

1102
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,559
shader so that you don't have to do this

1103
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,039
stupid stuff so i don't think you have

1104
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,838
to it's not as bad as this is making it

1105
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,279
seem um is i guess what i would say

1106
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:44,639
so you know you can uh you can nowadays

1107
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,480
be a little bit less hand-holdy i think

1108
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,159
you know what as i say that i think i

1109
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,199
checked recently and you still couldn't

1110
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,199
for vertex arrays

1111
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,519
am i wrong about that

1112
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,960
hey gpu people out there do they still

1113
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,000
not have it so you can just say the

1114
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,920
vertex

1115
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,838
vertices are

1116
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,599
this struct

1117
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,920
because i i feel like you know what i

1118
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,200
did check that recently and it still

1119
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,200
wasn't something that you could do

1120
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:14,880
uh

1121
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:18,239
in standard

1122
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,800
in standard uh gpu

1123
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,799
standard apis

1124
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:32,719
botander i don't think that's true i

1125
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,358
mean it's true on the gpu but it's not

1126
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,719
true in the api

1127
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:38,799
do you know what i'm saying like you're

1128
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,879
you're absolutely right that in in like

1129
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,880
like an nvidia gpu i'm pretty sure that

1130
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,480
it's just complete arbitrary fetch for

1131
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,240
the most part right

1132
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,119
um

1133
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,598
but i think like you know like if you

1134
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,440
boot up if you fire up direct3d11 most

1135
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,720
modern version

1136
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,599
um or

1137
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:59,439
opengl most modern version

1138
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,039
you can't do that

1139
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,119
i think you still have to specify each

1140
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:07,358
array manually

1141
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,358
i don't know if d312 might have it

1142
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,040
somebody check that because i remember

1143
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,880
being surprised i was like we're still

1144
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,960
doing this

1145
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,280
and and i think the answer was yes we

1146
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,480
often are still doing this and i was

1147
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,480
like god all right

1148
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,480
you can do 3d 12 structure

1149
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:34,800
are you sure

1150
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,800
are you sure you can do it for vertices

1151
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,639
meaning a vertex shader can use

1152
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,639
structured buffer

1153
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,639
i i i'm just i'm only i'm slightly

1154
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,599
doubtful i apologize for being a

1155
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:52,960
doubting

1156
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,039
thomas

1157
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,240
let's say doubting nancy

1158
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:58,800
um

1159
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,318
but i'm not sure i quite believe you

1160
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,640
because i feel like i looked at this and

1161
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:05,199
you couldn't do it for that case you can

1162
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,440
do other things structured you can send

1163
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,519
down arbitrary structured buffers that

1164
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,679
you fetch from in the vertex shader but

1165
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:15,480
not for the actual vertex parameters by

1166
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,480
default that come in

1167
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,480
okay yeah so that's what i thought so

1168
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,719
but can you actually still get the full

1169
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,199
performance by using the vertex id to do

1170
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,199
the indexing or does that create

1171
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:30,318
like i assumed that you wouldn't want to

1172
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,000
do that because it would create like

1173
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:32,719
performance issues

1174
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,318
for

1175
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,759
you know

1176
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,759
older cards or something i don't know

1177
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,520
like i i was i assumed that you didn't

1178
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,760
want to bypass the standard vertex

1179
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:46,519
shading but maybe you can can you safely

1180
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,520
do that i'd be very curious to know

1181
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:01,759
all right

1182
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,919
um

1183
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,800
so that looks like that worked well

1184
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,838
uh there's our our tone mapping is back

1185
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,280
um

1186
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:13,199
here's our

1187
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,440
cutscene looks looks right again

1188
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,439
so i guess the other thing

1189
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,400
we might want to do

1190
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,880
is verify that this works and it does oh

1191
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,240
lovely so our debug view works again too

1192
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,599
right because that had a problem with

1193
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,439
the new lighting

1194
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,880
so that with the tone mapping so that's

1195
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,280
all good

1196
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,280
great

1197
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,079
fantastic

1198
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,039
um

1199
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,280
so that seems good

1200
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,358
i am uh

1201
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,880
i am a swanky sally

1202
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:47,039
about that

1203
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,599
and

1204
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:51,279
i guess the only thing that remains is

1205
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,599
to actually try making the

1206
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,960
self-illuminating block now

1207
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,318
and to make sure that we can actually

1208
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,960
send it down

1209
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,558
uh you know what i'm saying to you

1210
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,079
um

1211
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,480
i guess

1212
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,480
so in the world gen

1213
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,480
code

1214
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,000
uh

1215
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:14,000
[Music]

1216
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:18,480
so i think that's all i really need to

1217
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,000
do we'll just say that first so let's

1218
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,599
just go ahead and ping pong over to the

1219
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,519
world gen code and see if we can make

1220
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,640
our dungeon area here

1221
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,358
um

1222
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:29,920
we know we've

1223
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:34,119
have it all

1224
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,119
any lemongrab fans in the audience

1225
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,838
lemongrab

1226
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,079
hey let me grab fans out there let me

1227
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:42,078
grab

1228
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,959
does anybody

1229
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:53,679
out there

1230
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,800
in the audience know who lemongrab is

1231
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,799
there's there's my people

1232
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:12,159
this code base is in unacceptable

1233
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:15,159
condition

1234
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,159
unacceptable

1235
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,519
uh

1236
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:38,480
the interesting thing about the

1237
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,559
autofocus on the sony cameras is that

1238
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,480
they

1239
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,839
it's almost like too good

1240
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,039
it has facial recognition in it

1241
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:51,119
that focuses on faces by default which i

1242
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,400
guess you could turn off and maybe i

1243
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,559
should

1244
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,318
but so as a result it's always going to

1245
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,519
focus on your face so if you try to hold

1246
00:49:56,318 --> 00:49:58,960
something up

1247
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:00,400
you're like look at this thing in front

1248
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,000
of the camera it's like no no i'm gonna

1249
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,800
look right past that at the face that i

1250
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,119
see so you have to like actually like

1251
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,720
obscure your face first

1252
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,079
uh i think

1253
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:13,838
i could be wrong about that but i think

1254
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,839
that's sort of what happens on there

1255
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,200
so you know

1256
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,200
anyway

1257
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:24,838
um

1258
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:31,919
in keeping with our

1259
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,200
so

1260
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,800
the question is

1261
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,799
what do we want to do

1262
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,960
in the world generator for

1263
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,960
like

1264
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,838
how rooms get connected

1265
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,040
uh if we're gonna start saying like oh

1266
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:51,039
yeah like

1267
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:54,159
you know

1268
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:56,800
up and down is not in here anymore do we

1269
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:59,279
want to still have up and down in here

1270
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,079
and just it like puts it puts it

1271
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,800
somewhere else and then like

1272
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,720
connects it with a teleporter or do we

1273
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,280
want to just not talk about up and down

1274
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,318
at all you know what i'm saying

1275
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,079
um

1276
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:14,318
and i don't know i mean for now i guess

1277
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:17,800
we just

1278
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:17,800
just do that

1279
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:32,159
um so i don't really know uh what this

1280
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,040
is gonna do but uh i wanted to get the

1281
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:37,358
dungeon in here because if we wanna like

1282
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,519
i think we already have the concept of

1283
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,920
these little tiles that i wanted right

1284
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:44,239
oh that's

1285
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,240
oh

1286
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,640
well would you look at that

1287
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:51,759
little

1288
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:53,838
saucy salamandor

1289
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,480
look at that

1290
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:58,558
interesting so what happened there is

1291
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,838
when we do when we were putting in the

1292
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,040
vertices for our grebel

1293
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,000
uh

1294
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:08,558
we didn't we never put like those are

1295
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,559
obviously getting they're the cover you

1296
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,559
know the sort of like ground cover

1297
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,519
um

1298
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:24,318
those are obviously not pushing a value

1299
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,318
what how do those actually

1300
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,519
get

1301
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:33,838
output i don't even know what we did

1302
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,838
here i mean you can see us doing a thing

1303
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,319
with p values here

1304
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:41,119
uh

1305
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:41,119
but i don't know

1306
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:47,240
i don't know what that supposedly do it

1307
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,239
does

1308
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,160
so it's using vertex out

1309
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,318
which oh we just specifically said

1310
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:00,480
doesn't have tone mapping

1311
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,960
um so i don't know what we want here

1312
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,280
like we could auto stuff

1313
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,280
this value um

1314
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,119
and then this would be fixed i don't

1315
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,160
know if we want control over that

1316
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,800
probably not because any time we're like

1317
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:17,039
putting those down um

1318
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,640
it fixed the it did not fix the blocky

1319
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,039
lighting bug you just couldn't see it

1320
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:21,920
because nothing was reflecting the light

1321
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:23,039
um

1322
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,760
right

1323
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:27,119
uh but anyway uh okay so so i think

1324
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,400
we'll just stuff that value for now

1325
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,599
because if we i don't know that we're

1326
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,039
ever going to need that function

1327
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,559
in that way

1328
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:37,599
um

1329
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,480
all right so in the dungeon areas here

1330
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,318
uh

1331
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,119
yeah like i think we already had this

1332
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:45,759
stuff set up oh these stupid guys

1333
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,440
um yeah we gotta we gotta do some uh

1334
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,359
some monster coding

1335
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,039
it's got to the point

1336
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:53,679
um

1337
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,519
so the dungeon is looking good uh so

1338
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:57,519
that all worked fine that connecting

1339
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,199
worked fine i assume dungeon to dungeon

1340
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:00,559
connection doesn't we can't actually

1341
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:01,838
kill any of these guys so that's a

1342
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,119
problem

1343
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,199
um because they're going to keep

1344
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,000
blocking our path but i assume then when

1345
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,519
we get out here the dungeons are are now

1346
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,519
going to actually still have a downward

1347
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,039
connection right so we'd have to fix

1348
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,679
that oh my god there's too many of these

1349
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:15,679
stupid guys

1350
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,079
stop no get

1351
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,838
get out of here

1352
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,760
all right yeah so like we still have

1353
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:28,318
some downward dungeon connect downward

1354
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:32,000
dungeon actually by the way sounds great

1355
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,000
like someone needs to make a game

1356
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:39,079
someone needs to make a game called

1357
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:39,078
downward dungeon

1358
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,160
can someone please make a game called

1359
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,160
downward dungeon

1360
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:52,000
like the next time there's one of those

1361
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:53,759
game jams where it's only you're only

1362
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,519
gonna spend like 48 hours or whatever it

1363
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,280
is that they do

1364
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:00,480
can you just can someone please make a

1365
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,480
game called downward dungeon

1366
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,399
if someone if someone is willing to make

1367
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,719
a game called downward dungeon

1368
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,200
for a game jam i will voice i will do

1369
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,879
some of that voice acting for free

1370
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,199
i will send you some voice acting for

1371
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,119
downward dungeon

1372
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:23,199
like i will narrate the introductory

1373
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,200
sequence to downward dungeon okay

1374
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,920
like let it not be said that i do not

1375
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,920
support the downward dungeon project

1376
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:45,920
i mean they made it like there was a

1377
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,519
game literally called like darkest

1378
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,838
dungeon or something right and it was

1379
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,358
super popular like it was it made a ton

1380
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:52,798
of money

1381
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,558
like hundreds of thousands of copies

1382
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:56,079
million million copies something like

1383
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,359
that right

1384
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,720
and it was literally just called like

1385
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,719
darkest dungeon i think

1386
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,838
i think

1387
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:09,519
and uh

1388
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,199
so downward dungeon do not tell me

1389
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:12,000
downward dungeon could not be a huge

1390
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:16,239
game

1391
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,480
i think downward dungeon could be big

1392
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,479
right

1393
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,960
so

1394
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,078
downward dungeon

1395
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,720
you know what i'm saying downward

1396
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,720
dungeon people

1397
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,280
okay

1398
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:57,440
in order to restore

1399
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,920
light to the darkness they knew they

1400
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,200
would have to go downward

1401
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,159
into

1402
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:05,159
the downward dungeon

1403
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:20,159
i mean at this point i would say i would

1404
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:23,280
accept most

1405
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:24,798
slightly off dungeon names

1406
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,200
as a project

1407
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:29,039
like

1408
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:32,000
like i would i would be willing to do

1409
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:33,920
some voice acting for like mildly like

1410
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,679
if there was a game called like mildly

1411
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,280
ominous dungeon

1412
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:39,279
or somewhat like

1413
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:44,199
or a game called slightly dungeon

1414
00:57:55,039 --> 00:58:00,960
or a game called

1415
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:00,960
just the outskirts of hell

1416
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:10,719
like this game is just

1417
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:14,000
just barely

1418
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:14,000
hell like we're just

1419
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,359
outskirts of hell

1420
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,719
but not ever actually going into hell

1421
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:25,039
because that would be dangerous

1422
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:25,039
yeah

1423
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:27,519
um

1424
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,798
i'm just saying i know there's people

1425
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,920
out there who do these game jams and

1426
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:36,920
stuff i'm just saying downward dungeon

1427
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,920
okay

1428
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,838
i agree that a game about traveling to

1429
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,359
the dungeon and then deciding not to go

1430
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,358
in because it just looks a little bit

1431
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:59,679
too dangerous is a totally would be

1432
00:58:57,358 --> 00:58:59,679
great

1433
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:05,318
like

1434
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:05,318
um

1435
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,519
i i mean basically like the monty python

1436
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,599
thing of like brave sir robin ran away

1437
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,798
right

1438
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,798
um

1439
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:19,838
the game i don't know how you make that

1440
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:19,838
a game

1441
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:48,880
maybe the game can just be called where

1442
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,880
is the dungeon

1443
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:56,000
like the whole game is just trying to

1444
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:58,078
find the dungeon and you don't it's very

1445
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,519
like diffic it's very like

1446
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,039
difficult to find

1447
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:05,838
or maybe the game could just be called

1448
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:05,838
what dungeon

1449
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:19,838
where's the dungeon would be

1450
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:23,720
dude where's my dungeon yeah

1451
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:23,719
i really like this idea

1452
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,039
technic beam that's a great idea i like

1453
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,200
that idea

1454
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:43,000
i like that you made that

1455
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,000
all right um

1456
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:46,880
yeah like what if you're basically going

1457
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:48,480
around so this game

1458
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,760
um

1459
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,838
you know this game is just called

1460
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,119
dungeon but with a question mark and

1461
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:55,440
basically like you're a bunch of heroes

1462
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:58,000
that show up to a town that's like

1463
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,318
giving you all these npc quests like oh

1464
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,639
it stole my cow and and the dragon has

1465
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:04,079
been menacing us but you sort of start

1466
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:05,440
to get the feeling like there's no

1467
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,440
evidence that any of these things ever

1468
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,400
happened right

1469
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,280
and like

1470
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,079
it turns out at the end of the game

1471
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,599
that really it's just the villagers just

1472
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,359
wanted like heroes to come to the

1473
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,880
village so they just it's completely

1474
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:22,000
fictional like they made it all up

1475
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:25,838
there's no dragon there's no dungeon

1476
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,838
they're completely full of it right

1477
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:28,639
um

1478
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,000
like

1479
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,079
oh well actually so if it wasn't already

1480
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:44,719
trademarked the obvious name for this

1481
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,220
game would be imagine dragons

1482
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:50,199
right

1483
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:50,199
[Laughter]

1484
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,880
you know

1485
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,880
um

1486
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:00,480
so

1487
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,318
yeah

1488
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,240
i mean you know it's it's one of those

1489
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,519
things that they don't make

1490
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:07,199
uh

1491
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,599
they don't really make much sci-fi

1492
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,879
comedy sci-fi fantasy comedy but i mean

1493
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,400
that's the kind of thing that they

1494
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,960
totally should have made

1495
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,200
like someone should make a movie about

1496
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,519
this town that's like struggling like

1497
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,519
all the peasants are like really

1498
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:23,838
unable like they can't feed their

1499
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:26,400
families and it's really bad and like

1500
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:29,038
somebody gets the idea to like attract a

1501
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,079
bunch of heroes

1502
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,799
um

1503
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,798
by pretending that something like

1504
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:36,480
momentous has happened there like

1505
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:38,880
pretending there's like a lord of the

1506
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,639
rings style like big

1507
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,720
grand thing happening but they

1508
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,960
completely fabricate it it's not

1509
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:46,719
actually true and like it's you know the

1510
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,199
standard kind of like

1511
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:50,719
uh rom-com kind of movie right like

1512
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:51,679
where they're just trying to pull it off

1513
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:53,679
and they

1514
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:55,199
almost do but sort of don't but then we

1515
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:57,838
all learn to work together in the end

1516
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:57,838
you know whatever

1517
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,440
you know

1518
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,239
so

1519
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:14,159
you know kindly sloth there sort of is a

1520
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:15,838
game like that a tycoon style game it's

1521
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:18,078
not quite it doesn't have that humor

1522
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:19,038
part of it unfortunately but there is a

1523
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,160
game

1524
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,000
uh

1525
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:23,598
made by like there's this company that

1526
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,599
has like this one

1527
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,039
little like pixel engine

1528
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,039
for like

1529
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:32,079
management sims

1530
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:34,000
um and they ship like if you go on like

1531
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,760
the playstation store they literally

1532
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,519
have shipped like 20 games that are all

1533
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,680
exactly the same but they're just like

1534
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:41,838
rebranded like they just keep like

1535
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:42,798
changing the underlying thing

1536
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:44,400
and

1537
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:46,880
one of them is

1538
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,960
that you create a town for adventurers

1539
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,318
and adventurers show up and then they go

1540
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,440
out and they fight in a dungeon and they

1541
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:53,279
come back

1542
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,760
and like you build things like an inn

1543
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,519
for them or a you know an armory and

1544
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,799
whatever right

1545
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:00,400
and uh

1546
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:03,199
so it doesn't have the humor part

1547
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,200
unfortunately but it it almost is the

1548
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,919
game you're talking about just minus the

1549
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:07,919
humor right

1550
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,480
i actually think it's a good idea for a

1551
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,720
game i just don't think they made a very

1552
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,880
interesting game out of it

1553
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:16,879
but

1554
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,199
anyway all right yeah so so you know

1555
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:29,440
someone out there

1556
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:32,000
like like these are all gems just we're

1557
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,079
just these are just like golden golden

1558
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,519
gems we're dropping here

1559
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,680
gems aren't gold

1560
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:41,400
it's all right um

1561
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,399
dave made a dungeon

1562
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,200
yeah all right i'll stop thinking about

1563
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,400
that

1564
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:05,679
uh okay so what we want to do here is in

1565
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,920
the generator

1566
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:10,000
nonsense which probably just needs to be

1567
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,358
improved dramatically which is what we

1568
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,440
were going to do next anyway so that's

1569
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:16,960
all fine

1570
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:19,119
uh we we had a thing i think in here

1571
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,119
that generated the

1572
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:23,200
little floor tiles and you know other

1573
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,079
garbage like that

1574
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,519
um

1575
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,460
and

1576
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:29,519
i believe

1577
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:32,000
[Music]

1578
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:32,000
um

1579
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,798
so it's this this is this is it

1580
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,880
uh

1581
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:42,559
this tile switch pattern

1582
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,880
thing

1583
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,880
um

1584
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:52,318
and

1585
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:52,318
we must have turned it off

1586
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,760
somehow

1587
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,720
we yeah

1588
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:06,480
so for some reason we turned it off

1589
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:06,480
probably because we were doing stuff

1590
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,038
um

1591
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,950
baby's first dungeon would also be a

1592
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:15,838
pretty good one

1593
01:06:12,949 --> 01:06:16,558
[Music]

1594
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:18,318
so

1595
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,920
i probably need to do the thing where we

1596
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:22,159
start the hero so we don't have to like

1597
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,079
walk out through the orphanage thing

1598
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:24,798
um every time

1599
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:27,519
but

1600
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:28,960
for the time being for the brief

1601
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:30,960
moment

1602
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:34,720
um if we walk out to where the things

1603
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,599
are there should be switches now maybe

1604
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:36,959
um

1605
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:40,079
yeah

1606
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,240
so here's a bunch of random garbage in

1607
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,440
you know right like these switches and

1608
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:46,318
stuff

1609
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,519
and the idea was like as they like oh

1610
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:51,358
god

1611
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:53,358
um well hey guys we found a place where

1612
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:55,838
we didn't set the light values to be

1613
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:57,598
less than one

1614
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:59,038
uh wow that looks

1615
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,480
pretty cool

1616
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,079
actually

1617
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,920
um

1618
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,559
so these are the things that i actually

1619
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,559
wanted to

1620
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:09,920
uh

1621
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:11,919
those little switches is what i wanted

1622
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,000
i don't really remember much about how

1623
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,318
we decided to light them i think we

1624
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,639
create a light above them which like i

1625
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:21,358
said is not really what i wanted i wanna

1626
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:23,838
i don't actually want to create

1627
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:26,159
a new light there anymore

1628
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:27,599
um so i want to

1629
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:28,480
change the way that's being done and

1630
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,640
also

1631
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,838
like yeah gotta keep those light values

1632
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:33,038
under

1633
01:07:31,838 --> 01:07:34,000
one

1634
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,599
so

1635
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,679
that's not quite gonna cut it you can

1636
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,039
see here us adding the light it's and

1637
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:40,960
it's off

1638
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:46,000
um and then my assumption is in the

1639
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,000
brain uh when it gets stepped on

1640
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,358
i

1641
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:50,239
i assume it's in the brain does it get

1642
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:53,598
uh

1643
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:55,279
execute brain switches yeah there it is

1644
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,880
um

1645
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:00,319
i assume it turns on the light and it

1646
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,318
turns it on like wait yeah

1647
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:04,880
like not

1648
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,599
an acceptable light level of 10. one is

1649
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,798
probably still way too bright

1650
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,480
um

1651
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:12,239
but you know at least then it wouldn't

1652
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,559
feed back presumably and let's put the

1653
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:16,880
hero up near that stuff when it starts

1654
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:18,400
so i don't have to keep walking up there

1655
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,159
because unfortunately

1656
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,559
hot code reloading doesn't work with the

1657
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:25,119
world gen maybe it should

1658
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,120
like because obviously like the hot code

1659
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:28,880
reloading it keeps the world that you're

1660
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:30,479
currently in that's kind of the point of

1661
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,000
it but you know maybe we should just

1662
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,838
have a button

1663
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,759
so that we can regen the world anytime

1664
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:37,838
we want so that if we hot reload changes

1665
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,439
to world gen we hit a button and says

1666
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:41,039
hey yeah regenerate this world because

1667
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:43,678
we want to see the you know the thing we

1668
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:46,640
changed we want to see what it does

1669
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:48,480
you know we may need something like that

1670
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:52,960
um but anyway

1671
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:56,158
so uh when the hero

1672
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,759
gets placed in the world

1673
01:08:56,158 --> 01:09:01,439
um

1674
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,439
i think we can just say like

1675
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:06,600
probably that

1676
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,359
maybes

1677
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:11,359
um

1678
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,960
so what you can see here is like it's

1679
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,600
not very good what's happening it's like

1680
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:26,158
putting lights above the thing and it's

1681
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:29,359
not like that's not at all what you want

1682
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:32,000
so we're gonna start with a couple

1683
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:33,600
uh tweaks here just so we can start

1684
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,039
working on getting this lighting to be

1685
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,798
correct

1686
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:40,640
instead of what it actually is which is

1687
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:40,640
the opposite of that right

1688
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:44,198
um

1689
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:58,158
so the first thing is i think

1690
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:05,519
i i want to say and i'm i'm probably

1691
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:08,158
lying

1692
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,880
i want to say we don't need to add a

1693
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:12,158
light at all

1694
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,640
because our system is global

1695
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:16,719
illumination now and works pretty well

1696
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,920
i want to say we can just set the

1697
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,840
emission

1698
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,520
of the cube

1699
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,039
and when it gets pushed into the system

1700
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,480
it will just be set up as an occluder

1701
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:28,399
that's a light source i think

1702
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:29,678
right

1703
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:31,279
is the light never going away uh yeah

1704
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:34,000
the light those lights don't go away

1705
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:37,039
they get set they permanently turn on

1706
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,039
so i think

1707
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,679
uh

1708
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,840
i think these light pieces just don't

1709
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:46,679
need to be

1710
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,679
there um

1711
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,640
here's the question does downward

1712
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,400
dungeon

1713
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,400
need a theme song

1714
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:14,319
i feel like it does

1715
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,359
like i'm imagining something like the

1716
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:21,920
top gun theme

1717
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:24,719
but where someone is singing the words

1718
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:27,840
downward dungeon

1719
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,840
along with it

1720
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,560
you know what i'm talking about

1721
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:49,960
first time chat

1722
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:04,000
all right so

1723
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:05,039
uh i'm i'm just gonna vote for we don't

1724
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,359
actually

1725
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:08,359
do this

1726
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:14,640
so like this

1727
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:14,639
is not a thing

1728
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:20,479
um

1729
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:25,359
and so now like when we hop over these

1730
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,920
uh they

1731
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:31,198
uh they turn on

1732
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,679
and they do not add any lighting and we

1733
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:35,279
also should remove our lighting because

1734
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,560
we're not really supposed to have a

1735
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:38,639
light i mean

1736
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,520
sort of we can

1737
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,320
uh

1738
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,159
do a little bit of that but we we mostly

1739
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:46,158
right now have like sort of almost like

1740
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:47,198
debug lighting in there

1741
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:49,119
for

1742
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:50,399
the stuff attached to us and we don't

1743
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:54,319
really want that

1744
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:56,158
i do suspect that the glove should glow

1745
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:57,840
like that is true

1746
01:12:56,158 --> 01:12:58,719
um

1747
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,279
but

1748
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,279
i don't actually

1749
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:09,119
i don't actually want it to be

1750
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:13,440
particularly bright and you know th this

1751
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:15,599
0.1 as a light mighty might even be too

1752
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:19,000
bright um

1753
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,000
so we'll see

1754
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:23,279
like that might be a bit much you know

1755
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:25,920
like like it's not really supposed to be

1756
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:28,238
a light source per se

1757
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,239
um

1758
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:33,520
i mean maybe it is in a completely like

1759
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:36,319
the the darkest of dark rooms but it

1760
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:38,080
just feels like oh hi way to change a

1761
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:39,359
value that's not even in play

1762
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:42,158
uh

1763
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:44,479
but i just i yeah you know

1764
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:44,479
um

1765
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:48,960
so i think that yeah like that looks a

1766
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,800
little bit more

1767
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,600
like it to me so like if you're in a

1768
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,760
completely dark room right it should be

1769
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,880
it should be more like that

1770
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,760
you know

1771
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,359
i also think these should be

1772
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,119
face

1773
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:06,479
um

1774
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:09,760
which they are not

1775
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:12,799
of course i don't remember at all how

1776
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,880
you make something stone face so

1777
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,119
there is that

1778
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,119
um

1779
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,520
my assumption is that that is just

1780
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:23,600
something that's set on the entity

1781
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,840
piece

1782
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,840
where

1783
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,679
it's it's going to be this

1784
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:34,399
uh asset tag

1785
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,520
so i assume that in here like this asset

1786
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:38,319
tag

1787
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,440
wants to be set to the stonework i mean

1788
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:41,519
eventually it wants to be set to the

1789
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:42,399
actual switch tile which nobody has

1790
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,280
drawn

1791
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:44,238
so

1792
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:45,679
you know

1793
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:46,879
there's that

1794
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,800
but uh

1795
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:51,279
that's what we actually want

1796
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:54,719
so when these get added here like the

1797
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:54,719
stone floor stuff

1798
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:02,719
um i don't know where this

1799
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:02,718
happens exactly but in tile material

1800
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,319
you can kind of see yeah like here tile

1801
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,039
type

1802
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:14,158
and tile material

1803
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:17,359
oh it's like wall or floor i see

1804
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:19,679
so so all we really need here is to just

1805
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:19,679
say

1806
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,560
um we're gonna for now switch it to this

1807
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:26,000
other thing really we should have

1808
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,840
our own

1809
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,560
um

1810
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,440
like

1811
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,039
we would we would like what not flowers

1812
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:34,238
uh we would like something that's

1813
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:35,039
specific

1814
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,559
to

1815
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,800
being a switch

1816
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,239
but at the moment we don't have that so

1817
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,440
we'll just leave it

1818
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:44,319
um

1819
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:46,879
as it is but this way uh they're cleaner

1820
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:48,880
because they're not like wood switches

1821
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,159
you know that wouldn't light up it

1822
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,760
doesn't look anything like something

1823
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:53,439
that would light up so that looks a

1824
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,600
little bit better right

1825
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,198
and so now what we want to do is make

1826
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,159
those

1827
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:01,919
like

1828
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:04,238
uh actually emit light instead of just

1829
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:07,359
their color brightening when you step on

1830
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:09,599
them you know what i'm saying to you

1831
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,599
um

1832
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:21,759
yeah i don't know what's up with the

1833
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,679
four coder

1834
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,719
project no one has told me

1835
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,600
actually

1836
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:29,439
so i don't even know what's up with it

1837
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,760
um

1838
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:34,559
is it like going to be like open sourced

1839
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:36,480
and kind of like abandoned or like like

1840
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,400
pooted forth to the community or is the

1841
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,718
plan that someday it will get started

1842
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:43,039
again or what i have no idea like what

1843
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:45,279
the idea is

1844
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:45,279
um

1845
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,840
uh behind it

1846
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,760
i re i really don't know

1847
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:58,479
oh this dude came in god what are the

1848
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,159
problems of having like no real like

1849
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:02,559
one of the problems of having your maps

1850
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:04,559
actually be real maps is that if the ai

1851
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:08,480
is not artificially constrained to stay

1852
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,480
in one place it can go wherever it wants

1853
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:15,039
did one of the heads face her wall yes

1854
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:17,759
they right now the collision detector is

1855
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:19,760
turned off completely

1856
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,760
uh

1857
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,000
this because we we were doing some stuff

1858
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:26,400
with it it's not turned on so any

1859
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,319
floating entity can go straight through

1860
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:30,559
a wall if it wants to

1861
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:32,079
uh probably we won't even do floating

1862
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,480
entities that way we'll probably make

1863
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:37,519
them have to use the uh

1864
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,519
other way of doing things

1865
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:42,158
where they actually occupy tiles but at

1866
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,600
the moment

1867
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:46,000
those guys are basically considered

1868
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,679
projectiles which means they are allowed

1869
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,960
to just phase straight through walls if

1870
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:50,560
they want to

1871
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,840
um

1872
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,080
so like

1873
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,079
uh

1874
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:02,158
i here's the thing though now that i

1875
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:04,238
think about it i do think they

1876
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:07,679
do require

1877
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:09,198
a accessible square they do check though

1878
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,560
whether they're allowed to move in a

1879
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:12,639
square

1880
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,480
so now that i think about it what i said

1881
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,360
isn't totally true

1882
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:18,238
their

1883
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:20,158
their flight path like they can go

1884
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:20,959
straight through the wall

1885
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:22,319
um

1886
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,319
if they

1887
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:26,880
if they're going between two squares

1888
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:28,719
that they could move between but i guess

1889
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,480
technically they can't phase directly

1890
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,000
through the wall that way

1891
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:34,639
um

1892
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,238
but like my point is that if i took this

1893
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,880
curve tight

1894
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:41,678
it you know it can

1895
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,679
um it can like if i go fast enough it

1896
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:46,319
could go through the wall like

1897
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,840
that right as long as it's moving

1898
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:50,000
through like

1899
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,239
to a space it could actually occupy i

1900
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,279
think it can't um

1901
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:55,839
while the collision detector detector's

1902
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:58,800
turned off so so it's not quite as

1903
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,920
it's not quite as free as i originally

1904
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,360
described

1905
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,359
um

1906
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:04,359
so

1907
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:12,319
oh okay so for coder is going to be open

1908
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:13,760
source that's kind of cool because i

1909
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:14,960
would go i have access to the source

1910
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,920
code right now because i said a couple

1911
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,198
of things i wanted to fix like the

1912
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,960
clipboard thing

1913
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:20,319
and so if it was open source i think i

1914
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,640
would contribute some stuff to it when

1915
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:24,639
we come across stuff on stream like that

1916
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,800
um

1917
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,320
just to get it in into a good like

1918
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,840
finishing state

1919
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:31,759
because we'll use it on we'll keep using

1920
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,079
it on stream so

1921
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,079
you know

1922
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:39,800
um i

1923
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,800
so

1924
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:55,279
the biggest problem for us here is just

1925
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:57,439
going to be the self-illumination

1926
01:19:55,279 --> 01:20:01,759
stuff

1927
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:04,759
because that is not currently in

1928
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,760
our

1929
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:08,679
vocabulary

1930
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:13,279
right

1931
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:16,079
in other words the biggest

1932
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:16,079
obstacle

1933
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:22,000
to our success

1934
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:23,199
is that in here you can see like

1935
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,520
the

1936
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:26,799
flag stuff

1937
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,600
and

1938
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,719
so if you set these um like cube light

1939
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,560
occluder

1940
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:35,119
how we were getting light sources before

1941
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,440
is we set this flag

1942
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:40,960
and the problem is that those lead to

1943
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:40,960
like separate switches

1944
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,920
you know what i'm saying

1945
01:20:56,479 --> 01:21:00,638
so our problem is really just the

1946
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:02,158
encoding of that and how do we want to

1947
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,719
actually represent that because when we

1948
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:07,679
go then to look at entity output code

1949
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:09,600
you can see i'll be more specific

1950
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:12,480
um you can see here that like it's going

1951
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:15,280
to pick one of these

1952
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:18,559
but what we actually wanted to do

1953
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:19,439
um is this

1954
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,520
while

1955
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:23,519
sending down self-illumination

1956
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:30,158
and in fact

1957
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:32,319
it looks like imizion

1958
01:21:30,158 --> 01:21:34,479
uh is actually something you can send

1959
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:38,399
down uh does that mean if i set this to

1960
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:38,399
one like all our cubes become lit

1961
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,079
lit cube bro

1962
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,279
all right

1963
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:47,519
so

1964
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:49,198
if that's true then really all we're

1965
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,880
talking about is a way to set this

1966
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:51,678
emission value

1967
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,880
right

1968
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:56,719
um and if we can set that emission value

1969
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,480
then we don't really need to change

1970
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,079
anything we just you know we just need

1971
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:02,000
to be able to

1972
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:04,639
have the code that was previously

1973
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,079
messing with the light source

1974
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:10,880
nonsense we're just making this

1975
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:12,399
uh

1976
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,600
we're just gonna set the emission

1977
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:16,000
instead

1978
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,000
that's it

1979
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:21,079
okay

1980
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:21,079
um

1981
01:22:21,409 --> 01:22:25,079
[Music]

1982
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:48,279
well

1983
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:57,158
stretching

1984
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:14,000
i mean i'm not sure what we want to do

1985
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:16,479
here but we could do it like alpha is a

1986
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,479
mission

1987
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:22,799
or we could just make this thing bigger

1988
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:24,960
i don't know

1989
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,679
what the heck is cube uv layout even

1990
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,679
defined as

1991
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:35,359
so bitmap piece is 32 bit and qb layout

1992
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:36,880
is u16 so actually we could keep this

1993
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:39,519
the same size and just say that when

1994
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,119
you're in the cube uv layout paths

1995
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,280
path

1996
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:46,559
um

1997
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:46,559
there's actually an emission

1998
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:51,440
value in there

1999
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:52,639
right

2000
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:56,399
um

2001
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:56,400
like a 16 bit omizian value

2002
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,359
that's pretty straightforward

2003
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:02,799
um

2004
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:05,679
because 16 bits is more than we would

2005
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,679
actually need anyway

2006
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:15,238
so we could do something where we just

2007
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,239
did like this

2008
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,489
uh and then

2009
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:24,489
[Music]

2010
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:30,520
uh put an emisian value in there

2011
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:38,079
like we could have both of those two

2012
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,080
things in there you know

2013
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:45,840
uh

2014
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:45,839
i

2015
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:01,440
yeah all right so let's pack an omizian

2016
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,840
value in there and see what that does

2017
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:03,839
for us

2018
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:10,920
we also don't need to call it cube uv

2019
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:10,920
layout anymore because that's obvious

2020
01:25:17,949 --> 01:25:26,119
[Music]

2021
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:26,119
now

2022
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:30,238
all right

2023
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:32,559
so there we go

2024
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:36,119
uh and now we just need to use that

2025
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,120
emission value

2026
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,480
in

2027
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:46,479
here

2028
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,639
so what we need to do is unpack the

2029
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:58,639
emission value and this is dumb

2030
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:11,119
uh but sometimes we are dumb

2031
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:20,960
i won't quote frank zappa in the

2032
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,199
interest of keeping the stream from

2033
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:26,319
family friendly

2034
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:28,960
but you're welcome to look up

2035
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:30,399
uh dumb all over i believe is the song

2036
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:34,800
name

2037
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:34,799
uh let's go ahead and

2038
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,719
try this

2039
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,439
since no one

2040
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:46,800
right now

2041
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:46,799
should be setting that value

2042
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:51,039
uh

2043
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:54,719
we should be

2044
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:57,119
fine there should be no immersion cubes

2045
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:58,239
and and i don't see any so that seems

2046
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:01,599
good

2047
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:03,359
uh and now if we go into the brains of

2048
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,960
the operation

2049
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:06,719
uh and

2050
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,480
we look at the

2051
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:10,000
uh

2052
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:12,479
this

2053
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,479
garbage

2054
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:16,840
uh in theory

2055
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:20,158
we can just say that

2056
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,679
now uh the emission

2057
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:24,158
of this thing

2058
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:26,719
is going to go up to some number

2059
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:28,479
and i don't know what number it's going

2060
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:30,480
to be

2061
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:31,599
i have no idea i don't have a sense yet

2062
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:32,879
because we only just did the lighting

2063
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,600
system

2064
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,119
um how bright a bright light is so i

2065
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:39,120
don't know

2066
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:40,158
um that

2067
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:42,158
looks

2068
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:44,399
uh shockingly like

2069
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:47,759
it did not do anything

2070
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:50,238
you know i don't want to be

2071
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,960
uh i don't want to be too

2072
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:54,638
bold in my assertion but you know it

2073
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:58,239
really doesn't

2074
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:58,239
uh so what happened

2075
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:05,119
there we set the cube emission

2076
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,639
it is a piece type cube

2077
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:09,359
i believe

2078
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:10,480
we don't pass the emission all right

2079
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:12,799
good

2080
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:15,839
yep on top of it as always really

2081
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,840
crushing it there

2082
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:24,559
okay

2083
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:25,920
that's what we wanted

2084
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,800
so now we're getting our

2085
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,800
self-illumination there

2086
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:35,039
and that's all good

2087
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:40,799
so that's good

2088
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:42,399
but it looks to me like we are not

2089
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,679
sending that down to the light system

2090
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:45,599
though because like

2091
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:48,079
over here there's no light it's

2092
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,400
self-illuminating properly but it's not

2093
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:53,359
actually telling the lighting system

2094
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:54,638
about that self-illumination

2095
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:55,519
right

2096
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,369
um

2097
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,560
so what we would prefer

2098
01:28:57,369 --> 01:29:00,639
[Music]

2099
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:04,239
uh here

2100
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,239
is if we could

2101
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,039
make it so that when you do a push cube

2102
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:14,480
if the emission is set it sets the

2103
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:16,719
vertices right to the omission

2104
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:19,198
um so let's see

2105
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:21,359
what's happening here i'm not say that

2106
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:25,039
that's i literally just said a word

2107
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:26,079
salad that is not correct

2108
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:30,000
um

2109
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:31,279
so what i mean to say is the occluder

2110
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,520
right so

2111
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:35,039
the occluder should be pushed

2112
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:37,040
there

2113
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:39,679
i don't know why i said that

2114
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:41,679
so here's the push cube function

2115
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,960
um

2116
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,119
and to be completely honest with you i

2117
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:48,319
don't know how this whole thing works

2118
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:49,198
anymore because it's been too long

2119
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:52,198
um

2120
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:52,198
but

2121
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:02,959
somewhere in here it adds the cube

2122
01:30:00,319 --> 01:30:04,399
to the occluder set

2123
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,079
i mean it would have to or this entire

2124
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,879
game wouldn't work so we know that

2125
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:08,880
that's happening

2126
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:15,520
but to tell you the truth i don't quite

2127
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:17,760
see

2128
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:20,080
where

2129
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:23,119
am i the only one is confused

2130
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:25,600
um right like in the push cube function

2131
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:29,198
this should have to push

2132
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,199
an actual clue around maybe it does it

2133
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:35,840
does it do it in here somewhere that i'm

2134
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:35,840
not seeing i don't

2135
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:42,960
i don't see it

2136
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:51,359
like this i would have expected this

2137
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:54,000
to have to call this right

2138
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:57,039
uh to call push a cluedoor

2139
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,359
so that it it would know that this is a

2140
01:30:57,039 --> 01:30:59,359
thing

2141
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,560
hmm

2142
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,600
oh

2143
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:11,119
oh

2144
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:12,480
wait do you just set both

2145
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:14,399
no but you couldn't set both because

2146
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:17,119
this is an else if clause so you ain't

2147
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:20,519
setting both right

2148
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:20,519
that ain't happening

2149
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:47,439
i'm gonna have to step through this

2150
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:47,440
because frankly i just don't remember

2151
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:58,560
does it add an occluder manually

2152
01:31:55,119 --> 01:32:02,399
when we generate the room

2153
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,400
i mean is that how we rolled this

2154
01:32:05,439 --> 01:32:09,919
i

2155
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:11,920
i mean we could have uh

2156
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:14,480
right it's totally possible that that's

2157
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:14,480
what happened

2158
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:20,639
so here's the generated room call

2159
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,319
there's it adding the cube

2160
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:31,519
there's it adding the light

2161
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:39,158
there's it adding the ceiling occluder

2162
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:39,158
um

2163
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:49,479
so i guess it really does

2164
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:49,479
no that's only for trees

2165
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:03,759
so how is it doing this

2166
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,880
i think i just assumed

2167
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,840
this entire time i've been assuming that

2168
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,719
those

2169
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:19,159
that that's how that worked

2170
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:19,158
um but i guess i was mistaken

2171
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,120
no

2172
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:31,039
it's this code right here

2173
01:33:29,119 --> 01:33:33,599
so it looks like we add the occluders

2174
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:33,600
manually

2175
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,920
so that's

2176
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:40,960
that happened

2177
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:43,279
um in here

2178
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:45,600
so is light

2179
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:46,719
i guess is what we need to deal with

2180
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,760
here

2181
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:50,719
so

2182
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:53,440
what we would want to do i guess is say

2183
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:57,520
that if the omission value is non-zero

2184
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:57,519
then we do set it to is light

2185
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:02,079
to be completely honest i

2186
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,880
don't know that we really need that

2187
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:06,960
we could presumably just

2188
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,079
um

2189
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,359
i mean the lighting system doesn't

2190
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:10,880
really care about that but what the

2191
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:14,880
lighting system does need to know is is

2192
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,880
something an emitter or not right

2193
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:21,439
so we don't really have a good place for

2194
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:24,560
a floating point value here other than

2195
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:26,638
to modulate the reference color

2196
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,960
so it's like really what you would

2197
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,199
probably want to do here isn't you'd

2198
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:33,679
want a refsee and is light would be like

2199
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:36,799
an emission c as well so you don't

2200
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:38,239
really have an is light right

2201
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,239
um and i don't know if we want to go

2202
01:34:38,238 --> 01:34:41,678
that far right now but maybe we do

2203
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:43,519
i don't know because we kind of know how

2204
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:44,840
the lighting works now we we pretty much

2205
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,639
know what's up

2206
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:49,119
right

2207
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,118
and so

2208
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:54,238
you know if we wanted to

2209
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:55,920
we could just make these

2210
01:34:54,238 --> 01:35:00,839
be

2211
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:00,840
we could just make that f32 be emission

2212
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:06,300
right

2213
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:12,720
um

2214
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:12,720
[Music]

2215
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:22,600
let's take a gander

2216
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:33,118
so that literally is the only place

2217
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:38,520
so yeah i mean

2218
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:47,638
i mean yeah

2219
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:06,039
i i'm i'm gonna suggest we just do this

2220
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:36,920
so now that value is directly

2221
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,920
controllable

2222
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:43,399
um

2223
01:36:55,279 --> 01:36:58,960
we don't care about the sphere stuff

2224
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:06,198
what do we do with hiddemizion

2225
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:28,159
i mean these could just be added now

2226
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:30,559
and should be added now

2227
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:30,559
right

2228
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:34,439
um

2229
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,319
shouldn't they be added shouldn't this

2230
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:43,319
be added

2231
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:43,319
like

2232
01:37:49,359 --> 01:37:53,679
like max

2233
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:55,039
max is a nice guy

2234
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,960
right i don't want to say anything bad

2235
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:59,679
about him but max just doesn't seem like

2236
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:01,600
the right choice here like if we have a

2237
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:04,239
reflected color

2238
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:07,039
and we have an emitted color

2239
01:38:04,238 --> 01:38:09,279
wouldn't we just add them together

2240
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:09,279
um

2241
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:17,840
i don't know

2242
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,920
we need the rendering equation we need

2243
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:28,238
jim caggia's rendering equation

2244
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,520
all right so now these are set to

2245
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:31,599
emission

2246
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,360
um and we can see them but we would like

2247
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,480
them to do in the lighting system and i

2248
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:37,118
believe

2249
01:38:34,479 --> 01:38:38,718
we have fixed that i believe we have

2250
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:40,079
uh so that now

2251
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:41,679
we should in fact i guess we don't even

2252
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:43,519
need to restart the game because it's

2253
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:46,158
not a startup thing

2254
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:50,719
um we should be able to add some code in

2255
01:38:46,158 --> 01:38:50,719
here so that when you push an occluder

2256
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,600
um

2257
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,360
we could we could more or less just say

2258
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,960
that that

2259
01:38:55,359 --> 01:39:00,000
there's no difference between pushing a

2260
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:02,800
light source and pushing an occluder

2261
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,800
right i think

2262
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:12,158
so here are the two calls

2263
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:13,519
um

2264
01:39:12,158 --> 01:39:15,198
and

2265
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:17,040
all we i think

2266
01:39:15,198 --> 01:39:18,319
they're exactly the same

2267
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:19,519
like there's no difference between these

2268
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:22,158
two things

2269
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:24,000
so i think now we can just stop with

2270
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:26,319
that and say push

2271
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,399
a lighting element or something like

2272
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:30,158
that you know what i mean

2273
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:32,719
um and then we would just say like

2274
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:35,359
what's the color

2275
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:38,399
uh and what's the emission

2276
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:41,279
and we would uh

2277
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:45,679
pass the emission through

2278
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:47,359
and set the color as suchly

2279
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:49,600
um

2280
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:49,599
and

2281
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:56,400
and then in order to do the lighting

2282
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,319
element thing

2283
01:39:56,399 --> 01:40:00,638
like you'd now just translate the other

2284
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:03,439
two calls into whichever one of those

2285
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:05,520
you actually wanted

2286
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:07,359
and we could also get rid of the concept

2287
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:10,000
that there's a light and an occluder as

2288
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:12,158
separate things i won't just yet but we

2289
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,399
certainly can

2290
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:14,399
um

2291
01:40:14,479 --> 01:40:20,399
so let's get rid of some of this stuff

2292
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:22,719
and and try to clean that up so if we

2293
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:26,559
want to push a lighting element on

2294
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:27,359
um all we need now to do is say

2295
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,639
that

2296
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:32,880
the color passes through in the rgb a

2297
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:37,118
style where because we encoded the

2298
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:39,679
emission in the a value didn't we

2299
01:40:37,118 --> 01:40:41,279
for lights that's how that worked

2300
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:42,880
um and i guess like i'm saying we can

2301
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:44,719
sort of undo some of that stuff in a

2302
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,239
little bit here because now we have an

2303
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:49,039
actual emission

2304
01:40:46,238 --> 01:40:53,519
we have an actual emission encoding

2305
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:56,000
um so then uh in here when we're doing a

2306
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,800
piece type occlude or

2307
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,198
then

2308
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:01,119
we push the same we call the same

2309
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:02,799
function but we do it slightly

2310
01:41:01,118 --> 01:41:04,639
differently where now

2311
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,199
um we're going to pass the amis we're

2312
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:09,520
past the omission as zero

2313
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:09,519
right

2314
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:15,359
um

2315
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:15,359
and and we don't have an alpha value

2316
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,920
because i mean we never did that was

2317
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:21,198
getting clipped off of there there's no

2318
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,719
such thing as alpha in the lighting

2319
01:41:21,198 --> 01:41:24,719
system we don't have translucent

2320
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:25,760
lighting at the moment

2321
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:27,279
right

2322
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:30,719
um okay

2323
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:33,279
so i think that's now encoded properly

2324
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:34,960
and the only thing that we didn't do and

2325
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:36,000
of course it won't do it for the ones i

2326
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:38,000
already stepped on so i guess when i

2327
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,520
said this wasn't a startup thing i was

2328
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,639
sort of lying

2329
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:43,440
um

2330
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:46,719
the thing we need to actually do is set

2331
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:49,519
the occluder's emission

2332
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:51,279
right um

2333
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:55,560
to to be the

2334
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:55,559
yeah you know what i'm saying

2335
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:08,319
well

2336
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:11,198
still don't see any light

2337
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:13,519
so i'm not feeling too good about that

2338
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:13,519
um

2339
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,320
i suppose technically we want them both

2340
01:42:15,198 --> 01:42:18,238
to be set

2341
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:20,399
to an emissive value

2342
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:21,519
uh because we also want the base one to

2343
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:22,960
be

2344
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,880
but we don't know which of these is

2345
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:27,039
which on here i suppose so that's kind

2346
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,719
of another problem

2347
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:31,039
but when we create those

2348
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:33,359
ground elements

2349
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:33,359
um

2350
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:38,079
yeah i mean it should be i mean you know

2351
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:39,920
we probably should be a little cl

2352
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:41,279
cleaner about this uh

2353
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,960
to make sure that these things line up

2354
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:44,960
properly but

2355
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:47,359
if we're at the first one

2356
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:51,279
we'd set the emission here uh and the

2357
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:51,279
second one we'd set the emission here

2358
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,480
that should have worked

2359
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:00,960
so i'm a little weirded out that it

2360
01:42:57,198 --> 01:43:00,960
didn't but we'll go we'll check it out

2361
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:04,960
what would translucent lighting even be

2362
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:07,199
like participating media

2363
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:10,480
right

2364
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:11,919
um god rays would be an example of

2365
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:12,959
of that sort of thing

2366
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:15,920
water

2367
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,920
like murky water

2368
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:21,678
so like yeah like that is not emitting

2369
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:23,359
any light in the lighting system so i

2370
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:25,840
think we're still not really sending it

2371
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:25,839
down

2372
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,119
how much time we got

2373
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:39,519
we have

2374
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:42,719
just a few minutes left so i would say

2375
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,719
with our few minutes left

2376
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,960
big stretch

2377
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,040
and

2378
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:51,359
we've

2379
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:51,359
uh

2380
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:55,480
we've have it all

2381
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,560
i'm not sure oh by the way you know the

2382
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:12,719
other thing is we have the light leaking

2383
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:14,800
problem a little bit

2384
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:16,239
because now we allow that sort of weird

2385
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:20,199
kind of sampling to happen when this guy

2386
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:20,198
comes over you'll see what i mean

2387
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:24,480
come on over

2388
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,440
come on guys there we go

2389
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:32,959
um

2390
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:32,960
no it's not coming over

2391
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:36,879
well that says i can do it maybe

2392
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,480
i mean i guess it's really not bad

2393
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:45,919
enough to worry about i was going to say

2394
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:47,439
because we now do the thing where we

2395
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,880
actually do jittered lighting positions

2396
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:50,559
like that we will have more light

2397
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,199
leaking but i guess it's just not good

2398
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:54,320
bad enough to worry about

2399
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:58,079
um anyway what i was going to say is

2400
01:44:54,319 --> 01:44:58,079
with we got a little bit of time left

2401
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:07,198
maybe i'll just uh step into this code

2402
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:08,000
uh so here's we made it a mid-or right

2403
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:10,158
um

2404
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,399
and

2405
01:45:10,158 --> 01:45:14,799
i guess let me let me actually set

2406
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:16,879
myself up for success by

2407
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,960
going into the code that actually like

2408
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:19,760
puts these fourth

2409
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,840
and

2410
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,920
checking to see when we have an emitted

2411
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:24,719
a one that has a mission

2412
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,639
uh

2413
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:28,239
in it you know

2414
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:30,639
so like if

2415
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:32,319
domitian is greater than zero

2416
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:33,279
um

2417
01:45:32,319 --> 01:45:34,079
oh

2418
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:37,198
hi

2419
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:37,198
i'm still an idiot

2420
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:41,279
nice work casey

2421
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:42,960
that's twi i did the same thing twice in

2422
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:44,319
a row the first time i was like oh that

2423
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,079
didn't work because i didn't actually

2424
01:45:44,319 --> 01:45:48,079
pass the value second time oh that

2425
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:49,198
didn't work and i didn't pass the value

2426
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:50,559
how many times are we not going to pass

2427
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:51,678
the value

2428
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:53,360
all right let's double check that that

2429
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:54,960
doesn't just work before i go debug the

2430
01:45:53,359 --> 01:45:58,519
thing

2431
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,520
hey look that worked

2432
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:05,519
all right so we can now turn these

2433
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,520
lights on

2434
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,520
uh which is fine

2435
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,880
um and

2436
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,719
they don't seem to be

2437
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,719
the color seems to be off and i suppose

2438
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:17,118
that's probably because

2439
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:19,439
um we need to set the color of the

2440
01:46:17,118 --> 01:46:22,479
emitter as well

2441
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:23,678
uh so we probably want to tweak this but

2442
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:25,678
i would say we did everything we wanted

2443
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:26,960
to do today so i i'm happy with that and

2444
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:28,079
we'll pick it up again next week and i

2445
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,679
said today was going to be short and i

2446
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:31,679
wasn't kidding

2447
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:34,840
so um

2448
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:34,840
you know

2449
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,760
and you can see here why i was saying we

2450
01:46:43,359 --> 01:46:46,960
should add a glue we should add a bloom

2451
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,400
shader

2452
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:50,639
um because

2453
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:52,879
you know this looks nice and all but you

2454
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:54,960
want to emphasize the fact that it's

2455
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,880
like a bright light you want a little

2456
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:59,600
bit of a halo effect around it right you

2457
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:01,600
want a little bit of that blurring out

2458
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,840
um and so this is why i was saying we

2459
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:05,360
want to add a post pass i think probably

2460
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:07,440
to do that because it's like for those

2461
01:47:05,359 --> 01:47:09,118
lit things on the ground that's really

2462
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:10,638
what's gonna sell it you know what i'm

2463
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:13,039
saying

2464
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:15,118
but i think we're good

2465
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:17,519
uh that was it

2466
01:47:15,118 --> 01:47:20,238
um this may be a bit too bright in terms

2467
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,239
of emission

2468
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:23,799
hard to say

2469
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,560
that seems better

2470
01:47:41,439 --> 01:47:45,439
i would also say we probably have to

2471
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:47,600
tone that down a little bit on the ramp

2472
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:50,319
um

2473
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:52,639
well maybe not i don't know

2474
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:54,399
anyway

2475
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:57,199
that's all i want to do today and like i

2476
01:47:54,399 --> 01:47:58,799
said today's gotta be a short day so

2477
01:47:57,198 --> 01:47:59,759
that's it

2478
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:03,039
um

2479
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,039
i don't really have anything else to say

2480
01:48:03,198 --> 01:48:07,759
it worked yay

2481
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,440
no real tough stuff today

2482
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:11,520
very simple

2483
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:13,198

01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:54,639
me and anna do a movie club on sub stack

2502
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:56,800
if you like talking about movies it's a

2503
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:58,239
podcast that you might be interested in

2504
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,159
forgot to mention that i'll mention it

2505
01:48:58,238 --> 01:49:01,678
next time more prominently but if you're

2506
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:03,439
interested in that if you like talking

2507
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:05,039
about movies

2508
01:49:03,439 --> 01:49:07,118
and you're tired of the way people

2509
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:08,560
normally talk about movies these days

2510
01:49:07,118 --> 01:49:10,000
you just want people who think about the

2511
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:12,080
movie a lot

2512
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,359
and talk about what's in it

2513
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:15,039
it's for you

2514
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:16,559
all right that's it

2515
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:18,238
the first movie was interstellar by the

2516
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,920
way and that's the podcast that's up

2517
01:49:18,238 --> 01:49:23,519
there right now it was recommended by

2518
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:23,520
the members of the movie club they said

2519
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:26,319
we're gonna do

2520
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:27,919
uh

2521
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:29,118
interstellar and it was it was a really

2522
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:30,639
fun discussion i liked talking about

2523
01:49:29,118 --> 01:49:32,079
interstellar a lot so if you want to

2524
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:36,079
check it out check it out that's where

2525
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:37,198
it's at mollymovieclub.com go for it

2526
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:39,519
um

2527
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:40,960
the uh question about whether i'm going

2528
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:44,320
to watch better call season six

2529
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:46,880
absolutely but uh i watch it on netflix

2530
01:49:44,319 --> 01:49:49,118
which i don't think has season six yet i

2531
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,359
only just watched season five cause they

2532
01:49:49,118 --> 01:49:54,000
only just got season five so i'm way

2533
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:55,279
behind on better call saul i love better

2534
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,560
call saul

2535
01:49:55,279 --> 01:50:00,800
i think it's not as good as it was the

2536
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,920
the first two seasons of better call

2537
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,719
saul

2538
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,719
better

2539
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:07,359
call saul

2540
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:09,439
are probably the best two seasons of

2541
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:11,920
television

2542
01:50:09,439 --> 01:50:14,000
that exists it is by far the best

2543
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,760
television writing i've ever seen the

2544
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,840
first two seasons

2545
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:20,560
seasons three through five

2546
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:22,480
were good they're still a good show but

2547
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:25,119
they're not that

2548
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:27,439
right um they're not

2549
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:29,118
like this is the best thing i've ever

2550
01:50:27,439 --> 01:50:29,839
seen kind of stuff

2551
01:50:29,118 --> 01:50:32,399
so

2552
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:34,239
so i would so my thing is like i'm less

2553
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:36,158
like invested in the show now because i

2554
01:50:34,238 --> 01:50:38,158
don't think it's as good as those first

2555
01:50:36,158 --> 01:50:39,439
two seasons i still will absolutely

2556
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:41,439
watch the rest of it because it's still

2557
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:42,638
a very good show compared to any other

2558
01:50:41,439 --> 01:50:44,960
show right

2559
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:47,118
but i wasn't as like hype as i was with

2560
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:48,920
seasons one and two were unbelievable

2561
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:52,079
i'd never seen anything quite like that

2562
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:53,440
so um

2563
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:55,359
rook tag you don't necessarily need to

2564
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:57,198
watch interstellar to enjoy the podcast

2565
01:50:55,359 --> 01:50:59,679
but if you ever plan on watching

2566
01:50:57,198 --> 01:51:02,079
interstellar i would say watch it first

2567
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:03,279
because we really talk a lot about

2568
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:05,039
everything that's in the movie and like

2569
01:51:03,279 --> 01:51:07,039
how it's structured and how different

2570
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:10,158
things worked and all that sort of stuff

2571
01:51:07,039 --> 01:51:13,039
so it's gonna totally destroy

2572
01:51:10,158 --> 01:51:14,319
any first impressions you could have of

2573
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:17,439
the movie

2574
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:19,118
so it's really assuming that you know

2575
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:21,359
like it's the ultimate spoiler warning

2576
01:51:19,118 --> 01:51:22,559
right like do not listen to a molly

2577
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:25,920
movie club

2578
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:27,039
podcast episode for a movie you plan to

2579
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,279
watch

2580
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:31,920
right

2581
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:33,118
um and we mostly do old movies

2582
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:34,639
so like

2583
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:36,238
you know

2584
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:38,000
presumably everyone has seen a lot of

2585
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:40,158
these movies but

2586
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,639
if you haven't we give plenty of warning

2587
01:51:40,158 --> 01:51:43,920
like we say look this this is the movie

2588
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:47,118
that's coming up

2589
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:48,880
you know in in three weeks or whatever

2590
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:51,198
so you have plenty of time to watch it

2591
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:54,239
we just expect you to watch it right so

2592
01:51:51,198 --> 01:51:56,799
there's it's it's super spoilery

2593
01:51:54,238 --> 01:51:58,158
it's it's it's like more spoilery than

2594
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,440
anything else

2595
01:51:58,158 --> 01:52:03,000
is right

2596
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:03,000
so um

2597
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:05,920
so basically like

2598
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,440
you know

2599
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:08,239
picking apart a movie like that where

2600
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:10,238
you start talking about all the

2601
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:11,839
nitty-gritty you then can't have an

2602
01:52:10,238 --> 01:52:14,238
honest first impression of it right if

2603
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:15,360
you've heard that before you've seen it

2604
01:52:14,238 --> 01:52:17,198
so

2605
01:52:15,359 --> 01:52:18,079
so that's what i would say so so if you

2606
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:20,719
have any interest in watching

2607
01:52:18,079 --> 01:52:23,760
interstellar don't go to the podcast yet

2608
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:24,719
watch interstellar first

2609
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,639
um

2610
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:29,039
and then

2611
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:31,920
listen to the podcast

2612
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:34,238

the ones that are coming up

2622
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:54,879
um because we wanted to do ones people

2623
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:57,118
recommended interstellar and we wanted

2624
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:58,560
to do movies that we thought it would

2625
01:52:57,118 --> 01:53:00,399
make sense

2626
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:02,080
um

2627
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:03,039
as to why

2628
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:04,719
like

2629
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:06,639
you know 2001 is very obvious because

2630
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:08,880
interstellar like pulls pretty heavily

2631
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:10,960
from 2001 you can kind of tell i mean

2632
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,480
all space movies do in a way it was kind

2633
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,800
of a progenitor right

2634
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:17,279
so we did a couple and wrath of khan is

2635
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:20,880
in there because

2636
01:53:17,279 --> 01:53:23,118
um we thought it was an interesting

2637
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:24,800
diametrically opposed movie

2638
01:53:23,118 --> 01:53:26,639
like

2639
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:29,279
i mean you i again don't really want to

2640
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:30,800
spoil anything but like

2641
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:32,960
you could say that they sort of are

2642
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:34,800
inverses in what they do right

2643
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:38,079
if that makes sense i mean not really

2644
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:40,639
but like or or what they do exemplary i

2645
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:42,800
would say right um so

2646
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:45,279
you know anyway all that's in the

2647
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:47,199
podcast uh so if you like movies and you

2648
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:48,000
like thinking about movies

2649
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:50,479
um

2650
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,198
as movies as opposed to thinking about

2651
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:54,959
them as culture which is all anyone ever

2652
01:53:53,198 --> 01:53:57,359
talks about now like nobody talks about

2653
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:59,439
movies anymore

2654
01:53:57,359 --> 01:54:01,920
except maybe you go find like a red

2655
01:53:59,439 --> 01:54:04,000
letter media episode or something maybe

2656
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:05,840
maybe does but like movie reviewers

2657
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,840
don't talk about movies at all if you go

2658
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,520
read a movie review they don't mention

2659
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:12,239
anything about the movie in the entire

2660
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:14,320
review um it's only like cultural or

2661
01:54:12,238 --> 01:54:15,919
casting and then like the internet only

2662
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:18,238
talks about like did this company do

2663
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:20,719
something bad or whatever right

2664
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:24,799
um and nobody talks about the actual

2665
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:24,800
like nitty gritty of like

2666
01:54:25,198 --> 01:54:29,519
okay so does this scene set up this

2667
01:54:27,439 --> 01:54:31,439
character to actually be sympathetic

2668
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:33,119
here or did they not really do that so

2669
01:54:31,439 --> 01:54:35,039
that this scene later doesn't really

2670
01:54:33,118 --> 01:54:36,799
land because of blah right or things

2671
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:38,479
like was the cinematography good here

2672
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:39,840
like did it actually convey the fact

2673
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:41,678
that these two things were in the same

2674
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:43,279
place or was the motion correctly done

2675
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:44,480
in here like we just kind of go into

2676
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:45,599
that stuff

2677
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:47,759
right

2678
01:54:45,599 --> 01:54:49,920
um

2679
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:52,320
so you know it's that kind of thing and

2680
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:53,920
so if you like that kind of thing and

2681
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:55,920
and you probably won't agree with us on

2682
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,279
everything right um because you're gonna

2683
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:58,800
have different opinions and we encourage

2684
01:54:57,279 --> 01:55:01,118
that the movie club is about tournament

2685
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,360
we don't care if people agree at all we

2686
01:55:01,118 --> 01:55:05,679
just want them focused on that so it's

2687
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:07,839
like we just try to like get people

2688
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:10,399
talking about that right like get them

2689
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:12,159
talking about what is in the movie and

2690
01:55:10,399 --> 01:55:14,559
if it worked for you

2691
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:16,719
or if it didn't work for you

2692
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:19,280
what are the actual things in the movie

2693
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:22,480
that made that happen right instead of

2694
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:24,000
just like i don't this this is not how

2695
01:55:22,479 --> 01:55:25,279
batman should be or something or

2696
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,198
whatever like statements that don't

2697
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:27,529
really make much sense

2698
01:55:27,198 --> 01:55:29,198
um

2699
01:55:27,529 --> 01:55:30,639
[Music]

2700
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:32,158
in

2701
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:34,239
their totally fine things to have a

2702
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:35,118
discussion about in the broader context

2703
01:55:34,238 --> 01:55:38,000
like

2704
01:55:35,118 --> 01:55:39,839
brand management and whether or not

2705
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,679
there's certain obligations to treat

2706
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:43,520
famous characters a particular way or

2707
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:45,440
any of that stuff right

2708
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:47,440
totally fine discussions to have but

2709
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:49,198
everyone's already having them like like

2710
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:52,079
those discussions are just like

2711
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:53,919
ubiquitous right so there's no need for

2712
01:55:52,079 --> 01:55:56,079
that because you can get that anywhere

2713
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:58,639
so we've tried to focus everything away

2714
01:55:56,079 --> 01:56:00,800
from that to basically like

2715
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:02,079
you know if it is a batman movie and we

2716
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,320
want to talk about how it uses the

2717
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:05,760
batman character does it do that well

2718
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:07,679
it's all we were really looking at right

2719
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,199
like like you know uh we're not going to

2720
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:11,279
complain because it's not our personal

2721
01:56:09,198 --> 01:56:12,839
version of batman or something right

2722
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:16,079
or we try not to

2723
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:16,079
anyway so

2724
01:56:16,319 --> 01:56:21,519
anyway uh all that kind of stuff so yeah

2725
01:56:19,238 --> 01:56:22,238
mollymovieclub.com that's it easy to get

2726
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:24,000
to

2727
01:56:22,238 --> 01:56:26,319
uh and

2728
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:29,118
yeah watch interstellar first

2729
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:30,399
uh if you haven't already and head over

2730
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:31,519
uh right

2731
01:56:30,399 --> 01:56:32,879
um

2732
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,480
and uh and the other thing that we try

2733
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:37,199
to do that we hope is interesting is is

2734
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:39,359
curate a good set of movies right like

2735
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:40,319
we try to pick movies that people should

2736
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:41,198
see

2737
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:43,279
um

2738
01:56:41,198 --> 01:56:45,198
to give them background

2739
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:47,118
uh that they might not have if they if

2740
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:48,479
they don't watch a lot of like older

2741
01:56:47,118 --> 01:56:50,079
films

2742
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:51,598
um or

2743
01:56:50,079 --> 01:56:53,439
films that are outside maybe slightly

2744
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:55,199
outside the mainstream we try to pick

2745
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:57,279
ones that are worth watching right like

2746
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:58,960
not just because like oh we think you

2747
01:56:57,279 --> 01:57:00,399
know really if you're not into foreign

2748
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:02,560
films you don't understand cinemas like

2749
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:04,319
some of that crap just like if there's

2750
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:05,599
actually things done well in movies we

2751
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:06,880
try to like point them out and say like

2752
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:08,560
hey this is a movie that does something

2753
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:10,159
very interesting here's what we think it

2754
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:12,960
is and why you might be interested in it

2755
01:57:10,158 --> 01:57:13,839
or whatever right

2756
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:17,198
so

2757
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:19,599
so anyway check it out easy to get to

2758
01:57:17,198 --> 01:57:20,559
and yeah i'll mention again on next

2759
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:22,319
stream

2760
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:23,840
so anyway thanks everyone for joining us

2761
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:26,079
i like the way this is shaping up next

2762
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:29,199
week uh try some level gen

2763
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:31,359
probably and then we gotta get combat uh

2764
01:57:29,198 --> 01:57:32,799
in there so just level down in combat i

2765
01:57:31,359 --> 01:57:34,799
think so the lighting looks nice now

2766
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:37,440
it's good enough uh for us to do

2767
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,639
whatever we need to do i think

2768
01:57:37,439 --> 01:57:40,960
all right everybody thanks for joining
