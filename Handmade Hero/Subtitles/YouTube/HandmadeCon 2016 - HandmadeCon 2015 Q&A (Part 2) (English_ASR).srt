1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,270
so ideally with something like this

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,298
where we started off with more questions

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,119
than we were going to be able to answer

4
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:10,710
we would not add questions to the list

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,018
but since folks came up and asked

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,660
questions we now have more questions

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:20,189
than we ended the previous session with

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,810
so on to our best a pretty good

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,320
multi-part question that got asked

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,759
actually just in the break that that I

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,199
thought was pretty interesting and I

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,780
kind of wanted hear what people had to

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,730
say about it was oftentimes we in you

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,558
know in the game industry we will pull

15
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,759
research from other places so you know

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:40,558
when you're working on something or

17
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,780
implementing something especially in

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,289
graphics but also in sort of other areas

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,090
we go get research from places that you

20
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,250
know isn't necessarily game industry so

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,710
it could be you know SIGGRAPH was a

22
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,969
common one back before games sort of did

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,439
a lot of the original research that's

24
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,390
into graph like that sort of stuff but

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,738
even today it's still very common but

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,359
then there's certainly obviously tons of

27
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:02,099
stuff like AI all those sorts of things

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,480
there's tons of publications and you

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,030
know oftentimes the games pull from

30
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,170
those so the two-part question I'll say

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,540
what both parts are but we're gonna take

32
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,890
them both separately the first part is

33
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,670
you know these papers oftentimes

34
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,109
regardless of whether the thing they're

35
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,239
talking about is you know going to be

36
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,890
useful or not are oftentimes kind of

37
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,349
they have a bit of a math wall in them

38
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,269
right or a Naumann klaich or wall where

39
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,099
you know if you might be a very good

40
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:27,450
programmer but you're you know coming to

41
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:29,039
this paper and you're looking at it and

42
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,469
you're like I do not know what I'm

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,509
looking at here right and so the

44
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,250
question is how do you start getting

45
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,450
past this pair here like how do you know

46
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,519
what do you need to do how do you need

47
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,659
to like start practicing to like be able

48
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,969
to start reading these papers and more

49
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,560
fluently and then the second part of the

50
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,810
question was assuming that you kind of

51
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,700
gotten to the point where you can start

52
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,859
using papers effectively you know how do

53
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,439
you find and evaluate them so just going

54
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,299
back to the first part to the math wall

55
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,859
part does anyone want to kind of start

56
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:02,368
on one I don't know I can I can probably

57
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:05,039
answer it sound really stupid but when I

58
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,718
look at those and I see a symbol I don't

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,789
recognize I try to find it on Wikipedia

60
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,788
and then figure out what the symbol is

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,908
and that's where yeah well Google's

62
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,979
really good at like what is the math

63
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:22,560
sign that is like this is an example

64
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:23,878
they go weird like half II kind of thing

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,500
and it'll come up with it'll show you a

66
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:30,750
picture and then yeah yeah so Google but

67
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,769
that's only gonna get you that only gets

68
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:44,729
you a little bit yes well I don't I

69
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:46,290
don't read a lot of papers either so my

70
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,908
wife is a biostatistician and so I

71
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:50,158
actually get to read some of her papers

72
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:52,318
and I know that there's a huge math gap

73
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:54,479
like she's way more advanced than me so

74
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,638
I do have a resource that helps me cheat

75
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,649
but I would say the first thing is like

76
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,909
the density of papers tends to be very

77
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,719
much higher than most of the reading you

78
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:02,848
do on the Internet

79
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,049
and so you're probably used to skimming

80
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:05,219
like this is what I do right mostly

81
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,989
internet reading I'm doing is skimming

82
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,340
even for programming stuff because it's

83
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,289
like yeah yeah yeah okay there's the

84
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,450
meat that's the line of code or that's

85
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:14,039
the the core function that I need when

86
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:15,539
you read science papers boy you really

87
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,948
have to just slow down a lot in your

88
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,179
reading and really like if you don't

89
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:19,949
understand the terminology you have to

90
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,349
go and read something else like go to

91
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,879
Google and get the terminology and and

92
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:27,709
then it's much more likely you can

93
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,709
actually use the results of those papers

94
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:40,079
so so about about the math wall I don't

95
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,239
find that that tends to happen to me in

96
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:45,030
terms of notation but it does happen in

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:50,158
terms of like concepts okay like do you

98
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:52,799
understand that you know I don't know

99
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,658
differential geometry has a certain set

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,209
of results and what that implies and

101
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:59,548
whatever and if you do you can follow a

102
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,500
thing and if you don't but but usually I

103
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,180
don't try to follow things that much

104
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,818
anyway I'm very impatient when it comes

105
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,949
to papers I'm like yeah yeah I don't

106
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:09,358
care I don't really care why this works

107
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:12,870
right now I just want to type the thing

108
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,250
that works and if that's promising then

109
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,379
I'll come back and build

110
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,298
understanding in fact that's even going

111
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:21,600
way back that's how I learned software

112
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:23,310
texture mapping which by current day

113
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,500
standards that's actually very simple

114
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,240
mathematics right but I would like read

115
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,370
Mike's articles and like Chris's

116
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,710
articles and like Mike's especially

117
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,870
right I would read those several times I

118
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:35,819
still didn't really understand I didn't

119
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,340
know what the one over Z thing was for

120
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,899
and like whatever right because I didn't

121
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,239
even at that time have experience with

122
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,919
like projection right all the experience

123
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,360
with projection that you have now from

124
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,920
decades of making games I didn't even

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,150
have like I literally sat down and

126
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,680
wanted to make games that didn't know

127
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:54,239
any of that so but I just kind of

128
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,189
started trying to understand a little

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
bit of it right like okay I'm just gonna

130
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:00,029
get a triangle on the screen with no

131
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,519
texture and then by the time I've done

132
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:04,109
that I actually have more context so the

133
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,849
thing actually this applies to my

134
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,650
approach to everything is just I'm

135
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,030
willing to let myself just be pretty

136
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:13,739
dumb for a while and not care because

137
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:15,929
human brains are really good at pattern

138
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,780
matching and learning and improving and

139
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,720
it doesn't need so much for you to

140
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,459
consciously try that hard right if you

141
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,050
immerse yourself in something for a

142
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,519
while you'll just kind of get it and

143
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,569
then you come back and if you really

144
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,109
need to read it again later and

145
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:32,490
understand it you know it's not like

146
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,290
you're gonna automatically understand it

147
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,269
but you're in a more privileged position

148
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,520
in the second time around right but my

149
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,529
second thing to say is I've been burned

150
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,209
so many times by papers that I think

151
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:44,489
most of them I don't go to papers as a

152
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,719
like if I see a paper that claims some

153
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,939
result like oh this algorithm does

154
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,430
something fast or I don't believe it my

155
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:53,759
default stance my default stance is that

156
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,680
this is not even toilet paper because

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,240
I've so many times I've put in the

158
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,840
effort to do something and then it turns

159
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,050
out well okay it may be 10% but they

160
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,399
haven't done the real work right and

161
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,290
that I may be a little bit over I've

162
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,379
over corrected in that direction more

163
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:13,050
cynical than I should be but really most

164
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,790
papers are not very good but some of

165
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,150
them are tremendously good right some of

166
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,590
them will change your understanding in

167
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:21,299
such a way that you are just on a

168
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:22,319
different level now in terms of being

169
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,478
able to approach a certain class of

170
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,610
problem and so it's it's very important

171
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,978
to like

172
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,210
keep an eye on stuff yeah but I don't

173
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:30,709
know how you know which is the right

174
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:32,508
stuff

175
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:35,089
I mean sometimes I guess you can kind of

176
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,620
get that from the word of mouth on a

177
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:39,019
particular paper and then you know

178
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:44,288
people I trust have been finding this to

179
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:46,459
be useful but it's really actually not

180
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:49,218
so even that's kind of saying where it's

181
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:51,109
hard to tell I suppose I was gonna say

182
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:53,209
something about the math wall sort of

183
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,069
separate from that that's that's very

184
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:58,938
much related to what Pat said which is

185
00:06:55,069 --> 00:07:00,229
just I think that most of the time if

186
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,270
I'm looking at a paper and I don't

187
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:03,620
really know what's actually going on in

188
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:05,329
the paper like it's obviously you kind

189
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,038
of read the abstract and the textual

190
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:08,870
part and you're kind of like okay well

191
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,490
obviously anyone who reads this is gonna

192
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,000
kind of vaguely know what's going on the

193
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,620
paper like some papers are maybe so sort

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,610
of far afield that you wouldn't even

195
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,560
have any idea what they're even talking

196
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,430
about but most of the time especially we

197
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,319
were talking about so you might be

198
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,740
reading for you know graphics for

199
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,569
example is the least a picture so yeah

200
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,340
you're not completely out too much so

201
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:29,750
you know typically the math wall part

202
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,429
usually comes in when they start doing

203
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,348
things it's like oh okay you know here's

204
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,879
some equation lines that aren't really

205
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:36,468
quite worked through all the way and

206
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,088
then they say some stuff and then

207
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:40,158
there's another one here and they don't

208
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:41,389
really quite relate exactly the way that

209
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:42,348
you might be obvious in blah blah blah

210
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,900
so you're kind of starting to go like

211
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:46,819
wait what about what's going on and I

212
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:48,888
find that when I actually do need to

213
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:50,598
understand those pretty much I just have

214
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:51,199
to redo the math myself on a separate

215
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,740
piece of paper

216
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,658
always so either the math was so obvious

217
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,519
when I looked at it that it was like you

218
00:07:56,658 --> 00:08:00,740
know high school algebra and anyone

219
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,538
could read it or it's pretty much I have

220
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,210
to flick I have to work it out it's rare

221
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:08,300
that I actually can read it just read it

222
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:09,769
and so I feel like the slowing down part

223
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,020
is like really important it's just like

224
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:14,329
okay I want understand this I'm just

225
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:16,008
gonna take my time I'm gonna like start

226
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:18,050
writing out the equations every you know

227
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:19,490
try to work them through myself but you

228
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,930
know maybe get confused about how they

229
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,329
got something and work it through and

230
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,338
then I usually find when I've actually

231
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:26,838
finally made the mental decisions that

232
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,449
I'm actually gonna take the time to

233
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:31,189
understand it then I can write whereas

234
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:33,800
before that it was just kind of like I'm

235
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,389
just moving around my eyes around the

236
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,818
page hoping that for some reason I

237
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,860
eventually start knowing what the math

238
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,629
did which

239
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,870
ever works right or or certainly hasn't

240
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:45,278
previously so let's move on to the

241
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,129
second part of that question which i

242
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:51,039
think is you kind of just brought up

243
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:52,659
which is like okay so how do you find

244
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,699
research and how do you know if that

245
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:56,199
research is good so you know maybe

246
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,610
you're working on some kind of a problem

247
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,810
and you think that this problem is

248
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,659
probably something that people have

249
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:03,129
studied it's probably not totally new

250
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,659
what's the process of collect is anyone

251
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:05,828
have any kind of experience stuff from

252
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:07,659
that where they'd be like here's how I

253
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:09,729
you know here's an example of how I

254
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:12,610
might look for for research on something

255
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,560
just even if it tends to be kind of a

256
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,220
crappy solution like what does that look

257
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:20,018
like dead

258
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,639
you know the web search will get you a

259
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,470
little of the way so for the witness

260
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,629
this didn't end up in the shipping game

261
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,420
but when we were initially building the

262
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:30,250
island for the game we even know if it

263
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:32,729
was gonna be you know a parameterised

264
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,509
surface right or if it was gonna be hand

265
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,039
constructed we ended up with hand

266
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:38,110
constructed in a modeler but for the

267
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:39,939
first few years of game it was like

268
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,810
moved some control points around and we

269
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:47,380
like you know interpolate the surface

270
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:48,518
and I had some requirements on that that

271
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,559
meant that it couldn't be like the

272
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,789
standard spline sheathing that you would

273
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,328
think of it had to be a different thing

274
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:58,539
and I just like searched for like you

275
00:09:55,328 --> 00:10:00,639
know terms like an interpolation of

276
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:03,338
unstructured control points or something

277
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,990
and usually you don't really find the

278
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:07,269
right thing that way but if you spend

279
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,940
like literally a day doing that like of

280
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:14,649
eight hours of trying you will probably

281
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:16,329
find something if it exists usually well

282
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,149
how might I describe this in a way that

283
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:20,620
I could see a paper yeah yeah and then

284
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:22,179
sometimes you'll find things that aren't

285
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,339
the right thing but they might refer

286
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:26,828
like you start learning about the

287
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:30,730
subject space of like okay this is not

288
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:32,019
what I want but it's in some field and

289
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,459
I'm seeing the field a little bit better

290
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:37,448
which might teach me more about the

291
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:42,879
keywords to look yes yeah so that worked

292
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:44,740
in that instance that was good Wow I

293
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,539
think some of it is the conclusions the

294
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,698
paper draws like and look if you run

295
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:50,588
this code then we can simulate thousands

296
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:53,838
of objects on a computer

297
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,220
that's the evaluation part right look

298
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,230
what you've already found it it's like

299
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,759
when you look at that time that table of

300
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,829
timings that they're proud of and you're

301
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,750
like oh you right because the maximum

302
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:04,099
number is like way below what you know

303
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,399
you could actually use in a game so

304
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:10,600
you're like well okay so I have a answer

305
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,740
to this one which is that I actually

306
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,250
typically do it almost exactly the same

307
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:20,419
way every time which maybe is good maybe

308
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:22,549
as bad so what I typically do is I first

309
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:24,919
go through the publication's that I know

310
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,899
of that correspond to this thing so for

311
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:30,229
like for SIGGRAPH I usually will

312
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:32,929
manually step through like SIGGRAPH in

313
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,209
reverse chronological order right and go

314
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:36,500
in that bucket because I don't know if

315
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,149
you ever seen half SIGGRAPH proceedings

316
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,339
are laid out they like bucket them by

317
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,289
group and I'm like for the group that I

318
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:44,690
care about here what are the five papers

319
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:46,969
that that are in that group and I just

320
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,860
look to see if the sort of thing that

321
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,170
I'm interested in has had anything in

322
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,519
the SIGGRAPH recently because typically

323
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,649
I find that's a really good way to kind

324
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,990
of like jump up to date on something

325
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,698
that I may have let slide because you

326
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,379
know I don't do that much graphics

327
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:02,208
programming anymore so I I'm not like

328
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:04,490
really in the know about what's going on

329
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:07,489
there so that's usually a good way to

330
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,440
catch a few things the next thing I'll

331
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,690
typically do is take whatever those were

332
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,550
that I found and just resource crawl

333
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,569
them I mean I reference crawl them so in

334
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,559
that you know the thing where it's like

335
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,208
the bibliography

336
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,629
I'll just go like okay let's just grab

337
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:23,869
all of what those papers are and also by

338
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:25,250
professor so if I fly if I get any kind

339
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,440
of pull from that at all I'll look at

340
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,690
who the professor was that's on that

341
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,920
paper or any co-authors that are on that

342
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,420
paper because they the professor that

343
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,159
oftentimes students I suppose who are

344
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,439
writing the paper but whoever is writing

345
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,750
the paper because they usually have

346
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,060
websites and those websites are usually

347
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,318
categorized by sort of what they've been

348
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:44,239
working on recently and they'll

349
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:45,828
typically be like oh here's some things

350
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,810
and oh that paper was actually the

351
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:49,458
lead-up to the thesis that I wrote and I

352
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,888
got bingo like I've got the thesis now

353
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,838
and so on and so I find that if I

354
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:56,810
actually kind of do this manual spider

355
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,100
process if I can just get one good pull

356
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:03,559
I can get the whole like nets worth of

357
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:06,620
dolphin slash tuna in that like you know

358
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:08,539
in that process if that makes sense so I

359
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,669
don't know maybe I'm the only one who

360
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:12,409
finds that useful but that's that's been

361
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:14,688
typically my go-to for a long time the

362
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:16,458
only time that it becomes really hard is

363
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:18,409
if you can't find any place to get an

364
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:20,929
initial poll so like if you're in a

365
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:23,688
thing we're like I literally have no

366
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:25,429
idea if there even is a publication

367
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:28,458
somewhere that even talks about this

368
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,748
thing at all or if it did it's the kind

369
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,948
of thing that's almost impenetrable to

370
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:32,899
search so it's like they don't have

371
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:34,758
online indexes or anything so I just I

372
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,860
can't even get it most of the time I

373
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,659
think in reality that's very rare I feel

374
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,308
like it especially these days but that's

375
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:42,679
actually not the hard problem the hard

376
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:44,629
problem is is again the I don't know

377
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,239
what I don't know problem right yes so

378
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:51,499
like going back to to the earlier days

379
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,019
right like Ken shumake had his famous

380
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:56,180
quaternion paper that was like here's

381
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:57,980
how you could rotate 3d objects right

382
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:59,299
which was a very important paper because

383
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,430
part of that everybody was doing like

384
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:03,979
janky Euler ankle stuff not even game

385
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:05,659
people but like computer graphics didn't

386
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,449
know how to rotate objects correctly

387
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:11,149
right and that was not a new research

388
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:13,429
paper that was like no the guys who do

389
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,990
spaceships like know how to do this yeah

390
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:19,519
I'm gonna communicate it to a different

391
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:21,558
audience yeah right and so the fact that

392
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,149
that exists like how many of those

393
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:25,490
papers have not been written because

394
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,990
somebody didn't have the idea that this

395
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,149
other community might be interested in

396
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,649
this thing it's got to be like of

397
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:32,750
relevancy to games it's got to be

398
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:34,308
hundreds right well probably there's a

399
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,139
two-stage process there to a certain

400
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:39,049
degree as well which is that like the

401
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,938
only reason that paper was able to be

402
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:43,519
written is because somebody in the

403
00:14:40,938 --> 00:14:45,198
spaceship field had read math stuff on

404
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,568
patterns because otherwise they wouldn't

405
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,878
have known to apply quaternion math to

406
00:14:47,568 --> 00:14:52,009
astrophysics anyway right so yeah can I

407
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:52,990
have that sort of thing probably just in

408
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,009
general although I suppose since

409
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,480
quaternions kind of came from physics in

410
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:59,629
the first place that's probably kind of

411
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,399
a I mean yeah but he was trying to

412
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:03,230
describe rotations in 3d space so it

413
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,698
wasn't yeah it wasn't like this thing

414
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,470
that we didn't really think about and

415
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:08,328
then it came down but you know let's

416
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,610
imagine other mathematical concepts

417
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:12,349
which were not created to do anything

418
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,360
that had anything to do with computer

419
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,290
stuff pulling those in in the first

420
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,970
place takes one step of somebody going

421
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:19,618
hey this thing that I happen to do when

422
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,850
I was working on some abstract NASA I

423
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,259
think I could use that here for a

424
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,089
practical problem and then there's the

425
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,289
like oh what other practical problems

426
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,600
could it actually applied to and that's

427
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:28,948
like a second step that night neither of

428
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,839
which may happen in which case you're

429
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:33,058
kind of just sitting there going we'll

430
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,799
never know we're still waiting for your

431
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:38,219
paper by the way on using Taylor series

432
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:40,168
expansion for estimating the division

433
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,548
coordinate for quaternions because we

434
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:43,588
stole that well you know you told us

435
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:45,389
about that idea for guild wars in 2004

436
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:54,089
something like that right that's a great

437
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:55,859
idea okay but I never used the Taylor

438
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,389
series expansion for it oh well it was a

439
00:15:55,859 --> 00:16:00,089
different expansion then it was maybe a

440
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:02,129
it was an estimation of the lower term

441
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:05,039
of the division term so I think what

442
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:08,609
that was is just that it's it's actually

443
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:11,548
a trick I want to say that I saw from

444
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:13,559
maybe Carmack or something there was not

445
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:14,788
for quaternions at all but it's

446
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:16,649
basically just like if you want to

447
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:18,178
renormalize something so you have

448
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,249
something that you're going to you know

449
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,600
take that was normal before and you do

450
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:25,288
something you want to renormalize it

451
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,609
right it's just a really simple first

452
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:28,078
order approximation of how to

453
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:30,269
renormalize something if you know that

454
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,828
original length was what close to one

455
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:34,078
you could get it back there so I'm

456
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:35,938
pretty sure I don't need to write a

457
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,378
paper there's a point at the original

458
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:42,168
that's like the kind of instruction that

459
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:45,808
shipped in 3d now and whatever whatever

460
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:47,818
and so I think I might be able to to

461
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:50,249
magically point to that paper without

462
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:51,928
actually do it because yeah that I stole

463
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:53,399
that that I totally stole I just put it

464
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:56,159
on quaternions because it was on just

465
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,629
regular vectors like that so I spent

466
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,828
roughly like I'd written the animation

467
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:00,600
system for Cold War's and spent about a

468
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:03,088
month trying to optimize quaternions to

469
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,870
use less CPU and like you know so

470
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:08,480
approximating like a 1 over square root

471
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:11,609
of sine or something like that

472
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,838
slurp yeah and it's it's nasty and like

473
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:14,188
so I did all these approximations and I

474
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:15,778
never would be like these weird 3d

475
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,339
models that would animate like you know

476
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:19,138
a bunch of points that are obviously

477
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,750
supposed to like look like a character

478
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:25,769
look like a mess and you came along with

479
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:29,449
your solution and it just looked for his

480
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:29,449
tweet stream this to point this out

481
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,590
up there but I knew I stole that I knew

482
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,659
I stole that from because people had to

483
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:37,069
renormalize you know vectors all the

484
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:38,778
time just just standard

485
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:40,668
three-dimensional vectors and since

486
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:43,009
quaternions are based they're just the

487
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,809
same you could just apply it so I I

488
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:46,579
think we probably even had been using

489
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:48,619
that in the characterization system

490
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:50,990
probably just for regular vectors and I

491
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:52,908
just like I'll just four elements just

492
00:17:50,990 --> 00:18:01,250
as easy or something like that I just I

493
00:17:52,909 --> 00:18:04,360
just wanted to say it's what lets the

494
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,359
hand go on the doorknob

495
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,649
so if I if it hadn't have been like over

496
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:17,089
a decade since this happened I could

497
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:19,308
probably read arrived it but I'm pretty

498
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:22,970
sure I won't remember how to do it is

499
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:24,259
the problem it's basically yeah I'll ask

500
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,058
a question and see if I can do it on

501
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:27,128
notebook and then I could show it's

502
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:30,618
really simple

503
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:31,998
but I just yeah since I wasn't the

504
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:33,259
person who figured it out originally -

505
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:34,819
it's more of a thing that I just

506
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:36,139
remember someone telling me how to do

507
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:37,609
whereas you know if you actually work

508
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:39,439
something out yourself oftentimes it

509
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:42,618
kind of sticks a little bit better at

510
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,720
least for me all right so let's let's

511
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:46,069
ask the last part of that question just

512
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,950
in case there's anything we didn't

513
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:51,439
actually cover which is for a cigarette

514
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:55,850
paper or for you know any kind of math

515
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,769
paper that's in this in that range how

516
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:59,209
do you evaluate one to know if it's good

517
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,740
and it sounds like your answer is it's

518
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,860
the answer is it's not sir you don't

519
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:06,109
evaluate no I mean there's a there's a

520
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:08,599
small probability that you know there's

521
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:10,490
some curve but it's very steep where the

522
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,408
really good papers are clustered at the

523
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,808
end and then but most most of them are

524
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:20,539
like something a guy wrote cuz he had to

525
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:22,999
publish a bunch of things like and it's

526
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:25,179
really it varies by discipline you know

527
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:27,860
but in computer science it's pretty bad

528
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:31,100
it's not a good situation the ratio is

529
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:32,359
not good yeah I guess you were saying

530
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:33,740
one way is to look at just the

531
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:35,599
conclusion right you're just looking at

532
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,659
kind of like when they showed the

533
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,158
results what does that section look like

534
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,259
I guess basically like how how much

535
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,119
confidence do you place and if it

536
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:45,740
doesn't have any results listed at all

537
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:47,480
I'm assuming the answer she stowed yeah

538
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,618
usually I read the abstract to find that

539
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,058
I'm in the right paper and and everybody

540
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:51,949
conclusion to see what the results were

541
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:53,569
and then the sieve that warrants reading

542
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,028
the rest of the papers so it's like the

543
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:57,740
middle gets gets pigeon if the two ends

544
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,599
look good basically there's also like

545
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,480
some authors are reliable so like if

546
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,969
Catan is on a paper okay it's probably a

547
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,099
good paper okay it's just that most

548
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,319
people are not kaha or whoever okay so

549
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:10,998
that's the problem well so the basic

550
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,528
going by author is one way as well

551
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:14,808
potential yeah but then you're not going

552
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:18,079
to hit most fields or sub headers right

553
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:18,740
yeah all right so let's go off of that

554
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,168
to that

555
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,849
topic was surprisingly silent I guess

556
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:24,380
that kind of means maybe we don't use

557
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:25,849
research as much as we think we do I

558
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,190
don't know I feel like I use it maybe

559
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:31,339
not we used to more in the in the older

560
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:33,200
days yeah like back when like now it's

561
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:35,928
most of our bottlenecks are just getting

562
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,190
everything done which like if I could

563
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:39,409
read a couple bucks that helps with that

564
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,558
that would be great but it's it's not

565
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:45,799
like I have a lot of you know I don't I

566
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,450
don't perceive technology barriers

567
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:56,000
between me and what I'm trying to do

568
00:20:47,450 --> 00:21:01,250
these days all right let me pick another

569
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,259
one here so this one kind of applies to

570
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,849
what we talked about yesterday and it's

571
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:07,339
kind of a it's kind of an interesting

572
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:08,569
question because I feel like it gets it

573
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:11,298
gets brought up a lot it got brought up

574
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:15,319
at Hamid Khan 2015 as well and it comes

575
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:18,349
from a poo from India who actually also

576
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:20,058
makes the papaya which i think is a

577
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:24,139
network actually it's like a open source

578
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:26,119
image editor when creating an engine or

579
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,610
shipping a game what do you look for in

580
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,619
a file format for asset data how do you

581
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:33,229
balance compression versus speed versus

582
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:35,389
readability etc and sort of like

583
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,429
separate from that is is there a

584
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,929
particular best file format you've

585
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,298
worked with in some case where you're

586
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:43,690
like this kind of does things right you

587
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:47,648
know more often than it does wrong

588
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:50,120
thoughts on that I always get bit by the

589
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,569
byte order stuff oh really

590
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:55,519
yeah I always do so I try to avoid that

591
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:59,269
stuff so you have only one byte value

592
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:01,069
yeah just 0 to 55 and everything

593
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:03,349
you know it's one of those things that I

594
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:06,349
think I don't have to worry a whole lot

595
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:09,319
about storage and load speed but I have

596
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:12,500
really gravitated towards file formats

597
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:14,599
that are asking at some level it aren't

598
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,970
a lot of binary stuff and I mean clearly

599
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,549
that does not work in a lot of a lot of

600
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,350
games for what I do I just kind of I

601
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:23,450
just kind of enjoy that because they can

602
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:25,399
also just pull up the file in a text

603
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,440
editor and see what else is going on

604
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,630
here yeah so I've I've kind of

605
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:35,960
gravitated towards kind of a you know a

606
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:37,820
very dense version of stuff so if you

607
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,319
take for example you were talking about

608
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:41,779
building a tool that allows you to

609
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:44,149
layout a room in Fenway Park that's

610
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,769
typically going to save out to some kind

611
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,259
of an ASCII file which generally people

612
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:49,759
aren't going to edit I guess but it is

613
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:51,410
actually gonna ask a description of it

614
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,750
yeah yeah I mean there are you know

615
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,029
using a big GUI tool and there there is

616
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,460
a point we're just going into an editor

617
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:01,039
and just going copy and then paste 50

618
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,960
times it's just a lot faster I've been

619
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,930
going through a GUI tool and I I kind of

620
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,140
like that kind of backdoor into that

621
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:11,750
data so I tend to tend to favor ASCII

622
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,310
stuff I have actually kind of an

623
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,230
interesting one so again this is the

624
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:17,809
model exporter for a girl were so we're

625
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,690
using 3ds Max's our animation and model

626
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,309
editing tool and 3ds max is notoriously

627
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,990
difficult to get data out of because you

628
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,579
can't read its file format that's not

629
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,019
documented in so I wrote a plugin that

630
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,699
would like live inside it and you'd

631
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:30,170
press a button and it would like go and

632
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,700
ask all the API is like here and then we

633
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,690
give vertex data and pull all stuff

634
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,150
together and what I would do is I'd

635
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,769
write a really simple file format it was

636
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,450
it was a chunked file format but like

637
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:41,329
the data was more or less exactly as it

638
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,769
came from max with no processing and

639
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:44,659
then I would run a second pass and then

640
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:46,700
I'd like converted into model format

641
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,490
data that was had to be super tightly

642
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,140
packed because Guild Wars was like

643
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,940
really early in the online game space

644
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,160
and we needed to download the whole game

645
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,960
I mean every single file so make them

646
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,640
small and tight and what that enabled me

647
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,900
to do is then in the build process like

648
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,060
I go you know I have a better way to

649
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,950
compress the animation data and so

650
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:05,359
instead of having to like you know take

651
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,340
this data which was like hideously

652
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,799
compressed and then reverse it which is

653
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:11,539
potentially lossy I congest should go

654
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:12,339
back to the source data and reprocess it

655
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:13,808
and get a new

656
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:16,000
junk out of that so that worked really

657
00:24:13,808 --> 00:24:18,940
well and that was so that you wouldn't

658
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,490
basically have to have something that

659
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:25,720
load max back up and reran the like

660
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:28,720
export process or something yeah was

661
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,220
like yeah got spurred games to this

662
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
trick I forget to the engineer was who

663
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,339
showed it to me but they had the system

664
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,409
where they would automate 3ds Max and

665
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:37,329
they'd say like okay just you know max

666
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:38,620
load up this file reprocess it and write

667
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,699
the results and they've just run for

668
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:41,589
hours and hours and hours this they

669
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,090
changed their model file format and so

670
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:44,980
that's like a different take on them you

671
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:46,750
know the problem of like recompressing

672
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,210
your data a different way it also seems

673
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,509
like it would keep you out of the

674
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,759
business

675
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:53,648
oh like max got upgraded and can't read

676
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,629
this sold file format currently so then

677
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:57,308
now that has to be artist intervention

678
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,630
for this process for some reason and

679
00:24:57,308 --> 00:25:01,450
it's like we can just avoid that because

680
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,990
as long as we saved the original export

681
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:13,360
we can always sort of Remus the data

682
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:15,399
without having to actually go back yeah

683
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:19,928
I mean I use ASCII stuff for like config

684
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:22,000
files but for me stuff like when I

685
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:25,090
integrated flash when I integrated a

686
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,700
spine as a spline I don't remember it's

687
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:30,970
the one that everybody uses but they

688
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:33,340
didn't have an a non ASCII format they

689
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,589
just had JSON files which was really

690
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:37,359
irritating because I want to be able to

691
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:39,009
just load in a big chunk of data and

692
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,859
just do stuff with it like like what I

693
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:44,710
do with the SWF file format I just chunk

694
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:46,990
done and what I save out for levels is

695
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,690
the same it's just a chunk file format

696
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,940
just as small as I could possibly get it

697
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,830
for you know levels or anything so and

698
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,940
the difference there you're saying you

699
00:25:53,829 --> 00:26:01,178
don't want to have to start parsing

700
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:03,610
things yeah yeah well yeah I well I had

701
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:05,679
to write a JSON parser which was fun but

702
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:07,959
I didn't I didn't want to have to do

703
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,490
that I wanted to just load in a thing

704
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:16,288
and just have all my things but yeah so

705
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:19,509
to speak yeah so for me it's more about

706
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:21,190
can like it's more about just what is

707
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:23,960
documented and what I can use and then

708
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,400
like with with spine they had

709
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,480
you know there are two formats and I was

710
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,920
forced to use this one because they

711
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,110
didn't have documentation for the other

712
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,120
one so they wanted me to use their

713
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:35,209
library to do all that stuff right now

714
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:40,639
so yeah it for me it really doesn't

715
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:43,370
matter well and I think what Pat said is

716
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,830
sort of the direction that most larger

717
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:47,719
games have gravitated toward and I think

718
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:50,029
it it reveals a little bit of an

719
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,079
assumption in the question which is that

720
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:55,730
there's a file format right okay I think

721
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,379
what there really is is there's things

722
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,140
that you need to happen at various

723
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,490
stages right either like when the

724
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,960
release game is going to load something

725
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,359
that needs to have certain

726
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,100
characteristics right our tool pipeline

727
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,539
needs different characteristics and so

728
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:11,139
you might have two different file

729
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:14,210
formats again for example for the mesh

730
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,790
at both of those stages right and then

731
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,890
that lets you not just make different

732
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:21,200
decisions about you know automatically

733
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:23,509
reprocessing to regenerate that second

734
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,490
format but now that second format can be

735
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:27,769
different on different platforms right

736
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,630
because what what is a mesh right like a

737
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:31,490
visual mash has different precision

738
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,770
requirements than a collision mesh and

739
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,900
if you're tight on memory you know you

740
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:40,039
might use half floats for water together

741
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,870
or whatever right so and that happens

742
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:44,809
all over the place so even you know

743
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:46,639
something like entities right we have

744
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:48,500
two different formats for entities

745
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,780
they're they're the same we meaning into

746
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:58,430
the witness yeah right there's not

747
00:27:50,779 --> 00:28:00,049
everybody but no and and so and that was

748
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,210
kind of driven by a little bit by a

749
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,980
desire for readability in fact the

750
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,360
original format was just text because it

751
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,400
was expected to be a small amount of

752
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,439
data of course when you have thirty to

753
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:14,120
forty thousand entities it becomes more

754
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,740
data right but but really you know you

755
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:18,769
also want to start the game up real fast

756
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,859
and load all those things and not you

757
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:23,900
know whatever you know use memory on it

758
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:25,939
as well or anything but we also had the

759
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,380
constraint that entities were one of the

760
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,420
main things that goes into and out of

761
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,660
source control so that's a binary file

762
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,700
format then you're in

763
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:36,580
because the second you have a merge

764
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,900
conflict you have to throw one or the

765
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:39,659
other version away you can't

766
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:44,620
well you can't merge it all really here

767
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:46,090
it would be kind of crazy right so so

768
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:47,949
there are reasons you have a text format

769
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:49,839
and reason to have a reason readable

770
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:53,650
format and reasons to have a binary

771
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:57,399
format and they're at different places

772
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:59,560
in different times and you just lay out

773
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,420
that architecture and decide what level

774
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:03,309
of complexity you're willing to adopt to

775
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:08,080
get the performance that you want and

776
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:10,599
then you do that right so I mean I don't

777
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,849
know like like I'm sure if Chris butcher

778
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,879
had done a survey of how many different

779
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:17,409
file formats have in the Bungie asset

780
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,510
system like that would have been a

781
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:23,580
two-hour talk at least like right there

782
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:28,599
right I assume I don't actually know but

783
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:31,449
it's just it's it's not that there's a

784
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:33,869
way to store data right there's Mike

785
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:39,039
Acton would say right you right they

786
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:40,809
either side of the data well I don't

787
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,879
know I mean I guess I guess that's a

788
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:44,980
little meta Acton right because he's

789
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,620
always about he's always about you know

790
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,019
me program to the data but when you can

791
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,939
also determine the data that will make

792
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:59,470
the best program they write that right

793
00:29:51,940 --> 00:30:00,730
so so I don't know if that that sounds

794
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,620
like you're basically saying you don't

795
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:06,190
really look for something specific in

796
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:08,379
file formats so much as you say look I I

797
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,900
know what it needs to do on either side

798
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,430
of it well II so whatever I look for in

799
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,759
it is just what are the things that make

800
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:17,799
those parts work well or is that yeah

801
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,720
yeah and it's contextual so if something

802
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:21,250
is a small amount of data were more

803
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,309
likely to be text only so like the

804
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:26,410
variables that you said to control like

805
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:28,000
gravity or whatever we don't ever ever

806
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,070
have ballistic things in the witness

807
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,670
anymore but there's still a grab gravity

808
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:32,649
variable

809
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,450
you know player friction or whatever

810
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,980
right that's like you know there's

811
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,420
probably a hundred variables or

812
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,509
something and those are just in a text

813
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,129
file

814
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:43,209
and there's no reason to do it another

815
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:45,498
way it's not a freakin JSON file great

816
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:48,288
because that stuff drives me bananas

817
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:49,940
because the the promise of like oh we

818
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:51,499
have this general file format and all

819
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,019
the tools will make it amazing to work

820
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:55,969
with that's never true right it's always

821
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,249
easier to just go like search for the

822
00:30:55,969 --> 00:31:00,619
line that says player acceleration and

823
00:30:58,249 --> 00:31:01,848
change that to whatever and then because

824
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:04,249
it's our own format we can do small

825
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:06,678
things so I don't know if you hinted us

826
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:08,598
at this or somebody did but like anytime

827
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,879
that we have a floating point value for

828
00:31:08,598 --> 00:31:12,948
example in one of these files we put the

829
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:15,048
human readable value and then like

830
00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:17,929
semicolon and then the hex value right

831
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:20,088
so that if it hasn't been edited you

832
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:22,219
load the hex value and you get exact

833
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:23,868
reproducible reproducibility of your

834
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:25,548
float value won't wander if Yuri save

835
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:27,138
the file or whatever right through bit

836
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:29,959
errors but if you want to edit it you

837
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:32,898
just delete the hex value in just thing

838
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:34,699
and then it's human editable right so

839
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:36,348
that's a weird hybrid thing that's a

840
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:40,099
little bit of a machine format a little

841
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:41,658
bit of a human format and we just

842
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:45,769
decided on that as being the best thing

843
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:47,149
for us at the time right so I like to

844
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:50,659
keep the text formats very small and

845
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:53,628
simple how do you know I am almost

846
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:56,089
certain so much you can you might even

847
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:57,588
Charles it could have been Charles so I

848
00:31:56,088 --> 00:32:00,440
feel like that's an odd world it could

849
00:31:57,588 --> 00:32:02,178
be how do you know do you just assume

850
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,038
that one bit errors are close enough

851
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:05,899
because if you can't reproduce the

852
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:07,249
original float from the ASCII how do you

853
00:32:05,898 --> 00:32:09,048
know if it's been edited you just assume

854
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:11,749
it fits well it's way worse if you

855
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:13,219
printf in Windows you're not down to one

856
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:14,659
bit error half the time I don't think

857
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:16,969
they might have fixed that right so I

858
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:19,729
can start saying how do you know that

859
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:22,459
the whether the user has the reason that

860
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:25,098
the hex and the float don't agree is

861
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:28,038
because the user edited them or because

862
00:32:25,098 --> 00:32:29,269
the precision is just off actually let

863
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:31,038
me correct you do it I said let me

864
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:33,019
correct that even if it's a one bit

865
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,699
error right that's one bit per load

866
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:37,068
andrey saves right and received that

867
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:38,359
like correct 500 times i don't know

868
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:39,828
where that numbers gonna go right that's

869
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:41,418
not usually how it works usually it'll

870
00:32:39,828 --> 00:32:43,459
it'll get into its local max because

871
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:45,528
it'll save the same well if it's a

872
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:48,078
scalar right so now you've got a vector

873
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:50,069
and it's normalized or you know I don't

874
00:32:48,078 --> 00:32:52,500
even like there's just it's it's

875
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:56,039
not that simple right and I don't know

876
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,079
yeah either way I was just curious

877
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:04,859
so I sleep better at night when the hex

878
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:07,349
number is there when you actually

879
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:10,259
implement this Oh the other issue

880
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:12,179
actually is if that number wanders then

881
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,369
it's gonna generate spurious source

882
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,130
control check-ins and did write which is

883
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:18,750
a whole different thing thing which we

884
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:22,080
wanted a minimum we did a lot of tactics

885
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:24,059
in our file formats actually so there's

886
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,369
a little bit of a different topic but

887
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,839
like okay I've got energy data yes and

888
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:29,129
I've got all these different types that

889
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,500
the fields could bees there's float

890
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,970
types there's maybe vector types if you

891
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,220
decide that's a high level thing there's

892
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,049
string types and there's like an array

893
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,490
of the IDS of other things because you

894
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,960
want to know like oh this is a container

895
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:43,319
and here's what's in the container or

896
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,230
whatever right we made the choice to not

897
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:49,230
put those in the file format but because

898
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,370
it would generate dips and conflicts

899
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,569
like we don't necessarily care what

900
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:54,859
order things all right word but

901
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:57,720
subversion doesn't know that so so

902
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:59,519
because of that we said that kind of

903
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,470
thing is not in our file format and

904
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,539
anytime you have a collection of

905
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:07,610
entities it works backwards where the

906
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:09,779
entity knows who it's in right and then

907
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:11,759
startup time which is a little bit of

908
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,440
overhead but it's small right and that's

909
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,620
just to illustrate this is not an

910
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,740
isolated file format issue at all right

911
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:21,269
it's like a list of the things that I

912
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,159
connect with is a totally reasonable

913
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:25,320
thing to have in a file format and yet

914
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,940
for our requirements it was causing

915
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,120
problems every family different way to

916
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,380
do it so okay I just want to ask the

917
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,969
original question there cuz I don't

918
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,919
understand it

919
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:37,439
so I print out a floating point value

920
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:39,389
yeah I print out the hex version of a

921
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,070
floating point value right and

922
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:43,079
presumably the reason I'm doing this is

923
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:45,360
because the print out routine for the

924
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,889
floating point value and the scan

925
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,470
routine that loads the floating point

926
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:51,418
value back in is no guarantee you never

927
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:53,668
did the work to make those River people

928
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:56,429
have since right right I mean nobody we

929
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:57,690
didn't nobody done this the C runtime

930
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,070
library that I'm calling let's say I

931
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,200
didn't write it sure no it's just I'm

932
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,260
calling this function and I know that it

933
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,960
won't be reversible yeah so

934
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,369
now I go to load the file in and I load

935
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,220
the file in and I see that the two

936
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:11,750
numbers are not the same how do I know

937
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:15,289
whether the reason that they're not the

938
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:17,269
same is because the user edited it or

939
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:19,550
the reason they're not the same because

940
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:21,530
when the user I mean give me where I'm

941
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,660
wrong here but when the user edits the

942
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:27,440
floating point value you delete the hex

943
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:29,000
value okay we might have also measured

944
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,460
the magnitude of the difference as well

945
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,349
like if it's a if it's a significant

946
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,300
difference you you can do it just just

947
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:36,739
as a way to like okay maybe they forgot

948
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,510
to delete that part or whatever but I

949
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:40,129
think I think we just delete the value

950
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,600
so basically the user goes in the text

951
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,300
file they change the floating point

952
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:47,000
value they need to remember get rid of

953
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,140
the hex load because otherwise we're

954
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,960
just gonna overwrite your floating point

955
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:55,099
value next time you say this thing yeah

956
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,630
and this is interesting too because what

957
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:59,000
we're saying right now only applies to

958
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:01,608
the entity files right which are rarely

959
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,989
edited by anyway and those get saved out

960
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:05,420
all the time when you save stuff in the

961
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:08,629
editor for stuff like the variables that

962
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:10,490
I was talking about before the computer

963
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,289
doesn't ever write or you know we ended

964
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:14,689
up writing sometime later I guess but

965
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:16,820
the main ones are read-only and so we

966
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,960
don't care about this right right and so

967
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,220
we don't then we don't have that

968
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,500
potential mistake of forgetting to

969
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:23,118
delete the X float as well all right but

970
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,829
but you know it's it's hard to cuz you

971
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:29,090
put it it's like one space away from the

972
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:31,639
number so you see it just totally spaced

973
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:33,350
yeah all right so I don't know why I

974
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:37,190
really wanted to do so many things are

975
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:38,868
pretty cool I'm just like wait so okay I

976
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,349
kind of wanted to ask a little bit about

977
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:41,990
that

978
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:43,009
reverse storage part there because I

979
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:45,979
think that's kind of interesting thing

980
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:47,359
just in general which is that anytime

981
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,579
that you're storing information

982
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,619
you obviously have a choice you know if

983
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:54,289
it's information that involves sort of a

984
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:57,619
variable length list or something like

985
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:59,989
this you can either store something like

986
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:01,369
a list in the actual data format meaning

987
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:04,539
I can say okay this is gonna be a

988
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:06,440
variably sized thing in here that just

989
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:08,840
enumerates all the things that are

990
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,889
members of it or whatever or you can do

991
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,600
what you were talking about there which

992
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:15,769
is you can transform that into saying

993
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,690
everyone has a sort of back pointer that

994
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:20,349
says which

995
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:22,088
- my a member of right and what's

996
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:24,609
interesting about that is like so I'm us

997
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:26,858
you know benefits of that are like you

998
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:30,489
were saying it means that now it's

999
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:32,679
doesn't mess with an entity's data every

1000
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:34,088
time maybe that list order changes or

1001
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:35,318
anytime like something like this happens

1002
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:37,328
that isn't really something that you

1003
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:39,550
cared about but it does mean stuff like

1004
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:41,440
okay any you know things can only be in

1005
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,568
one list now right for example or now we

1006
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,010
need to start having multiple ones of

1007
00:37:43,568 --> 00:37:46,300
these and the reason I bring that up is

1008
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,770
I think that actually happens in the

1009
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,650
witness there were these times when you

1010
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:52,900
had to have stuff like reference one

1011
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:55,780
reference to because sometimes thing

1012
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:58,960
would have that was that was more you

1013
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:01,630
know like you've got like a marker in

1014
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,940
any title and what it wants to do is

1015
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:07,358
based on some string tag like says what

1016
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:09,130
like open a door if a person walks into

1017
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:10,838
this marker or whatever and just you

1018
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,059
whenever you do that you have different

1019
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:15,400
numbers of things that any of those

1020
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:17,710
handlers will care about those are just

1021
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,440
slots for that okay so we never ran into

1022
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:22,150
the specific problem of oh my god we

1023
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,950
can't I mean we sort of wanted to put

1024
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,139
things in more than one group but it was

1025
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:28,000
never a such a burning desire that it

1026
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:31,019
became a problem and we could have just

1027
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,869
said blood group two or whatever right

1028
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:36,909
okay so but but you know in a different

1029
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:38,800
game that might be more or the problem

1030
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:40,358
yeah it's but but it's like I'm saying

1031
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,280
it's contextual you solve the problem

1032
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:48,250
that you have as opposed to everybody's

1033
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:51,119
alright let's see here we are down we're

1034
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:54,159
actually making reasonable progress here

1035
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,780
this one comes from and and I think this

1036
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,848
was basically someone who submitted a

1037
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,410
question because they wanted to finally

1038
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:01,329
give me names that I would have no

1039
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:04,899
trouble pronouncing my cue from

1040
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:07,450
Amsterdam asks if you could go back in

1041
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,829
time and give yourself only one piece of

1042
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:11,939
advice at the beginning of your career

1043
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:11,940
what would it be

1044
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:31,980
I think I've got one if anybody ever

1045
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:44,579
tells you anything that's ready to

1046
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:47,039
finance or honestly though let's say

1047
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:51,569
that's all I'm thinking of is like maybe

1048
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:59,130
maybe spend the money on lawyers maybe

1049
00:39:51,570 --> 00:40:01,019
don't be afraid of them you know I think

1050
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:13,829
I think I would have told myself to be a

1051
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:17,460
lawyer of the panel says talk to a

1052
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:18,599
lawyer is the advice they would have

1053
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:22,250
given us us at the beginning of their

1054
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:28,559
programming career good advice probably

1055
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:31,679
John wanna either say make it 75% of the

1056
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,329
panel or do a different one yeah I'm

1057
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,969
having a hard time with that one if you

1058
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:38,340
restrict it to programming right if it

1059
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:41,129
has to be a programming piece of advice

1060
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:43,700
you know that I would give myself that's

1061
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:50,250
I mean I don't know that I can really

1062
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:53,099
think of one actually I think the thing

1063
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:54,510
that I mean you hear this a lot that I

1064
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:56,809
probably struggled with a little bit

1065
00:40:54,510 --> 00:41:00,840
early is just don't be afraid to fail

1066
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:02,639
you know just just try stuff no matter

1067
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,010
what and if it doesn't work just keep

1068
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,750
trying

1069
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,880
you know I think very early on in my

1070
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,909
career I was a little bit you know

1071
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,769
dejected by failures where well now I

1072
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:13,989
just I don't care about some level

1073
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:18,608
is that the sort of thing that basically

1074
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:20,108
like you know seeing this this maybe

1075
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:21,309
kind of relates back to the imposter

1076
00:41:20,108 --> 00:41:22,840
syndrome part of things that we were

1077
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:24,429
talking about earlier is it's a sort of

1078
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,760
thing that kind of is like well if

1079
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:29,349
you've if you experience failure and

1080
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,910
then have some successes then you can

1081
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:32,170
sort of start to put it in context where

1082
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:34,059
it's like Oh failures are those things

1083
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:35,858
that happen on the way to success but

1084
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:37,599
maybe it's like you haven't had a

1085
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:39,069
success yet so all you're sort of seeing

1086
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,569
as the failures or is this something

1087
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,280
that's more like no no I've had

1088
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:45,160
successes already at that point I just

1089
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,260
for some reason was still afraid of

1090
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:48,579
failure as a reason to not go do

1091
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,170
something or try something well I think

1092
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:53,049
I think a lot of it and maybe he doesn't

1093
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:55,780
go back to that imposter soon another

1094
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:58,450
thing is it's watching people I have an

1095
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,940
immense amount of respect for fail and

1096
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:05,069
and it is it's one of the reasons I

1097
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,070
enjoy watching your Twitter feed right

1098
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:10,000
you are one of you know the best

1099
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:12,369
programmers that I know and I watch you

1100
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,130
on that feed struggle with stuff and I

1101
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:17,650
go well if Casey is struggling with this

1102
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:19,960
stuff it's okay for me to struggle with

1103
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:21,599
this stuff - whispers you know before so

1104
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,010
watch it

1105
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,509
but but I think I think that's the kind

1106
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:28,060
of thing that you know over time you

1107
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,780
realize oh it's not me it's not just me

1108
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:32,019
that's failing

1109
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:34,240
everybody's failing and it makes you it

1110
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:36,070
makes it okay that does seem to me to be

1111
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,259
like a pretty big part of it too because

1112
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,180
I feel like I don't even know if I still

1113
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:43,020
internalize that part of it meaning I

1114
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:46,569
think I still generally think that I

1115
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:47,829
like in even though if I cognate link of

1116
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:49,690
it I don't think it this way but when

1117
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:51,730
I'm just subconsciously think about it I

1118
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:54,639
don't think of other programmers that I

1119
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:55,960
respect as making mistakes mmm like it

1120
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:57,519
just isn't in there it's like when I

1121
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,199
think of somebody else doing this

1122
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,179
program I just don't think of them

1123
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,009
making the mistakes now I know they must

1124
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,419
make them it's not that if you asked me

1125
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,190
to then think about it would I would I

1126
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,450
not but I think it is kind of the case

1127
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:10,000
that it's hard to actually remind

1128
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:11,500
yourself in practice no really they're

1129
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,650
all making mistakes that's just how it

1130
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,650
works

1131
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,100
I'm gonna start with a design one

1132
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:20,750
because that's the problem I actually

1133
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:24,710
had but then it's got a programming

1134
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:27,769
equivalent right which is just you know

1135
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:30,440
usually usually you have a voice

1136
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:31,759
somewhere telling you what the problem

1137
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,159
is with what you're doing and you

1138
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,560
usually choose to ignore it

1139
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:37,819
so the first professional game I did was

1140
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:45,500
a you know as a science fiction

1141
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:47,630
hovertank war game and they had yes it

1142
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:52,460
had some gameplay problems that made it

1143
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:54,860
you know not that fun like the the

1144
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,750
combat situations would always devolve

1145
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,670
into like a mess in a small area of the

1146
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,920
map and it was because of decisions that

1147
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:03,260
from a high level I had decided were

1148
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,550
important like oh you could place a unit

1149
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,290
anywhere because that gives you the

1150
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:10,400
maximum player freedom or whatever but

1151
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:12,829
what that really does is it you know it

1152
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,480
makes most it makes terrain a lot less

1153
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:19,369
important or whatever right so but I had

1154
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,920
lots of reasons in my head why it was a

1155
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:24,889
good game and it was pretty good in some

1156
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,889
areas but it had some fatal flaws to it

1157
00:44:24,889 --> 00:44:31,069
right and I I knew what they were right

1158
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:33,199
but I cognitive dissonance myself out of

1159
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:35,360
understanding them and acting on them

1160
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:38,210
you didn't want that to be true so you

1161
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,829
just yeah or you know there's always

1162
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,119
enough things to think about and deal

1163
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:42,139
with when especially when it's your own

1164
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,989
software company that you just find

1165
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:46,819
other things it's like oh you know this

1166
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:48,529
doesn't feel the way I want but you know

1167
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,700
we'll figure it out eventually it's not

1168
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:51,170
gonna it's not going to be these

1169
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:52,969
decisions that I made that were the

1170
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,550
problem deal with it later

1171
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:58,399
right I mean and the programming version

1172
00:44:55,550 --> 00:45:00,170
of that is just you know you're building

1173
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,240
some system that you think is gonna

1174
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:05,300
solve a problem and gonna be really

1175
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,909
great and it's got plenty of drawbacks

1176
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,110
and downsides and you probably know some

1177
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:10,250
of them you probably don't know cuz you

1178
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:13,309
haven't hit the wall but some of them

1179
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:16,130
you know you really do yeah but you're

1180
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:18,139
just choosing not to pay attention to

1181
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,200
that voice in your head so it's just

1182
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:22,809
like listen to that and pay attention

1183
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:24,098
to that I learned that or probably in

1184
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:28,029
programming before I learned it in

1185
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:31,690
design but I didn't know that either at

1186
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:34,480
the beginning right I would say kind of

1187
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:36,550
similar or along those same lines one of

1188
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,829
the pieces of advice that I will simply

1189
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:40,720
throw in here that's actually from Jeff

1190
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:43,780
Roberts who was in the opening session

1191
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,848
at this this handmade one of the things

1192
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,700
that he said that I found to be totally

1193
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:50,800
true is he said that like actually

1194
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:53,799
finished pieces of code before moving on

1195
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,359
to new pieces of code which is an odd

1196
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,609
thing to say because it sounds like well

1197
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:00,009
obviously that has to be true

1198
00:45:57,608 --> 00:46:02,500
but actually when you're doing a fairly

1199
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,670
large project or you're at the point you

1200
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,460
know in your programming career where

1201
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:09,338
you're doing you know a broad spectrum

1202
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,900
of things you know it's often the case

1203
00:46:09,338 --> 00:46:12,639
that you're like you'll get something up

1204
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,220
to just the point where it sort of works

1205
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:19,150
a little bit and then you'll move on to

1206
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:21,848
a new thing right and one of the things

1207
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,430
that happens at least to me there is if

1208
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:26,140
I don't actually stop and go wait have I

1209
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:29,529
actually done all of the programming

1210
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:30,909
necessary to to finish sort of fleshing

1211
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,349
this out completely it doesn't mean I

1212
00:46:30,909 --> 00:46:33,848
have to like optimize it all the way

1213
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:35,950
down or it doesn't mean I have to like

1214
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:37,990
have it in its shippable state it's just

1215
00:46:35,949 --> 00:46:39,789
have I actually finished it to the point

1216
00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:42,899
where I don't think I will have to come

1217
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:45,429
back to this for some ancillary reason I

1218
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,900
find that a lot of times I just won't do

1219
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:48,489
that if I don't stop and like hear

1220
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,019
Jeff's voice in my head saying this

1221
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:51,459
right because a lot of times you just

1222
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:52,780
kind of want to get everything working

1223
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,329
and now this thing just kind of works

1224
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,980
and okay I'm aware of these things that

1225
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:58,920
it's not doing it all but I'll just I'll

1226
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,358
do those eventually or something right

1227
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,920
and the reason that I find that it

1228
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:06,789
actually becomes important to do that is

1229
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,139
just that the amount of mental context

1230
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:09,969
that you build up when you're working on

1231
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:11,588
a piece of code doesn't come back

1232
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:13,299
immediately at least it doesn't for me

1233
00:47:11,588 --> 00:47:14,619
if that code is at all complicated so

1234
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,500
like when I'm actually writing it for

1235
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:18,970
the first time or even you know whenever

1236
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,338
I'm opening up a piece of code in like

1237
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:23,379
working on this system or something my

1238
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:25,088
brain is the lot sharper at working on

1239
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,068
that system after I've been doing that

1240
00:47:25,088 --> 00:47:28,929
for several days then if I pop back to

1241
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:31,630
it and now it's day one again of working

1242
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:33,460
on that system and so I find that

1243
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:36,160
actually I if I

1244
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:39,818
don't follow that advice I burn a lot of

1245
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:42,190
time INRI getting all of my context back

1246
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:45,818
if the changes that I have to make are

1247
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:48,220
at all non-trivial so nowadays much more

1248
00:47:45,818 --> 00:47:50,409
than I used to I definitely tried to

1249
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:51,848
kind of like finish this code to the

1250
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,500
point where I don't think I need the

1251
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:56,710
mental context anymore and if it's just

1252
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,568
stuff that I can just go look if I pop

1253
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,010
back in here it's brutally obvious what

1254
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:02,259
I've been doing I need to optimize this

1255
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:04,180
loop there's no conceptual optimizations

1256
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,710
it's just some assembly language stuff

1257
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:08,469
really I'll put Cindy is't or something

1258
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,119
like this that's no problem right but if

1259
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:11,679
it's not that if it's like something

1260
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:13,119
where it's like no no there's conceptual

1261
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:14,379
optimizations that I probably need to

1262
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,390
make in order to make this thing run I

1263
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,710
now do them there if I know that I have

1264
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:19,358
to do them because otherwise I find I

1265
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:21,789
just burn all this time on otherwise

1266
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,558
that might not be what other people find

1267
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:25,808
but just the way I program it seems like

1268
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:28,150
it really is true that it ends up saving

1269
00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:29,890
time in the end throw that out there

1270
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,420
fortunately I have one thing to add on

1271
00:48:29,889 --> 00:48:34,088
there actually since nobody else jumped

1272
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,789
in there's a secondary reason to do that

1273
00:48:34,088 --> 00:48:39,279
that relates to a topic we had earlier

1274
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,318
which is just you know we all we all

1275
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,930
make stuff and we feel like it's crappy

1276
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:45,308
a lot of the time right and a lot of the

1277
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:47,710
reason we feel like it's crappy is

1278
00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:49,869
because we took all these shortcuts get

1279
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:51,849
it go I mean that's my programming

1280
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:54,160
philosophy right is like get it running

1281
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:56,318
as quickly as possible so I will very

1282
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,750
deliberately take a large number of

1283
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,400
shortcuts where you could like it looks

1284
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:03,190
like a wall but you can kick through it

1285
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,480
because it's paper right yeah and you

1286
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,780
know that you have to come back and do

1287
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,159
that later and at some point that

1288
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,930
affects your picture of what you're

1289
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:11,920
making right because in the beginning

1290
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:14,199
it's like oh I'm gonna make an amazing

1291
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,088
thing that's gonna do all this right and

1292
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:18,308
then after a while it's like oh I've

1293
00:49:16,088 --> 00:49:20,650
been making this crappy thing of all

1294
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:23,500
these shortcuts that don't really do and

1295
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,880
and they pile up and eventually at least

1296
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,829
for me and I think for a lot of people

1297
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,680
your morale changes like oh this thing

1298
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:30,970
I'm working on it's not that good right

1299
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:32,169
and then combined with all the factors

1300
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:36,219
we were talking about before about how

1301
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:38,950
it just can be so hard to just keep

1302
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:40,838
going right that this becomes a barrier

1303
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:42,848
at least for me and so for example with

1304
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:44,710
the compiler I've taken a great deal of

1305
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:46,690
joy and just like stopping and like you

1306
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,400
know what okay cool I've done a lot of

1307
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,380
good work

1308
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:53,760
to this point I'm gonna go back now and

1309
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:55,019
you know refine these couple of areas to

1310
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,670
a much greater degree than I need to

1311
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:58,980
like I'm just gonna do it really I'm

1312
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:01,318
gonna go chase all the corners of this

1313
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,659
yeah and I'm gonna be really proud of

1314
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:05,250
what I did and I'll use the demos to do

1315
00:50:03,659 --> 00:50:07,500
that like okay I'm gonna demo in a week

1316
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,510
everything I do from now till then I can

1317
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,028
already demo right right but I'm just

1318
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:13,559
gonna harden all that stuff right and at

1319
00:50:12,028 --> 00:50:16,440
the end of that I feel really good about

1320
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:19,079
what I did yes because it's quality now

1321
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,789
yes it's not you know it's not just a

1322
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:23,670
thing that's gonna collapse as soon as I

1323
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:25,799
turn that way yeah so and and then that

1324
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:29,338
helps me keep going yeah so I should

1325
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:31,798
have said that earlier well but it's

1326
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:34,949
it's an interesting sort of trade-off -

1327
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:36,869
because it's like overdoing things is

1328
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:38,429
definitely a problem in programming as

1329
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:41,099
well so you're constantly in the stand

1330
00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:42,568
of like am I going to am i over building

1331
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:45,329
a system and so I think it's important

1332
00:50:42,568 --> 00:50:47,130
to eventually riu know learn that

1333
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:49,829
there's a difference between adding

1334
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:52,079
stuff to a system and making the system

1335
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:54,420
good like they're totally unrelated

1336
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,220
right it's like adding features or

1337
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,740
thinking that it's gonna do more do

1338
00:50:56,219 --> 00:51:00,118
whatever is a separate part and that's

1339
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:01,919
the thing you want to kind of limit like

1340
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,079
only do the things you actually you know

1341
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,789
need to do but then the like quality

1342
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,730
part is like a separate access and you

1343
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:10,890
kind of do want to go down that one more

1344
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:13,170
than oftentimes I think you might but we

1345
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:15,889
have different styles - right so like if

1346
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:18,420
I if I were doing handmade hero right I

1347
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:22,409
would not do the environment I don't do

1348
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:24,510
this on handmade here yeah between what

1349
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:25,858
we do like you you went and did like I'm

1350
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:29,839
building the technical infrastructure

1351
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:29,838
for the game because I want to build a

1352
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:40,548
what I would do in that case is I would

1353
00:51:36,449 --> 00:51:42,778
have gone and you know just done the

1354
00:51:40,548 --> 00:51:44,400
lowest effort things possible to get

1355
00:51:42,778 --> 00:51:45,960
things on the screen and then elaborated

1356
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:52,440
them right so those are two different

1357
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:53,490
approaches and I'm not I see I see what

1358
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,389
you work on and I'm like I would have

1359
00:51:53,489 --> 00:52:00,629
done that later

1360
00:51:54,389 --> 00:52:02,940
right but you know it's not to say that

1361
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:05,039
one is better than the other or like

1362
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,510
it's even you know it's down to your

1363
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:10,199
personality as a programmer you have to

1364
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:11,460
do the best thing for you but what's the

1365
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:13,439
best thing for you also changes with

1366
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:17,940
time and winning the project it is so

1367
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:20,789
like the stop and work hard and make a

1368
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:23,039
piece of it high quality is almost the

1369
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:24,719
exact opposite advice of like don't

1370
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,150
rathole writings

1371
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,250
and but both of those are correct advice

1372
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,090
at different times in different contexts

1373
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,710
and part of being a really good

1374
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:34,289
programmer is knowing when to swap in

1375
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,329
one piece of advice for another or you

1376
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:38,519
do a blend of like thirty percent this

1377
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:41,730
advice to 70 percent this advice your

1378
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:46,349
face makes and that's why new people can

1379
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:47,820
get really confused I I still don't feel

1380
00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:51,569
like it's the kind of thing that I'll

1381
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:53,430
probably ever not mess up or at least

1382
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:55,050
not know if I'm messing up right like

1383
00:52:53,429 --> 00:52:57,719
you know maybe this system shouldn't

1384
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,100
have been done this way or at this time

1385
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:02,549
or whatever so I I don't know

1386
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:04,440
necessarily if it ever gets perfected in

1387
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:06,840
terms of allowing your experience to

1388
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,130
inform those things but you know unless

1389
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,380
you're literally working on something

1390
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:12,869
that you've you totally have done before

1391
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:14,460
and just know this is exactly the order

1392
00:53:12,869 --> 00:53:15,449
to do it in or something like that one

1393
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:18,059
other thing that's funny

1394
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:19,379
is this also happens in design where

1395
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:21,269
like I have a lot of ideas about how

1396
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:26,190
what's a good game design for me or for

1397
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:27,420
a particular game right but then there's

1398
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,950
other ideas that come into play at

1399
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,480
different contexts in different times so

1400
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:32,669
like someone on the team will be asking

1401
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,469
me how something should be and I'll be

1402
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,610
like you know most of the time I'll say

1403
00:53:34,469 --> 00:53:37,199
this one thing and then one day I'll

1404
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:40,470
like say a completely opposite thing

1405
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:43,469
because now the situation is and I feel

1406
00:53:40,469 --> 00:53:44,969
you know like there's this stereotype of

1407
00:53:43,469 --> 00:53:47,519
like the flaky designer who just says

1408
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:49,739
random crap that nobody you know

1409
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,300
pre-madonna just like has ideas out of

1410
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:53,639
nowhere and expects you to do them but

1411
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,380
it's actually it's if they're a good

1412
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,509
designer was actually something very

1413
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,099
similar at play where you cross some

1414
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,210
invisible boundary where before one

1415
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:04,380
thing was appropriate and now a

1416
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:05,730
different thing is appropriate and we

1417
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:08,430
don't know exactly when that was crossed

1418
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:10,380
but it has had

1419
00:54:08,429 --> 00:54:25,440
and now what we're doing is different in

1420
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:26,430
this one piece right so it's just you

1421
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,010
know if someone asks you how do you

1422
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:32,719
design a game you have to actually plug

1423
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:32,720
them into the matrix and do the thing

1424
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:37,440
because it's not it's not that simple to

1425
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,030
say how to do it right as you have to

1426
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,039
give them the BSP tree of all these

1427
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,150
weird lines where you cross this one and

1428
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:44,130
now this other thing and it's a

1429
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,720
multi-dimensional space and whatever and

1430
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:48,630
mine doesn't agree with anyone elses

1431
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:50,669
model anyway okay so you're basically

1432
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:52,860
just saying like yeah okay I've got this

1433
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:55,320
complex set of internal sort of trade

1434
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:57,480
offs I can move the as the design moves

1435
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,590
around the actual practical thing I'm

1436
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,360
going to tell somebody needs to get done

1437
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:02,400
that the game is gonna change sometimes

1438
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,200
I just cross that some boundary where

1439
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,910
it's like okay this thing I told you and

1440
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:07,349
was very serious about yesterday needing

1441
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:08,429
to be in this game Tilly doesn't need to

1442
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:11,579
be in this game this other thing does

1443
00:55:08,429 --> 00:55:13,949
now I realize that sounds nuts but yeah

1444
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:16,739
trust me there is a very sane logical

1445
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:18,929
process that occurred internally that I

1446
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:19,589
just can't describe and I don't do that

1447
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:24,539
too often

1448
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:26,280
right I've done it simulator yeah so

1449
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:27,570
that so then the last thing to make that

1450
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,310
make more sense is like the technical

1451
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,930
version of that does exist right and so

1452
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:32,909
in the large like the Chris butcher

1453
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:34,829
asset system thing which was like the

1454
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:36,389
technical version of that but played out

1455
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:38,610
at a much longer time scale where you

1456
00:55:36,389 --> 00:55:41,969
can see the reason right like oh we were

1457
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:44,070
doing this thing but had these drawbacks

1458
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:46,980
that we didn't anticipate and because of

1459
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:49,050
that reason the right decision is now

1460
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:51,329
diff different right so it's the same

1461
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:53,400
thing it's just a lot harder to see cuz

1462
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:55,079
it's subjective right with game design

1463
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:59,039
being something that you can't say is

1464
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:02,099
absolutely why are there 15 mega tasks

1465
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,449
is not a game design but but then you

1466
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:05,369
know as it becomes more subjective in

1467
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:07,649
the technical realm to like how how

1468
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:10,710
should the handmade hero Engine be right

1469
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:11,820
well a lot of things and you might

1470
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:12,358
change your mind tomorrow about

1471
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:15,599
something

1472
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:17,278
right okay so I don't know how we're

1473
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,930
doing on time here we have 15 minutes

1474
00:56:17,278 --> 00:56:20,998
left I think I'm gonna not talk for the

1475
00:56:18,929 --> 00:56:22,259
rest of the 15 minute that's it okay all

1476
00:56:20,998 --> 00:56:25,558
right so these questions cannot be

1477
00:56:22,259 --> 00:56:28,019
directed at John anyway this one's for

1478
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:30,298
Pat it said regarding the prevention of

1479
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:33,088
cheating how much is it I figured we

1480
00:56:30,298 --> 00:56:35,248
were little heavy there in our in our

1481
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:36,538
sort of psycho psychology psychology for

1482
00:56:35,248 --> 00:56:38,308
a second there so this is totally

1483
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:39,660
concrete regarding the prevention of

1484
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:41,309
cheating how much of a difference does

1485
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:43,679
encrypting gameplay network traffic

1486
00:56:41,309 --> 00:56:45,480
realistically make I often hear it as

1487
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,778
important but it seems to me it would

1488
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:50,099
only catch the lowest hanging fruit so

1489
00:56:48,778 --> 00:56:51,690
first I'd say that the thing you're

1490
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:53,338
doing for encryption is you're actually

1491
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,809
preventing people's personal data from

1492
00:56:53,338 --> 00:56:56,940
being stolen if they're playing in a

1493
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:59,849
cafe is the primary motivation for

1494
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:01,619
everything if you want to cheat in games

1495
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:03,690
there's lots of ways to do it so I mean

1496
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:05,789
first I'm going to separate like console

1497
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:07,200
games from PC games so a console games

1498
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:09,239
it's much harder to cheat because it's

1499
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,980
hard to inject code into the console I

1500
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:13,769
mean some really smart people have

1501
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:15,480
managed to figure out exploits for Xbox

1502
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:17,038
and Playstation but by-and-large really

1503
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,659
tough and then the risk is if you do

1504
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,670
that and get caught then your Xbox gets

1505
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:24,048
bricked and you can't play anymore and

1506
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:27,119
your accounts wiped out so encryption

1507
00:57:24,048 --> 00:57:28,559
you know it can be useful for console

1508
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,970
games but for PC games it's actually not

1509
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,099
really good anti cheat mechanism because

1510
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:33,238
what happens is the game client is

1511
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:34,710
already running in an on trust for the

1512
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:36,838
environment and all I need to do is

1513
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:39,329
break open my create remote thread

1514
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:42,298
inject some code into the process space

1515
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:44,640
and like discover where the network code

1516
00:57:42,298 --> 00:57:46,409
is and start sending messages you know

1517
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:48,568
as if I was the game client so

1518
00:57:46,409 --> 00:57:50,278
encryption doesn't save you at all so I

1519
00:57:48,568 --> 00:57:50,998
would say that you should do it but it's

1520
00:57:50,278 --> 00:57:53,099
for a different reason

1521
00:57:50,998 --> 00:57:55,828
so basically Krypton is for keeping the

1522
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:58,079
stuff that the user knows themselves

1523
00:57:55,829 --> 00:58:03,390
from being snooped in route but other

1524
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:06,028
than that it does nothing so here is a

1525
00:58:03,389 --> 00:58:08,489
question for everybody I guess except

1526
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:12,739
John because he has opted out of a

1527
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:12,739
further question witness

1528
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:20,390
I could ask one so this question is when

1529
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,220
debugging your code are there obvious

1530
00:58:20,389 --> 00:58:29,119
shortcomings in the debugger as you use

1531
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:31,929
and are there any uh you sure you don't

1532
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,929
want to talk with this

1533
00:58:32,528 --> 00:58:37,429
are there any obvious things that

1534
00:58:35,028 --> 00:58:45,949
debuggers should do to make debugging

1535
00:58:37,429 --> 00:58:51,048
easier this is a question that is

1536
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:52,429
apparently everyone thinks immediately

1537
00:58:51,048 --> 00:58:55,369
tons of people will have tons of answers

1538
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:56,689
for based on the laughter so I apologize

1539
00:58:55,369 --> 00:59:01,099
out there the people who write debuggers

1540
00:58:56,688 --> 00:59:02,989
yeah so what calm 10-point Oh back in

1541
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:05,959
the DOS 4gw days actually was really

1542
00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:07,818
powerful and you could run like a short

1543
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:09,318
script so that like breakpoint a would

1544
00:59:07,818 --> 00:59:10,998
hit and it would run a script and look

1545
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:12,978
at some stuff and then set breakpoint B

1546
00:59:10,998 --> 00:59:14,688
so you could catch League these really

1547
00:59:12,978 --> 00:59:16,968
esoteric bugs that only happened in

1548
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:18,408
certain states and I'm still waiting for

1549
00:59:16,969 --> 00:59:20,599
a visual studio to do something to make

1550
00:59:18,409 --> 00:59:21,829
that process easy yeah I don't think

1551
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,199
they have any way to script a break

1552
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:25,789
point do they have scripts yeah you can

1553
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:27,679
write code to do that like sort of

1554
00:59:25,789 --> 00:59:31,789
aftermarket and set debug registers and

1555
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:33,858
things but it's like you're gonna have

1556
00:59:31,789 --> 00:59:35,869
this bug that I'm currently trying to

1557
00:59:33,858 --> 00:59:38,659
track down and I know there are ways

1558
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:40,278
around this but it's a bug that only

1559
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:43,130
happens when the game is running in

1560
00:59:40,278 --> 00:59:45,679
full-screen mode and that becomes very

1561
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:47,659
difficult to debug because I can't

1562
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:48,918
actually step through my code I can't

1563
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:54,039
look at stuff because we're in

1564
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:54,038
full-screen mode so you

1565
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:12,338
[Laughter]

1566
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:14,349
so literally some way to just overlay

1567
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:16,088
the text on the screen but some yeah I

1568
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:18,849
feel like for laptop work that would

1569
01:00:16,088 --> 01:00:19,989
make a lot of sense in general reminder

1570
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:21,609
what yeah when you're working on a

1571
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:24,250
laptop and you're doing stuff it's very

1572
01:00:21,608 --> 01:00:24,789
difficult to to debug in full-screen

1573
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:33,219
mode

1574
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:34,389
so lens Minds very quick and it might be

1575
01:00:33,219 --> 01:00:36,250
a thing but I haven't really looked into

1576
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:38,618
it too much you know data breakpoints

1577
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:41,679
now come in the watch window I can't

1578
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:43,240
right click and hit watch watch the data

1579
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:45,449
right there why can't I do that why do I

1580
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:47,919
have to copy it and paste it and then

1581
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:50,230
kill all the stuff that's also in the

1582
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:56,079
watch row to make the data breakpoint

1583
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:58,170
it's so irritating like why isn't that a

1584
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,170
thing

1585
01:01:00,269 --> 01:01:20,440
I used like for things in Visual Studio

1586
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:22,000
and that's the one thing I want yeah you

1587
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,210
used to at least be able to drag a break

1588
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,588
point from line to line you can yeah

1589
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:29,920
don't don't expect a new function no no

1590
01:01:26,588 --> 01:01:30,578
I I I copy and paste it's fine we could

1591
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:44,200
re-request

1592
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:46,000
old so this one I think is a possibly a

1593
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:51,519
little tough because I'm not sure I

1594
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,530
guess I have addressed to everyone and

1595
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:57,039
the question is what are the costs and

1596
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:59,980
benefits of shipping a mod API or level

1597
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:02,050
editor with a game I guess well you know

1598
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:03,490
what actually no Warcraft at all we're

1599
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:07,300
doing that yeah we're crafting mr. craft

1600
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:08,409
had love letters yeah okay so I don't

1601
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:12,960
know like you know people make these

1602
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:12,960
trivial little add-ons like dota

1603
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:26,090
I'm sorry watch which add-on so did you

1604
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,250
want to say the cost/benefit yeah well I

1605
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:30,110
mean you know it's funny because like

1606
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:33,380
clearly other companies have benefited

1607
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:36,559
hugely right like valve and and Riot

1608
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:38,000
Games have made big hey on making new

1609
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,920
versions of that game but but also

1610
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,389
Warcraft 3 probably got a lot of users

1611
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,530
that were playing extensively for really

1612
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:44,629
long periods of time because of the

1613
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:46,220
extended play value of the game because

1614
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:49,160
people were coming up with new ideas all

1615
01:02:46,219 --> 01:02:51,069
the time and certainly you know valve

1616
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:53,659
has made a really successful game

1617
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:55,309
business out of like taking the mods

1618
01:02:53,659 --> 01:02:57,170
that people have created in and like

1619
01:02:55,309 --> 01:02:58,719
really seeing them which is kind of

1620
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:00,619
funny because back in I don't know maybe

1621
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:03,019
2002 or something like that there was a

1622
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:05,659
bunch of us playing CS Kirk beta we're

1623
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:06,769
like now you know everybody who wants to

1624
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:08,359
play this game has probably already

1625
01:03:06,769 --> 01:03:10,849
downloaded it nobody's ever gonna pay

1626
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:12,349
money to valve to release this game and

1627
01:03:10,849 --> 01:03:14,960
you know I turned it to be totally wrong

1628
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:16,639
on that one so so I think there's huge

1629
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,289
value in doing level editors if you have

1630
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:19,819
the time you're in your development

1631
01:03:18,289 --> 01:03:23,929
schedule I guess one thing I would ask

1632
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:25,730
about that is is that really level

1633
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:26,719
editor or does that have to go all the

1634
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:30,289
way to mod because I'm just thinking

1635
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:32,149
about the the things because he sort of

1636
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:33,769
said mod or level editor and that

1637
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:36,800
they're kind of grouped together there

1638
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:39,829
but I'm just thinking in terms of finer

1639
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,000
detail it seems like a lot of that value

1640
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:42,829
that you're talking about like for

1641
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,230
example that valve gets out of the you

1642
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:46,789
know pulling mods into into there you

1643
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:49,460
know sort of business model or whatever

1644
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:53,119
or the you know Warcraft spawning sort

1645
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:55,400
of these other lineages those seem to be

1646
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:58,009
mostly if you can actually change what

1647
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,750
the game is right which is not really

1648
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:02,540
quite the same as level editor so I

1649
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:05,329
wonder is perhaps there a big difference

1650
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:07,909
between the value in doing full mod

1651
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:09,739
support versus just level editor and

1652
01:04:07,909 --> 01:04:12,529
maybe like level editor isn't so useful

1653
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:14,059
but mod support definitely is or you

1654
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:15,519
know I'm saying like I wonder if there's

1655
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:18,019
actually a pretty big difference between

1656
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:19,250
going all the way and only going part of

1657
01:04:18,019 --> 01:04:21,259
the way in terms of allowing the game to

1658
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:22,969
sort of be customized in that way yeah

1659
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,260
well in as much as Warcraft who didn't

1660
01:04:22,969 --> 01:04:27,739
really spawn any

1661
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:30,140
derivative games because yeah

1662
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:33,829
Warcraft 3 did because it was a yeah you

1663
01:04:30,139 --> 01:04:38,079
know like I guess you could argue that

1664
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:42,679
mods are a better strategy Tommy do you

1665
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:45,110
have super meatboy at the PC ship 12 in

1666
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:49,159
ship with it but which is which is the

1667
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:51,260
the mistake is don't promise stuff after

1668
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:57,859
because you're not gonna want to do it

1669
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:59,750
so so but I think more than you know are

1670
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,670
mods more valuable than level letters

1671
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:04,969
based on the like the context of the

1672
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:06,440
game so with meatboy when we did when

1673
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:08,509
when I did the editor and I put the

1674
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,579
editor out there people made seventy

1675
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:12,230
four hundred levels and that just had

1676
01:05:10,579 --> 01:05:14,329
people just constantly playing the game

1677
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:16,010
which you know just had constant

1678
01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:18,440
attention there were weekly levels that

1679
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:20,840
people were making and I can't say if I

1680
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,000
actually made any money off of that but

1681
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,860
what it did is it did get a whole bunch

1682
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,380
of people excited about creating for the

1683
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:29,390
game so I think in that way for meatboy

1684
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:31,250
it works is just a love letter I don't

1685
01:05:29,389 --> 01:05:33,019
think I needed to go deeper into mods

1686
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:34,670
like make it so Meat Boy has a gun and

1687
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:36,369
you can like make an entire different

1688
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:39,740
game I don't think it would have really

1689
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:43,670
added much to the game because you know

1690
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:46,939
with meatboy a lot of what made it great

1691
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:48,860
is the stuff that you couldn't do so you

1692
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:51,170
know you couldn't make weird little

1693
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:52,849
slopey levels that you know have all

1694
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:54,889
these rolling hills and stuff because it

1695
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:57,230
was just tiles and what people did is

1696
01:05:54,889 --> 01:06:00,589
they took that and they creatively found

1697
01:05:57,230 --> 01:06:02,300
ways to make new kinds of levels and

1698
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:05,480
stuff and I think I think in that way

1699
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:07,130
that you know that added some sort of

1700
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,460
something that engaged people to the

1701
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:14,559
game so mod or no just kind of context

1702
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:17,960
so I guess question about that

1703
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:20,119
it did say costs and benefits kind of

1704
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,039
thing obviously benefit to that doesn't

1705
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:23,630
have to be monetary right in a sense it

1706
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:25,219
could be just like I wanted to have

1707
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:27,079
those extra people make those maps I

1708
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:29,239
mean yeah I wanted in the you know as my

1709
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:30,409
vision for what this is so the benefit

1710
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:32,209
doesn't necessarily have to matter could

1711
01:06:30,409 --> 01:06:33,679
be anything I suppose yeah I just wanted

1712
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:34,550
us about the cost part because that's

1713
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:36,769
something that people haven't really

1714
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:37,410
talked about yet in the answer it's just

1715
01:06:36,769 --> 01:06:39,000
that

1716
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:40,440
okay so let's say we do have this

1717
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,840
benefit that we want or that we're

1718
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:44,519
thinking of what about the cost part of

1719
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,480
shipping that right because you kind of

1720
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:47,219
touched a little bit there it's like I

1721
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,539
promised it now yeah they're written so

1722
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:51,750
it's a it's a big undertaking

1723
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:53,190
potentially or I mean I'm just depending

1724
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:55,769
on what it was like the the reason it

1725
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:58,110
was a big undertaking for meatboy wasn't

1726
01:06:55,769 --> 01:07:00,059
in like technical complexity or anything

1727
01:06:58,110 --> 01:07:02,190
it was literally I don't want to work on

1728
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:03,929
this anymore and now I have to make it

1729
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:06,659
look pretty and I have to fix all the

1730
01:07:03,929 --> 01:07:08,429
bugs in it that II didn't just he didn't

1731
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:10,199
place it there you know he didn't place

1732
01:07:08,429 --> 01:07:12,000
that there but now I have to make it so

1733
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:14,429
people can place this thing here and it

1734
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,079
doesn't crash so and then after the

1735
01:07:14,429 --> 01:07:20,389
crazy development cycle it was like well

1736
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:25,469
live life now I don't want to keep

1737
01:07:20,389 --> 01:07:28,559
working on the stupid thing so yeah I I

1738
01:07:25,469 --> 01:07:31,259
think though I mean having said that the

1739
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,480
games that I'm working on now that I

1740
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:36,330
want to put out I do want to put out the

1741
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:38,579
level editor at launch because if for no

1742
01:07:36,329 --> 01:07:40,110
other reason I enjoyed seeing everything

1743
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:42,690
that everybody made I thought it was

1744
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:45,000
pretty cool yes and I think it helps

1745
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:47,519
with just a community in general because

1746
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,469
you know media is kind of garbage you

1747
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:51,840
know Twitter is kind of garbage you know

1748
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:53,730
you you want people to just play and be

1749
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,590
excited about your game and the way they

1750
01:07:53,730 --> 01:08:00,269
can do that some of them at least is by

1751
01:07:55,590 --> 01:08:01,530
making more of it so so this would get

1752
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:03,030
to a question that was asked during the

1753
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:05,930
break actually because it kind of

1754
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:08,280
touched on it there just incidentally

1755
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:10,379
the question was actually about

1756
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,720
something but jamun said earlier which

1757
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:14,400
means you may have to talk briefly just

1758
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:16,949
just I'm talking about like just a

1759
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:22,230
little bit yes or no or you can kind of

1760
01:08:16,949 --> 01:08:24,539
blink it out John had said something

1761
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:25,799
earlier that was about like okay I had

1762
01:08:24,539 --> 01:08:29,100
you know done something in particular

1763
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:31,829
and I was really burnt out from this and

1764
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:33,329
you know for doing things a certain way

1765
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:37,559
for too long or whatever and get really

1766
01:08:33,329 --> 01:08:40,170
burnt out and he used I was at 20% and

1767
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:43,530
then what you know etc and the person

1768
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:47,310
asked a very interesting question which

1769
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:49,889
was how do you know what that even means

1770
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:50,980
in your head like ignore trying to

1771
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:52,329
quantify the 20

1772
01:08:50,979 --> 01:08:56,858
thank us obviously like what you know

1773
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:58,750
you can't but how do you know what it is

1774
01:08:56,859 --> 01:09:01,270
to be you know I'm at my normal

1775
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:02,859
productivity or I'm like really close to

1776
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:04,270
bottom productivity you're like what

1777
01:09:02,859 --> 01:09:05,770
quick how do you what what does that

1778
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:08,500
even mean is that just an experience

1779
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:09,850
thing or is that something that that

1780
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:13,899
look almost look if you were gonna say

1781
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:16,859
something I think is probably the number

1782
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:20,889
of times per hour then I open up Twitter

1783
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:23,079
yeah so we could quantify exactly really

1784
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:26,890
quantify yeah like three times an hour

1785
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:29,759
that's a good day yeah yeah yeah alright

1786
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:34,210
so number of Twitter checks per hour

1787
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:36,939
metric what is a number that would be

1788
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:39,789
good productivity how often would you

1789
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:41,439
check Twitter I mean literally was with

1790
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:43,930
Twitter right I have two factor

1791
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:46,088
authentication turned on and so I will

1792
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:48,730
in the morning I will log out of Twitter

1793
01:09:46,088 --> 01:09:50,920
because it is such a pain to log back

1794
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:52,869
into Twitter because I have to get my

1795
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,489
cell phone out and or some crazy number

1796
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:56,199
and all those other stuff that that's

1797
01:09:54,488 --> 01:10:01,349
kind of you know how I keep myself

1798
01:09:56,199 --> 01:10:01,349
productive during the day is lock myself

1799
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:08,199
basically what you're saying is

1800
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:13,659
two-factor authentication is not a

1801
01:10:08,199 --> 01:10:15,609
security I guess though if you were view

1802
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:17,289
if you follow me on Twitter and you

1803
01:10:15,609 --> 01:10:21,880
don't hear from me during the day you

1804
01:10:17,289 --> 01:10:23,800
know I'm the same way if you're not

1805
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,750
feeling it you're not gonna log out of

1806
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,909
Twitter so you can be logged into it and

1807
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:29,560
continue to be on Twitter so if you're

1808
01:10:27,909 --> 01:10:30,789
if you're not feeling very productive

1809
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:37,480
like that morning when you're logging

1810
01:10:30,789 --> 01:10:39,010
out of Twitter yeah so would you even go

1811
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:42,599
so far as to say that we could get

1812
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:42,600
productivity gains by moving to three

1813
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:55,359
all right Pat yeah I guess it's for me

1814
01:10:53,979 --> 01:10:57,039
it's email right cuz it's like ooh

1815
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:59,949
there's fun stuff I can go and respond

1816
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:00,840
to people like I actually turn off email

1817
01:10:59,949 --> 01:11:03,000
toast when I

1818
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,819
programming doesn't pop up it's like Oh

1819
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,520
a distraction that looks cool yeah and

1820
01:11:05,819 --> 01:11:09,539
so in general you would know if you were

1821
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,710
kind of burned out if you're just kind

1822
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:12,960
of like spending all your time an email

1823
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:14,158
or that's ultimately if I don't really

1824
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,289
have any I wouldn't do what I'm doing

1825
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:17,460
you know let me hit Google again and

1826
01:11:16,289 --> 01:11:21,569
again surely some of you have solved

1827
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:23,399
this problem before okay so basically

1828
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:24,599
searching for other people's answers

1829
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:26,789
rather than writing the answer yourself

1830
01:11:24,599 --> 01:11:28,110
is a good sign that like you're not well

1831
01:11:26,789 --> 01:11:29,399
and I suppose too because it's like that

1832
01:11:28,109 --> 01:11:30,630
means you're not that excited about

1833
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:31,948
solving it yourself because you just

1834
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:35,699
want it to kind of be done and move on

1835
01:11:31,948 --> 01:11:40,039
exactly how are we doing on time we got

1836
01:11:35,698 --> 01:11:42,839
three minutes left alright so here is

1837
01:11:40,039 --> 01:11:46,139
here is kind of I guess we'll do this on

1838
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:48,360
the the closing question because I think

1839
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:54,239
it's the only one that I can ask that

1840
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:57,359
would in no way require John to talk the

1841
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:59,968
question is what old school books

1842
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:03,569
did you like back when people still read

1843
01:11:59,969 --> 01:12:05,279
books about programming or tech things

1844
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:07,579
in general and I guess we'll just go

1845
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:12,210
down I don't know if you've got any

1846
01:12:07,579 --> 01:12:16,260
wrong well I mean I think my favorite

1847
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:19,800
tech book ever was just that big fat

1848
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:22,230
Commodore 64 manual that you know showed

1849
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:26,880
all the cool pecan poke locations and

1850
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:27,899
stuff it's just like come with no yeah

1851
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,819
ordered separately

1852
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:31,408
you didn't come with a ordered it

1853
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:33,118
separately and I just you talked about

1854
01:12:31,408 --> 01:12:35,039
every aspect of the Machine and where

1855
01:12:33,118 --> 01:12:37,319
all the memory values were and stuff and

1856
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:39,359
I think I mean I don't I don't really

1857
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:41,309
read a lot of stuff me even before the

1858
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:43,229
internet I didn't you know it was mostly

1859
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:50,670
just conversations with people but that

1860
01:12:43,229 --> 01:12:52,259
one book so the good book was actually

1861
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:53,158
an AI programming book that I got when I

1862
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,840
was in college and it sort of

1863
01:12:53,158 --> 01:12:57,029
demystified the whole idea of how a

1864
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,619
program like server the basics of

1865
01:12:57,029 --> 01:13:00,569
depth-first and breadth-first searches

1866
01:12:58,618 --> 01:13:01,799
and things I'm like because before then

1867
01:13:00,569 --> 01:13:04,420
it's like I don't know you make the

1868
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:07,699
computer think

1869
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:09,289
and yeah it was really valuable to sort

1870
01:13:07,699 --> 01:13:11,179
of demystify the whole process because I

1871
01:13:09,289 --> 01:13:12,350
was still learning cooking then and the

1872
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:15,440
one that actually it was the reverse

1873
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:17,420
that was the KN RC book because it's

1874
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:18,949
like you know jumps into like print

1875
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:21,140
death and pointers and stuff it's like

1876
01:13:18,949 --> 01:13:22,970
this isn't really helpful how do I do

1877
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:25,730
useful stuff without pointers right

1878
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:27,170
because you know coming from like a very

1879
01:13:25,729 --> 01:13:28,489
beginning Pascal knowledge it's like

1880
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:30,140
there's all this weirdness in the

1881
01:13:28,489 --> 01:13:32,329
language I don't know you just want to

1882
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:33,710
do something interesting first so I

1883
01:13:32,329 --> 01:13:36,829
didn't find it to be very helpful book

1884
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:39,380
so the K in R was just like it was too

1885
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:40,729
focused on just like specific language

1886
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,989
these things they were doing they didn't

1887
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:44,149
really take the time to go like look

1888
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:51,349
here's sort of how you start doing

1889
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:53,569
things and see I didn't really read many

1890
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:56,600
programming books I had my one cue basic

1891
01:13:53,569 --> 01:13:59,239
book but that was it it was it was on

1892
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:03,200
the Panasonic computer I had that was a

1893
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:05,119
laptop that was about 35 pounds Wow yeah

1894
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:08,659
it was really cool I had like a green

1895
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:10,640
screen and a built-in printer two things

1896
01:14:08,659 --> 01:14:12,019
and it had a keyboard that went over and

1897
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,670
you would carry it and well you wouldn't

1898
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:15,800
carry it had a roll case because it was

1899
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:18,170
too heavy yeah that was like my first

1900
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,720
computer and it had a Q basic book and

1901
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:39,050
that's no it was kind of the only one I

1902
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:40,970
read can you just say the way I got into

1903
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:44,180
programming there was some books that

1904
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:46,550
came like in RadioShack the trs-80 color

1905
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:47,900
computer there was I just remember there

1906
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:49,579
were two books that like started with

1907
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:50,869
really simple exercises and you would go

1908
01:14:49,579 --> 01:14:52,970
through I don't know if they were

1909
01:14:50,869 --> 01:14:56,359
particularly good it was just like how I

1910
01:14:52,970 --> 01:15:00,920
did it so and and you wouldn't use those

1911
01:14:56,359 --> 01:15:04,729
to learn today no well maybe learn how

1912
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:06,319
to program the trs-80 all right well I

1913
01:15:04,729 --> 01:15:07,669
think we're just about out of time so

1914
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:10,069
thanks so much for coming back and

1915
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:16,170
talking with us again this year

1916
01:15:10,069 --> 01:15:16,170
[Applause]
