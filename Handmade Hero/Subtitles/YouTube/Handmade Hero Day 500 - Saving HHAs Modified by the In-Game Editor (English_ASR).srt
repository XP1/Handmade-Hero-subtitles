00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,619
hello everybody and welcome handmade

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,020
hero show recoat a complete game live on

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,660
stream we've got so much to do there's

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:12,230
all kinds of things we can do now we're

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,388
just yeah we're in we're in party mode

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:19,380
for Krampus laugh and calm for sloths

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:21,358
and we need to yeah we need to just go

8
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:24,559
to town so you know of the things that

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,580
we can be doing there's a lot of them

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,229
there's some quality of life things that

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,028
I was doing yesterday like now we can

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,820
sort of have some hotkeys for our stuff

13
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:34,710
here where we can switch between like

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,390
debug output stuff we want to do I'll

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,710
probably do a little bit more of that in

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,420
the future but we don't really need it

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:45,390
right now so I'll let that be a bit more

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:47,429
on demand we want to go do some asset

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,829
system stuff we want texture handle

20
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:53,009
recycling and I'd like to add audio

21
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,899
asset better audio asset loading in

22
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:56,070
there and so when we go to add sounds

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,179
maybe I'll do that I don't know I need

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,698
to do it right now but the texture

25
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:03,539
handles recycling would be a problem

26
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:05,338
that we need to address some point and

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:11,040
then finally we need the ability to do

28
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:14,400
the sort of the saving and loading of

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,780
permanent alignment point stuff so in

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,799
terms of what we do first I'm just gonna

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,519
start there I'm gonna start at the

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,900
saving and loading of the line points

33
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,280
because I've it's kind of been we keep

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,118
pushing it back like we're kinda me like

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,140
we gotta do that we gotta do that we

36
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,688
gotta do that and we just haven't done

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,319
it and I'd like to go ahead and do that

38
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:34,679
because it's it's really important for

39
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:38,669
us getting all the rest of our graphic

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,470
stuff done and you know I want the cat

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,150
like I want you know we showed how we

42
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,500
can edit the cat forward do like great

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,750
where the head just snapped the body and

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,909
all this sort of stuff so I'd like to be

45
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,140
able to have that work and so when we

46
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,759
come in here and you know we do this

47
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,430
editing like we did before where I say

48
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,049
I'm like oh yeah let's make a place how

49
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,560
it snaps on to the head or whatever

50
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:03,868
there and you know we can adjust all

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,490
this stuff now see there you know now

52
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:07,349
that we can put this stuff together we

53
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:09,598
want to be able to save that kind of

54
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,409
information and right now we just don't

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,409
have that right

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:21,879
you know we have no we have a wheel we

57
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,650
have like no way to preserve this so

58
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:27,789
even though we did all the work to make

59
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:30,310
all of this stuff all this stuff kind of

60
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:32,590
like clean and efficient right we don't

61
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,319
really have any way of actually saving

62
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,878
what we did and you know and there's

63
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:38,259
also like little editor things like like

64
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,298
that's too thick I can't see what's

65
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,979
going on there there's also like I'd

66
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,319
like to add synthetic hits here for

67
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:46,030
other parts of this thing because right

68
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,798
now you have to have clicked on where

69
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,719
the head is to edit the head which is

70
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:51,489
not as good like if I click anywhere on

71
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,769
an entity I should probably get all the

72
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:55,359
things on the entity automatically or at

73
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,658
least have a little cycle so I can go

74
00:02:55,359 --> 00:03:01,000
through forwards and backwards and so on

75
00:02:57,658 --> 00:03:04,389
but anyway so now that we have the

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,219
ability to edit that stuff and I just

77
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:09,848
want to be able to now go back here and

78
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:11,378
hit the Save button where I can you know

79
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:12,608
do all that work and then when we come

80
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:14,500
back into the game it's the same as it

81
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,000
was before and there's two pieces to

82
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,799
that one's easy one's hard

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,079
the easy one is we actually already have

84
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:24,209
saving implemented into our data file

85
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:26,739
format so that's just calling a function

86
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,799
in fact if you hit save and import it

87
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:32,590
would just save I believe it so like if

88
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,319
for example in here if I if I hit

89
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:40,509
important save I think that because that

90
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:40,988
will save the file well you know I take

91
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:43,479
that back

92
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,870
it may not because nothing changed right

93
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,568
there was there was no actual there were

94
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,009
no new bitmaps loaded presumably so it

95
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:52,208
probably didn't actually save the file

96
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:55,120
cuz none of them would have been marked

97
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,469
dirty but point being if we had imported

98
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,209
a new texture it would have marked the

99
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,340
file dirty resaved it and then this

100
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,840
stuff would have saved so then when we

101
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,128
restarted it would be there I don't

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,449
actually think it's gonna be here now

103
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:05,768
cuz I don't think it picked up any

104
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:08,019
changes on the import because we didn't

105
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:10,000
change anything yeah but it would have

106
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,469
so implementing that part of the save

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,068
feature would be simple and in fact I

108
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:17,139
guess we can just go do that now because

109
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:18,519
that part is just a question of saying

110
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,370
which files we wanted to save in the

111
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:25,728
first place and that's it

112
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:32,360
so we can do that and then the other

113
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:34,339
thing we need to do is we need to have a

114
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,900
permanent storage file format for those

115
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:37,399
alignment points and that's the text

116
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:40,310
part of things that I wanted to do and

117
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:42,528
that's harder it it's not actually a

118
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,899
difficult code it just it's a bunch of

119
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:47,089
parsing stuff like we just don't have

120
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:49,339
any of that and so putting that in there

121
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,468
will take a little bit longer because

122
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:52,998
it's just a it's just new code there's

123
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,769
no it's not like we already have a bunch

124
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:56,569
of stuff that does this or reads textile

125
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,188
formats and so on we do have some

126
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:00,860
parsing stuff so it's probably not as

127
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:02,419
hard is it might be in that sense but

128
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,370
you know it's it's definitely something

129
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:05,478
that that will take a little longer than

130
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,300
this which would probably be fairly

131
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:10,098
straightforward so if we go to the

132
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,598
in-game editor we look at the save

133
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:13,338
function here where we've got like

134
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:15,938
should save you know and then it says

135
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:19,939
like okay let's let's save the file

136
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:22,249
check for art changes here you you know

137
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:28,338
this part where we where we say say

138
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:32,028
we're going to save the problem that

139
00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:37,459
we're gonna get is we need to be able to

140
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:39,408
mark things as dirty and have the I I

141
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:41,538
don't actually know that we really want

142
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:45,788
this to happen per se right look we

143
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:45,788
probably need something more like this

144
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:58,370
you know something like this or do you

145
00:05:54,019 --> 00:06:00,740
know do save preparation or something

146
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:05,060
like that where you know we're gonna do

147
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:07,399
something like this and we're also going

148
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,079
to mark the files as dirty right so in

149
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,569
here we'll mark all the files as dirty

150
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:15,218
that that need to get marked dirty and

151
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:19,699
then what we would have is instead of

152
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:23,810
saying should save what I want to do

153
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:26,088
instead is say like you know I want to

154
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,019
say do save preparation or like prepare

155
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:29,019
for save or whatever

156
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,000
I want to do prepare for saving and

157
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:40,279
prepare for saving we'll do whatever

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,230
needs to happen and then this will will

159
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,569
execute the save on unit in and of

160
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:52,580
itself right I think I think that's

161
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:55,610
probably what we want to do in fact I

162
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:57,709
think what we could do actually save all

163
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:06,740
changes no I think about it we could do

164
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:09,139
it this way like so I think we could

165
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,560
actually do this and then what we would

166
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:17,569
do is inside the asset system where we

167
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:22,730
do check for art changes this would not

168
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:31,370
happen here anymore right so what we

169
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:37,520
would actually do is have this rewrite

170
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:42,649
or write all hij modifications so in

171
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:48,799
here right this is what we would call on

172
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:51,620
the game assets and the the temporary

173
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,920
nough in this case where we you know

174
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,920
we're using the one from from up here

175
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:07,159
yeah I think we just want to do yeah oh

176
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:10,699
it already was doing that so yeah like

177
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,460
this is more what we want because then

178
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:16,060
we can just say okay you know when you

179
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:19,039
want to do your you're saving right

180
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,740
check for art changes would not really

181
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:30,939
be checked for art changes it's just

182
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:33,409
like import changed assets right and and

183
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:34,909
we would call that and then save all

184
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,279
changes whereas if you hit save we'd

185
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:41,719
just do save all changes you know what I

186
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:44,000
mean so I think that's more what we

187
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:56,660
would want to do and save all changes

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:59,568
would do this and in here when we go to

189
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:01,730
do the save all changes we now just have

190
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:04,669
to do the stuff that we were going to do

191
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,680
where we need to take a look at any

192
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:10,490
changed assets and make sure that they

193
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:17,059
get saved out you know in a more

194
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:20,329
meticulous fashion right so there's two

195
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:23,838
ways we can do this one is we can well

196
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:26,088
you know I guess I would say we really

197
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,449
kind of wanted we probably want to do

198
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:31,670
this in a way that that is actually

199
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:34,849
fairly specific so we probably just want

200
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:39,289
to loop over all of the changes that

201
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:41,959
we've done so the undo stack back to the

202
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:46,730
last clean undo sentinels so you know

203
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:53,869
when we do a revert for example like

204
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:55,459
this code here so this is effectively

205
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,278
what we want to do but we don't want to

206
00:09:55,458 --> 00:10:00,888
actually undo the changes so really what

207
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:04,789
we'd want to do here is say look you

208
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:07,549
know we've got this change list here for

209
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:10,429
the in-game edits so we want to look at

210
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:16,969
like each of those we want to start at

211
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:20,989
whatever the clean undo Sentinel was and

212
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:24,250
we would just want to go to there I mean

213
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,250
we could do it this way

214
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:41,159
so if we look the undo stack like the

215
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,660
first thing you would undo is the next

216
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:47,579
pointer on the undo sentinel stack right

217
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:51,299
we would want to loop until we got to

218
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,550
wherever it was that you know was

219
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,379
considered no more edits right because

220
00:10:53,549 --> 00:11:00,629
we keep that watermark of like when the

221
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:02,399
last time you saved was and then we've

222
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:09,480
got sort of the edit here right where

223
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:11,279
we're really / - next there's a I want

224
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,889
to say there's a condition here that we

225
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:21,179
need to take into account which is that

226
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:24,539
we may have done a redo operation that

227
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:26,809
redoes passed the clean undo Sentinel

228
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:26,809
and

229
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:43,689
I'm not really sure what we would do in

230
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:43,689
that case because we would have to redo

231
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:55,250
you know at one point someone asked me

232
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,679
like why have two stacks and I was like

233
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,240
I don't know why not have two stacks it

234
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,129
seems a little clearer but when I'm

235
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,710
thinking about that I'm like maybe it's

236
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:08,419
true that we should have had just one

237
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,519
stack because you can see where the

238
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:13,279
there's a bug here I think it's already

239
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,919
exists in the revert because let's say

240
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,600
that the clean undo sentinel next is now

241
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:22,159
pointing to something that's in the redo

242
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,649
stack this just wouldn't terminate it

243
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,129
just crash right when it gets I mean

244
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:33,309
what wouldn't crash it would assert

245
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:36,980
right which is the same as crashing so

246
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:45,489
it makes me think that maybe we do want

247
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:45,490
that to happen as as an undo redo

248
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,490
and I guess what you would need at that

249
00:12:56,528 --> 00:13:02,230
point but you know now I think about it

250
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,940
doesn't really solve the bug because you

251
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,379
still need to know where whether that's

252
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,380
in front of our behind you

253
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,620
so yeah so I guess the way I would look

254
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,328
at it to say all right so the clean undo

255
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:25,659
sentinel next this is not really

256
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:31,120
sufficient right we need to know where

257
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:35,769
that was so we'd like we'd have to do

258
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,649
this where we have this notion of a

259
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:41,919
clean edit right and then what we'd have

260
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:44,789
to do is say well whatever the changes

261
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:53,049
that we've made since the clean edit is

262
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:55,990
what we have to mark now if you want to

263
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:57,969
revert then you have to look to see

264
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,948
whether the clean edits in the undo

265
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,120
Sentinel or the redo Sentinel and you

266
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:07,059
have to undo or redo whichever one it is

267
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:15,519
until then if you want to save all your

268
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:17,349
changes then you would need to do the

269
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,019
same thing right you need to figure out

270
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:26,050
which stack you're in and you need to

271
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:27,789
walk that stack until you get there so I

272
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:34,569
think what we'd want to do here is say

273
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:43,568
look find this thing and maybe we say

274
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:47,879
something like in-game edit fine or find

275
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:47,879
clean edit list

276
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:00,480
right

277
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:11,899
and in here we would say you know if the

278
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:21,899
if the ingame edit existed or not and

279
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:26,909
this would just take one of these so if

280
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:32,448
you asked us to match that pointer we

281
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:35,429
would say okay you know here's our test

282
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:40,078
as long as the test is not equal to the

283
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:54,109
sentinel we'll look if we find one of

284
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:54,109
these we'll say okay here's our result

285
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:04,049
so in here we just say look if the test

286
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:07,500
equals the match then go so we look here

287
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:09,599
we say look through this list if you

288
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:21,659
find the thing you found it if not you

289
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:24,199
didn't right and so here we can say if

290
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,198
the Edit

291
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:36,219
that we're talking about which is the

292
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:38,259
clean edit if the Edit exists in the

293
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,210
undo sentinel then it is the undo

294
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:42,210
sentinel list that we're talking about

295
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:52,750
so result equals editor undo sentinel

296
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:56,589
else if the edit exists you know I guess

297
00:16:52,750 --> 00:17:00,009
in this case we could say result equals

298
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:03,910
editor redo sentinel and assert that the

299
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:06,220
edit exists in there because it's an

300
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:10,379
error to ever be in a case where somehow

301
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,380
it didn't exist in either of them right

302
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,000
so I'm gonna do one other thing here

303
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:23,859
because I need to I need this to make

304
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,720
sure that if the list is empty or that's

305
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:28,149
or the match was equal to the sentinel

306
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,430
that we return right away and so what

307
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm gonna do here I might do this I

308
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:36,240
might say that

309
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:48,429
so now what I can do is say if the

310
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:55,309
sentinel equals the match

311
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:57,289
you know same because we do at startup

312
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:01,970
have clean edit just point to the

313
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:03,619
sentinel right it's just nothing so if

314
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,240
it happens equal to sentinel that needs

315
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:06,319
to still return true so we need to

316
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,970
basically do this

317
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:12,319
and then and then I think we're good

318
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:14,210
right so what we can do now is implement

319
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,250
these more properly we can say when we

320
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,410
go to save all the changes that we're

321
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,599
going to save what we could do is see

322
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:25,880
which one of these we need so we can say

323
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:27,349
the in-game edit list in question equals

324
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,780
fine clean edit list and there's the

325
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:32,089
editor and then we can just loop through

326
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,500
that list and know that well we don't

327
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:36,500
know which list it was in but we also

328
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,329
don't care right we know that we have to

329
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:43,900
go through everything up until that

330
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:43,899
point so we know that we just need to

331
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:52,519
take whatever list were given and go

332
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:56,809
from there oops why change that to list

333
00:18:52,519 --> 00:19:00,769
for no reason so when we're doing this

334
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:07,339
then here's the part where we would mark

335
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:10,849
this asset for writing etc and then at

336
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:14,059
the end of this we would mark the clean

337
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:17,539
edit as being at the end of the undo

338
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:19,279
sentinel or the redo sentinel or whoever

339
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:22,190
right because we are saving all the

340
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,660
changes so now it's fine so that seems

341
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:28,100
like it doesn't matter whether we use

342
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:33,250
the undo or the redo one in this case I

343
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:33,250
don't think I have to think about that

344
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:43,120
I wonder we may need to include an

345
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,119
actual link

346
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,429
so I'm not really sure we'll have to

347
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:15,720
test that I'm not sure whether we need

348
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:18,330
to put something in there or not

349
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,950
my gut instinct says we don't because as

350
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:24,928
long as we specify what this was

351
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:26,819
supposed to be there's only two cases

352
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:29,160
either it actually was something in

353
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:32,149
which case that something is now being

354
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,759
tracked as the state that had to be

355
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:38,340
valid if it was nothing then there isn't

356
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:43,230
anything on the undo list anyway and so

357
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:50,879
once you are in that position you should

358
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:57,019
be good to go right because you can't

359
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:58,860
hit redo anyway so I think that's okay

360
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,139
so really the only thing we need to

361
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:03,599
modify then after that is just the

362
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,919
revert function like I said it's not

363
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:13,349
really correct anymore so this needs to

364
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:15,660
do one of two things like what we really

365
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:20,039
need to do on revert is we need to say

366
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:24,480
hey tell us which one of these two it is

367
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:26,879
right and you know I could actually do

368
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,759
this myself because you know since I

369
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,530
need to do two different loops it

370
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,759
doesn't really matter I guess but you

371
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:38,178
know in this case I got that backwards

372
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,179
there

373
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:53,980
if it happens to be in the undo stack

374
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:56,679
then I just keep undoing until I'm done

375
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:03,370
and if it happens to be in the other

376
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:06,970
sack right so you know that's the same

377
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:10,389
path as before if the clean edit was

378
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,829
actually in the other sack though then

379
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,610
what we would need to do and let me also

380
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,079
do that assertion

381
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:19,329
I didn't mean to delete that because you

382
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:21,220
might as well can continue with that if

383
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:23,500
it happens to be in the other stack then

384
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:30,690
what I would need to do is do reduce

385
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:30,690
right now that this is the same you know

386
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:42,220
meaning I'm still waiting for this to be

387
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:47,289
the case if that makes sense but I would

388
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:52,509
redo I would keep doing reduce to get to

389
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:54,940
that point because I'm actually instead

390
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:59,049
of undoing I need to do reduce to get to

391
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:02,680
get there if that makes sense and so

392
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:05,619
that case happens when I save the game

393
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,950
or save the state so I mark something

394
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:11,799
and then rather than the user making

395
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:17,049
edits they actually hit undo a couple

396
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:19,450
times and now if they want to revert it

397
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:21,279
means reverting is actually redoes

398
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,049
changes it doesn't undo changes it

399
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,899
redoes them to get back to the state of

400
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:29,829
the file you know what I mean so I think

401
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:31,060
that's correct again we may be going a

402
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:32,319
little bit further than we need to here

403
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,599
because this is just an in-game editor

404
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,919
for our own use and getting all this

405
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:43,049
stuff right is probably not super

406
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:43,050
necessary but you know

407
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:56,700
it is an educational stream after all so

408
00:23:50,039 --> 00:24:00,750
there we go don't know if there's any

409
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:03,240
other things yeah so when we actually do

410
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:06,059
this loop now and we look through the

411
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:12,269
list to find whichever list has the

412
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:18,839
clean edit in it we look through to see

413
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:21,029
where that is we need to go for each

414
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,470
edit and figure out how to mark that

415
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:24,359
edit is something that needs to get

416
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:29,190
rewritten right that needs to get

417
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:36,809
written back and so in the actual file

418
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:42,289
the the asset manager right inside here

419
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:45,779
we kind of have these we have like a

420
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:47,460
notion of where the thing came from that

421
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:51,720
we store like the file index in the

422
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:53,460
asset index and file so for each one of

423
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,370
the assets that we know we touched in

424
00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:00,029
the edit we can go to the asset file and

425
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:03,079
mark it as modified so we know that it

426
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:06,149
needs to get written back at that point

427
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:09,419
allow editing is an interesting thing I

428
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:11,250
don't know if maybe we should be looking

429
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,070
at that allow editing flag to see

430
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,900
earlier on in the process to prevent you

431
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:18,629
for example from selecting things you

432
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:24,300
couldn't edit or prevent you from

433
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:30,090
selecting things yeah I mean I don't

434
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:32,009
know what we probably would have to do

435
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:34,709
in the future if we wanted to be super

436
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:36,000
good about it is if you tried to edit

437
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,400
something that was in a file that

438
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,630
doesn't allow editing we would create a

439
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:48,840
new file for you and then the edits

440
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:50,400
would go in there right so it also means

441
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,839
we could change the way that we are

442
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,620
doing like we could make that local HHA

443
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,599
we could make that be a thing too

444
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:02,529
so we'll see we'll see how we want to do

445
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:03,579
in the future for now however all we

446
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:05,920
really need to do worry about is

447
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:08,259
modifying setting that modified flag to

448
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,710
be true anytime we've done edit in an

449
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:13,629
asset that's in one of those files and

450
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,430
that part's pretty easy because it

451
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:17,650
doesn't actually matter like how many

452
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:20,440
times we set that flag so basically what

453
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:22,690
we'd be doing here is saying well you

454
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,059
know file modified equals true

455
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:28,269
so what we really need to do is get

456
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:37,470
whatever the asset was for this change

457
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:42,309
right you know something like this and

458
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:44,200
in here we would just say well assuming

459
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:46,809
this change related to an asset of some

460
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,269
kind then we need to get the file for

461
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:50,619
the asset which we kind of know is just

462
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:53,619
look it's something we can just look up

463
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:55,979
directly in here right because we know

464
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:59,919
that there's the list of asset files is

465
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:05,460
maintained by the system I don't

466
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,460
actually know assets source file

467
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:28,820
I'll be honest I don't really know to

468
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:28,819
what extent we need this anymore but

469
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,058
all right doesn't matter um so anyway

470
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,950
we're all we're gonna do here is set

471
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,990
that modified equal to true and so all

472
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:56,759
we have to do is get the file you know

473
00:27:45,990 --> 00:28:00,000
for that asset right and in here when we

474
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:04,740
you know for this particular asset when

475
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:11,009
we get that that file back we decided to

476
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:13,140
modify the trip so the thing that we

477
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:15,480
don't really have at the moment like I

478
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:19,980
saying is the other side of this which

479
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:24,298
is that if an assets gets modified in

480
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,860
here we kind of want to specify that it

481
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:28,668
needs to get rewritten that it's

482
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:32,668
specific data needs to get rewritten and

483
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:38,630
so that part is a little bit harder like

484
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:38,630
I don't know exactly how we would I

485
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:46,798
don't know exactly how we would do that

486
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:48,089
cleanly there's two ways we could one's

487
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,599
probably a little more work than it's

488
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:55,649
worth because you know C++ and its

489
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,819
terribleness but really all we want to

490
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,809
do here is just create a little local

491
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:02,069
hash table and use it but of course that

492
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:03,509
would bring us into template nightmare

493
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:05,700
land if we were gonna have stuff that

494
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:07,558
that was able to do that where we just

495
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,909
want to mark like okay which assets do

496
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:12,720
we actually need to save the file which

497
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:16,080
ones we don't and so you know I don't I

498
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,519
I don't love the idea in here of having

499
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,079
it so that we have to rewrite that but

500
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,730
you know the other thing we could do is

501
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:26,519
just rewrite all the text files every

502
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:32,599
time let me save or just diff the

503
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,599
contents you know of those text files so

504
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:51,388
I think I may just leave it at that and

505
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,329
we'll go from there

506
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:59,219
so I mean here we do get a set for edit

507
00:29:54,329 --> 00:30:00,118
and we go look up in one of these files

508
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:08,940
here let's see

509
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:13,709
so set active asset turn eyes see no no

510
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:17,399
no no that matters so right here it's

511
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:19,619
basically this stuff so what I want to

512
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,319
do is have something that for one of

513
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:24,178
these types which again you know we

514
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,358
don't really know what it does because

515
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,528
they can be any kind of edit in here

516
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:32,460
then what we want to do is something

517
00:30:28,528 --> 00:30:39,239
like this where we say okay you know for

518
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:40,288
each asset or rather for this edit look

519
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:42,720
at what type it is

520
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:45,138
and if we know what kind of you know

521
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,179
edited actually is then we can get the

522
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:52,638
asset back pretty easily you know we can

523
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:52,639
say get asset and do it this way

524
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:03,538
something like this and then later if we

525
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,460
have other types that can also report

526
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:13,460
one of those we can have a way of

527
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:15,929
getting them in here as necessary so

528
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,278
once we have that then we really just

529
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:20,159
need something that allows to get the

530
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:25,099
file and I don't actually know that

531
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:28,019
we've ever done that you can get a file

532
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:30,868
from a file index but not necessary from

533
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:34,649
an asset so but that's probably fine I

534
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:35,488
mean we could just say get file and and

535
00:31:34,648 --> 00:31:39,148
leave it at that

536
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:43,470
right so get file we passed the editor

537
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:49,378
assets and file index for that asset and

538
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:52,460
that may be sufficient right that is not

539
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:52,459
what I meant to type

540
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:05,519
and neither is that what else we get

541
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:07,500
alright so in terms of the matching

542
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,389
there I'm gonna go ahead and switch this

543
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,769
build to debug mode and just step

544
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:14,160
through there cuz I want to see what

545
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:16,500
that actually does because we added some

546
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,759
stuff there and I do you know I know

547
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,140
what I wanted it to do but who knows if

548
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:23,279
I made a typo in there somewhere and

549
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,170
just want to make sure that it's

550
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,599
actually gonna do what I wanted it to do

551
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:31,500
and not some other thing that is

552
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:35,639
unrelated to those so let's suppose I

553
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:40,319
come out here and I want to edit the

554
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:44,270
little cat head again and you know in

555
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:47,609
sear I just can select the the cat right

556
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:49,619
so as you can see it's it's a default

557
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:51,329
state doesn't have anything special here

558
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:54,689
so I'm gonna like edit it a little bit

559
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:56,939
I'm gonna place it on the ground in a

560
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:00,210
more specific fashion I'm gonna set the

561
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,710
base of neck I'm gonna move the base of

562
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:06,090
the neck up to roughly where the base of

563
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:08,279
neck should be and then I'm gonna select

564
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:11,579
the head again

565
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:15,809
or whatever that's called this piece

566
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:19,199
right and then I'm going to adjust that

567
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:23,819
so that the bat piece does roughly what

568
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:26,009
I expect as well I don't know exactly

569
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:28,109
how I want that so now I've got two

570
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:31,259
assets that should have been edited

571
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:34,289
there and I want to set a breakpoint so

572
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:36,269
I can watch what the assets what the

573
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:39,990
in-game editor does when I say that I

574
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:42,500
wanted to save it so let's see I think

575
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:46,680
that was called save all changes right

576
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:51,119
and now if I go to the HHA and I hit

577
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:52,710
save I want to see what it does so first

578
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:53,189
it's going to look to see where this

579
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,079
thing is

580
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,559
and it correctly located it here

581
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:59,609
hopefully correctly I located it here

582
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:01,259
which is exactly where it should have

583
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:04,229
located it so hopefully that is what

584
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:04,950
happened then we can say all right for

585
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,710
any given

586
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:11,159
edit like I should have if I look in

587
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:13,168
here now for any given edit I should

588
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,829
have a thing where I see like you know

589
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:19,108
what what had actually changed and you

590
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:23,599
can see here it said like ok asset 307

591
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:27,628
edited it's 0 the line point right and

592
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,720
so you know what's actually what's it

593
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:34,828
actually gonna do I want to get the file

594
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:39,480
back that should be local doubt HHA I

595
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:42,899
think should be the file in question of

596
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,320
course I don't actually know if it is or

597
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:46,138
isn't

598
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,320
I should probably bake some naming stuff

599
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:50,909
into the header of the file so that you

600
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,700
can actually see after you've loaded it

601
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:55,679
what it actually is because I don't

602
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:57,269
think the platform stores the file name

603
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,789
maybe it does I don't know I don't think

604
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:03,809
it does though does it well let's see no

605
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:05,338
it definitely doesn't I mean you can

606
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:08,269
even see that it's not a pointer right

607
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:11,130
it's like a kernel handle or something

608
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:13,380
so in here I'm gonna say that this file

609
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:16,890
is now modified so it's gonna set that

610
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,180
to true and of course I'm assuming it

611
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:19,920
did set it to true even though Visual

612
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:22,019
Studio so help to lead prevents us from

613
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,480
being able to see anything after we step

614
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:28,199
out of a scope do not know whose idea

615
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,579
that was but that person if they didn't

616
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:35,730
already quit and go work somewhere else

617
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:37,740
is fired so you know here's this setting

618
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,269
all those modified Flags presumably all

619
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,389
in the same file because these all come

620
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:44,250
from the local HHA we then said so that

621
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:46,799
like we assume that the edit is we

622
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,730
assume that the edits clean now now

623
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,160
we're gonna go through here and there

624
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:53,579
should be that local HHA should actually

625
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:55,799
be marked as modified so when we get

626
00:35:53,579 --> 00:36:01,310
there which is here we should write all

627
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,310
of them out again and that should be it

628
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:10,680
so now in theory that data was saved to

629
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:12,630
the HHA and so if we load the game again

630
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,480
we should get back to a situation where

631
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,190
those edits are preserved again only in

632
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,539
the HHA and we can't see that that

633
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,929
actually is true

634
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:24,000
right so that's really all we need to do

635
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:26,399
to save the stuff and if you didn't mind

636
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,309
Rhys aligning everything in the game

637
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,619
every time you wanted to build the hhas

638
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:34,019
you could just do that right that could

639
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,719
be the end of it but like I said I'm not

640
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:39,869
sure we want to use that as our as our

641
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,639
permanent file format that seems

642
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:44,460
ill-advised you know what else we should

643
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:51,059
do we should we should well we're on the

644
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:56,960
subject in entity Jen the cat head in

645
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:59,460
here I'm I'm not sure why we're getting

646
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:04,050
you know if you look at what's happening

647
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:06,960
here I don't really know why we're

648
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:09,930
getting these happening in the same

649
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,240
place like I don't understand why these

650
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:14,549
the why they're z-fighting

651
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:17,759
exactly because if you look at like the

652
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:20,700
entity visible piece body and entity

653
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,800
visible piece head stuff it looks like

654
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:26,039
we should it looks like maybe it's

655
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,410
ignoring the offset or something

656
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:41,509
and so I wonderfully maybe have that

657
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:41,509
code wrong a little bit because sort of

658
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:52,079
these are offsets relative to where they

659
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:54,030
should be just placement wise right so

660
00:37:52,079 --> 00:38:04,079
in the sense they should just both be

661
00:37:54,030 --> 00:38:08,340
set to this you know what I mean like

662
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,920
that's the initial settings and if we go

663
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:14,789
look at what actually happens when you

664
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,289
create one of these you know what I mean

665
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:19,529
and we go over here and look at what

666
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:21,000
where that actually places things then

667
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,640
presumably like you know it's kind of

668
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,590
stuck in the ground right you can see it

669
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:29,969
you can see it's stuck down in there

670
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:33,809
right but what I'm not sure about is why

671
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:36,480
because in theory if the alignment point

672
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:38,369
is on the bottom of the cat the point

673
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,710
that it's standing on should be like up

674
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:43,380
here somewhere and so it should be

675
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:47,608
starting up like I worry that we've got

676
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:49,680
a bug in the entity placement code and

677
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:51,150
we haven't really streamlined that code

678
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,230
yet we only just kind of put in the

679
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,329
basics of it yet

680
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,559
and so I am a little bit concerned and

681
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:57,210
like if you look at a lot of this stuff

682
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:57,750
there's just a lot of nonsense going on

683
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,369
in here

684
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,079
and we haven't looked at it in a while

685
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:02,460
and we probably needed to get a little

686
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:04,889
more serious about it because especially

687
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,570
if we're gonna start saving data out

688
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:11,129
where we're like doing actual work to

689
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:12,900
position art assets we don't want all of

690
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:16,220
that positioning to be based on a

691
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,900
mistake you know what I mean

692
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:22,319
so when we do stuff like the alignment

693
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:24,539
here and we set the initial P you can

694
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,019
see like this stuff is you can already

695
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:30,869
see that's wrong in a lot of ways the

696
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:32,940
initial P this piece offset actually has

697
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:36,260
to be added afterwards because it's

698
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:38,849
supposed to be the offset from the

699
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,740
location that you would snap to right

700
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:44,789
because the piece offset is a separate

701
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:45,959
offset so you know that is really what

702
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:48,509
should be happening there because that's

703
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,099
what would allow this to say wherever

704
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,480
this thing snaps to here's how much I

705
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,099
want to offset it which we want to be

706
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,940
able to do for things like Z and stuff

707
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,750
to like offset the position that you

708
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:07,490
know we want to be able

709
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:07,489
do so you know so that's that and

710
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:26,769
looking at the entity ground P part of

711
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:29,320
things I guess I don't know how that's

712
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:30,579
actually being set and I would like to

713
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,710
know where that is

714
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:44,440
so we may want to look at that a little

715
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:47,650
more carefully to make sure it's

716
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,300
actually on the ground but the offset

717
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,070
parameter is the only thing I was

718
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,100
worried about here like where are we

719
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:56,920
getting that from so when we say offset

720
00:40:54,099 --> 00:41:02,799
what do we mean and it looks like we're

721
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:07,619
talking about you know mostly animation

722
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:10,269
there so that's fine

723
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:15,820
so that really shouldn't be anything at

724
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:18,190
the moment so it's really just the enemy

725
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,470
ground P so assuming that that's the

726
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:22,929
case what is happening here we've got

727
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:24,819
the P sprite specific or so we're using

728
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:26,618
that whatever that parent is and the get

729
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,400
P percent for the parents alignment with

730
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:29,289
that all seems fine

731
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,950
and then we're changing that height

732
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:37,570
ratio there so that Vettel looks fine

733
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:41,829
and when we go to get the the parameters

734
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:45,750
when we use the initial P that should be

735
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:51,989
the the point that that it aligns around

736
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:51,989
right so let me just make sure

737
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:07,989
here's sprite values for upright so

738
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:10,369
inside here where we specify the

739
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:13,008
alignment of this thing we do subtract

740
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:16,130
backwards based on the alignment X and

741
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:17,900
alignment Y so if the alignment is at

742
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:26,079
the base of that thing

743
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:36,170
then I mean that should do it right like

744
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:38,869
so I feel like I feel like the only

745
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:42,289
thing I'm not sure about is what happens

746
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:45,140
with the min P that that all makes good

747
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:47,900
sense and the sprite scaled x axis stuff

748
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:50,268
let me just double check then we can go

749
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:56,180
see if there's anything else weird going

750
00:42:50,268 --> 00:43:00,858
on there but in here it's want to make

751
00:42:56,179 --> 00:43:02,449
sure this is kosher yeah so that all

752
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:04,338
looks fine so we start at that base P

753
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:06,018
and then we push around from there so

754
00:43:04,338 --> 00:43:08,239
yeah I'm not sure why that's stuck in

755
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:09,858
the ground and and I want to get the

756
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:14,389
bottom of that first so I'm gonna draw

757
00:43:09,858 --> 00:43:17,960
some of these things because I that's

758
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:18,379
not good right that's that's not a good

759
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,750
thing

760
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:26,900
what's happening there so the the fact

761
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:29,809
that that seems like like this point

762
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:33,769
here and in fact you know if I look in

763
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:35,750
the editor here let me pick this cat if

764
00:43:33,768 --> 00:43:38,199
I look in the editor here at where the

765
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:40,309
points have to be that's way too thick

766
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:43,449
that stuff needs to be based on like the

767
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:43,450
screen space size or something

768
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:01,450
can I get that thinner alright that may

769
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:01,449
be a little too thin

770
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:23,969
I know it wasn't even just didn't have

771
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,970
selected there we go

772
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:33,940
so looking at that I mean you can even

773
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:35,379
see just like if we look at the

774
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,349
alignment points you can see that it's

775
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:43,930
to parent alignment point is that red

776
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:46,929
block right so if that red block is

777
00:44:43,929 --> 00:44:50,319
where the thing was standing why isn't

778
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:58,419
it you know why isn't it up on this

779
00:44:50,320 --> 00:45:03,280
thing you know I mean that just doesn't

780
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:06,070
make a lot of sense it seems like it's

781
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,210
not actually placing that entity on any

782
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:11,980
thing which may be true like for all I

783
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:15,269
know like it may be that we didn't

784
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:17,619
actually place this entity on anything

785
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:20,920
like when we do one of these place

786
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:27,599
entity calls like that part is a little

787
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:33,070
bit Squinkie in that you know the

788
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:36,069
standing on thing I don't like I don't

789
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:38,890
know is it set to anything I assume it

790
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:42,430
is but again I don't really know what

791
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:44,529
happens in that case like it's been a

792
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:47,289
while since we did anything with that

793
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:49,120
and so when we do a world position P for

794
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:52,630
placement I don't know if like the

795
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:56,139
standing on thing properly overrides

796
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:58,720
that or what happens there right so I

797
00:45:56,139 --> 00:46:03,730
feel like that is a little bit busted

798
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:07,929
probably and you know we should double

799
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:11,380
check to make sure that's all flowing

800
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:12,569
properly and you know cuz that's a part

801
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,980
of the code that we haven't really

802
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:19,690
gotten to yet like that's a part of the

803
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:24,219
code we haven't really pushed on much so

804
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:29,230
where am I Jenning my cat here you can

805
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:32,199
see here we create the pending entity

806
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:36,449
here and the reference to the

807
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:36,449
traversable is is here

808
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:55,620
you know and looking at this I guess I

809
00:46:49,829 --> 00:47:01,289
would say I can't quite tell but that

810
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:05,900
does look wrong if that's the like here

811
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:12,559
we've created an entity for the for the

812
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:17,030
floor right and we've said that the

813
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:22,489
traversable on it is at zero zero zero

814
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:29,240
but when we push a piece on there and

815
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:29,239
you know we can look it like this stuff

816
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:37,279
when we push a piece on there all this

817
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:40,530
stuff comes into play and like who knows

818
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,420
you know is the zero zero actually there

819
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:45,810
or not like we've got all this nonsense

820
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:48,180
going on here and these offsets and all

821
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:49,789
this other stuff so you know we got to

822
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:52,409
make sure that this stuff actually is

823
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:57,329
accurately placed where it should be

824
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:59,339
placed if the assets location so in this

825
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:04,710
case like we have a dimension here

826
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:08,370
that's 0.5 times the wall height and we

827
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:10,470
offset it by negative 0.5 times the wall

828
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:12,329
height so if we assume that's a radius

829
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:15,389
then this is trying to place it

830
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:18,440
downwards so that 0 0 0 is the correct

831
00:48:15,389 --> 00:48:18,440
location to stand on

832
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:42,639
so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and draw

833
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:44,680
whatever those traversable points are

834
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,719
first I think that's the easiest thing

835
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:48,039
to do because like I said I'm just I'm a

836
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:49,598
little weirded out right now and I don't

837
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:51,130
really want to move forwards until I

838
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,640
have a good understanding of what's

839
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:56,050
happening there so we've got a little

840
00:48:54,639 --> 00:49:00,039
thing for drink - rustles here let's

841
00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:02,609
rien a bat a little bit I don't really

842
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:04,659
know what this is for

843
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:10,509
looks like we were drawing some kind of

844
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:13,858
a rectangle for no real reason so I'm

845
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,859
just gonna go ahead and actually say

846
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,059
let's draw a cube on it

847
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:29,079
so we know that we've got the entity

848
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:30,369
ground point here I guess and at least I

849
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:33,789
think this would give us the position

850
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:36,099
that we should be looking at there in

851
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:38,108
terms of the traversable so if I wanted

852
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:39,940
to draw a cube that would show me where

853
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:46,318
that was you know I can I can use

854
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:46,318
essentially this code for drawing a cube

855
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:56,920
and so if I wanted to put one of these

856
00:49:52,568 --> 00:49:59,409
on there at this location and then

857
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,809
define some kind of a point there you

858
00:49:59,409 --> 00:50:03,818
know maybe it looks like this I'm gonna

859
00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:08,429
use a known color here

860
00:50:03,818 --> 00:50:13,800
maybe magenta and then I'm going to

861
00:50:08,429 --> 00:50:13,799
render that those traversable x'

862
00:50:22,248 --> 00:50:32,669
so you know they're definitely in the

863
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:34,828
right place so something is busted about

864
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,150
the way we're we're placing the cat on

865
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:40,650
there and that's what I'd like to

866
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:42,269
address because before I I'm not gonna

867
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:44,729
go any further till I have that exact

868
00:50:42,268 --> 00:50:46,468
right so those all look like they're in

869
00:50:44,728 --> 00:50:50,429
in exactly where we think they should be

870
00:50:46,469 --> 00:50:52,708
and so I want to know why the cat isn't

871
00:50:50,429 --> 00:50:58,108
getting placed on to that traversable

872
00:50:52,708 --> 00:51:00,118
properly now one reason could be if

873
00:50:58,108 --> 00:51:02,518
that's not what actually happens

874
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,528
meaning we didn't actually do any code

875
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:06,389
like maybe we didn't actually do

876
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:08,130
anything that tries to snap people to

877
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:09,808
traversable x' meaning if someone's

878
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:13,619
standing on something maybe that's not

879
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:15,749
how that works I don't know so I'm gonna

880
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:25,528
look real quick just to see what happens

881
00:51:15,748 --> 00:51:29,578
when you add a cure oh and I'm gonna see

882
00:51:25,528 --> 00:51:39,420
what happens there so let's see where

883
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:47,910
that is so in here it looked yeah it

884
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:49,619
looks like you actually have to do it

885
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:54,199
looks like you actually have to do this

886
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:54,199
call for the cat

887
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,059
so I don't know I think we're gonna look

888
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:03,130
you know look this is code that we want

889
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:04,840
to go do eventually look later on anyway

890
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:07,960
so I guess I won't worry about too much

891
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:11,500
for now but you can see like this is

892
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:15,210
just a little bit much at this point so

893
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,210
I guess if we just say that

894
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,880
um yeah I guess if we just say that

895
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,588
that's good enough for now

896
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,880
but really we want to get that stuff a

897
00:52:47,588 --> 00:52:50,798
little more automated this is just too

898
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,329
much busy work to be doing here and we

899
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:54,489
don't need to do it because it's gonna

900
00:52:52,329 --> 00:52:56,318
do this again later anyway so why this

901
00:52:54,489 --> 00:52:58,209
would be happening upfront I have no

902
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:00,190
idea because entities should just be

903
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,568
placed in in regular sim space to begin

904
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:04,450
with because that's what we're actually

905
00:53:01,568 --> 00:53:10,900
operating in at the moment so I don't

906
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:33,778
know what's going on there this this is

907
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:33,778
just garbage so that seems stupid I

908
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:43,778
don't remember what the region is called

909
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:46,538
here just just regular region I guess if

910
00:53:43,778 --> 00:53:49,088
that's dumb and you know before we get

911
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:50,739
to hot and heavy in that code which will

912
00:53:49,088 --> 00:53:51,849
be more gameplay side of things we

913
00:53:50,739 --> 00:53:55,119
should just clean that up because

914
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:59,019
there's no need for that that's just

915
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:03,338
silly so let's see what's going on here

916
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:05,078
of course that that does not appear to

917
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:14,349
have helped it definitely moved our cat

918
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:17,650
to a different place right but it does

919
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:20,380
not seem to have actually fixed the part

920
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:27,599
I was interested in so again still not

921
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:27,599
really helpful here I also where is the

922
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:36,469
get entity ground points

923
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:58,679
so we also don't really have you can see

924
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:00,538
there's just a lot of vestigial remains

925
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:02,159
stuff here and we don't like look so we

926
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:05,099
don't even have the notion of identity

927
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:07,440
ground point anymore and for obvious

928
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:08,940
reasons because pieces can have offsets

929
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:16,220
to them already so this stuff is just

930
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:18,510
irrelevant right so you know this is not

931
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:21,118
something we would ever need to actually

932
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:23,099
have because entities would always be

933
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,048
related to wherever they were and the

934
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:29,910
ground point part of things is not

935
00:55:25,048 --> 00:55:31,679
really a thing like I feel like this is

936
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:34,379
just not really a thing so I'm

937
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:43,528
interested to know who's actually using

938
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:50,970
that and why and the answer is

939
00:55:43,528 --> 00:55:53,909
absolutely no one so what we want to

940
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:56,189
find out is why is this position not

941
00:55:53,909 --> 00:56:01,199
being in like placing the cat squarely

942
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:04,380
on the ground like what is the what's

943
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:07,858
the issue there because we should see

944
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,390
the red point of the cat snap directly

945
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:11,429
to the purple point of the ground

946
00:56:09,389 --> 00:56:16,828
because that's the initial placement in

947
00:56:11,429 --> 00:56:17,940
theory of what it should be so this is

948
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:19,859
the thing I want to do here is just

949
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:23,250
figure out is something else stupid

950
00:56:19,858 --> 00:56:25,739
happening so in here where we highlight

951
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:27,298
somebody I'm gonna also in addition to

952
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:31,459
highlighting you know the various other

953
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:33,900
aspects of this entity I want to just

954
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:36,750
you know show where's the entity

955
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:39,260
position you know look where's that at

956
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:41,519
show me like a white marker or something

957
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:45,170
at that location

958
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:48,239
so I can figure out what the heck

959
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:51,240
happened in terms of its placement

960
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:53,368
because at the moment anyway I don't

961
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:56,038
really know and I'm gonna make this a

962
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:58,798
little bit bigger at the moment I don't

963
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:01,800
really know whether or not the entity's

964
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:04,679
position value is wrong or whether the

965
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:07,470
these transform stuff is wrong and so I

966
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:10,500
want to eliminate I want to get down to

967
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:12,389
figuring out which one is the the

968
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,460
culprit before I start trying to bug

969
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:17,940
anything so looking at the cat from the

970
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:22,409
underside here if I select it you can

971
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:24,179
see the white point there so it's the

972
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:25,980
entity's actual position that's wrong

973
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:28,710
because the white point is properly

974
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,809
pegged so for whatever reason even

975
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:33,329
though we were trying to set it so that

976
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:36,869
it would be there it's actually not

977
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:42,090
there and we don't know why so we now

978
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:45,659
have a concrete reason why who's to

979
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:49,350
blame right and so we want to go figure

980
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:54,509
out what's displacing the entity's

981
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:59,639
position in that fashion and so that in

982
00:57:54,510 --> 00:58:02,640
theory anyway is like the the get sim

983
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:09,809
space traversable thing we were

984
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:12,509
recalling here oh haha so I think I know

985
00:58:09,809 --> 00:58:16,170
why that would be the case so if you

986
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:21,480
look at what happens here in the room

987
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:23,930
gem so if we're gonna call this function

988
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:29,610
you'll notice we don't place this entity

989
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:32,460
until here right and so really we

990
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:36,630
probably need to wait to do this

991
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:40,159
somewhere else so we kind of want to do

992
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:40,160
something more like this I guess

993
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:56,730
because if we plate we have to place

994
00:58:54,690 --> 00:59:00,990
this entity before we can place an

995
00:58:56,730 --> 00:59:02,849
entity onto it right so we kind of want

996
00:59:00,989 --> 00:59:07,939
to do this and we want to do this only

997
00:59:02,849 --> 00:59:07,940
if the traversable count is one I guess

998
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:26,789
so now will will have actually placed

999
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:28,739
the floor tile prior to calling the

1000
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:31,829
placement of the entity onto the floor

1001
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:34,319
tile and lo and behold now we're

1002
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:37,949
actually doing the thing correctly right

1003
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:42,480
and so now if I actually look at this

1004
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:44,699
this this cat here you can see that it's

1005
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,420
it's welded properly to the to the floor

1006
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:50,129
the way that I would expect

1007
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:52,108
unfortunately as with like one of the

1008
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:55,289
reasons we need a proper debug camera

1009
00:59:52,108 --> 00:59:57,449
here is I can't really focus on that as

1010
00:59:55,289 --> 01:00:00,389
well as I would like you know I'd like

1011
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:02,939
to be able to to zoom in on just that

1012
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:04,799
thing and so that's why we really we

1013
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:06,929
really really need a debug camera at

1014
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,250
some point here a real one

1015
01:00:06,929 --> 01:00:10,289
because otherwise we'll never be able to

1016
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:12,809
edit this stuff properly but that looks

1017
01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:15,329
about right and so if I look at the

1018
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:20,789
alignment points here now and we whoops

1019
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:22,289
that's the head in theory like you know

1020
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:24,509
if you were to place it so that it's

1021
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:26,880
square on there it would look exactly as

1022
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:31,790
it should yeah like it lines up exactly

1023
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:34,108
as it should uh and so yeah just like

1024
01:00:31,789 --> 01:00:35,550
this is exactly what I would have

1025
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:38,730
expected to have happen and it looks

1026
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,510
correct and now you can also see this is

1027
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:41,940
the thing I was talking about before

1028
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:44,310
about how we need some idea of how we

1029
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:46,760
want to bias the Z values because if

1030
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:48,929
you're sitting on the center you

1031
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:51,600
actually have a part of your sprite that

1032
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:54,329
will naturally dip below and so we need

1033
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,099
to you know we're the problem is a

1034
01:00:54,329 --> 01:00:57,630
sprite encode stuff that technically

1035
01:00:56,099 --> 01:01:00,719
comes out this way

1036
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:02,490
in negative Y and the renderer doesn't

1037
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,019
know that so it just thinks it's a plate

1038
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:06,089
that's extending down into the ground

1039
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:08,099
and so that's the part not be able to

1040
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:09,780
see the bottom of that cat is the part

1041
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:11,880
there that I was talking about and you

1042
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:14,610
know that's about biasing those Z values

1043
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:17,070
so that we don't have that issue but

1044
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:19,170
otherwise now that's all correct and now

1045
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:22,170
we can also do what I want to do before

1046
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:27,180
with like offsetting these sprites so

1047
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:30,480
now oops so now when we create these

1048
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:35,069
entities we should be able to use this

1049
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:43,590
the piece offsets themselves to make the

1050
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:46,470
sprites be offset in Z offset in Z in

1051
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:48,420
various ways that would allow them to

1052
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:56,989
sort of shift location a little bit more

1053
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:56,990
to in terms of how that wants to happen

1054
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:10,260
the only thing that's a little confusing

1055
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:12,960
is I almost feel like you want these

1056
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:15,840
peace offsets in this case to be

1057
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,059
relative to some coordinate system on

1058
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:21,390
the actual sprite so Z would actually

1059
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:24,079
come off this way and x and y would be

1060
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:24,079
the other way

1061
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:37,818
as opposed to it being being interpreted

1062
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:43,548
in the world space which seems less

1063
01:02:37,818 --> 01:02:47,768
useful you know so for example if I say

1064
01:02:43,548 --> 01:02:50,208
that the head is displaced that way I

1065
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:54,258
feel like you really want that to mean

1066
01:02:50,208 --> 01:03:03,228
in the plane of the sprite not in the

1067
01:02:54,259 --> 01:03:04,818
world so I'm not sure I'm explaining

1068
01:03:03,228 --> 01:03:08,179
this well but like you can kind of see

1069
01:03:04,818 --> 01:03:10,788
how that displaced this right I'm not

1070
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:15,288
sure to what extent that actually makes

1071
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:17,749
sense you know maybe it's fine what to

1072
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:21,999
see so I feel like that's something we

1073
01:03:17,748 --> 01:03:21,998
got to think about a little bit more to

1074
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:27,199
hard to say but the good news is like

1075
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:29,680
all that stuff just kind of works so

1076
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:29,680
that's fine

1077
01:03:36,269 --> 01:03:42,329
where's the other cat where's the other

1078
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:42,329
kind

1079
01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:55,480
that would be about how that would look

1080
01:04:17,389 --> 01:04:25,449
because I'm not sure where that piece

1081
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:30,220
should be probably like there may be

1082
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:30,219
kissing ish

1083
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:51,809
so yeah I think that's about right in

1084
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:55,469
terms of placing the cat I don't know

1085
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:58,130
how big cats should be that's sort of

1086
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:58,129
another question

1087
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:49,368
it's like that's sort of right maybe

1088
01:05:52,608 --> 01:05:57,028
goose cats are obviously harder cuz we

1089
01:05:55,349 --> 01:06:00,298
don't really have a real ghost effect at

1090
01:05:57,028 --> 01:06:02,068
the moment anyway but you know you can

1091
01:06:00,298 --> 01:06:03,750
see that it's translucent Hanno's

1092
01:06:02,068 --> 01:06:08,460
translucent at the moment because she is

1093
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:15,079
a ghost cat so I guess that's all fine

1094
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:15,079
and yeah

1095
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:27,210
I guess that's all fine and dandy um so

1096
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:30,509
yeah so for now like that would just

1097
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:33,690
work like I was saying before we don't

1098
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:35,490
really have any we don't really have any

1099
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:38,039
issues with saving stuff and reloading

1100
01:06:35,489 --> 01:06:41,549
it like if I saved and reloaded here we

1101
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:43,139
would get back to presumably all those

1102
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:46,110
cats would be a line the same way that

1103
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:54,289
they were you can see there we got that

1104
01:06:46,110 --> 01:07:09,780
going where the other cats are here

1105
01:06:54,289 --> 01:07:13,380
right like so and so I think that is all

1106
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:15,030
we need for if we just wanted the HHA so

1107
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:20,160
the only other thing we would need is

1108
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:24,660
for permanent archival storage and for

1109
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:26,849
now I'm just gonna say like maybe we

1110
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:29,039
ignore that maybe we put that off I

1111
01:07:26,849 --> 01:07:32,219
don't know we could we could definitely

1112
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:37,349
put it off until such time as we wanted

1113
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:39,329
to actually rebuild hhas or something

1114
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:41,279
and then we could try doing that where

1115
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:43,619
we you know have a thing which dumps all

1116
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,260
of the things out to texture man HHA and

1117
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:48,599
something like this so I don't really

1118
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:52,280
know right it's hard to say I'm not sure

1119
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:52,279
how I feel about it one way or the other

1120
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:13,428
so I think what I'd rather do honestly

1121
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:15,078
yeah I'd rather just kind of go forward

1122
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:17,059
with other more pressing concerns

1123
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:18,798
because like again like having the HHA

1124
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:21,099
there is now fine with me I don't know

1125
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:21,099
like

1126
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:41,170
yeah I don't know what I will say is we

1127
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:42,699
should probably start keeping track of

1128
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:45,100
all the stuff that we should have to do

1129
01:08:42,699 --> 01:08:48,000
and maybe we can use I don't know we can

1130
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:49,900
use the github for that or something

1131
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,880
unfortunately the github has gotten a

1132
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:53,818
little bit ownerís lately because you

1133
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,380
know I I don't really have a way of

1134
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:58,240
signing on to it very easily I don't

1135
01:08:56,380 --> 01:09:04,630
think I don't know if I did it here oh I

1136
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:08,229
guess we did so if we know how do I get

1137
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:11,588
to oh okay I see yeah right look if I

1138
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:13,659
sign in here I can't actually do it

1139
01:09:11,588 --> 01:09:15,869
because I need to do two two-factor

1140
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:17,858
authentication to actually log in right

1141
01:09:15,869 --> 01:09:20,099
so that's gonna say we could start

1142
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:22,088
trying to keep it to do list on there

1143
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,120
because that way we can actually

1144
01:09:22,088 --> 01:09:29,439
everyone can see it

1145
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:33,880
who's on the private github but I'll try

1146
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:35,379
logging in later after the stream I'll

1147
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:40,588
grab my phone maybe try to keep myself

1148
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:43,480
logged in so we can use it so yeah

1149
01:09:40,588 --> 01:09:46,409
looking at the situation here I guess

1150
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,409
what I would say is

1151
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:57,060
there's just a lot of things we could be

1152
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:59,250
working on and I'm not sure which one of

1153
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:01,350
them's which ones I actually want to do

1154
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:02,819
I kind of want to just start playing

1155
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:04,320
around with it we've got so much stuff

1156
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:05,729
though that that's like on the to-do

1157
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:09,840
list now like everything could be on a

1158
01:10:05,729 --> 01:10:13,739
to-do list right um so I don't know what

1159
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:19,409
I want to do exactly who knows what I do

1160
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:21,960
think maybe I'll do at the moment so I'm

1161
01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:24,420
just looking at like this stuff and I'm

1162
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,730
thinking about the fact that ideally we

1163
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:28,920
want you know there always to be stuff

1164
01:10:26,729 --> 01:10:33,329
we don't really want a scene where

1165
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:37,289
there's just nothing there you know on

1166
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:41,220
the you know having like nothing on the

1167
01:10:37,289 --> 01:10:42,779
outside seems bad and so you know ever

1168
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:45,510
there should always be like tiles out

1169
01:10:42,779 --> 01:10:48,630
here probably to like you know that fill

1170
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:50,610
out further I'd like to do something

1171
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:52,739
that I want to make the camera work

1172
01:10:50,609 --> 01:10:54,449
properly the camera doesn't seem to be

1173
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:57,179
right at the moment like you see that

1174
01:10:54,449 --> 01:10:59,099
weird discontinuity when it goes between

1175
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:00,510
centering on rooms that's what's very

1176
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,340
strange I'm not sure what's happening

1177
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:04,980
there the lighting the projection code

1178
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:08,940
is also wrong did you notice that

1179
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:12,389
so like first we have some kind of bug

1180
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:14,669
in our scene production that's like not

1181
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:16,950
actually correctly projecting where the

1182
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:19,619
lighting band should be you know what I

1183
01:11:16,949 --> 01:11:20,609
mean so that was pretty weird too so we

1184
01:11:19,619 --> 01:11:22,109
just have so many things that I'm

1185
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:24,779
looking at now I'm kind of overwhelmed

1186
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:28,099
by all the stuff that I could do and I'm

1187
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:35,670
not sure which of it I should do first

1188
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:38,840
just really hard to say so let's let's

1189
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:45,810
see what else we have for stuff

1190
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:48,480
so inside handmade art what do we

1191
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:51,060
actually put in like we got grass stone

1192
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:54,119
floor we got the walls we got the cats

1193
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:56,730
we put the cats in there without Krampus

1194
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:59,729
and Krampus isn't in there yet we also

1195
01:11:56,729 --> 01:12:03,419
have some monsters that we haven't put

1196
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:05,299
in yet we've got ground cover we got the

1197
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:12,699
hand

1198
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:12,699
got hats here's some trees and stuff

1199
01:12:15,368 --> 01:12:28,960
Chris don't ask me why windows can't

1200
01:12:18,198 --> 01:12:32,269
show this alpha why's got title screen

1201
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:34,219
yeah so mostly yeah I mean like one

1202
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:36,020
thing I'm not we haven't really talked

1203
01:12:34,219 --> 01:12:43,130
about is how to scatter stuff around so

1204
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:47,540
like okay so this it loaded it with

1205
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:51,560
alpha this time apparently I had no idea

1206
01:12:47,539 --> 01:13:05,060
why so if we look at the like something

1207
01:12:51,560 --> 01:13:07,159
like these forest obstacles right I do

1208
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:08,719
think you know these are some things we

1209
01:13:07,158 --> 01:13:09,920
want it like one of the reasons we have

1210
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,050
these is we were sort of thinking about

1211
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,199
how are they gonna look I think these

1212
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:19,159
are probably at a set up fairly

1213
01:13:14,198 --> 01:13:21,198
reasonable like a stray Leary's large

1214
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:23,779
but I do wonder like you know if these

1215
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:26,000
were three different Tufts of the tree

1216
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:29,359
it'll probably work better because then

1217
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,279
as they slid relative to each other they

1218
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:34,908
would probably look a little bit better

1219
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:39,229
I'm just guessing because they wouldn't

1220
01:13:34,908 --> 01:13:42,170
be yeah I don't really know if that's

1221
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:44,629
true but like I do think like maybe like

1222
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:50,020
the Tufts at the top and these should be

1223
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:52,849
like separated out that's hard to say

1224
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:54,770
but you know looking at furniture like

1225
01:13:52,849 --> 01:13:56,779
the lamps and stuff here and these

1226
01:13:54,770 --> 01:14:03,260
things get to try and get these in there

1227
01:13:56,779 --> 01:14:04,698
and I don't again really know like one

1228
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:06,650
of the ideas here was for us to start

1229
01:14:04,698 --> 01:14:08,960
thinking about how these things should

1230
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:12,469
be labeled and brought in and so you

1231
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:15,969
know looking at these I'm like well how

1232
01:14:12,469 --> 01:14:15,969
would we label these things

1233
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:28,699
it's like a throw rug there's like

1234
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:28,699
tables

1235
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:45,220
you know and they just don't really have

1236
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,479
any association with each other they're

1237
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,860
just things that happen to be in the

1238
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:49,479
orphanage so I feel like they probably

1239
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:52,389
want to be broken into like separate

1240
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:56,169
files to a certain extent there we're

1241
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:57,970
like you know you would probably have

1242
01:14:56,170 --> 01:15:01,529
each file then you would just text name

1243
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:01,530
it what it was actually gonna be

1244
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:31,948
yeah I really don't know I really don't

1245
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:31,948
know

1246
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:50,729
I wonder what it is that makes it so it

1247
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,589
shows alpha or not like why does it show

1248
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:56,339
alpha sometimes on the forest obstacles

1249
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:59,970
and sometimes it doesn't like did you

1250
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:14,420
notice it's it's got it now right the

1251
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:14,420
Alpha composited this time right so why

1252
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:20,030
what what what is it what's the magic

1253
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:34,109
like this time it didn't it's kind of

1254
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:35,190
magic like you what I it's like how it's

1255
01:16:34,109 --> 01:16:36,899
almost a game to figure out how

1256
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:38,939
Microsoft wrote that code like I would

1257
01:16:36,899 --> 01:16:42,379
how do they make it so sometimes the off

1258
01:16:38,939 --> 01:16:45,359
deposit works sometimes it doesn't like

1259
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:48,949
what why don't they do and if you zoom

1260
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:54,569
in far enough it does it comes back you

1261
01:16:48,949 --> 01:16:55,920
know so yeah I don't know I really don't

1262
01:16:54,569 --> 01:17:02,340
know what we should be doing right now

1263
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:04,949
so let's let's think about this so we

1264
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:06,510
want to get our characters in there so

1265
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:10,050
we can get like the hopping and stuff

1266
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:11,880
working too and like this cuz right now

1267
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:15,659
we were sort of worth worrying about how

1268
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:20,279
we're gonna tag that and the camera

1269
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:21,720
stuff or we can we get outside yet so we

1270
01:17:20,279 --> 01:17:24,420
should make it so that the outside

1271
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:26,850
generates an outside right I mean that

1272
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:29,850
seems like something reasonable to be

1273
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:35,070
doing so in here like we have like stone

1274
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:36,660
floor and stuff like that and so you

1275
01:17:35,069 --> 01:17:44,159
know maybe we should also make a thing

1276
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:47,970
that's like is there you know look the

1277
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:49,619
on boundary thing it's like you know if

1278
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:53,159
outdoors

1279
01:17:49,619 --> 01:17:55,710
boundary equals false kind of thing so

1280
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:58,739
basically like there's some kind of rim

1281
01:17:55,710 --> 01:18:00,329
spec thing and like the rim spec just

1282
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:02,309
says if it's outdoors and again we're

1283
01:18:00,329 --> 01:18:04,859
this is not real code

1284
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:06,539
this is totally fake i I'm just hacking

1285
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:08,339
these things in there this stuff will

1286
01:18:06,539 --> 01:18:12,149
get developed quite a bit more when we

1287
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:13,949
actually want to push on it hard but I'm

1288
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:16,170
kind of just putting in the things that

1289
01:18:13,949 --> 01:18:17,760
we might you know showing some things

1290
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:20,340
you might want to do so that we can get

1291
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,560
educated about how we want that code to

1292
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:25,980
look so we can look a bit if the spec

1293
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:32,490
outdoors then we don't have walls and if

1294
01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:38,699
it is outdoors then you know we would

1295
01:18:32,489 --> 01:18:41,819
need to not set this stuff right so we

1296
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:44,000
would say tag floor and stone floor or

1297
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:48,269
whatever we would need to set the grass

1298
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:52,010
stuff up so like that

1299
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:56,300
so we mean to do like okay if outdoors

1300
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:56,300
we have a different kind than

1301
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:11,450
you know this is gonna be like tag grass

1302
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:13,670
or something and that way we can say

1303
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:16,189
that some things outdoors and it will

1304
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:20,510
get generated as outdoors of course you

1305
01:19:16,189 --> 01:19:22,039
know it's not really doing much but at

1306
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:24,860
least we can sort of see what that would

1307
01:19:22,039 --> 01:19:26,479
look like and so then in here where when

1308
01:19:24,859 --> 01:19:28,250
we look at like the forest paths and

1309
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:29,449
stuff like that when we create those we

1310
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:31,100
can just say that those were supposed to

1311
01:19:29,449 --> 01:19:33,260
be outdoors and then you know it will

1312
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:36,560
get generated that way so in here we've

1313
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:41,270
got like you know the garden and the

1314
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:46,970
forests back I think are the two and so

1315
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:49,400
I don't remember when we were sort of

1316
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:56,539
mucking with that but I guess just here

1317
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:58,339
so if we look at those two maybe I

1318
01:19:56,539 --> 01:20:01,729
dropped them here like the garden spec

1319
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:05,840
outdoors equals true and the basic

1320
01:20:01,729 --> 01:20:09,109
forests back outdoors equals true and

1321
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:14,659
then those will be like set to be

1322
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:17,299
outdoors areas which just you know it's

1323
01:20:14,659 --> 01:20:20,119
really basic at the moment but so I

1324
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:22,220
think wasn't there like a backyard path

1325
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:24,800
over here or something yeah so like this

1326
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:27,890
is outside this is like the garden area

1327
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:29,720
right I should also probably turn off

1328
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:30,770
those attachment points for the moment

1329
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:39,440
because we don't really need to be

1330
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:42,320
seeing those probably put this on a on a

1331
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:47,500
debug thing as well so we can turn it on

1332
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:47,500
and off oops

1333
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:56,779
sorry about that um so yeah like

1334
01:21:06,088 --> 01:21:11,609
you know those don't have walls around

1335
01:21:08,069 --> 01:21:15,749
them which is fine you should probably

1336
01:21:11,609 --> 01:21:17,399
put like trees in there or something or

1337
01:21:15,748 --> 01:21:20,338
who knows what and then yeah like out

1338
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:26,030
there there's also you know this parts

1339
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:26,029
forest path as well so that's all fine

1340
01:21:27,288 --> 01:21:37,738
that all seems reasonable uh so I want

1341
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:41,459
to see what I maybe want to focus on now

1342
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:44,068
is just like let's let's improve that

1343
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:47,358
camera code a little bit and because I

1344
01:21:44,069 --> 01:21:49,409
don't really want to go work on it

1345
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:51,209
there's just there's enough things to

1346
01:21:49,408 --> 01:21:52,888
work on here that I'm not sure which one

1347
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:56,639
would be the best but the camera is

1348
01:21:52,889 --> 01:21:59,279
constantly annoying me and so being able

1349
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:01,229
to work with that a little bit better

1350
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:04,759
would probably be a big improvement

1351
01:22:01,229 --> 01:22:07,829
because right now like I totally can't

1352
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:09,719
do anything with that and also we've got

1353
01:22:07,828 --> 01:22:12,198
that lighting projection problem so you

1354
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:14,698
can see that like even though I can see

1355
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:17,488
around these other areas it's not

1356
01:22:14,698 --> 01:22:21,598
actually properly picking where the

1357
01:22:17,488 --> 01:22:23,788
lighting should be occurring right so

1358
01:22:21,599 --> 01:22:26,159
and I and there's a lot of reasons for

1359
01:22:23,788 --> 01:22:27,538
that but you know a lot of them have to

1360
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:29,429
do with the fact that I think that code

1361
01:22:27,538 --> 01:22:33,268
was not taking into account the

1362
01:22:29,429 --> 01:22:35,729
perspective and the angle very well and

1363
01:22:33,269 --> 01:22:39,539
so and and I don't know exactly how we

1364
01:22:35,729 --> 01:22:41,819
really want to do that going forwards so

1365
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:45,088
yeah and you know if you look at the

1366
01:22:41,819 --> 01:22:48,059
area that we're simulating right is much

1367
01:22:45,088 --> 01:22:50,969
larger it would be nice if our lighting

1368
01:22:48,059 --> 01:22:52,859
was more about what was visible and you

1369
01:22:50,969 --> 01:22:54,029
know we may be able to kind of move more

1370
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:58,139
towards stuff like that as we improve

1371
01:22:54,029 --> 01:23:01,800
how the lighting actually works but at

1372
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:05,118
the moment anyway we're kind of we're

1373
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:06,838
kind of we only have like rudimentary

1374
01:23:05,118 --> 01:23:10,078
quality on the lighting which is

1375
01:23:06,838 --> 01:23:11,969
unfortunate but anyway and you know like

1376
01:23:10,078 --> 01:23:13,738
you said you can see why I'm reticent to

1377
01:23:11,969 --> 01:23:16,378
give it up though because you get nice

1378
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:17,759
results from it right like even just

1379
01:23:16,378 --> 01:23:19,829
looking down there this is just a much

1380
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:23,430
more interesting looking space with

1381
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:24,630
crappy lighting then over here which is

1382
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:26,730
what it would look like with no lighting

1383
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:28,800
like you don't want to really explore

1384
01:23:26,729 --> 01:23:33,119
that you do kind of want to explore that

1385
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:34,829
and so I really that redoubles my

1386
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:37,409
assumptions that we really want the

1387
01:23:34,829 --> 01:23:39,239
lighting to be good and we probably want

1388
01:23:37,409 --> 01:23:40,920
to spend some time on it continuing to

1389
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:43,559
spend time on it getting it good because

1390
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:47,730
that is what we want almost it's a speed

1391
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:49,200
issue it's really just speed I mean what

1392
01:23:47,729 --> 01:23:54,239
we have right now is actually quite good

1393
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:57,420
lighting in a sense but this lead is

1394
01:23:54,239 --> 01:24:01,079
horrible and so we need to yeah make

1395
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:03,270
that not be horrible so moving on from

1396
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:04,769
here I think yeah maybe just looking at

1397
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:06,300
the camera how much time I have but

1398
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:08,070
let's maybe we can start opening up the

1399
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:11,579
camera I could also do recycling texture

1400
01:24:08,069 --> 01:24:15,269
handles those the two things come to

1401
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:17,809
mind what time do how much time do we

1402
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:17,810
have left

1403
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:28,539
which time do we have left how do I know

1404
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,569
how long has the stream been live one

1405
01:24:28,539 --> 01:24:34,469
hour and 56 minutes so probably two so

1406
01:24:31,569 --> 01:24:37,210
we probably have about 20 minutes to go

1407
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:43,149
25 minutes to go do we start at like 115

1408
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:47,710
maybe so I think we've got like I think

1409
01:24:43,149 --> 01:24:52,299
we've maybe got yeah maybe got 25

1410
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:54,369
minutes to go missing uh so what I want

1411
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:56,079
to do with the camera there's a lot of

1412
01:24:54,369 --> 01:24:57,969
kind of crappy stuff that's happening

1413
01:24:56,079 --> 01:25:02,189
with the camera at the moment and I

1414
01:24:57,969 --> 01:25:05,529
would like the camera to not be crappy

1415
01:25:02,189 --> 01:25:11,159
and so I think we want to do is like

1416
01:25:05,529 --> 01:25:15,449
force the camera to be good and to

1417
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:18,059
actually the right thing in in you know

1418
01:25:15,449 --> 01:25:20,859
in terms of how its represented

1419
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:23,200
coordinate system wise and so on do we

1420
01:25:20,859 --> 01:25:26,880
need any of this stuff we don't need it

1421
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:32,260
this this has been long long forgotten

1422
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:38,920
code so you know the way that this stuff

1423
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:41,079
works right we've got we've got all this

1424
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,029
stuff you know here's update camera for

1425
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:45,100
entity movement right and we say like

1426
01:25:43,029 --> 01:25:49,569
hey here's the the camera that we're

1427
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:51,700
looking at and here's the sim region and

1428
01:25:49,569 --> 01:25:54,210
and we've got like what any of the

1429
01:25:51,699 --> 01:25:57,609
camera supposed to be following you know

1430
01:25:54,210 --> 01:26:04,029
and that's not bad like that that seems

1431
01:25:57,609 --> 01:26:06,189
totally reasonable as a call so that

1432
01:26:04,029 --> 01:26:09,449
seems fine I don't care about the debug

1433
01:26:06,189 --> 01:26:09,449
white P by the way

1434
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,670
yeah I don't I don't know that we care

1435
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:18,079
about that very much but can we still do

1436
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:19,579
this by the way does this mean we can

1437
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:21,619
carry a light around with us maybe I do

1438
01:26:19,579 --> 01:26:43,039
care about it because I would like it to

1439
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:47,420
keep happening so in here we've got the

1440
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:52,010
group the diva light be the radius the

1441
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:56,510
color the emission and the lighting

1442
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:57,909
point state so what it was it

1443
01:26:56,510 --> 01:27:09,440
complaining about that actually looks

1444
01:26:57,909 --> 01:27:12,250
right doesn't it Oh this appears to be

1445
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:12,250
the problem

1446
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:23,029
so can we carry a light around with us

1447
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:25,160
if we do this yes we can that might be

1448
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:26,840
good for the time being since we don't

1449
01:27:25,159 --> 01:27:32,229
really have our lighting solid that's

1450
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:32,230
probably better right yeah

1451
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:43,550
now we're just a hopping light cube

1452
01:27:40,579 --> 01:27:45,859
what's the problem it's fine all right

1453
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:47,329
so let's talk about the camera now that

1454
01:27:45,859 --> 01:27:48,859
we you know now we've got a like a

1455
01:27:47,329 --> 01:27:51,649
marker for our entity and I can carry

1456
01:27:48,859 --> 01:27:53,299
the light around with me so a couple

1457
01:27:51,649 --> 01:27:55,129
things you want to do first of all we

1458
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:56,539
never want to see a lighting edge so

1459
01:27:55,130 --> 01:28:00,770
like that crap up there should never

1460
01:27:56,539 --> 01:28:02,630
happen we want to set the the fog value

1461
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:05,390
like we want to have some notion of

1462
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:07,699
where the fogging should happen and

1463
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:12,560
where alpha fading should happen for for

1464
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:15,679
upper floors and crap like that and did

1465
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,520
that just hop through duh it hopped up

1466
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:21,159
on top

1467
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:21,160
no it upped it hop through

1468
01:28:21,979 --> 01:28:29,179
so I'm allowed to actually hop to a

1469
01:28:24,748 --> 01:28:29,179
traversable that is that far away

1470
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:57,579
why is that so I can't hop through

1471
01:28:55,659 --> 01:28:59,380
double walls but I can't hop through

1472
01:28:57,579 --> 01:29:03,220
single walls I guess that's the search

1473
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:08,859
region for the traversable is just that

1474
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:11,039
far away seems ill-advised to say the

1475
01:29:08,859 --> 01:29:11,039
least

1476
01:29:19,829 --> 01:29:25,170
just out of curiosity why did we do that

1477
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:49,158
I'm just curious I have no idea why we

1478
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:50,599
did it that way left a look so yeah I

1479
01:29:49,158 --> 01:29:53,299
just feel like we shouldn't be able to

1480
01:29:50,599 --> 01:29:54,889
hop through those and I'm not sure why

1481
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:59,320
we can I assume it's because the hop

1482
01:29:54,889 --> 01:30:04,279
distance here is just too much and

1483
01:29:59,319 --> 01:30:05,988
should be much less than it is so

1484
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:09,228
there's one that actually works more

1485
01:30:05,988 --> 01:30:14,089
properly right I don't know how far

1486
01:30:09,229 --> 01:30:15,289
apart the tiles actually are like I

1487
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:21,679
don't know what we actually set our

1488
01:30:15,288 --> 01:30:23,719
scale to in that case but now that's at

1489
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:26,630
least correct and it can't get through

1490
01:30:23,719 --> 01:30:28,309
walls all right sorry about that just

1491
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:29,599
notice that I didn't know really what

1492
01:30:28,309 --> 01:30:33,860
was going on there so I figured we might

1493
01:30:29,599 --> 01:30:36,110
as well take care of that issue all

1494
01:30:33,859 --> 01:30:38,899
right so yeah again back to the camera

1495
01:30:36,109 --> 01:30:41,389
thing so there's a couple things that I

1496
01:30:38,899 --> 01:30:43,788
would like to do here one is that I

1497
01:30:41,389 --> 01:30:45,800
would like the camera to behave in a

1498
01:30:43,788 --> 01:30:48,349
number of ways it's not behaving now so

1499
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:49,820
first of all like the way the debug

1500
01:30:48,349 --> 01:30:51,529
camera works right now you can kind of

1501
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:54,139
see that the debug camera is actually

1502
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:56,420
just a displacement off of whatever the

1503
01:30:54,139 --> 01:30:58,279
simulation region center is which means

1504
01:30:56,420 --> 01:31:01,010
that as I hop from room to room it

1505
01:30:58,279 --> 01:31:02,599
actually shifts the camera I don't

1506
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:04,159
actually want that to be true if I

1507
01:31:02,599 --> 01:31:05,300
switch into debug camera mode I would

1508
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,408
like the camera to just stay exactly

1509
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:08,989
where it is

1510
01:31:06,408 --> 01:31:10,969
right and if I want to move to a new

1511
01:31:08,988 --> 01:31:12,288
location I will tell you but I don't

1512
01:31:10,969 --> 01:31:15,889
really want that to be happening

1513
01:31:12,288 --> 01:31:19,130
asynchronously of my commands just based

1514
01:31:15,889 --> 01:31:22,998
on you know the movement of it in some

1515
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:26,179
separate sense so I want to be able to

1516
01:31:22,998 --> 01:31:29,538
represent a debug location and a regular

1517
01:31:26,179 --> 01:31:32,748
location both and so that should

1518
01:31:29,538 --> 01:31:35,478
probably happen I'd also like to make it

1519
01:31:32,748 --> 01:31:38,029
so that the movement of the camera is

1520
01:31:35,479 --> 01:31:39,979
always guaranteed to be seamless so the

1521
01:31:38,029 --> 01:31:42,319
fact that this right now

1522
01:31:39,979 --> 01:31:44,119
this part here can happen at all is

1523
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:46,009
annoying and I think it's because we

1524
01:31:44,118 --> 01:31:50,498
don't map the camera into world

1525
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:53,960
positions and back but we should right

1526
01:31:50,498 --> 01:31:55,788
so like that's just bad

1527
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:58,130
and we don't really want that to happen

1528
01:31:55,788 --> 01:32:01,099
finally we want there to be a way that

1529
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:03,590
says look find out where you have to be

1530
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:06,739
to view this room like right now we've

1531
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:08,929
got some kind of crappy like thing in

1532
01:32:06,738 --> 01:32:10,488
there that that I don't know is like

1533
01:32:08,929 --> 01:32:12,309
using some kind of heuristic to figure

1534
01:32:10,488 --> 01:32:14,839
out how far back the camera should be

1535
01:32:12,309 --> 01:32:16,579
and I don't want that to happen I want

1536
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:21,110
to basically say look this is the region

1537
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:23,420
that you should be able to view you get

1538
01:32:21,109 --> 01:32:24,828
some exposure control in there this is

1539
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:28,819
the region that you should be able to

1540
01:32:24,828 --> 01:32:31,069
view so I want to be able to to always

1541
01:32:28,819 --> 01:32:33,380
guarantee that the entire room that I

1542
01:32:31,069 --> 01:32:36,590
asked for will be in there in there and

1543
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:39,828
I guess the thing that we didn't I think

1544
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:41,119
we actually we basically said look some

1545
01:32:39,828 --> 01:32:44,210
rooms are gonna be big and they're gonna

1546
01:32:41,118 --> 01:32:45,649
scroll so I think that's why we did it

1547
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:47,569
this way but what that means is the

1548
01:32:45,649 --> 01:32:49,908
camera should also if we're in a room

1549
01:32:47,569 --> 01:32:52,908
that we have to scroll to view that

1550
01:32:49,908 --> 01:32:54,799
should be handled right so this the

1551
01:32:52,908 --> 01:32:56,988
camera should should gradually scroll up

1552
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,909
if you're in this region to show you the

1553
01:32:56,988 --> 01:33:00,859
part that you were in and it should

1554
01:32:58,908 --> 01:33:02,988
gradually scroll down in this case to

1555
01:33:00,859 --> 01:33:04,939
show you the part that you're in now and

1556
01:33:02,988 --> 01:33:07,609
left-to-right or whatever so larger

1557
01:33:04,939 --> 01:33:09,738
rooms should scroll and we don't have

1558
01:33:07,609 --> 01:33:11,389
any of that in there now so there's a

1559
01:33:09,738 --> 01:33:12,948
ton of things that we can improve about

1560
01:33:11,389 --> 01:33:14,900
the camera and that's what we should

1561
01:33:12,948 --> 01:33:16,879
probably start on the main thing I'll

1562
01:33:14,899 --> 01:33:20,529
start on now is just none no more

1563
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:23,059
Kitching so like none no more of that

1564
01:33:20,529 --> 01:33:26,679
hitching nonsense by the way what

1565
01:33:23,059 --> 01:33:26,679
happens if I just make the world dark

1566
01:33:36,739 --> 01:33:39,979
just curious

1567
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,670
that's pretty cool

1568
01:34:00,939 --> 01:34:04,019
[Music]

1569
01:34:08,738 --> 01:34:14,718
all right so let's fix this camera let's

1570
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:18,229
find out what the heck is going on with

1571
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:22,219
our camera and and let's try to do

1572
01:34:18,229 --> 01:34:25,039
something that's not so horrible so

1573
01:34:22,219 --> 01:34:28,429
first things first how restore on the

1574
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:32,198
camera and why and what kind of crap did

1575
01:34:28,429 --> 01:34:35,090
we pull in here that's making it lousy

1576
01:34:32,198 --> 01:34:37,158
so we've got this notion of the game

1577
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:38,449
camera and it's set up in here it's

1578
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:41,179
saying here's the entity that I'm

1579
01:34:38,448 --> 01:34:43,189
looking for here's where I am it's got

1580
01:34:41,179 --> 01:34:45,710
the simulation center the offsets the

1581
01:34:43,189 --> 01:34:48,919
target P all this stuff right in special

1582
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:53,328
so the first thing I want to know is why

1583
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:57,408
like what's all this garbage why why are

1584
01:34:53,328 --> 01:35:00,828
these things why do we even have an

1585
01:34:57,408 --> 01:35:04,549
offset Z right like why is that even

1586
01:35:00,828 --> 01:35:06,889
there why aren't we just interpolating

1587
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:08,960
our world positions and look why are we

1588
01:35:06,889 --> 01:35:14,118
storing the simulation center why is any

1589
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:16,939
of that stuff happening right and I

1590
01:35:14,118 --> 01:35:19,069
assume that the that the problem that

1591
01:35:16,939 --> 01:35:22,819
we're having the basic problem that

1592
01:35:19,069 --> 01:35:24,899
we're having is we don't really know

1593
01:35:22,819 --> 01:35:27,130
where the simulation center should be

1594
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:32,779
[Music]

1595
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:35,690
without knowing like without knowing

1596
01:35:32,779 --> 01:35:37,039
what the entity is in a sense right and

1597
01:35:35,689 --> 01:35:42,559
without knowing what room were supposed

1598
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:44,359
to be highlighting right so I guess the

1599
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,550
reason we have to store that simulation

1600
01:35:44,359 --> 01:35:48,618
center is because that has to move

1601
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:50,420
around right like we have to be able to

1602
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:51,769
go like okay here's where the simulation

1603
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:55,639
center is going to be and here's where

1604
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:58,880
the P is and whatever and so we kind of

1605
01:35:55,639 --> 01:36:00,739
want to go into this with a little bit

1606
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:04,029
of trepidation but you know generally

1607
01:36:00,738 --> 01:36:10,638
speaking you can see it's not set up to

1608
01:36:04,029 --> 01:36:13,759
stupidly it seems okay right it doesn't

1609
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:15,618
seem totally busted and because this P

1610
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:18,849
and the simulation center because these

1611
01:36:15,618 --> 01:36:18,848
things are themselves

1612
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:28,320
absolute world positions I'm not sure

1613
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:34,049
why we're getting that jerkiness so I'd

1614
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:38,789
like to know if I can I would like to

1615
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:42,360
know more about why were we're being

1616
01:36:38,789 --> 01:36:45,810
pulled around that way one of the

1617
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:50,369
reasons we may be in some nastiness is

1618
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:55,170
just because we at the moment don't have

1619
01:36:50,369 --> 01:36:57,840
any we don't have a real interpolator

1620
01:36:55,170 --> 01:37:00,960
like our interpolators kind of crap you

1621
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:05,010
can see this to do right here is is

1622
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:09,390
telling you exactly that but I'm not

1623
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:11,039
sure why we're getting such like we're

1624
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,300
still getting pretty unusual results

1625
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:14,760
there's like a discontinuity that

1626
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:17,279
probably shouldn't be there even with

1627
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:22,079
the fact that our camera movements not

1628
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:23,489
good so if we go in here and say all

1629
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:28,350
right let's find out what the camera and

1630
01:37:23,489 --> 01:37:38,279
any movement is let's find out how how

1631
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:40,289
and why we're screwing things up so it

1632
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:41,819
is mandatory that the camera Center be

1633
01:37:40,289 --> 01:37:43,439
the Scimitar center for this good or

1634
01:37:41,819 --> 01:37:46,170
preferably because it cannot add the

1635
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:47,669
offset from the sim center to the camera

1636
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:49,560
as this placement or will fail when

1637
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:51,980
moving with room rooms at the changeover

1638
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,980
point

1639
01:37:56,869 --> 01:37:59,869
okay

1640
01:38:18,289 --> 01:38:26,899
why would that be given the fact that

1641
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:29,930
we're the ones doing the changeover like

1642
01:38:26,899 --> 01:38:39,250
we're the people who set the simulation

1643
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:39,250
center differently right like we do that

1644
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:52,190
so you know maybe this is a case of us

1645
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:56,690
just kind of being dumb because the

1646
01:38:52,189 --> 01:38:59,299
simulation region itself should always

1647
01:38:56,689 --> 01:39:01,069
be the simulation center and if we're

1648
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:03,110
going to reset the simulation center

1649
01:39:01,069 --> 01:39:07,059
that should only happen after we've done

1650
01:39:03,109 --> 01:39:13,779
all of the camera computations anyway

1651
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:13,780
when we go to call this

1652
01:39:25,889 --> 01:39:30,500
we don't do anything else after that

1653
01:39:37,619 --> 01:39:43,000
so I don't know that yeah I mean you

1654
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:46,650
know that happens that's the last thing

1655
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,649
you do and mandatorily so

1656
01:40:12,828 --> 01:40:19,130
so I'm not really sure I also don't know

1657
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:21,050
why this wouldn't just have the camera

1658
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:27,109
being entity in the world who had it

1659
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:29,029
updates itself that's something that

1660
01:40:27,109 --> 01:40:33,019
happens is the last thing it wants to do

1661
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:35,448
but all right so there's a lot of stuff

1662
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:38,599
that I'm not sure is on the up-and-up

1663
01:40:35,448 --> 01:40:43,158
here we're gonna start by assuming that

1664
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:45,289
it's okay to do this at the end and what

1665
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:47,328
I'm gonna say there is look we know

1666
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:49,158
where the simulation center is and the

1667
01:40:47,328 --> 01:40:51,828
simulation center always came from the

1668
01:40:49,158 --> 01:40:56,529
camera to begin with right like when we

1669
01:40:51,828 --> 01:40:59,808
go here to set the simulation center

1670
01:40:56,529 --> 01:41:04,630
inside like begin sim or whatever right

1671
01:40:59,809 --> 01:41:07,489
so inside that we specifically say that

1672
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:12,260
you know this is where we want the to

1673
01:41:07,488 --> 01:41:16,399
start things off right and so we know

1674
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:21,039
that right up until here you're always

1675
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:24,379
using that Center anyway so I'm not sure

1676
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:25,099
I'm not even sure why it thinks this is

1677
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:28,190
true

1678
01:41:25,099 --> 01:41:32,210
because who cares what that simulation

1679
01:41:28,189 --> 01:41:36,109
center was as long as you just always

1680
01:41:32,210 --> 01:41:39,020
call map into chunk space for whatever

1681
01:41:36,109 --> 01:41:41,058
the current region is who cares what you

1682
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:42,110
set this to and when like as long as you

1683
01:41:41,059 --> 01:41:45,770
set it at the end of the routine you

1684
01:41:42,109 --> 01:41:48,009
don't use it for anything why would we

1685
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:48,010
care

1686
01:42:04,729 --> 01:42:10,909
and like even this this looks just wrong

1687
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:17,060
like why would we yeah so I'm just gonna

1688
01:42:10,909 --> 01:42:19,939
say I don't believe this and you know I

1689
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:22,240
don't know that that that's what should

1690
01:42:19,939 --> 01:42:27,409
have been happening in the first place

1691
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:29,420
so looking at this stuff this pre pass

1692
01:42:27,409 --> 01:42:31,849
we can do more work on later this this

1693
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:33,409
isn't really the problem here this is

1694
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:36,770
just for identifying special camera

1695
01:42:33,409 --> 01:42:39,079
locations or things like that that that

1696
01:42:36,770 --> 01:42:40,700
you know whatever we can talk about that

1697
01:42:39,079 --> 01:42:43,250
some other time because that's not the

1698
01:42:40,699 --> 01:42:46,699
problem here we're assuming that we're

1699
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:49,670
just not doing any special camera so if

1700
01:42:46,699 --> 01:42:51,289
we're in a room you can see us saying

1701
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:53,119
look the simulation center should be the

1702
01:42:51,289 --> 01:42:55,310
center of the room because that's how we

1703
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:56,899
kind of wanted to find this game meaning

1704
01:42:55,310 --> 01:43:00,080
we're simulating stuff around room

1705
01:42:56,899 --> 01:43:02,359
boundaries so that's fine

1706
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:04,100
and if we look at stuff like the target

1707
01:43:02,359 --> 01:43:16,159
P and the target offset and all that

1708
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:18,350
crap I mean that seems fine for now we

1709
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:21,229
know this code doesn't matter for the

1710
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:22,400
moment and so when we let me go here and

1711
01:43:21,229 --> 01:43:25,579
we say all right the candy series is

1712
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:27,559
mapping chunk space this thing the

1713
01:43:25,579 --> 01:43:30,109
target P is map into chunks base this

1714
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:32,840
thing and the target of a offsets gonna

1715
01:43:30,109 --> 01:43:37,009
be this then you know the thing that

1716
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:40,010
strikes me is as busted is this is now

1717
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:43,909
dependent on this change and so it's

1718
01:43:40,010 --> 01:43:47,780
gonna be wrong for one frame but why

1719
01:43:43,909 --> 01:43:53,109
didn't we just do it over here you know

1720
01:43:47,779 --> 01:43:58,489
what I mean so so this just seems dumb

1721
01:43:53,109 --> 01:44:00,920
right it just doesn't it doesn't add up

1722
01:43:58,489 --> 01:44:05,029
like it seems like I don't know if if we

1723
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:07,760
were just like if we just got confused

1724
01:44:05,029 --> 01:44:12,590
when we wrote it originally or if we

1725
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:14,720
like maybe we weren't really thinking

1726
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:16,590
about it right or maybe it was because

1727
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:18,329
we were like coming at it from the wrong

1728
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:20,460
we like have it working one way and you

1729
01:44:18,329 --> 01:44:24,238
know as we changed it we came the other

1730
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:26,158
way but you know this is this should

1731
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:30,559
just be a based around the simulation

1732
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:33,149
center I mean that's what it should be

1733
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,949
because the camera is just another thing

1734
01:44:33,149 --> 01:44:38,029
that should get mapped into that space

1735
01:44:34,948 --> 01:44:41,158
and we shouldn't have to do this at all

1736
01:44:38,029 --> 01:44:45,539
in other words this should be the region

1737
01:44:41,158 --> 01:44:51,089
origin if anything else right it should

1738
01:44:45,539 --> 01:44:53,219
it should be this right it should not

1739
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:55,529
matter what the camera simulation center

1740
01:44:53,219 --> 01:44:57,179
thinks it is these things are things

1741
01:44:55,529 --> 01:44:59,488
that are happening relative to the sim

1742
01:44:57,179 --> 01:45:03,569
space anyway so just do them in that

1743
01:44:59,488 --> 01:45:07,259
space right and then when you map them

1744
01:45:03,569 --> 01:45:09,238
in you know off you go and that way we

1745
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:10,980
could also map this more at the outset

1746
01:45:09,238 --> 01:45:13,589
and things would probably be better

1747
01:45:10,979 --> 01:45:18,000
there too but that's sort of a separate

1748
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:19,980
issue right so I'm not sure why we

1749
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,868
wanted to use the simulation center at

1750
01:45:19,979 --> 01:45:23,459
something I can't say exactly whether

1751
01:45:21,868 --> 01:45:24,809
would have caused any bugs per se but

1752
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:27,239
just doesn't seem a good idea because

1753
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:29,489
everything in this game should be based

1754
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:31,919
around the simulation region always and

1755
01:45:29,488 --> 01:45:33,928
the fact that the camera stores what the

1756
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:35,699
next frame simulation center would be

1757
01:45:33,929 --> 01:45:37,289
should not change the fact that

1758
01:45:35,698 --> 01:45:38,279
everything should always be happening in

1759
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:39,988
subspace because otherwise you've got

1760
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:42,179
two different spaces potentially and

1761
01:45:39,988 --> 01:45:46,919
that just further adds to the confusion

1762
01:45:42,179 --> 01:45:49,170
right and and there's no point to it

1763
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:58,920
so I would say like we would rather do

1764
01:45:49,170 --> 01:46:00,510
this for sure now again I'm just gonna

1765
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:01,889
double check that that runs okay because

1766
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:03,570
I think it should I still don't know

1767
01:46:01,889 --> 01:46:05,039
where our bug was coming from though

1768
01:46:03,569 --> 01:46:08,009
like we were having sort of a strange

1769
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:10,139
like hiccup bug there and I I don't know

1770
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:15,690
where that's coming from so like you

1771
01:46:10,139 --> 01:46:17,789
could do you see it you see that weird

1772
01:46:15,689 --> 01:46:22,079
like the height maybe is what changes

1773
01:46:17,789 --> 01:46:24,539
discontinuity discontinuously and so

1774
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:28,880
it's like the offset Z's are are

1775
01:46:24,539 --> 01:46:33,739
happening weirdly and I

1776
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:40,159
I guess that but that makes sense too in

1777
01:46:33,739 --> 01:46:43,939
a way because the cameras offset Z has

1778
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:47,720
to be based we have to be interpolating

1779
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:50,599
the position so the offset Z is not what

1780
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:53,390
you want this camera offset Z should

1781
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:56,329
never really be there and the camera

1782
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:58,100
target P P and target P those should

1783
01:46:56,329 --> 01:47:00,769
actually just have the Z in them

1784
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:03,200
directly right I mean that's probably

1785
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:08,330
how we should have been doing it but you

1786
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:17,420
know I guess we weren't so oops but

1787
01:47:08,329 --> 01:47:19,489
looking at how that's going you know

1788
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:21,980
what you like I said why is this even a

1789
01:47:19,489 --> 01:47:23,750
thing you know why aren't we just saying

1790
01:47:21,979 --> 01:47:25,909
well the target P should include

1791
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:32,060
whatever the offset Z is and you should

1792
01:47:25,909 --> 01:47:34,869
just interpolate to it right I mean why

1793
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:34,870
isn't it just this

1794
01:47:51,909 --> 01:47:57,439
because this is a position it's saying

1795
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:58,369
look I want to go from here to here and

1796
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:00,619
that's what I'm doing

1797
01:47:58,369 --> 01:48:02,689
when we compute where we would like it

1798
01:48:00,619 --> 01:48:05,300
to go sure talking in terms of an offset

1799
01:48:02,689 --> 01:48:07,609
Z maybe something we want to do because

1800
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:10,279
it just helps us construct the final

1801
01:48:07,609 --> 01:48:11,809
target but why would we have that be

1802
01:48:10,279 --> 01:48:13,789
something that's maintained separately

1803
01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:18,320
for no apparent reason and I don't know

1804
01:48:13,789 --> 01:48:20,600
why right like the Delta should just

1805
01:48:18,319 --> 01:48:22,009
work you know in this case and we

1806
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:24,650
shouldn't have to worry about all these

1807
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:27,949
weird like offset Z nonsenses because

1808
01:48:24,649 --> 01:48:32,689
who cares right so this should not be a

1809
01:48:27,948 --> 01:48:33,769
thing and yeah I mean I don't know what

1810
01:48:32,689 --> 01:48:36,009
to say other than it shouldn't be a

1811
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:36,010
thing

1812
01:48:49,939 --> 01:48:54,829
yes so in terms of get camera rectangle

1813
01:48:52,788 --> 01:48:58,488
at target in this case what we'd like to

1814
01:48:54,828 --> 01:49:04,130
do is say in terms of the Z here we want

1815
01:48:58,488 --> 01:49:07,578
to just know we want to know for the

1816
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:08,748
point that we're actually stimulating

1817
01:49:07,578 --> 01:49:13,929
around right

1818
01:49:08,748 --> 01:49:16,488
so forget camera rectangle at Target

1819
01:49:13,929 --> 01:49:18,439
even this this world camera rect just

1820
01:49:16,488 --> 01:49:21,348
isn't very smart because again that's

1821
01:49:18,439 --> 01:49:23,630
it's not a rectangle it's a frustum now

1822
01:49:21,349 --> 01:49:28,569
you know what I mean

1823
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:28,569
and so this is kind of just not right

1824
01:49:33,368 --> 01:49:39,380
yeah so a lot of that stuff is kind of

1825
01:49:35,988 --> 01:49:44,178
stupid and I'm not sure really how else

1826
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:45,889
to describe it other than that let's

1827
01:49:44,179 --> 01:49:48,828
look at how these things are actually

1828
01:49:45,889 --> 01:49:50,958
written in here and you know I'm gonna

1829
01:49:48,828 --> 01:49:52,248
I'm gonna hack this in in a second I'm

1830
01:49:50,958 --> 01:49:53,779
gonna well are right now I'm just gonna

1831
01:49:52,248 --> 01:49:55,760
say like alright suppose it's eight

1832
01:49:53,779 --> 01:49:58,908
units away who cares I don't care right

1833
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:01,219
now but let's let's look through that

1834
01:49:58,908 --> 01:50:05,198
code a little bit more cleanly and see

1835
01:50:01,219 --> 01:50:05,198
what happened what's the problem here

1836
01:50:05,979 --> 01:50:14,269
just our particle systems were unhappy

1837
01:50:08,359 --> 01:50:16,609
about that so now what I want to see is

1838
01:50:14,269 --> 01:50:19,189
like look when we're when we're

1839
01:50:16,609 --> 01:50:21,679
interpolating now I expect this to be

1840
01:50:19,189 --> 01:50:23,630
always correct so I want to know why

1841
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:28,069
we're getting an offset there because if

1842
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:30,439
we're just interpolating only two you

1843
01:50:28,069 --> 01:50:32,688
know just those two positions so we're

1844
01:50:30,439 --> 01:50:37,630
just interpreting a p2 another you know

1845
01:50:32,689 --> 01:50:41,300
p2p I want to find out where our

1846
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:43,400
discontinuity is coming from why the

1847
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:45,679
frame boundary is causing it because I

1848
01:50:43,399 --> 01:50:49,188
should be able now if I'm always using

1849
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:51,590
the simulation origin I should now

1850
01:50:49,189 --> 01:50:53,840
always be able to unpack the cameras

1851
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:58,729
location relative to that simulation

1852
01:50:53,840 --> 01:51:03,019
boundary and that should give me what I

1853
01:50:58,729 --> 01:51:03,770
want right in other words this is always

1854
01:51:03,019 --> 01:51:05,810
in in

1855
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:07,820
absolute space now so it shouldn't be

1856
01:51:05,810 --> 01:51:09,530
able to be wrong even across a frame

1857
01:51:07,819 --> 01:51:12,969
boundary and so we need to go find out

1858
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:15,590
why it is like what's going on there

1859
01:51:12,970 --> 01:51:20,180
that would be incorrect does that make

1860
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:23,630
sense so let's go see how we're

1861
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:30,280
unpacking that so in update in render

1862
01:51:23,630 --> 01:51:30,279
worlds when do I actually create

1863
01:51:40,849 --> 01:51:47,469
so there's my Z rotations so yeah so

1864
01:51:47,529 --> 01:51:52,819
this actually is fine right because it's

1865
01:51:50,868 --> 01:51:55,488
gonna be this is where things are going

1866
01:51:52,819 --> 01:51:58,599
to be unpacked relative to as well so

1867
01:51:55,488 --> 01:51:58,598
this should still work

1868
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:15,390
and so I think like yeah like the reason

1869
01:52:13,710 --> 01:52:17,850
that we had been doing it the other way

1870
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:19,770
is I think we were maybe thinking

1871
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:22,230
something else was causing frame hiccups

1872
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:25,530
but it wasn't that but that is actually

1873
01:52:22,229 --> 01:52:27,239
what the problem is you know and so I

1874
01:52:25,529 --> 01:52:28,590
feel like we need to find out what the

1875
01:52:27,239 --> 01:52:30,300
real cause was and I think we were just

1876
01:52:28,590 --> 01:52:32,310
papering over it by assuming that for

1877
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:36,000
some reason you couldn't do it in

1878
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:41,039
absolute space but you totally can like

1879
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:42,989
that should just work right because the

1880
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:49,019
relative subtractions should still

1881
01:52:42,989 --> 01:52:50,479
produce the same results that's my story

1882
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:53,190
and I'm sticking to it

1883
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:54,839
right because this simulation center is

1884
01:52:53,189 --> 01:52:59,399
now is that's going to be zero zero zero

1885
01:52:54,840 --> 01:53:02,940
and so when we packed the camera into

1886
01:52:59,399 --> 01:53:05,849
this origin it's just about where we

1887
01:53:02,939 --> 01:53:07,799
unpacked it before and when we unpacked

1888
01:53:05,850 --> 01:53:10,740
it we need to make sure we always unpack

1889
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:13,520
like the camera what is it called the

1890
01:53:10,739 --> 01:53:13,519
simulation center

1891
01:53:20,429 --> 01:53:25,949
yeah as long as we always map everything

1892
01:53:23,219 --> 01:53:27,960
relative to the origin of the simulation

1893
01:53:25,948 --> 01:53:30,599
region that should always be correct and

1894
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:36,050
then as long as we set the simulation

1895
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:36,050
center correctly what is Delta from sim

1896
01:53:39,469 --> 01:53:43,698
yeah that's that's fine

1897
01:53:51,829 --> 01:54:01,649
so when we begin the simulation mmm

1898
01:53:57,619 --> 01:54:03,510
when do we set this yes so we set the

1899
01:54:01,649 --> 01:54:06,179
simulation centre here so everything

1900
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:10,730
will be unpacked relative to that which

1901
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:10,730
is what we want right that's good

1902
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:35,419
so I'm not sure where else we could have

1903
01:54:33,469 --> 01:54:41,139
introduced a bad thing there we look at

1904
01:54:35,418 --> 01:54:41,139
the focal length look at the cameras Z

1905
01:54:41,319 --> 01:54:57,889
it's just whatever we got out of that

1906
01:54:44,569 --> 01:55:09,399
column right get the OT what the heck is

1907
01:54:57,889 --> 01:55:09,399
camera offset okay so that'll be zero

1908
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:40,470
so that could just be removed that's

1909
01:55:34,979 --> 01:55:41,339
better world mode camera dolly should be

1910
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:44,039
set to zero

1911
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:54,090
always unless we're doing debugging so

1912
01:55:44,039 --> 01:56:00,060
this should also just be zero and in

1913
01:55:54,090 --> 01:56:04,730
fact always is so not really sure why we

1914
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:04,730
had that either

1915
01:56:11,289 --> 01:56:20,079
so this is complete nonsense and

1916
01:56:17,819 --> 01:56:22,259
probably explains why we were getting

1917
01:56:20,079 --> 01:56:25,269
the bugs before so if you look at this

1918
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:30,489
we were saying here's the rotation of

1919
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:33,190
the camera right but that means that

1920
01:56:30,489 --> 01:56:37,389
we're actually taking where we said the

1921
01:56:33,189 --> 01:56:41,049
camera was and rotating it to line up

1922
01:56:37,390 --> 01:56:43,510
with the with the pitch right but we

1923
01:56:41,050 --> 01:56:45,550
still don't want to do that right what

1924
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:48,520
we want to do is make sure that we use

1925
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:51,130
that pitch to figure out where we wanted

1926
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:53,470
the camera to be and then that just

1927
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:56,199
should get rolled into the Delta right

1928
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:58,119
because otherwise we've got otherwise

1929
01:56:56,199 --> 01:57:01,210
we've got interpolation yeah like this

1930
01:56:58,119 --> 01:57:02,710
this was this is just um so let me say a

1931
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:04,029
little bit about this first because like

1932
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:05,699
when we were hacking this together we

1933
01:57:04,029 --> 01:57:07,689
probably didn't go over it very well

1934
01:57:05,699 --> 01:57:09,279
when you're doing animation

1935
01:57:07,689 --> 01:57:11,039
interpolation generally speaking you

1936
01:57:09,279 --> 01:57:13,389
want to make sure that you actually

1937
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:14,319
interpolate things in the way that they

1938
01:57:13,390 --> 01:57:17,140
really exist

1939
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:18,729
so parametric constructions that are the

1940
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:21,760
kind we add here where we're like oh

1941
01:57:18,729 --> 01:57:23,829
let's let's take a location and then

1942
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,050
back up from it and Bend that around and

1943
01:57:23,829 --> 01:57:27,430
then here's where the thing is

1944
01:57:25,050 --> 01:57:29,409
interpolating in that parameter space is

1945
01:57:27,430 --> 01:57:33,159
almost never a good idea and the reason

1946
01:57:29,409 --> 01:57:34,930
it isn't is because the viewer usually

1947
01:57:33,159 --> 01:57:37,630
expects things to be smooth in the

1948
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:39,190
absolute parameter space like outside of

1949
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:41,500
it because they're thinking of this as

1950
01:57:39,189 --> 01:57:43,659
like a camera moving through space they

1951
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:45,399
don't want it to be smooth in the

1952
01:57:43,659 --> 01:57:47,590
parameter system of the cameras that

1953
01:57:45,399 --> 01:57:50,859
doesn't make any sense so then you end

1954
01:57:47,590 --> 01:57:53,079
up constantly fighting that so this is

1955
01:57:50,859 --> 01:57:56,019
bad and should not have happened and so

1956
01:57:53,079 --> 01:57:58,329
we want this stuff to actually be

1957
01:57:56,020 --> 01:58:01,410
something that's set up more in the

1958
01:57:58,329 --> 01:58:09,579
intro in the camera side of things you

1959
01:58:01,409 --> 01:58:11,349
know not here so the debug camera will

1960
01:58:09,579 --> 01:58:17,590
address in a second because that's again

1961
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:19,120
a sort of a separate issue but let me

1962
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:21,369
just take a look at what's going on here

1963
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:22,989
now so now I don't think we'll get any

1964
01:58:21,369 --> 01:58:24,039
hiccups at all right and you can see

1965
01:58:22,989 --> 01:58:24,908
that we're not because now we're

1966
01:58:24,039 --> 01:58:26,408
interpolating for

1967
01:58:24,908 --> 01:58:28,478
to frame and look at how nice and clean

1968
01:58:26,408 --> 01:58:29,679
that is so that's how we should have

1969
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:32,918
been doing it before but I don't know I

1970
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:36,340
just had like you know a lard head that

1971
01:58:32,918 --> 01:58:39,130
day or whatever and so it was screwed up

1972
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:42,038
so what we want to do now is in that

1973
01:58:39,130 --> 01:58:44,349
camera code we want to go add that lean

1974
01:58:42,038 --> 01:58:47,429
in there am i say lean i mean david lean

1975
01:58:44,349 --> 01:58:51,788
the director who made Lawrence of Arabia

1976
01:58:47,429 --> 01:58:54,489
we want to go in there and have that

1977
01:58:51,788 --> 01:58:56,828
lean be part of the camera offset so

1978
01:58:54,488 --> 01:58:58,418
that it it correctly figures out where

1979
01:58:56,828 --> 01:59:00,248
the actual camera would be in world

1980
01:58:58,418 --> 01:59:05,019
space based on how we want the camera

1981
01:59:00,248 --> 01:59:06,938
tilted right um and so that's you know

1982
01:59:05,019 --> 01:59:12,010
that's what we actually want to do here

1983
01:59:06,939 --> 01:59:13,719
so you know off we go so in here we get

1984
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:15,729
the camera Z out what we want to do is

1985
01:59:13,719 --> 01:59:18,760
send that camera Z when we're actually

1986
01:59:15,729 --> 01:59:22,179
doing the look where's the camera right

1987
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:25,360
we want to pass that in so that when we

1988
01:59:22,179 --> 01:59:30,819
do update the the camera in here it

1989
01:59:25,359 --> 01:59:33,069
knows like you know what that vector

1990
01:59:30,819 --> 01:59:35,228
would have been so then when we do the

1991
01:59:33,069 --> 01:59:37,238
displacement we just say oh if that's

1992
01:59:35,229 --> 01:59:39,099
what you like to look down if that's how

1993
01:59:37,238 --> 01:59:43,888
you're looking down then what we'll do

1994
01:59:39,099 --> 01:59:46,029
is we'll set the location to be you know

1995
01:59:43,889 --> 01:59:47,739
when we're creating one of these things

1996
01:59:46,029 --> 01:59:49,538
here where we asked for where the target

1997
01:59:47,738 --> 01:59:51,998
is going to be you know we'll say well

1998
01:59:49,538 --> 01:59:57,399
the target P is whatever it should have

1999
01:59:51,998 --> 01:59:59,978
been offset you know for lies we'll just

2000
01:59:57,399 --> 02:00:01,658
multiply by that vector so that now

2001
01:59:59,979 --> 02:00:03,880
we're actually going to move you back

2002
02:00:01,658 --> 02:00:05,918
along the Tilted vector so that you

2003
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:08,078
still look down on it but I mean all of

2004
02:00:05,918 --> 02:00:10,868
that gets rolled into the desired target

2005
02:00:08,078 --> 02:00:12,759
location not so we're not feeding

2006
02:00:10,868 --> 02:00:14,978
forward a bunch of hard to interpolate

2007
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:17,530
values so now we can still look at the

2008
02:00:14,979 --> 02:00:19,630
center but we notice how clean the

2009
02:00:17,529 --> 02:00:21,609
interpolation is no bugs and there's

2010
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:23,889
none of this garbage to do up at the top

2011
02:00:21,609 --> 02:00:26,168
or garbage note from me saying that

2012
02:00:23,889 --> 02:00:27,969
there is some nonsense about having to

2013
02:00:26,168 --> 02:00:30,248
have them line up frame by frame right

2014
02:00:27,969 --> 02:00:31,809
so now the interpolation is exactly

2015
02:00:30,248 --> 02:00:34,478
perfect and we never have any of that

2016
02:00:31,809 --> 02:00:37,538
our interpolator still sucks don't get

2017
02:00:34,479 --> 02:00:38,590
me wrong it's a weird exponential frame

2018
02:00:37,538 --> 02:00:41,319
based in term

2019
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:43,480
litter which is terrible so we want to

2020
02:00:41,319 --> 02:00:45,309
fix that but at least now there's no

2021
02:00:43,479 --> 02:00:48,158
jarring things that's just it's buttery

2022
02:00:45,310 --> 02:00:51,460
smooth and we got it buttery sirs by

2023
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:53,289
removing code right because I had extra

2024
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:54,969
code in there that was stupid and adding

2025
02:00:53,289 --> 02:00:56,710
stupid code doesn't make it better it

2026
02:00:54,969 --> 02:00:58,448
makes it worse just ask the C++ standard

2027
02:00:56,710 --> 02:01:01,539
committee they've been doing it for 30

2028
02:00:58,448 --> 02:01:05,049
years so what we want to do now is we

2029
02:01:01,539 --> 02:01:06,760
want to go fix the projection part of

2030
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:08,440
this because like I said we now need to

2031
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:10,420
have a good way of figuring out where

2032
02:01:08,439 --> 02:01:11,888
that lighting region is I won't do that

2033
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:14,340
now cuz that's a good thing to start on

2034
02:01:11,889 --> 02:01:17,219
next week I mean next time next dream

2035
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:20,529
but that's what we wanted to fix there

2036
02:01:17,219 --> 02:01:21,939
so that's that's so much better and I

2037
02:01:20,529 --> 02:01:25,689
apologize for not just typing that in

2038
02:01:21,939 --> 02:01:28,658
the first place but off we go so I'll go

2039
02:01:25,689 --> 02:01:30,819
to a brief Q&amp;A now and take any

2040
02:01:28,658 --> 02:01:33,029
questions and then we'll wrap it up for

2041
02:01:30,819 --> 02:01:33,029
today

2042
02:01:40,069 --> 02:01:44,219
JMC 5:16 have you ever found yourself

2043
02:01:42,659 --> 02:01:45,779
angry with something in the game maybe

2044
02:01:44,220 --> 02:01:46,560
the progress of a certain part if so how

2045
02:01:45,779 --> 02:01:48,779
do you get past it

2046
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:50,580
I usually don't look at it that way I'm

2047
02:01:48,779 --> 02:01:52,649
always angry with the state of my code

2048
02:01:50,579 --> 02:01:57,659
and that is just what makes me keep

2049
02:01:52,649 --> 02:01:59,039
trying to make things better I guess if

2050
02:01:57,659 --> 02:02:00,779
you always think all the code is

2051
02:01:59,039 --> 02:02:02,069
terrible then that does help in a sense

2052
02:02:00,779 --> 02:02:05,250
because it means that you don't

2053
02:02:02,069 --> 02:02:07,019
necessarily have any more motivation to

2054
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:08,489
do one part than any other book part so

2055
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:09,960
you're free to make other decisions

2056
02:02:08,489 --> 02:02:11,760
because you're always like well

2057
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:13,980
everything in this game could use work

2058
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:15,000
so if this seems like the most high

2059
02:02:13,979 --> 02:02:17,250
priority thing I'll just go do it

2060
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:26,819
because it's as valid to work on as

2061
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:29,100
anything else are you playing to switch

2062
02:02:26,819 --> 02:02:36,000
up the interpolation with a smooth damp

2063
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:39,480
function i I would say that I don't

2064
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:44,970
super care for the jargon smooth steps

2065
02:02:39,479 --> 02:02:47,819
smooth damp things like this I I don't

2066
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:50,039
know why we have those names I worked in

2067
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:52,769
animation for you know code for five

2068
02:02:50,039 --> 02:02:54,659
years six years something like that and

2069
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:59,190
I just prefer to be more specific about

2070
02:02:54,659 --> 02:03:03,389
it right so what I will be switching the

2071
02:02:59,189 --> 02:03:05,750
camera to is either second order or

2072
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:09,780
third order interpolator

2073
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:16,109
that uses the velocity of the camera at

2074
02:03:09,779 --> 02:03:21,960
the current time as a constraint that is

2075
02:03:16,109 --> 02:03:23,549
what I will be switching it to do you

2076
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:25,230
ever feel like everything needs to work

2077
02:03:23,550 --> 02:03:27,659
to the point it's demotivating you're

2078
02:03:25,229 --> 02:03:28,889
not even sure or everything needs work

2079
02:03:27,659 --> 02:03:31,859
to the point where it's too motivating

2080
02:03:28,890 --> 02:03:36,240
you're not even sure to start yes and no

2081
02:03:31,859 --> 02:03:39,389
so here's what I would say in a perfect

2082
02:03:36,239 --> 02:03:41,489
world where I just had funding to do

2083
02:03:39,390 --> 02:03:44,820
whatever I wanted all the time and the

2084
02:03:41,489 --> 02:03:46,590
things Fermat thought magical it never

2085
02:03:44,819 --> 02:03:48,750
would demotivate me because I always

2086
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:52,289
want to work on all of it so I just work

2087
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:53,579
on it and I wouldn't mind so really the

2088
02:03:52,289 --> 02:03:55,199
part that's the motivating

2089
02:03:53,579 --> 02:03:57,359
realizing that you will never have

2090
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:58,559
enough time to do stuff before it has to

2091
02:03:57,359 --> 02:04:03,239
go out the door or you just become

2092
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:05,160
bankrupt and poor and whatever and so if

2093
02:04:03,239 --> 02:04:08,369
I worked in a research lab I would never

2094
02:04:05,159 --> 02:04:12,930
be demotivated like ever because I

2095
02:04:08,369 --> 02:04:14,640
always want to work on it but in the

2096
02:04:12,930 --> 02:04:16,500
real world yes it can be de motivating

2097
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:18,800
cuz you're just like I can never I'm

2098
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:22,829
never gonna get all this done you know

2099
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:24,720
and so that's unfortunate

2100
02:04:22,829 --> 02:04:26,970
right but it's that's just true for

2101
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:28,890
everything I mean no matter what you do

2102
02:04:26,970 --> 02:04:32,550
it's always true that you could have

2103
02:04:28,890 --> 02:04:35,250
done more even if you use a licensed

2104
02:04:32,550 --> 02:04:36,779
engine and plugins and used as much

2105
02:04:35,250 --> 02:04:38,750
off-the-shelf stuff as you could

2106
02:04:36,779 --> 02:04:41,579
whatever the part is that you're making

2107
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:44,130
you coulda done more right it's almost

2108
02:04:41,579 --> 02:04:46,949
never it's only if you have a very

2109
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:50,340
limited idea of the possibilities that

2110
02:04:46,949 --> 02:04:58,199
you'd ever be like well that's perfect

2111
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:59,220
right like so it's just something you

2112
02:04:58,199 --> 02:05:01,829
have to live with you know it's

2113
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:03,510
unfortunate but it's also in some sense

2114
02:05:01,829 --> 02:05:06,899
you could look at it in a positive light

2115
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:09,480
in that hey it means that as long as we

2116
02:05:06,899 --> 02:05:11,219
still have some market for shipping this

2117
02:05:09,479 --> 02:05:13,049
stuff there will always be work to do

2118
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:14,550
because there's always things you could

2119
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:16,440
have improved on in your previous time

2120
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:18,690
you did it so you never have to think

2121
02:05:16,439 --> 02:05:23,329
about it it's like well I mean we're

2122
02:05:18,689 --> 02:05:23,329
just done now right

2123
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:32,000
Carrie Johansson so we've been debating

2124
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:34,220
the merits of using a garbage collected

2125
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,510
language like go in a network situation

2126
02:05:34,220 --> 02:05:37,730
where you have absolutely no prediction

2127
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:39,079
of what data load will be coming in do

2128
02:05:37,729 --> 02:05:40,729
you think a language let go would be a

2129
02:05:39,079 --> 02:05:41,989
good choice I feel like you've answered

2130
02:05:40,729 --> 02:05:47,750
a question like this but I honestly

2131
02:05:41,989 --> 02:05:49,659
don't remember response um I guess what

2132
02:05:47,750 --> 02:05:51,979
I would say is garbage collection

2133
02:05:49,659 --> 02:05:55,779
doesn't really ever seem to solve

2134
02:05:51,979 --> 02:05:55,779
problems for me that I care about

2135
02:05:58,270 --> 02:06:08,810
because the way I would state it is that

2136
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:13,690
garbage collection isn't garbage

2137
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:17,960
collection is not you is not solving

2138
02:06:13,689 --> 02:06:20,089
memory allocation in any way that

2139
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:22,369
anything else doesn't solve it right

2140
02:06:20,090 --> 02:06:26,569
it's just one way of managing your

2141
02:06:22,369 --> 02:06:29,090
memory and so if the answer is that

2142
02:06:26,569 --> 02:06:32,329
garbage collection is the optimal way to

2143
02:06:29,090 --> 02:06:34,010
manage the memory then I could have

2144
02:06:32,329 --> 02:06:38,840
written something that effectively did

2145
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:42,079
that right and so at that point it's

2146
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:45,319
like well is using go better than doing

2147
02:06:42,079 --> 02:06:46,699
that sure probably I mean I trust that

2148
02:06:45,319 --> 02:06:48,079
they probably wrote a good garbage

2149
02:06:46,699 --> 02:06:53,019
collector for whatever they were doing

2150
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:55,970
and so that seems reasonable but

2151
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:58,370
identifying an actual real-world

2152
02:06:55,970 --> 02:06:59,930
situation where garbage collection was

2153
02:06:58,369 --> 02:07:05,289
the most efficient way to manage the

2154
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:09,039
memory I can't really even think of one

2155
02:07:05,289 --> 02:07:11,300
I've certainly never seen one and

2156
02:07:09,039 --> 02:07:13,789
usually what garbage collection is is an

2157
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:15,440
excuse for you to not figure out what

2158
02:07:13,789 --> 02:07:18,109
the optimal way to manage the memory was

2159
02:07:15,439 --> 02:07:19,129
and so a lot of times when you talk

2160
02:07:18,109 --> 02:07:22,789
about garbage collection what you're

2161
02:07:19,130 --> 02:07:25,190
really talking about is do I want to

2162
02:07:22,789 --> 02:07:28,189
save programming time not worrying about

2163
02:07:25,189 --> 02:07:30,439
memory management that's very different

2164
02:07:28,189 --> 02:07:32,869
than saying I wanted to write the proper

2165
02:07:30,439 --> 02:07:34,809
program here and so it's just worth

2166
02:07:32,869 --> 02:07:40,489
understanding what you're actually doing

2167
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:42,560
so I would say if you're choosing go

2168
02:07:40,489 --> 02:07:44,719
in a sense what you're saying is I am

2169
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:47,150
okay with this code performing worse

2170
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:50,600
than it should in exchange for me not

2171
02:07:47,149 --> 02:07:51,979
doing some certain work and that's very

2172
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:54,020
different from saying it was a good

2173
02:07:51,979 --> 02:07:56,929
technical decision it may be a good

2174
02:07:54,020 --> 02:07:58,280
managerial decision but garbage

2175
02:07:56,930 --> 02:08:01,280
collection is almost never a good

2176
02:07:58,279 --> 02:08:02,989
technical decision because you could

2177
02:08:01,279 --> 02:08:04,250
have probably done a much better job if

2178
02:08:02,989 --> 02:08:10,159
you thought about how the memory should

2179
02:08:04,250 --> 02:08:12,140
work right so I would really emphasize

2180
02:08:10,159 --> 02:08:14,470
splitting those two things apart because

2181
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:16,490
that's usually where the arguments start

2182
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:18,230
if someone's arguing that garbage

2183
02:08:16,489 --> 02:08:20,529
collection was actually the best way to

2184
02:08:18,229 --> 02:08:22,659
manage the memory they're probably wrong

2185
02:08:20,529 --> 02:08:24,949
it almost never is

2186
02:08:22,659 --> 02:08:26,539
maybe there's a circumstance where it is

2187
02:08:24,949 --> 02:08:28,760
literally indistinguishable from what

2188
02:08:26,539 --> 02:08:32,479
you would have done optimally but that's

2189
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:34,640
almost never true so really the only

2190
02:08:32,479 --> 02:08:38,719
arguments made for for garbage

2191
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:40,190
collection is managerial here are some

2192
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:41,920
reasons the programmers on this project

2193
02:08:40,189 --> 02:08:44,299
aren't good enough to deal with memory

2194
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:46,340
totally valid managerial decision if

2195
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:48,739
they aren't use a garbage collector

2196
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:50,090
it might work right they might still

2197
02:08:48,739 --> 02:08:51,949
screw it up because garbage collectors

2198
02:08:50,090 --> 02:08:54,409
can't fix things where you leave

2199
02:08:51,949 --> 02:08:56,599
references around that it doesn't know

2200
02:08:54,409 --> 02:08:59,599
you're done with right so you can still

2201
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:00,920
screw up but you know that's a totally

2202
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:01,880
totally reason I'm Angelo decision the

2203
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:05,119
partners loss pressures aren't good

2204
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:06,949
enough to the amount of analysis and

2205
02:09:05,119 --> 02:09:08,899
work we'll have to do to get the memory

2206
02:09:06,949 --> 02:09:10,880
memory management correct isn't going to

2207
02:09:08,899 --> 02:09:12,649
be worth it on this project because we

2208
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:15,020
don't have the time or we don't have the

2209
02:09:12,649 --> 02:09:18,079
resources or we'd rather do something

2210
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:21,320
else or our competition is all terrible

2211
02:09:18,079 --> 02:09:22,670
anyway so we will still be faster than

2212
02:09:21,319 --> 02:09:27,259
them even if we don't do a very good job

2213
02:09:22,670 --> 02:09:35,170
right all of those are also valid

2214
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:37,720
managerial decisions so you know just

2215
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:40,430
understand what you're arguing about and

2216
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:44,060
if you're arguing about some of those

2217
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:46,520
things I want to save my team time I

2218
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:47,840
don't think that seems good enough we've

2219
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:49,610
had a lot of bugs like this in the past

2220
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:50,270
so we just assume we can't really handle

2221
02:09:49,609 --> 02:09:53,259
it properly

2222
02:09:50,270 --> 02:09:55,410
bla bla bla bla all valid

2223
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:58,030
managerial decisions valid arguments

2224
02:09:55,409 --> 02:10:00,760
garbage collection is good at managing

2225
02:09:58,029 --> 02:10:06,029
memory here probably not a valid

2226
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:06,030
argument like probably just not

2227
02:10:25,329 --> 02:10:29,119
is it better to work on a fun task or a

2228
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:30,829
test is more important if you have

2229
02:10:29,119 --> 02:10:32,210
limited time that's a tough decision

2230
02:10:30,829 --> 02:10:34,180
because one of the things about fun

2231
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:36,649
tasks is you may get them done quicker

2232
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:38,390
or you may do a higher quality of work

2233
02:10:36,649 --> 02:10:41,059
on them so I feel like that's a really

2234
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:42,950
tough thing to answer obviously a more

2235
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:44,930
important task is more important to do

2236
02:10:42,949 --> 02:10:47,179
so you should probably do it instead of

2237
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:48,500
the fun task but if you're going to be

2238
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:49,909
doing lousy work or you're

2239
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:50,989
procrastinating all the time and the

2240
02:10:49,909 --> 02:10:52,670
more important task isn't getting done

2241
02:10:50,989 --> 02:10:55,569
maybe switching to the fun task for a

2242
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:55,569
little while is a good idea

2243
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:23,690
and no we don't this is a procedural

2244
02:11:22,069 --> 02:11:29,179
game so there's no scripting language in

2245
02:11:23,689 --> 02:11:30,769
it all right I'm gonna wrap it up yeah

2246
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:32,239
again on that garbage section front I

2247
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:33,680
would really encourage people to think

2248
02:11:32,238 --> 02:11:34,968
to make sure they know what they're

2249
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:38,989
arguing about when the argument things

2250
02:11:34,969 --> 02:11:45,109
like that and you know garbage garbage

2251
02:11:38,988 --> 02:11:46,968
collection just it's really usually not

2252
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:48,589
worth arguing about also because it's

2253
02:11:46,969 --> 02:11:51,619
just like I think the answers are very

2254
02:11:48,590 --> 02:11:55,250
clear right garbage collection is never

2255
02:11:51,619 --> 02:11:58,189
the best code pretty much ever I don't

2256
02:11:55,250 --> 02:12:00,199
think I've ever seen a situation where

2257
02:11:58,189 --> 02:12:02,509
garbage collection is going to be the

2258
02:12:00,199 --> 02:12:07,460
most efficient way to run that code

2259
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:09,409
right and so as long as we agree on that

2260
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:11,390
then we're really just talking about

2261
02:12:09,409 --> 02:12:13,069
managerial decisions and those are very

2262
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:14,800
fuzzy so I don't know that there's that

2263
02:12:13,069 --> 02:12:17,779
much arguing you could really do like

2264
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:19,070
you know sometimes it's clear-cut these

2265
02:12:17,779 --> 02:12:20,779
programmers are beginners they don't

2266
02:12:19,069 --> 02:12:22,309
even know what a pointer is like use

2267
02:12:20,779 --> 02:12:24,979
garbage collection and come on like

2268
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:26,630
they're gonna screw it up it's fine but

2269
02:12:24,979 --> 02:12:27,859
if you have a bunch of experts and they

2270
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:29,719
really know what they're doing should be

2271
02:12:27,859 --> 02:12:31,130
using guard section I don't know how

2272
02:12:29,719 --> 02:12:35,000
complicated is the code is it editing

2273
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:36,949
based how much realistic flexibility is

2274
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:41,270
there and how much the asset space is

2275
02:12:36,949 --> 02:12:42,769
and so and so forth you know do we have

2276
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:44,210
to get this done extremely quickly maybe

2277
02:12:42,770 --> 02:12:46,969
we just don't want to think about it and

2278
02:12:44,210 --> 02:12:48,619
performance isn't the issue you know and

2279
02:12:46,969 --> 02:12:49,909
hopefully we can all make a reasonable

2280
02:12:48,619 --> 02:12:51,349
decision there I mean we know what it is

2281
02:12:49,909 --> 02:12:52,939
it's it's not like it's weird what

2282
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:55,430
garbage suction does it's very obvious

2283
02:12:52,939 --> 02:12:59,149
what it does and how it does it so you

2284
02:12:55,430 --> 02:12:59,869
know and so really the only thing I

2285
02:12:59,149 --> 02:13:01,309
would encourage you let's say it's like

2286
02:12:59,869 --> 02:13:03,469
let's make sure you get the technicals

2287
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:05,690
down for every section isn't good it's

2288
02:13:03,469 --> 02:13:07,430
it's a lousy way to manage memory in

2289
02:13:05,689 --> 02:13:10,250
terms of if you're trying to get optimal

2290
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:11,960
performance accept that fact and if we

2291
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:14,409
can if we can accept the fact that

2292
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:17,659
that's true and move on to talking about

2293
02:13:14,409 --> 02:13:21,050
whether using a lousy memory manager is

2294
02:13:17,659 --> 02:13:21,769
in fact better than then doing it

2295
02:13:21,050 --> 02:13:23,810
ourselves

2296
02:13:21,770 --> 02:13:27,550
he's a separate discussion and you can

2297
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:30,890
say yes to that you can say yes right

2298
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:31,770
all the code you will ever write in your

2299
02:13:30,890 --> 02:13:33,719
whole life

2300
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:36,270
we'll probably not be optimal except

2301
02:13:33,719 --> 02:13:42,689
very small tiny maybe little little bits

2302
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:44,540
you know and so it's okay to say we're

2303
02:13:42,689 --> 02:13:47,159
gonna do something none optimal here and

2304
02:13:44,539 --> 02:13:49,260
we understand that but it's the right

2305
02:13:47,159 --> 02:13:52,619
decision

2306
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:53,489
and so that's what but you want to get

2307
02:13:52,619 --> 02:13:57,869
that right

2308
02:13:53,488 --> 02:13:59,819
don't confuse making a trade-off with

2309
02:13:57,869 --> 02:14:01,529
saying that you're doing the right thing

2310
02:13:59,819 --> 02:14:02,969
in some abstract sense because that's

2311
02:14:01,529 --> 02:14:04,829
not what's going on you're making a

2312
02:14:02,969 --> 02:14:06,630
trade-off you're saying let's have worse

2313
02:14:04,829 --> 02:14:07,979
performance in exchange for something

2314
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:10,140
and as long as you know what that

2315
02:14:07,979 --> 02:14:11,519
something is and you've justified it

2316
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:14,039
well that's a totally reasonable

2317
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:17,040
decision but you don't want to argue as

2318
02:14:14,039 --> 02:14:20,449
if you didn't make a trade-off because

2319
02:14:17,039 --> 02:14:20,449
you did right

2320
02:14:26,170 --> 02:14:36,940
all right what did we change what did I

2321
02:14:33,909 --> 02:14:40,630
change it says Save Changes what were

2322
02:14:36,939 --> 02:14:42,698
the changes can't tell me what the

2323
02:14:40,630 --> 02:14:45,210
changes are no don't change them I guess

2324
02:14:42,698 --> 02:14:50,979
I don't even know what the changes were

2325
02:14:45,210 --> 02:14:52,989
heaven forfend I didn't mean to make any

2326
02:14:50,979 --> 02:14:54,459
changes thank you everyone for joining

2327
02:14:52,988 --> 02:14:55,599
me for another so the handmade hereit's

2328
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:58,090
or the pleasure coating with you as

2329
02:14:55,600 --> 02:15:00,370
always I felt good to fix that camera

2330
02:14:58,090 --> 02:15:02,110
bug was driving me nuts and hey we

2331
02:15:00,369 --> 02:15:04,059
simplified that code you notice the

2332
02:15:02,109 --> 02:15:07,210
theme of leyte is just simplifying code

2333
02:15:04,060 --> 02:15:08,860
now and everything gets better why is

2334
02:15:07,210 --> 02:15:10,989
that the case it's the case because

2335
02:15:08,859 --> 02:15:12,880
again with exploratory architecture

2336
02:15:10,988 --> 02:15:14,500
we're prepaying we don't know exactly

2337
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:17,679
how things should work there's a lot of

2338
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:19,810
slop there and as as things build up and

2339
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:21,340
change and mutate there's garbage code

2340
02:15:19,810 --> 02:15:23,140
that's in there and bad ways of doing

2341
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:25,090
things that naturally kind of happened

2342
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:26,949
as we as we brought systems up together

2343
02:15:25,090 --> 02:15:28,690
but once we're now at a place now where

2344
02:15:26,948 --> 02:15:30,250
we're like yeah this engine is pretty

2345
02:15:28,689 --> 02:15:33,099
reasonable and it's got most of things

2346
02:15:30,250 --> 02:15:34,719
we need now we can see those areas where

2347
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:36,640
things come together and it becomes

2348
02:15:34,719 --> 02:15:38,230
obvious how they can be made much

2349
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:39,670
simpler and work much cleaner and so

2350
02:15:38,229 --> 02:15:42,159
we're just go we're just going in there

2351
02:15:39,670 --> 02:15:44,199
and cleaning those out right and

2352
02:15:42,159 --> 02:15:46,420
cleaning those out

2353
02:15:44,198 --> 02:15:47,619
it's like polishing the the artwork

2354
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:49,960
right you know you get this sort of

2355
02:15:47,619 --> 02:15:51,969
rough plaster cast of this thing and you

2356
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:53,109
look it off it's all rough and gross and

2357
02:15:51,969 --> 02:15:54,310
now he's going in there and like you

2358
02:15:53,109 --> 02:15:55,479
know getting it all smooth is like oh

2359
02:15:54,310 --> 02:15:57,730
well that's actually quite beautiful

2360
02:15:55,479 --> 02:15:59,349
like now that we get to it right and so

2361
02:15:57,729 --> 02:16:00,789
you'll see that theme that will continue

2362
02:15:59,350 --> 02:16:03,579
to play out over the next few months as

2363
02:16:00,789 --> 02:16:06,000
we bring the actual game into a game

2364
02:16:03,579 --> 02:16:08,590
state like a actual like this is a game

2365
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,390
you'll see me doing that over and over

2366
02:16:08,590 --> 02:16:12,699
where like things that were complicated

2367
02:16:10,390 --> 02:16:14,320
and weird before now that's clear how

2368
02:16:12,698 --> 02:16:16,419
they work they just get nicely polished

2369
02:16:14,319 --> 02:16:18,789
over and become a very simple thing you

2370
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:20,500
saw it with the asset system now you're

2371
02:16:18,789 --> 02:16:22,238
seeing it with a camera code and that

2372
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:23,439
will continue to be true the renderer

2373
02:16:22,238 --> 02:16:25,209
kind of went through that it'll go

2374
02:16:23,439 --> 02:16:26,500
through one more time hopefully the

2375
02:16:25,210 --> 02:16:27,969
lighting happens that way too but

2376
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:30,729
platings the worst part so that'll be

2377
02:16:27,969 --> 02:16:33,189
the harder one but you know it's good to

2378
02:16:30,729 --> 02:16:34,599
see right that's a good sign that's not

2379
02:16:33,189 --> 02:16:36,550
a sign you screwed up at the sign you

2380
02:16:34,599 --> 02:16:38,349
did your job you did the right thing

2381
02:16:36,549 --> 02:16:38,840
and you're finally getting to the to the

2382
02:16:38,349 --> 02:16:40,489
correct

2383
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:44,450
texture that now you could say hey we

2384
02:16:40,489 --> 02:16:46,429
figured it out you got it now all right

2385
02:16:44,450 --> 02:16:48,530
so there'll be more surprise streams

2386
02:16:46,429 --> 02:16:50,659
coming I can't say when because then

2387
02:16:48,530 --> 02:16:52,820
they wouldn't be surprises so you know

2388
02:16:50,659 --> 02:16:55,579
keep a keep a check on the live stream

2389
02:16:52,819 --> 02:16:57,529
page here and I'll be updating the

2390
02:16:55,579 --> 02:16:59,870
schedule as it goes also there's also

2391
02:16:57,530 --> 02:17:03,219
that the Twitter you can always check on

2392
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:07,189
the handmade hero Twitter it's got a

2393
02:17:03,218 --> 02:17:08,569
it's got a feed that goes on you know

2394
02:17:07,189 --> 02:17:13,519
what I'm saying

2395
02:17:08,569 --> 02:17:15,170
this thing it'll you know we says when

2396
02:17:13,519 --> 02:17:16,840
we're live and and all that stuff so you

2397
02:17:15,170 --> 02:17:19,579
can always get on there if you want to -

2398
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:21,349
all right that's it for today remember

2399
02:17:19,579 --> 02:17:22,609
if you want to follow along at home you

2400
02:17:21,349 --> 02:17:24,349
can always peer to the game on handmade

2401
02:17:22,609 --> 02:17:25,550
here Oregon it comes with a source code

2402
02:17:24,349 --> 02:17:27,250
so if you want to play around with it

2403
02:17:25,549 --> 02:17:30,228
you can just hit that big green button

2404
02:17:27,250 --> 02:17:32,478
and you can either it's got a github

2405
02:17:30,228 --> 02:17:33,920
thing on there and it's got a source

2406
02:17:32,478 --> 02:17:35,179
code download the github is kind of

2407
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:36,950
unsupported but we haven't had any

2408
02:17:35,179 --> 02:17:39,109
problems with it yet so seems like it's

2409
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:40,340
pretty good for people like to use that

2410
02:17:39,109 --> 02:17:42,769
as an alternate way of getting the

2411
02:17:40,340 --> 02:17:45,260
source so go ahead and check that out

2412
02:17:42,769 --> 02:17:46,609
and that's about it till next dream have

2413
02:17:45,260 --> 02:17:48,050
fun programming everyone and I'll see

2414
02:17:46,609 --> 02:17:50,260
you on the Internet take it easy

2415
02:17:48,049 --> 02:17:50,259
everybody
