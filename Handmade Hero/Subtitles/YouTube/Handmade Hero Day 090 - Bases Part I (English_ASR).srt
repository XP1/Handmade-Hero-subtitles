1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:04,859
okay hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:09,949
handmade hero the show where we code a

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:15,630
complete game live on twitch you know

4
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:16,559
one thing that I pretty much always say

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,850
at the beginning of the stream is that

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,028
we don't use any engines and we don't

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,400
use any libraries and that is true and

8
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:26,759
the reason that we do that is because

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,528
you know honestly mm-hmm I always say

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,118
that it so we can see the entire you

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,969
know the entire pipeline of a game and

12
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,859
all that's right Stefan honestly like

13
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:38,429
there's a hidden part there too which is

14
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,869
just like I always get grumpy about the

15
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,799
way other people do things you know I

16
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:43,259
think there's like a control-freak

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,089
aspect of that as well where it's like

18
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,920
it's not just that I think it's a good

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,109
idea and educational to go through and

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,219
do it entirely yourself at one point but

21
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:54,719
also that like I would spend all my time

22
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,039
complaining about how they chose to do

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,239
something you know what I mean you ever

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,189
get in that situation where you're like

25
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,589
using something and you're just like you

26
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,628
know what this is just done totally

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,659
wrong like I don't agree with any of

28
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,920
this and I don't see that's the

29
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,140
experience I have most the time I try to

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,670
use that stuff so so you know I'm doing

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,260
this one for educational purposes but

32
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,579
honestly even if I wasn't I still

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,890
wouldn't be using an engine or libraries

34
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:21,359
because frankly they're garbage

35
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:25,618
alright so that said I would like to go

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,969
ahead and introduce to you day 90 if you

37
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,799
are trying to follow at home and you've

38
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,590
pre-ordered the game on handmade hero

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,930
org you can download the source code

40
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,689
that from the link you got in your email

41
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,939
and what you want to do there is you

42
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:40,228
want to unzip date 89 source code

43
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,469
because that is what we are starting

44
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:45,149
with right now so unzip that and you'll

45
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,750
be able to follow along exactly with me

46
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:51,118
so let's take a look here where we're at

47
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,349
where we have what we have come to and

48
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,790
honestly you know since its kind of a

49
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,438
little bit of a sleepy day today I'm

50
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,840
gonna start off with something that I

51
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:02,218
mean you for a long time I'm just gonna

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:06,299
do it it's complete busy work but I want

53
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:08,399
to do it anyway which is I realized that

54
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,560
I named these a little bit wrong

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,599
compared to my code base that I normally

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,819
use

57
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,579
and it drives me insane when I switched

58
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:21,239
between them so I put them as capital

59
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,120
letters when we did it here the X Y and

60
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,939
the X Y Z and stuff which is what I

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,420
would normally do

62
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:33,449
however if you have ever looked at HLSL

63
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:37,319
or GLSL the shading languages that you

64
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:42,509
are required to write stuff in when you

65
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:45,269
are using OpenGL direct3d etc they use

66
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:49,079
lowercase accessors for their vectors

67
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:52,620
and I like to make my code so that it

68
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,050
can compile both ways so that you know

69
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,500
you can have expressions that compile in

70
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:01,770
a shader or in your code and so what I

71
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,169
did with my source code the way that I

72
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:08,760
write it you know at my day job

73
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:11,309
basically right is I use the lowercase 1

74
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,429
so that I can use so that I don't have

75
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,099
to do any translation between them right

76
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,439
and so every time I switch between the

77
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,939
handmade hero code at night and the code

78
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,409
that I work on during the day I always

79
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:26,879
end up in this situation where I'm like

80
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:28,409
ah because I typed the wrong things and

81
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,769
it drives me bonkers so I want to just

82
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:34,229
kind of unify these two here so that I

83
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:37,530
can stop having that that painful

84
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:39,869
process occurred basically so that's it

85
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,969
that's all I really wanted to do was

86
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,230
this and so it's again it's just

87
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:45,569
annoying I just have to kind of go

88
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:48,959
through and change what people were

89
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,000
accessing those by so it's gonna be a

90
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,409
little bit of Drudge work but you know I

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,650
really wanted to do it because every

92
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:58,979
time I was like aah and so I'm gonna try

93
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:03,060
and get us back to there before we get

94
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:05,399
any further down the oops that's not

95
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,909
right before we go any further down the

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,670
the rathole of using a different one so

97
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:13,139
it's gonna take a while I apologize

98
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:14,549
there is really nothing to describe I'm

99
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,858
literally just changing these from

100
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,310
uppercase to lowercase which is

101
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:23,009
extremely boring but that's just what

102
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,139
you got to do sometimes oops

103
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:28,889
I wonder if I can do something like dot

104
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:34,889
X equals dot X and have that be mostly

105
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:39,060
right most of the time looks like it so

106
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:40,379
that's good that looks good so let's do

107
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,009
that that'll save us a bunch of time

108
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,050
wasn't sure how likely that would be to

109
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:48,740
work but it looks like it does so that's

110
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,480
good so let's do dot y equals dot y

111
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,329
there we go

112
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:58,950
also that'll also save us from making

113
00:04:54,329 --> 00:05:01,500
typos potentially hopefully I just take

114
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,969
a little bit of attention here kind of

115
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,410
crazy when you think about how much code

116
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,290
you end up writing we look through here

117
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,850
and you know 90 hours of code I guess

118
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:13,950
we've done well maybe a little bit more

119
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:15,330
than that but mmm you know 90 hours of

120
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:18,029
code and there's just so much stuff in

121
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:20,189
here even though we're just you know

122
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:25,259
we're only maybe a sixth of the way

123
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:27,149
through working on this stuff my head

124
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,750
keeps obscuring that last replacement

125
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:34,429
all right so that's one file down so dot

126
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:44,629
XY becomes dot XY as well there we go

127
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:52,430
and let's see dot Z Z Y dot y all right

128
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:54,149
okay next file dot X becomes that X that

129
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:59,329
that's pretty good

130
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:59,329
and why comes that why

131
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,739
it's one of those things where I do feel

132
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,800
like I kind of have to watch each

133
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:12,780
individual one even though probably I

134
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:15,530
don't have to yeah you never do now are

135
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:20,429
are I wonder if I can just do a thing

136
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:21,299
where I Wow yeah I won't do that I was

137
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,280
gonna say what if I could do a thing

138
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,579
that'll automatically do all of them for

139
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,069
me

140
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:29,909
Emacs has ways of doing that but I'm not

141
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:46,139
I don't have enough Emacs foo to to bust

142
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:48,740
that out and B's and A's alright let's

143
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,740
see how we're doing

144
00:06:52,939 --> 00:07:03,149
hmm all right and dot Z as well yeah

145
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:10,980
that was mistake

146
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:12,989
oh it's a sleepy day here yeah I did not

147
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,650
get much sleep last night and then you

148
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,210
know I was I was doing a bunch of coding

149
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:21,299
all day long and then it's like you know

150
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:23,159
I think my brain might just be tired my

151
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:30,319
brain might just be a little bit tired

152
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,320
sometimes it happens let's see see see

153
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,598
you know I liked it better in the old

154
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:40,418
days when it didn't do this see

155
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,978
Declaration of thing because jumping in

156
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:44,939
like that makes it hard to just quickly

157
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:47,199
go through where all the errors are I

158
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,329
don't know if you can turn that off I've

159
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,908
never looked I should but just kind of

160
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:54,008
spontaneously turned on and I don't know

161
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:59,199
how you get it get rid of it

162
00:07:54,009 --> 00:08:23,590
all right so let's do Dex Dex yeah a lot

163
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:26,288
of those and why last file I think this

164
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:27,878
is the big one right here people and

165
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:53,319
we'll see if I made any critical

166
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:54,959
replacement errors all right what do you

167
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,528
think do you think it worked

168
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:01,528
do you think it worked let's find out

169
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:01,528
okay

170
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:06,278
yay

171
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:09,278
looks pretty good nothing particularly

172
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:13,299
suspicious going on so we'll call it

173
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:14,289
good all right okay so now we can get

174
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,389
started with other things I just I

175
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,679
really wanted to do that I kept being

176
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,990
like you know I gotta do that sometime

177
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,458
and since you know I'm a low energy day

178
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,629
you kind of want to go like okay what

179
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,639
could I do that's not going to take a

180
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:27,220
huge amount of mental energy something

181
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:31,480
that like needs to get done that's just

182
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:34,870
kind of that that sort of thing all

183
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,659
right so let's take a look here we were

184
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:41,500
working on our render group structure

185
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:44,049
when we last were handmade hearing and

186
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,909
we sort of introduced this notion of

187
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:47,859
multiple things like we had the rec time

188
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:50,620
goals and the bitmaps and clears we

189
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,269
never implemented clear though and so

190
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,480
what I want to do is I want to go ahead

191
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:57,789
and implement clear so I'm gonna take

192
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,840
the the place where we were actually

193
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:03,549
calling before we draw a rectangle to

194
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,310
clear the screen right like this is that

195
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:08,559
that rectangle clear call right right

196
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:12,159
there so what I want to do is I want to

197
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,959
turn that into an actual clear operation

198
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,029
so I want to do like a render drip clear

199
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:20,530
where I just say okay you know what

200
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:22,750
clear the screen clear it to this color

201
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:26,740
right here that's what I want you to

202
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:29,799
clear it to rgba and then we'll make it

203
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,860
so that that actually does that clear

204
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,779
operation so in here when we actually

205
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,720
get one of these clears what we're gonna

206
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:40,149
do is do the sort of the draw rectangle

207
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,440
call that we were doing before because

208
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:42,730
we don't really need to implement an

209
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,710
actual clear yet

210
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,990
and we'll actually make sure that it

211
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,780
does exactly what we wanted to do now we

212
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:53,110
don't actually pack a in here at all a

213
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:54,879
has to be 0 for now so what I'm gonna do

214
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,220
is I'm going to actually go ahead and

215
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,429
make it so that there is an A for the

216
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,990
draw rectangle call in terms of what you

217
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:04,899
actually want to pack in there it just

218
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,779
defaults to 1 let's say but that way if

219
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,720
you want to you can clear the buffer to

220
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:12,459
have an A in it even though that's not

221
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,529
going to actually do any alpha blending

222
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,259
if that makes sense so I think I'll just

223
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,829
allow it to do that like so you know

224
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,049
what I'm saying

225
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:23,259
so it'll produce that packed color like

226
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:25,569
that so if I do that then what I should

227
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:29,110
be able to do is just pass that as a V

228
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:32,379
for right that that V for from the clear

229
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,840
call so this entry right here right will

230
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:37,570
have that color that we passed so this

231
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,030
will just be color are you I could do it

232
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:44,080
in lowercase now that's very good

233
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:46,919
so we'll do our G loops RGB and a there

234
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,350
so that way we can set the clear and

235
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:53,049
when we do that clear when we do the

236
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,610
actual call we now have to you know

237
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:56,259
anything that we want to do render wise

238
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,870
has to kind of go through that buffer

239
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:00,000
push right and so when we have this here

240
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,179
we're going to make

241
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,649
in line Boyd clear like so and it's

242
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,439
really just gonna do the exact same

243
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:10,199
thing that you know everything else so

244
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,730
far has been doing it's going to push on

245
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,740
mm-hmm one of these render elements

246
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:25,019
that's the that's the actual clear right

247
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:27,870
and and then it's gonna set whatever

248
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,399
values are specific to that thing right

249
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:33,120
so this in this case we've just got a

250
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,799
color and this is what we pass here and

251
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,019
so that's really I think all we'll need

252
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,299
to do for a clear I don't think there's

253
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:42,149
anything else that would be particularly

254
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:44,219
relevant at least not yet so up here we

255
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:45,419
now just need something for that it

256
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,820
looks like we've already got it so

257
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,829
that's good so we'll put in color there

258
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,150
which is a little bit different from how

259
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,430
we have it set up but we'll take a look

260
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:54,569
and make sure that that's all all kind

261
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:57,000
of kosher

262
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,890
we need the buffer to be changed to

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,259
whatever the output target is right so

264
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:03,750
that's what that is and that's good and

265
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,309
then we okay yeah need to change it here

266
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,860
as well so if you get the width and

267
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:10,439
height of that buffer we want to clear

268
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,210
so once we've done that we can now sort

269
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,100
of lean on that clear call and that

270
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,210
doesn't really do that much compared to

271
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,970
what we would have been doing in

272
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,440
software but in hardware and probably

273
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,210
eventually in software as well we'll be

274
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,010
able to do a faster operation there then

275
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:26,339
drawing something we'll be able to you

276
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:29,899
know most renderers and all hardware has

277
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:32,010
an accelerated way of clearing things

278
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:33,569
because it knows that you know it's

279
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:35,100
doing this sort of block operation

280
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,510
instead of having to figure out where

281
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,529
something is it knows it can just do the

282
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:43,470
whole active buffer at once right so we

283
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,480
should now have that working of course

284
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,009
we can't really tell but we could see we

285
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,620
can still see the purple flashes so we

286
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,299
can kind of assume it's working although

287
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,060
it's not a super great test what we

288
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:56,849
could do is of course stop drawing our

289
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,099
our ground patches for example and make

290
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,409
sure that we're actually seeing

291
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,779
something back there so what I can do is

292
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:05,639
I can go in here and say alright you

293
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,110
know this this thing here that goes

294
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,949
through and draws these ground buffers

295
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,810
you know I could just make that stop

296
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:17,420
right I think that would probably do it

297
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:19,649
oh why do you do this to me why

298
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:22,588
concessional press why is that even in

299
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:26,159
our build that's going away I hate that

300
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:29,310
wording it's like why are you even

301
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,990
telling me that I know whether I wanted

302
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:34,949
it to be constant or not it's not your

303
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:38,909
job so yeah so that's clearly clearing

304
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:40,830
it to that beautiful beautiful pink it's

305
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:42,269
really you know when people say their

306
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,650
favorite color is pink that's the pink

307
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:45,929
they're thinking of is that pink right

308
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:49,708
there it's this it's this sort of lush

309
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:51,809
magenta favorite of artists everywhere I

310
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,969
think it was Leonardo da Vinci who said

311
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:55,500
that you know if he could that the

312
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,800
perfect painting would be nothing but a

313
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:03,990
canvas of pure magenta he also listed

314
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:08,189
the the HTML pound color for it FF 0 0

315
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:10,470
FF so what you want to do now or rather

316
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,570
what I want to do now is go okay what's

317
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,009
what's the final set of things that we

318
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,589
haven't moved over into the render and I

319
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:19,559
think out of those I remember there was

320
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:24,390
an outline call as well and that's not

321
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:25,588
going through our renderer yet just

322
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:29,730
trying to think if there's anything else

323
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:32,130
that ever gets drawn right that that we

324
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,920
don't that we don't do and you know what

325
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:37,019
else here this is interesting so the

326
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:42,299
other thing that we haven't addressed is

327
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:44,549
the ground chunk that's calling the

328
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:47,250
bitmap routines directly not the

329
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:50,669
renderer and so I think we'll probably

330
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:52,049
we will more than likely want to port

331
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:53,429
that as well so maybe that's what we'll

332
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:57,299
do next as well but I'm pretty sure

333
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:59,039
we've still got the outline calls which

334
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:03,088
have not so this yeah these two guys

335
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:05,639
right here so push rect outline and draw

336
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:10,250
a rectangle outline so both of those I

337
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:12,539
think maybe we want to make those happen

338
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,730
we want to put those into the render as

339
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,528
more of a

340
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,589
you know as more of a specific concept

341
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:20,958
basically so I don't rally really

342
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:22,670
remember how this was working I feel

343
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,719
like you don't see these I feel like

344
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:25,909
these don't show up

345
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,850
normally anyway because they were behind

346
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:32,778
the ground chunks so one thing I could

347
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:36,170
do is say okay like after this filling

348
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:37,909
happens here oh no I guess they would

349
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,799
show up after because these get pushed

350
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:42,230
on first all right so that's fine

351
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,179
so when those get pushed then what I

352
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,610
would do here is I would say I want to

353
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:48,198
be able to have the rectangle outline

354
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,940
get pushed on as well

355
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:51,799
and one thing that I'm not sure about

356
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,380
yet I don't think we probably want this

357
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:56,120
but the the phrase push doesn't really

358
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:59,570
probably need to be on here anymore

359
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,948
either right we can probably get rid of

360
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,620
that anomic nature in a second but I'll

361
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:08,240
leave it for now so we'll just call this

362
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:09,529
push rect outline for now and we will go

363
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,199
ahead and port it

364
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:14,599
the two to what needs to happen for us

365
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,370
to actually draw here all right so if we

366
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:22,428
want to push the rect outline here let's

367
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:25,759
take a look at how this is being done so

368
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:27,949
screen P that looks like it's actually

369
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,480
something in screen space do we actually

370
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:31,279
care about any of this though how is

371
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,599
this stuff working that's strictly

372
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,000
something that's being used for

373
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,500
rendering right so let's move that down

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,240
here so we can see what sort of stuff

375
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,289
we're using for rendering some way

376
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:46,339
screen dim screen dim is also only used

377
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:49,250
for rendering so really that's those two

378
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:49,819
what about r LP r LP is actually used

379
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,859
okay

380
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:54,409
so really this is what we're doing for

381
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:56,240
rendering here and we're we're

382
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,250
differencing off the center of the

383
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,500
screen which is really not necessary

384
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,910
because the renderer will do that part

385
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,798
for us and the meters to pixels

386
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,590
conversion it will do for us as well

387
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,139
so I think most of this stuff we can

388
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:14,178
actually just use the standard things

389
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,610
that were happening kind of

390
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:17,900
automatically to make most of this stuff

391
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:20,298
happen so I think we can get rid of most

392
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,490
of this we can just say okay you know

393
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:25,548
what the v2 for this is actually just

394
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,690
going to be rel PX r l py so it's going

395
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:30,259
to be that that's

396
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:33,379
that's where the the rect outline starts

397
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:35,358
I guess and you know to be honest I

398
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:37,969
guess I don't know yeah it looks like

399
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:40,368
that's the center right of it so so

400
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,858
that's fine and if that's the center I

401
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:47,269
got a C so this does min and Max is what

402
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:49,339
it was doing before right right it was

403
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:51,679
doing - the screened-in + the screen to

404
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:54,888
him and here it just does the dim so we

405
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,340
can just do without doing meters to

406
00:18:54,888 --> 00:19:00,589
pixels we can just do that world chunk

407
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:03,259
dim in meters basically so now we know

408
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:04,908
that that as well so I think we more or

409
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:08,358
less could just do something like this

410
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:09,739
and kind of be done with it entirely if

411
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:12,108
that makes sense not have to do any of

412
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:15,440
that fussing there don't quote me on

413
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:18,618
that we'll see is it not push rect

414
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,179
outline it's push rect outline right did

415
00:19:18,618 --> 00:19:22,428
I miss something Oh doesn't take for

416
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:24,619
arguments that's probably true it

417
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:28,639
doesn't take for arguments that is

418
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:34,398
because we need to put in offset Z like

419
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:46,098
so mmm dim and color color is a v4 so

420
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:51,498
let's make sure all right so let's see

421
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:53,689
if that gets us any outlines oh my I

422
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:55,308
guess we forgot to update our push

423
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,169
rectangle call yeah these are still

424
00:19:55,308 --> 00:20:01,460
pushed piece calls we want these to be

425
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:03,470
pushed rect calls not push be skulls so

426
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,149
let's go ahead and change those because

427
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,909
I guess we haven't ever called push rect

428
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:12,158
outline since we did the port to the

429
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:15,830
renderer so it's still a bit a bit janky

430
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:20,979
what does it need let's see push rect

431
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:24,858
takes the group the offset the offset Z

432
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:28,069
the dimension so it doesn't take the

433
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:32,858
alignment that goes away takes the

434
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:32,858
dimension and that looks like it

435
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:41,888
so there's our tiles always good to be

436
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:44,648
able to see those skin let's also add

437
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:47,879
back in the other thing that was I think

438
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:51,099
we had one here that would show the

439
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,889
spaces that were defined so let's make

440
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:56,199
sure we can push those on as well I

441
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:57,548
assume that we can I don't actually know

442
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,429
why we wouldn't be able to so don't

443
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:02,109
think we change anything there they are

444
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:03,700
so those are just empty spaces that were

445
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:05,648
defined in the game so that's good

446
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,778
all right so everything seems like it's

447
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:12,489
flowing through properly now so I think

448
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:18,490
that maybe all of the calls to draw

449
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:26,710
anything that that we had had outside of

450
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:31,808
Phil Gramm chunk right do we see no we

451
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:33,610
don't so I think that's probably all we

452
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:35,470
really need to do for that now one thing

453
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:36,729
we do want to do like I said here is I

454
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,950
think we want everything going to the

455
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,798
renderer so I think we want fill ground

456
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:46,360
chunk to probably be able to go through

457
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:50,168
the renderer relatively easily and that

458
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:52,449
means it's gonna need it's gonna need

459
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:54,309
access to some kind of renderer that it

460
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,470
can use so what I'm gonna do is I'm

461
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:58,928
going to pass it the renderer as well

462
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,509
and allow it to do its own kind of

463
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:03,009
rendering for now we'll see what happens

464
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:06,190
with that but that seems like it should

465
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:10,569
be pretty straightforward so what I want

466
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:13,899
to do is say all right that kind of

467
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:16,898
happens up here where we do these ground

468
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:22,359
buffers you can kind of see where we

469
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:24,788
were we right here we do them the render

470
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:27,609
group is already something that we have

471
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:32,288
at the time so what we can do probably

472
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:34,569
pretty easily is allow the we could

473
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:38,710
probably have the ground buffers just

474
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:40,388
work directly through sort of that we

475
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,740
could probably have them work directly

476
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:43,079
through that render group before we

477
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,490
really get started now

478
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,319
we'll probably want it like I said do

479
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,759
these on a separate thread eventually so

480
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,319
they would be using a different render

481
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,259
group but for now we really don't need

482
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,539
to use a separate render group although

483
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,599
you know no they think about it I guess

484
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,399
we just could that doesn't really even

485
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:01,939
doesn't really even matter so you know

486
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:06,180
we could just do this right um

487
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:11,700
ground render group this it's so easy to

488
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:13,440
do right we could do something like this

489
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,029
where we just say all right let's do

490
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,809
that render group right here where we

491
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:20,700
have like ground memory right and then

492
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:22,559
we'll just release it when we're done so

493
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:27,539
we'll just do and temporary memory down

494
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:31,409
here right before you and temporary

495
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:33,149
memory ground memory so I think that

496
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,759
would just work right I don't think

497
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,560
there's really anything fancy that has

498
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:41,960
to go on there and so then what we could

499
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:44,759
do is say let's just go ahead and and

500
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:51,269
and sort of let this fill ground chunk

501
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:54,000
stuff let's let that actually use yeah

502
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:57,359
let's let that actually use our render

503
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,819
group now I don't actually know I got a

504
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,399
go make sure that the ground chunk will

505
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:03,960
actually work like I don't I don't

506
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,370
actually think there's anything special

507
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,860
that it has that it needs right it

508
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:09,209
wasn't doing anything yeah it doesn't do

509
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:14,490
anything that we can't do through the

510
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:16,200
render it's just drawing some bitmaps so

511
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,029
yeah I think we can literally just go

512
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,640
ahead and do it so when we do feel

513
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:22,529
ground chuck what we do is we go ahead

514
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,170
and take that render that render group

515
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:27,029
right and in fact I suppose we could

516
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,340
even instead of doing it there we could

517
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:32,039
even just do it in here right we could

518
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:34,559
just do it right there so that whenever

519
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:37,460
we want to refill one of these ground

520
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,659
chunks we just do it like this and then

521
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,220
it sort of can just build its little

522
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,080
queue and that would also let us

523
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,150
leverage the sorting that we're gonna do

524
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,949
which will be kind of cool because then

525
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,440
we don't have to make two separate loops

526
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,630
like we don't need two separate loops or

527
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,210
like we have we could just use one push

528
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,430
call and have them both get sorted so

529
00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:00,809
that's kind of nice so let's let's go

530
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:02,519
ahead and and see if we can make that

531
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:06,119
happen as well that seems like a good

532
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:09,900
idea all right so if we if we make this

533
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:12,509
happen with the render group oops we're

534
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,570
gonna need that transient arena but we

535
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:17,099
have it so that's fine and it doesn't

536
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:19,439
look like there's anything else in

537
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:21,929
particular fancy that has to happen so

538
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,240
it would literally just be making sure

539
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:27,450
that we at the end of it render

540
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,160
everything out to whatever that target

541
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,080
buffer is so if this is the buffer that

542
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,970
we're trying to target we would just

543
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:36,000
make sure that we sort of push

544
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,740
everything out at the very end right so

545
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,890
if we do this now we should presumably

546
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,349
get well we'll get nothing although we

547
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,870
could say that we you know we would we

548
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:47,429
would we could put a clear in here and

549
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:51,659
verify things were actually happening

550
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:55,289
like if I say clear render group v4 and

551
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:58,110
put in maybe a nice yellow you know a

552
00:25:55,289 --> 00:26:00,629
nice tasteful yellow I should say let's

553
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:03,109
go ahead and do that we should see all

554
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:05,520
our ground chunks be yellow now like so

555
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:06,899
and the reason for that is because again

556
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,539
this is still just calling the

557
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,310
drawbitmap directly so all of these draw

558
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,379
bitmap calls are actually happening on

559
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:15,450
the destination buffer immediately when

560
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,040
they get called but then at the end we

561
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,059
say render group to output and it starts

562
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,379
interpreting the command it's the only

563
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:21,929
command as is clear so it goes and

564
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,940
clears the buffer right but I just want

565
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,870
to do that to make sure that like it was

566
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,430
actually going through the pipeline

567
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:28,259
properly and it looks like it is so then

568
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,470
when we get here we can just do change

569
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:33,059
this to a push bitmap call right and

570
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:36,900
then we just have to change it to use

571
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:40,519
that renders syntax okay so when we do

572
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:44,519
that what we want to do here is say oops

573
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:46,740
push bitmap we want to do here is just

574
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:52,670
pass the same stuff the stamp right the

575
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:55,710
offset is just that pxpy I believe we

576
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:56,880
still we have some stuff here that makes

577
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,759
this a little bit trickier

578
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,450
this is being done in pixels at the

579
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,730
moment and so this this is kind of

580
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,680
interesting this may be a little bit of

581
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,970
an impetus for us though to go in and

582
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,788
support

583
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:14,429
soul positioning which isn't

584
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:15,599
particularly hard for us to do and so

585
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:21,990
maybe now it would be a good time for

586
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:24,240
start thinking about that so how would

587
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:27,599
we do that well we can actually cheese

588
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,038
it right now basically in a pretty

589
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,379
simple way like let's say we just want

590
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,230
this to be pixels so we want to push

591
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,260
that bitmap on and you know previously

592
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:40,620
we're calling this right and we just

593
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:42,379
want to literally have it you know do

594
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,699
exactly that draw so we don't want

595
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:49,409
anything other than that we don't want

596
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,210
to see offset right we where's that

597
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:52,980
bitmap called there we go we don't have

598
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,480
any alignment or anything that we needed

599
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,788
to do we've already done that although

600
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,370
we could start passing that along and

601
00:27:56,788 --> 00:28:01,500
and so we're just gonna let it do its

602
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:04,589
thing now if I do that right if I change

603
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,990
our to push bitmap calls to do that

604
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:10,470
exact thing then the problem is now

605
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,690
those oops well the problem is I

606
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,700
obviously have not finished what I was

607
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:24,210
doing what is the problem too loaded

608
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:28,350
bitmap to render group oh yeah sorry if

609
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:30,870
I do that now P right is in pixels but

610
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:32,699
the renderer only works on things in

611
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:35,069
meters and they always converts them up

612
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,319
to meters to pixels right so if I do

613
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:39,089
this you can notice that like okay so

614
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,519
there is some splatting going on there

615
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:43,288
but it's not at all right because only a

616
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,609
couple things will still fall within the

617
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:47,879
rectangle cuz everything else will have

618
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:49,500
been generated way outside where the

619
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,700
actual rectangle we were trying to fill

620
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,069
was so as say is we can choose that

621
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,808
pretty easily and it sort of sets up us

622
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:59,428
up for doing the next step that I wanted

623
00:28:57,808 --> 00:29:02,220
to take with cleaning up our renderer

624
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:04,140
and that is there's a meters to pixels

625
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,538
that's specified right

626
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,860
and instead of specifying the actual

627
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:10,140
meters to pixels I can just specify

628
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:12,240
nothing right I can just say you know

629
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,890
what it's one don't don't actually do

630
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,169
any multiplication just leave the values

631
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,600
the way they were and if I do that then

632
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:21,630
the stuff is actually in pixels right

633
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:22,099
because if I pass in pixels values and I

634
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,760
multiply

635
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:28,369
by one point oh I get pixel values right

636
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:31,190
and so hey that's an easy way to change

637
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:34,909
the scale that everything is operating

638
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:37,298
in in the renderer right and you know

639
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:40,970
you can kind of see this a little more

640
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:43,129
concisely right if I if I open up the

641
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,620
code here and I just kind of you know

642
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,179
edit it while we watch let me go ahead

643
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:50,418
and kind of pull that out there

644
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:54,230
so if I edit this code while we watch we

645
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:56,090
can kind of see hmm let me move over

646
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:58,730
here so we have a little more space to

647
00:29:56,089 --> 00:30:00,949
see it you know this is basically you

648
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:03,798
know it's just a scale right you can see

649
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:06,230
that if I scale as that number gets

650
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:07,819
higher then the sort of the separation

651
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:11,179
between these things gets bigger because

652
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:13,158
the placement of each of these elements

653
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:14,690
is getting multiplied by a higher and

654
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,520
higher value similarly I can like sort

655
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:20,779
of condense them down right into

656
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,889
something that's very smush face or not

657
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,139
as the case may be

658
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:28,929
oh there it goes I don't know why that

659
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,929
wasn't reloading let's try that again oh

660
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,970
it's just taking a long time when I do a

661
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:37,250
0.1 for reasons that are not immediately

662
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,319
clear to me but anyway you can see right

663
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,839
oh I know why because a lot more stuff

664
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:44,000
falls within the actual rectangle when

665
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,849
you do that so anyway you can kind of

666
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,980
see what happens right with with that

667
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:50,538
scale value and so all our meters to

668
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,429
pixel value was was something that was

669
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:54,950
kind of taking a small number which is

670
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:57,169
meters relative to the number of pixels

671
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:59,390
on the screen right because a meter in

672
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:01,970
our world is pretty pretty large here

673
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,960
and a pixels pretty tiny it's taking a

674
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,610
small number and blowing it out to a

675
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,490
larger one but we can just not do that

676
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:09,379
right and so what I want to kind of

677
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,150
introduce with that since we haven't

678
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,070
ever formally really talked about this

679
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,630
now it's probably a good time to talk

680
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:17,658
about it what I'd like to start talking

681
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:20,090
about is just the concept sort of of

682
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:21,830
coordinate systems and of Basie's and

683
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:24,079
that sort of stuff because we want to

684
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:27,319
start actually having a real notion of

685
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:31,069
those in our renderer so that we can you

686
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:32,960
know do more powerful things with it and

687
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:34,730
so that we have less stuff that confuses

688
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,539
us like negating Y and multiplying by

689
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,509
this and all that

690
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:41,509
it'd be nice you know just sort of get

691
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:43,160
things more towards something that's a

692
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:44,329
little more reasonable and so what I'd

693
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,250
like to do is just go ahead and talk

694
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:46,809
about that on the blackboard for a

695
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,980
minute

696
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:51,649
so that everyone kind of gets what the

697
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:57,250
idea is so all right so here we come

698
00:31:51,650 --> 00:32:00,350
with day ninety there is day ninety so

699
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:02,150
what I want to describe now and this

700
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:04,250
will probably take the rest I think

701
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:06,200
probably of the session I think that'd

702
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,759
be my suspicion but because it's

703
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,960
probably a fairly in-depth topic but

704
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,490
we'll do our best so what I want to

705
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,960
introduce here and I think we kind of

706
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,789
talked about it a little bit but not in

707
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,000
the cloud just not not so much in the

708
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:22,039
context of rendering but what I want to

709
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,940
talk about is that concept of a basis

710
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:27,980
right or another way to think about it

711
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,990
is an axis right these are similar

712
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,509
things because typically we see these a

713
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,460
lot like we'll draw things right you

714
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:37,190
know like this and then we'll say like

715
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:39,680
oh this is the x axis and this is the y

716
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,840
axis right and we don't think a huge

717
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,850
amount about what they mean if you

718
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,000
haven't done it spent a lot of time

719
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:48,049
doing graphics programming you're not

720
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,250
thinking about these much other than

721
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,690
like oh they're just some lines and some

722
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,920
graph paper or there's some stuff on the

723
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,690
screen that's sort of is you know one

724
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:58,070
goes up one goes to the side or whatever

725
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:59,960
right but these are actually fairly

726
00:32:58,069 --> 00:33:02,689
important to think about as first-class

727
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,730
citizens and it's important to sort of

728
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:08,480
think about you know what I what I would

729
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:10,190
say is how we measure things right and

730
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,769
the place where we talked about this was

731
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,750
before was with the dot product and if

732
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:16,129
you remember I said that with the dot

733
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,579
product what you could do is you can

734
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:22,490
measure a point along some unit vector

735
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:25,970
so if you have like a vector right I've

736
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:28,370
got some vector V and I know that V is

737
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:32,210
unit length right it's a unit length

738
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:36,949
vector then whatever the point is that

739
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:40,970
I'm trying to measure P if I take P if I

740
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:44,809
do the dot product of P dot V right that

741
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:47,350
actually gives me how far along V I

742
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:48,740
traveled to get to the place where

743
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:51,439
perpendicularly like a

744
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:54,679
right angle P would have been projected

745
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,720
onto it right and so what that really is

746
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:01,250
is that's a thing that generates

747
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,799
coordinates off of axes right if this

748
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,750
was the x-axis then I would be asking

749
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:09,199
what P's coordinate was on the x axis

750
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:11,090
right if this was the y axis I'd be

751
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,128
asking what its y-coordinate was right

752
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,720
and so we talked about this if you don't

753
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:16,039
remember that I highly recommend going

754
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,959
back and watching the dot product

755
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:20,719
episode the dot product is incredibly

756
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:25,070
important but that's you know that's

757
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:27,829
like how we measure things okay and axes

758
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:30,110
are the basis of that axes tend to have

759
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:33,739
when we use them in games they tend to

760
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:36,740
have two properties okay

761
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:42,138
the properties that they have are one

762
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:43,849
unit length right and the reason that

763
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,740
they have unit length is because that

764
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:47,569
allows you to use coordinates in a

765
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:51,109
logical fashion right you can basically

766
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:52,850
say okay I know that I can dot things

767
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:56,300
onto these axes and I'll get a

768
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:59,389
coordinate on it that is actually the

769
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,670
distance I would move you know in

770
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:03,858
whatever space I'm in it's the distance

771
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:06,050
I would move along this axis to get to

772
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:09,500
that perpendicular point right whereas

773
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:12,230
if the axis is scaled right so if the x

774
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,679
axis or you know or or oh sorry I should

775
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:18,920
say if this V was not unit length if it

776
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:22,190
was say length two right then P

777
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,680
transpose V remember length of P length

778
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,119
of V cosine of the angle between them

779
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:29,599
that's the formula for the dot product

780
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:33,079
right if this is scaled so this was two

781
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:36,108
or something then this value is note no

782
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:39,769
longer allows us to do our sort of

783
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:42,309
length of P times one cosine of theta

784
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:44,840
which is what produces this this

785
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:48,108
projection here right it produces this

786
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:51,470
value again cosine theta

787
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:53,000
there's our theta right so if this is an

788
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:56,959
extra value in here we're multiplying

789
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,789
that coordinate by the length of V which

790
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,420
we don't want to do it produces a result

791
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:05,610
that's not very usable for us right

792
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:09,730
so unit length density 1 and orthogonal

793
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:14,010
or I should probably say well I'll say

794
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:14,010
orthogonal sometimes it's hard because

795
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:21,909
because that gets or overloaded with

796
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:24,489
orthonormal which kind of wraps in the

797
00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:25,960
unit length part of things but what our

798
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:27,549
thuggin all means in this case what I'm

799
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,970
trying to convey with it is the fact

800
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:33,910
that the basis vectors tend to be at

801
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:35,349
right angles to each other right and the

802
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:37,960
reason that they tend to be at right

803
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:40,869
angles to each other is because of a

804
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,090
property called linear independence and

805
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:44,859
this goes way back this goes so far back

806
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:47,760
in my math education when I was reading

807
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:52,150
like introduction to linear algebra

808
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:56,380
indeed my handwriting so bad I can't

809
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:59,410
tell where in the word word I stopped so

810
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,269
this is something that pseudonym 73 will

811
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:04,750
hopefully clean up for anyone in the

812
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:08,130
chat or maybe on the forums or some

813
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:10,420
other person who does math for a living

814
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:12,309
because like I said it's way back in my

815
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:16,780
math education but basically what linear

816
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:20,289
independence means it for the purposes

817
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:22,870
of our discussion is that when we are

818
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:24,070
talking about coordinate systems the

819
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:25,539
reason we like them to be at right

820
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:29,950
angles to each other is because the

821
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:34,300
coordinates along those axes axes do not

822
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:35,619
interfere with each other right so if

823
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,710
you think about it let's say I've got

824
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,659
two axis systems one looks like this

825
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:44,349
with a right angle between them right

826
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:46,420
here's my X here's my Y okay but then I

827
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:48,309
introduced two other axis systems and

828
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,680
they look like this they've got

829
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:54,730
something in here some theta and theta

830
00:37:50,679 --> 00:38:00,009
is not equal to 90 degrees it's it's

831
00:37:54,730 --> 00:38:03,460
some other angle right and so this will

832
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:06,160
call this like U and V or something now

833
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,050
when I look at these axis systems what

834
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:13,518
you will notice is that if I want to

835
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:18,169
locate a point you know in this

836
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:20,448
you know what now that I'm thinking

837
00:38:18,168 --> 00:38:23,449
about it this is really the wrong term I

838
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:26,778
should not have introduced that because

839
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:28,188
linear independence really it's really

840
00:38:26,778 --> 00:38:29,478
just orthogonality because the thing I'm

841
00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:31,009
about to describe has nothing to do with

842
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:32,358
linear independence linear independence

843
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:36,318
is a thing where you have matrices

844
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:37,668
whether or not they end up collapsing on

845
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:39,528
each other so you know what forget I

846
00:38:37,668 --> 00:38:40,458
even said that if you do want if you

847
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:43,309
want to know what that is

848
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:45,168
do a student I'm 73 to explain it on the

849
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:47,959
forums because I just realized I don't

850
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:48,228
really even need to talk about that so

851
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,548
yeah

852
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:51,468
let's pretend I never said that for now

853
00:38:49,548 --> 00:38:54,079
that'll come up some other time maybe

854
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:55,429
maybe later I'm really just really only

855
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,499
talking about our thought analogy here

856
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:59,449
and linear independence really isn't an

857
00:38:57,498 --> 00:39:00,379
issue because these would still these

858
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:03,139
would still create a linearly

859
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,309
independent basis if you wanted to if

860
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:07,038
you made a matrix out of them I'm pretty

861
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:10,009
sure but anyway so ignore all that my

862
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:12,019
bad again sometimes my explanations not

863
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:12,438
fabulous let's get back to the important

864
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:14,418
part

865
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:18,618
so if I want to locate a point here

866
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:21,199
right point P versus a point here what

867
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:25,999
you can see about these two systems is

868
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:29,389
essentially that when I map this P

869
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:31,428
coordinate on to these two coordinate in

870
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:35,749
onto these two axes you'll note that

871
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:38,630
motion along the y axis does not change

872
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:42,498
the motion along the x axis at all right

873
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:45,499
so if I want to find P I can literally

874
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:47,538
can I can consider the two the locations

875
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:50,298
of it on the two axes completely

876
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:52,459
independently of each other right I do

877
00:39:50,298 --> 00:39:53,630
not need to know where it is on one axis

878
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:55,998
to think about where it is on the other

879
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,409
so basically I can do a dot product here

880
00:39:55,998 --> 00:39:59,718
and I can do a dot product here and I'm

881
00:39:57,409 --> 00:40:00,979
done those are the two coordinates that

882
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:02,208
I'm talking about and there's nothing

883
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:05,448
else that needs to happen but if you

884
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:08,688
think about what happens here it's quite

885
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:11,028
a bit different actually right if I

886
00:40:08,688 --> 00:40:14,058
wanted to find P here well I could

887
00:40:11,028 --> 00:40:16,759
easily see where it was along V right it

888
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:18,769
might be right there okay so that's

889
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:21,079
pretty easy and if I wanted to I could

890
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:23,118
also see where it was along U right

891
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:24,979
there it is right that's where it is

892
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,050
along U perpendicularly speaking right

893
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:30,649
but what you'll notice is when I

894
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:33,800
go up along this axis right when I go up

895
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:37,639
along the U axis I'm actually also

896
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,090
moving the point along V do you see what

897
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:40,009
I mean

898
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,809
because if I said that this was you know

899
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,460
let's say that this is five units up

900
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:45,159
right or something like that that's five

901
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:49,099
for some reason who knows why it just is

902
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:52,039
if I mean if I went five units up here I

903
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:55,460
don't just get five units higher in

904
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:58,039
space I also get five units along I also

905
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,380
get some amount of of that five units in

906
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,909
V and in fact I get the amount that's

907
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,400
proportional to that angle that's that

908
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:08,389
cosine again right so I actually move

909
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,210
cosine theta right times however much

910
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:14,589
that motion is in V I move that along

911
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:16,579
I'm sorry along you in V as well and

912
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,440
that just creates a much more

913
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:20,539
complicated scenario that you constantly

914
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,429
have to work think through right

915
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:24,139
whenever you're doing things whereas in

916
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:26,329
this one when they're orthogonal you end

917
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:28,279
up in a nice pure scenario where you can

918
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:29,509
always consider each axis completely

919
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,240
independently and you don't have to

920
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:35,780
worry about the interaction between the

921
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:38,929
two and so that's what the orthogonality

922
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,730
gives you that you want it just makes

923
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:42,949
life a lot simpler it's not that you

924
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:46,940
couldn't do things in this system

925
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:49,819
because each point can still be uniquely

926
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:52,490
located using this system right I can

927
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,559
still say oh well you know what if I

928
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:57,949
wanted to get here what I would do is

929
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:59,570
I'd first move up this far right along P

930
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:02,239
which is not the dot product of it on

931
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:05,269
you and then I would move this far along

932
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:08,269
V right you know I can still get there

933
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:11,900
just fine and it's still unique there is

934
00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:14,719
still no other way to produce P so it's

935
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,970
not like it creates some ambiguity about

936
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,939
what the coordinates are there's only

937
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:22,869
one set of coordinates still and that's

938
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:26,179
why I said this was the wrong term to

939
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:29,630
introduce right and in fact I could

940
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:31,099
probably I'll try to save maybe I'll

941
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,590
maybe I'm only making things work but

942
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:36,739
worse but I'll try to save pseudonym 73

943
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:39,320
from having an aneurysm here by just

944
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:40,449
briefly saying what this is or at least

945
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,980
what I think it is and so

946
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:43,239
then you know maybe this is only gonna

947
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,300
make it worse for him to try and

948
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:47,578
untangle it later but you know I'm a

949
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,619
game programmer I'm not a mathematician

950
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:52,660
but you can imagine coordinate systems

951
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:54,039
were even that wasn't true and that's

952
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:55,779
where the linear independence things

953
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:57,159
come comes in that I was sort of saying

954
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,570
I thought I was gonna have to introduce

955
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:01,539
but I realized to talk about thing I

956
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:03,550
want to talk about it really have to you

957
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:06,690
could imagine making coordinate systems

958
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:10,180
where there are multiple ways to

959
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:12,490
describe you know where a point actually

960
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:17,949
is so let's say I create a coordinate

961
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:22,358
system that looked like this so I have a

962
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:27,699
2d plane and I'm using U V you know and

963
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:31,358
s to say where a point is right and so

964
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:33,909
if I have a point here at some point you

965
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,440
will realize that because I have three

966
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:39,059
vectors and there's only really two

967
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,130
degrees of freedom in a plane right I

968
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:45,250
could get there via multiple pass I can

969
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:48,490
trade off between say the s and the V

970
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:50,469
how far I go on either one and still get

971
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:52,719
you know I could go this far up s and

972
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:54,689
then this far in you or I could go this

973
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:58,689
far in V and this far on you right

974
00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:01,389
because these basis vectors s U and V

975
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:04,809
they don't they are not linearly

976
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:05,980
independent they have they collapse I

977
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:09,279
put this

978
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,690
they do not uniquely span this

979
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,200
two-dimensional plane that I'm talking

980
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:14,650
about

981
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:16,719
they are redundant right and because of

982
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:19,180
that redundant it means that if I want

983
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:21,489
to talk about a point P I can't assign

984
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:23,889
it a single unique coordinate and say

985
00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:26,889
anyone who ever wants to talk about this

986
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:27,909
point in space given this basis has to

987
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:30,429
use this value

988
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:34,358
there's many values I could assign to it

989
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:36,009
there's infinitely many in fact right so

990
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:37,210
that would just be crazy and like I said

991
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,410
I don't really need to talk about that

992
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:40,990
for talking about why I need to but I'll

993
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:42,519
just briefly mention it and if you get

994
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:44,318
into more linear algebra right what

995
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:45,639
happens is you imagine matrices with

996
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:49,480
these things in them and it's whether or

997
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:50,739
not that matrix ends up having whether

998
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,909
it's you know singular and stuff like

999
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:53,259
this you could so this there's there's

1000
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:55,480
linear algebra afoot here

1001
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:58,510
right but getting back to just the more

1002
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,699
intuitive stuff you can see why these

1003
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:02,470
are important properties right for what

1004
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:04,210
we wanted to we want to have unit length

1005
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:05,919
we want to have them be orthogonal and

1006
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:08,590
you might grab a little bit from this

1007
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,010
and just say and we want them to be

1008
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:14,680
minimal right in some sense right we

1009
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:18,430
want them to uniquely span the space but

1010
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:21,669
no more so if we have a 2d plane we want

1011
00:45:18,429 --> 00:45:23,949
to basis basis right we want X and y we

1012
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,900
don't want some other basis jumping in

1013
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:28,179
here making things more confusing for us

1014
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,889
so we typically want you know the same

1015
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:31,509
as the number of dimensions we want the

1016
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:33,759
unit length we want them to be

1017
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:37,150
orthogonal to each other and the same

1018
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,670
thing happens in 3d when we extend it

1019
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:41,619
out here's our X right here's our Y

1020
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,659
here's our Z when we extend it out we

1021
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:46,480
want the exact same thing to be true we

1022
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:50,710
want all of these guys to be unit length

1023
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,559
right want them all to be unit length we

1024
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:54,880
want them all to be orthogonal so

1025
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:56,559
there's a right angle between each and

1026
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,769
every one of them and that goes for

1027
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,269
every single pair right and you can

1028
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:02,440
imagine writing this in terms of that

1029
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:04,599
dot product again because if you

1030
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,760
remember the dot product I spoke about

1031
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:09,549
this before cosine theta

1032
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,100
well if theta is 90 degrees right what's

1033
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:15,609
the cosine of 90 degrees right remember

1034
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:18,608
your circle here's the circle right this

1035
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:21,608
is this is our unit circle right and as

1036
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:22,750
we go around that unit circle cosine is

1037
00:46:21,608 --> 00:46:25,299
the x-coordinate sine is the

1038
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:27,309
y-coordinate right so here is 90 degrees

1039
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,230
right here's our 90 degrees right here

1040
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:34,449
when we're here what's our x-coordinate

1041
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:36,550
it's zero right so cosine of 90 is 0

1042
00:46:34,449 --> 00:46:37,750
which means that the dot product and if

1043
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:39,519
it's zero everything else goes away

1044
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:42,489
which means the dot product of any two

1045
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:45,608
vectors whose angle between them is 90

1046
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:49,149
degrees in space the dot product is zero

1047
00:46:45,608 --> 00:46:51,099
so we can define this cordas requirement

1048
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:53,500
for our coordinate systems similarly by

1049
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:55,480
seeing we also know not only do we know

1050
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,519
that all their lengths are one we also

1051
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:02,190
know that if you take any pair of them

1052
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:05,280
and you dot them together you will get

1053
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:08,700
nothing right

1054
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,980
and that's what we like to see right

1055
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:14,549
that's what we want to see so that's

1056
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:17,369
kind of how we define basis vectors okay

1057
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,960
now moving up from basis vectors a lot

1058
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,490
of times you know it depends how you

1059
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,289
want to describe a basis vector I

1060
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:25,108
actually use it then to start talking

1061
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:27,989
about any sort of coordinate system like

1062
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:29,789
that that I introduced which may be

1063
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:31,529
stretching the term basis a little bit

1064
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:35,250
thin but it's still I think probably

1065
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:37,200
technically correct because that's like

1066
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:39,358
what we would create for our actual

1067
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,579
screen coordinates or our actual world

1068
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:44,670
space coordinates would be would be

1069
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:47,460
obeying this but what we probably and

1070
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:49,380
and this part were probably never gonna

1071
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,980
change this is gonna be true all the

1072
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,539
time

1073
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,449
you're very rarely are we gonna do

1074
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:58,619
anything that messes with that but this

1075
00:47:54,449 --> 00:48:00,239
part right here we may change right and

1076
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,970
so that's where basis vectors get a

1077
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,108
little more interesting so when I let's

1078
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:05,250
talk about how to represent thing in

1079
00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:07,199
base vectors then we'll talk about that

1080
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:11,010
scale let's see how much time I got got

1081
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:13,949
seven minutes so what I want to say here

1082
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:15,750
is these basis vectors are ways in which

1083
00:48:13,949 --> 00:48:19,199
we can both measure things and encode

1084
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:21,929
things right so if I take a basis like

1085
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,689
the screen space basis right it's a way

1086
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:26,519
of encoding points so I'm encoding

1087
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:30,300
points by saying I'm going to record

1088
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:32,059
where they are right I'm going to record

1089
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,180
where they are by what they're

1090
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:39,539
measurement is along axes so if I want

1091
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:41,639
to record P I record P by saying what is

1092
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:43,139
its exposition what is its Y position

1093
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:44,909
right I want to know what its

1094
00:48:43,139 --> 00:48:48,539
measurement is and with that measurement

1095
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:51,049
I can reconstruct what it is but the

1096
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:56,070
interesting thing about that is that

1097
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:58,619
process right can be made more explicit

1098
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:01,559
and when you make that more explicit you

1099
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:03,780
can do more powerful things with bases

1100
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:06,630
so for example we are used to using

1101
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:09,660
these relatively directly we are used to

1102
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:11,550
singing oh okay we just have some

1103
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:13,679
function like you saw us with the pixels

1104
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:16,470
we do something like okay we've got

1105
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:19,169
pixels right and we look at the pixels

1106
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:22,909
that were at like Y times

1107
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:25,740
stride you know plus X equals some value

1108
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:27,779
right equals the color right you saw us

1109
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:28,798
doing a bunch of drawing things where we

1110
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,559
were doing this this is that we were

1111
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:34,889
drawing things implicit in that is this

1112
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:36,690
understanding that this layout this this

1113
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:39,029
grid of pixels that were outputting to

1114
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:41,460
the screen implicit in that is that

1115
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:43,680
we've just we moved by rows when Y

1116
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:46,170
changes and we move by columns when X

1117
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:48,058
changes that was just we just baked that

1118
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:51,690
in there and that's what x and y meant

1119
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:53,160
right but if we want to get to more

1120
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,900
powerful rendering what we want to be

1121
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:56,879
able to do is we want to be able to

1122
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,910
rotate things we want to be able to

1123
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,048
scale things right and so in order to do

1124
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:03,000
that we want to start thinking about

1125
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:06,000
this these bases more explicitly and

1126
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,068
thinking about screen space versus a

1127
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,849
sort of object space or world space all

1128
00:50:08,068 --> 00:50:14,608
these sorts of things more explicitly so

1129
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:16,829
we already have one of those right we

1130
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:19,909
already have one of them happening

1131
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:23,640
already and that is meters to pixels

1132
00:50:19,909 --> 00:50:27,149
right you saw this happen this is a

1133
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:30,058
basis change all right we baked that in

1134
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:32,849
but that's a basis change what we were

1135
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:33,900
saying literally the whole time we never

1136
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:35,099
mentioned it because we haven't really

1137
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,160
gotten to the point where we want to dig

1138
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:42,269
into it but now's the time what we were

1139
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:46,558
saying there was okay we have oh and you

1140
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:48,809
know what negate why those are the two

1141
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,829
things these are all basis changes

1142
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:57,298
that's what they are we were saying this

1143
00:50:52,829 --> 00:51:00,450
is what our world X and our world Y axes

1144
00:50:57,298 --> 00:51:03,809
are and we are describing points in

1145
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:05,639
world space right that is what we were

1146
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:09,150
doing maybe I should be a little more

1147
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:11,868
consistent there X world wide world

1148
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,869
right

1149
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:21,869
there we go ex-world oh wow that's not

1150
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:26,509
x/y world x world yeah a little bit

1151
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:31,019
better my handwriting is atrocious

1152
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:32,760
right that's what we're doing we're

1153
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:38,460
specifying these in world space we were

1154
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:42,750
saying that one unit along X or one unit

1155
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:45,449
along Y or something was a meter right I

1156
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:47,880
think it's what we said so these are in

1157
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:53,659
meters one unit is a meter that was its

1158
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:55,800
units this is our world space basis

1159
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:59,879
that's what it was and everything's

1160
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:02,190
described in it but when we render this

1161
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,450
is completely unrelated to how we were

1162
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:05,880
rendering right this is a totally

1163
00:52:03,449 --> 00:52:08,909
different basis what we did is we

1164
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:12,150
changed the basis we changed the basis

1165
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:13,139
to screen space and first of all I

1166
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:15,930
should draw that the other way because

1167
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:19,259
what we actually did was negate Y right

1168
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:21,239
so on our screen space basis you can

1169
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:23,010
actually think of Y as going down

1170
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:26,729
because that was what its direction was

1171
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:28,860
it was left handed right so here's our Y

1172
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:32,460
in screen space and here's our X in

1173
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:36,059
screen space right so we needed to

1174
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:39,840
change the basis of this thing if that

1175
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:47,159
makes sense and it's hard to say I

1176
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:49,200
should clarify a few things but I'll get

1177
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:51,869
to it when we get to it so when we

1178
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:54,480
wanted these when we wanted to actually

1179
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:58,049
draw things we did two things first of

1180
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,990
all one unit is now like is this is this

1181
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:03,150
high and it's a pixel right so that's

1182
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:06,269
one on these and they have different

1183
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:09,599
pixels ranked and so to go from this

1184
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:11,639
basis to this basis right we had to

1185
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,579
basically do these two operations we had

1186
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:19,679
to negate the direction that Y went

1187
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:23,099
always and we had to change the scale of

1188
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:25,929
our of our coordinates because they were

1189
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:27,730
much larger the core

1190
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:30,368
would become much larger when we went to

1191
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:33,278
pixels when we were going for meters and

1192
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:38,318
so what we were effectively doing is we

1193
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:40,900
were applying a scale right we were

1194
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:43,298
applying a scale to our bases we were we

1195
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:46,480
were scaling and the scaling that we

1196
00:53:43,298 --> 00:53:48,099
were using is we were using meters to

1197
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,710
pixels whatever that was

1198
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:55,000
we'll just call that I guess m4 now we

1199
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:58,659
were using the scale M on the x axis and

1200
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,088
negative M on the y axis right because

1201
00:53:58,659 --> 00:54:03,578
we were flipping that y-coordinate right

1202
00:54:01,088 --> 00:54:05,588
it was flipping it around because that's

1203
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:06,880
just how we wanted our stuff to go we

1204
00:54:05,588 --> 00:54:09,900
wanted it so that if it was moving

1205
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:14,230
upwards in sort of the notion of space

1206
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:16,568
upwards here goes down the y axis it

1207
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:20,409
gets less whereas upwards here it gets

1208
00:54:16,568 --> 00:54:24,210
greater right and so you can think about

1209
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:29,108
this as taking those coordinates right

1210
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:30,369
in fact I can sort of let me take a few

1211
00:54:29,108 --> 00:54:33,009
more minutes here and just show you one

1212
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:36,548
more thing because this is something we

1213
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:38,710
probably want to pick up on tomorrow but

1214
00:54:36,548 --> 00:54:41,858
if you take a look at this right what

1215
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:44,019
happens here is how would we have known

1216
00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:46,328
like how could we describe what we were

1217
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:48,099
doing we did it by intuition we negated

1218
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:50,500
Y because we needed things to go the

1219
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:52,359
right direction in screen space and we

1220
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,858
had meters to pixels cuz we knew that's

1221
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:55,750
how big we wanted stuff to be but how

1222
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:59,440
would we actually talk about what really

1223
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:02,409
happened there right and the answer is

1224
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,389
you can actually do what I was saying

1225
00:55:02,409 --> 00:55:08,588
before in terms of measuring things I

1226
00:55:04,389 --> 00:55:11,469
can actually measure this basis in this

1227
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:13,778
space right if I want to right that's

1228
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:17,169
something that I could do and I can also

1229
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:18,849
measure this basis in this space right I

1230
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:23,068
can I can figure out where these things

1231
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:25,960
were right and so that is almost exactly

1232
00:55:23,068 --> 00:55:28,989
that's really exactly what we were sort

1233
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:32,079
of doing you'd have to think about a

1234
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:35,469
good way to say this let's pretend we

1235
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:37,900
had some third universal basis right

1236
00:55:35,469 --> 00:55:39,230
there's some third universal basis

1237
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,119
that's magical

1238
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:43,909
we don't know exactly what it is right

1239
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:47,929
but we have some some universal basis

1240
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:51,859
the magical God basis right so this is X

1241
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:55,190
Universal and this is y Universal okay

1242
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:57,980
and we imagine that we have both of

1243
00:55:55,190 --> 00:56:01,550
these bases described in the same space

1244
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:05,150
right well what would it look like

1245
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:08,830
well our pixel basis right would be here

1246
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:11,180
let's say right here's our pixel basis

1247
00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:14,659
let's just we're just making this up

1248
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:16,309
here's our pixel basis right so this is

1249
00:56:14,659 --> 00:56:18,199
going to be what did we call it do we

1250
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:21,650
call it screen yeah as we call it so

1251
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:26,089
here's our screen x-axis and here's our

1252
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:28,039
screen y-axis right and you know if I

1253
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:31,579
wanted to pick the unit on them let's

1254
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:33,800
say it's there right so that's one along

1255
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:35,090
those axes in fact I could just draw

1256
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,950
them that way to begin with that's

1257
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:39,410
probably the easier thing to do let's

1258
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:41,929
just draw it so that it's unit length so

1259
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:44,509
that's that's one unit in that direction

1260
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:47,149
right so there's X screen there's y

1261
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:49,370
screen so that's my that's my screen

1262
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:51,559
space basis now I've got this other

1263
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:53,719
basis right that's meter that this is

1264
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,509
the sort of world space and world space

1265
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:57,799
is not only totally different size it's

1266
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,790
also somewhere else entirely and the

1267
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,789
y-axis goes in a different direction

1268
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:05,349
right all of that stuff is true so I've

1269
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:05,349
got something that looks like this

1270
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,910
there's my world space basis here's my x

1271
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:15,140
world space here's my Y world space

1272
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:16,759
right so these are my two bases this is

1273
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:18,710
what I'm drawing to the screen how I'm

1274
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,420
figuring out where the pixels are this

1275
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:22,940
is my world space and this is just some

1276
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:25,579
synthetic axis that's some universal in

1277
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:28,690
which they are both it which it is

1278
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:34,190
possible to represent both of them right

1279
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:38,420
so if I now want to ask the question how

1280
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:41,929
do I move a point from world space into

1281
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:46,970
screen space right how do I know what

1282
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:50,509
this value is in this basis right I can

1283
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:52,299
actually do that somewhat directly right

1284
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:54,790
I can actually say

1285
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:58,330
what I want to have happen there what I

1286
00:57:54,789 --> 00:58:00,519
first would do is I would transform it

1287
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:03,340
into this other space this universal

1288
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:06,460
space right I would first say okay I

1289
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,860
know where the origin of my world space

1290
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,619
is in this space right it's going to be

1291
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,090
you know the world space point the world

1292
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:15,039
space origin I don't know what you want

1293
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:19,840
to call this world space origin origin

1294
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:22,150
of the world in you right I know I start

1295
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:25,090
there I know I go whatever the

1296
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:28,360
coordinates of this point are but why do

1297
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:29,200
I keep mixing up my x and y axes that's

1298
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:33,010
crazy

1299
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:37,589
I really really want to call those X and

1300
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:37,590
I do not know why pun intended

1301
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:48,519
guess it's just that kind of sleepy day

1302
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:52,509
alright so here's my Y axis y axis x

1303
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:55,500
axis x axis try it again okay

1304
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:59,140
sorry back to the back to the point I

1305
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,369
can imagine starting here going as far

1306
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:02,469
as its coordinate tell because remember

1307
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:04,690
this has a coordinate right a B or

1308
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:07,119
whatever right so I would just go a

1309
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,400
along this axis and then I would go B

1310
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:13,690
along this axis and I'd beat it right

1311
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:15,070
and now I would want to know well where

1312
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:17,679
is it

1313
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:19,390
you know where is it in this coordinate

1314
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,879
system so then what I want to do is

1315
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:23,440
measure where it is in this one right so

1316
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,059
the first step that I would do if this

1317
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,400
was a and B this really that's let's say

1318
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:30,039
that's really what that was right the

1319
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:35,050
full equation is I started oh W in this

1320
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:38,920
space right I then add a times whatever

1321
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:41,170
that that x axis is plus B times

1322
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:44,260
whatever that Y axis is for the

1323
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:47,829
worldspace basis and now I am at PW

1324
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:50,860
that's where I am in this space in the U

1325
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:54,069
space this is the universal in fact I

1326
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:57,490
should say P Universal right in the

1327
00:59:54,070 --> 01:00:00,100
universal space that's where I am now if

1328
00:59:57,489 --> 01:00:02,769
I want to measure that right I can just

1329
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:04,420
say well I know how to figure out where

1330
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:06,880
it is on one of these axis it's just a

1331
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:08,860
dot product right that's all that is so

1332
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,890
if I want to figure out what P is in s

1333
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:13,180
face I could start by measuring it along

1334
01:00:11,889 --> 01:00:16,179
these I could do that with dot product

1335
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:18,579
but this is at a different place it's

1336
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,659
not coincident the the origin of that

1337
01:00:18,579 --> 01:00:21,670
coordinate system right is not in the

1338
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:23,799
same place so the first thing I have to

1339
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:26,289
do is make it relative to this

1340
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,870
coordinate and I do that by subtracting

1341
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:31,509
wherever this guy is again in that new

1342
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:34,179
space right so what I would say is okay

1343
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:37,240
I've got that screen space origin right

1344
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:39,489
origin screen space what I do first is

1345
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:44,859
I'd subtract that right so I'd say okay

1346
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:48,069
P of U minus that origin that is the the

1347
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:50,829
sort of the the local version of that PW

1348
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:54,760
but now I also need to know you know

1349
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:57,309
what its measurement would be along the

1350
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,560
these axes right and I could do that by

1351
01:00:57,309 --> 01:01:03,130
taking that that dot product right I can

1352
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:05,349
just say okay you know I need to I need

1353
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:09,700
to figure out where they are along this

1354
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:11,230
I'm way too over time here yeah uh what

1355
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:13,359
should I do

1356
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:18,909
kind of want to get to wanted to get to

1357
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:20,320
the end of this well I'll give you a

1358
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:22,389
little preview of what we're gonna do

1359
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,830
and then we'll pick up on this diagram

1360
01:01:22,389 --> 01:01:25,210
tomorrow and then we'll go implement it

1361
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:28,150
in the render let's say that's what

1362
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:30,010
we're going to do so all right pretend I

1363
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:34,690
didn't quite right this math yet we'll

1364
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:38,170
write this math tomorrow and we will go

1365
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:39,730
and implement it in the renderer what I

1366
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:41,260
was going to say simply was just wait we

1367
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,849
need to measure it and then we will

1368
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:46,570
figure out where it is in this other

1369
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:49,389
space once we have done that we will be

1370
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:52,030
able to see that you really don't

1371
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:54,279
actually ever need this external

1372
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:57,970
coordinate system you just need the

1373
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:59,920
relationship between these it just the

1374
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:04,869
the math boils down to the relationship

1375
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:08,050
between the axes and their origins so we

1376
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:10,989
end up just doing the relative

1377
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:13,930
Corrections to move things one is we

1378
01:02:10,989 --> 01:02:15,699
translate the origin right so we add to

1379
01:02:13,929 --> 01:02:17,949
the point whatever the difference in

1380
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:18,939
origin is right or rather weeks a recent

1381
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:21,909
track depending how you wanna think of

1382
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:23,829
it and then we change the scale like we

1383
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:26,469
had to to account for the difference in

1384
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:28,119
axis sizes and then we have one more

1385
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:30,309
thing to do which we haven't actually

1386
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:32,049
done yet because we haven't supported it

1387
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:34,059
at all which is rotation because these

1388
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:36,789
axes could be anywhere right and that's

1389
01:02:34,059 --> 01:02:38,920
that dot product piece and the same

1390
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:40,119
would would be true here right so what

1391
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:42,789
we'll see is we'll see that collapse

1392
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:44,829
down and we'll see that really what we

1393
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:47,860
were doing with negate Y meters to

1394
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:50,079
pixels right is just this operation so

1395
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:54,370
if we want to we can introduce a more

1396
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:57,279
Powell for more powerful version of that

1397
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:59,019
that supports the rotation and arbitrary

1398
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,910
of scaling that we're gonna want for the

1399
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:02,679
render but I think if I went now I'd be

1400
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:06,699
totally out of time so maybe we'll pick

1401
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:07,809
up here tomorrow so that we can we can

1402
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,549
actually have plenty of time to the

1403
01:03:07,809 --> 01:03:21,329
that's it all right so I will go to the

1404
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:24,400
Q&amp;A for now all right

1405
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:26,460
so is that relatively what's that was

1406
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:30,490
that beginning to make sense if I it had

1407
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:32,260
another let's say 20 minutes to go

1408
01:03:30,489 --> 01:03:34,839
through did you kind of see where I was

1409
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:37,890
going even though we kind of got cut off

1410
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,890
before I could get there

1411
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:45,070
mr. fourth-dimension would you represent

1412
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:48,489
the origin of coordinate systems in a

1413
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:49,809
universal coordinate system so yes so so

1414
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:51,519
basically what I was you you don't

1415
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:52,779
actually have to ever represent it in a

1416
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:54,369
universal scoring system you just have

1417
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:56,519
to kind of introduce that so that you

1418
01:03:54,369 --> 01:04:01,059
can think about them being in some space

1419
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:02,800
but what we actually do in in the game

1420
01:04:01,059 --> 01:04:04,570
is we don't ever actually need that

1421
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,920
Universal coordinate system because what

1422
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:09,880
we think about is we just think about

1423
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:11,559
where the camera is relative to the to

1424
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,090
the origin of the world so what we

1425
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:14,949
typically do in the game right and

1426
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:19,030
you've seen me do this a bunch is we

1427
01:04:14,949 --> 01:04:22,119
have some world space right so here's

1428
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:24,310
our world space right and there is a

1429
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:25,599
zero zero there's a zero zero in world

1430
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:28,090
space it's like where we started making

1431
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:31,110
like that first room right like here's

1432
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:33,100
the first room you know that we made I

1433
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:35,170
think that's how it lines up I don't

1434
01:04:33,099 --> 01:04:36,460
remember exactly where the actual world

1435
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:39,039
space is but you know there's the world

1436
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:41,260
space right and what we do is we say

1437
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,320
well there's a camera and the camera is

1438
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:47,110
here and the screen is there right and

1439
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:50,070
the screen is its own space its origin

1440
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:55,180
is actually up here right like that and

1441
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:58,090
we never really explicitly form any kind

1442
01:04:55,179 --> 01:04:59,829
of a notion of some universal coordinate

1443
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:01,870
system for these two things right we

1444
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,759
never really think of it that way all we

1445
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:05,739
do is just go oh well we know that if

1446
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,710
the cameras here and here's where that

1447
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:11,409
corner is then to translate from world

1448
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:12,639
space we have to just move things so

1449
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:16,149
that they're relative to that so we

1450
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:17,949
subtract this point from everything to

1451
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:21,318
put everything as if world space

1452
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:24,018
coincided with the screen right so the

1453
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:27,108
is just like an ocean to help you put

1454
01:05:24,018 --> 01:05:30,139
them somewhere but you never actually

1455
01:05:27,108 --> 01:05:33,949
need it right it's not required for

1456
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:35,808
anything it's just a thought experiment

1457
01:05:33,949 --> 01:05:38,778
the other way you could think of it is

1458
01:05:35,809 --> 01:05:41,359
just always pick one to use so always

1459
01:05:38,778 --> 01:05:42,498
use world space and then just think

1460
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:44,958
about these other things that's being

1461
01:05:42,498 --> 01:05:46,608
represented directly in world space so

1462
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:47,748
I'm just gonna say that the screen is

1463
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:49,278
here in world space and that's sort of

1464
01:05:47,748 --> 01:05:50,328
how we do it by intuition when we were

1465
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,068
writing it that's sort of what we were

1466
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:54,559
thinking of right here's where the

1467
01:05:52,068 --> 01:05:56,869
camera is in world space right and

1468
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,789
that's fine because we only need at the

1469
01:05:56,869 --> 01:06:00,349
end of the day like I said it all boils

1470
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:02,329
down to just a relative thing anyway

1471
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:04,999
after you plug through this it's all

1472
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:07,699
relative so it doesn't you don't really

1473
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:09,618
care who's represented in what space as

1474
01:06:07,699 --> 01:06:12,190
long as you can get from one to the

1475
01:06:09,619 --> 01:06:12,190
other you're fine

1476
01:06:15,608 --> 01:06:21,199
why oh actually probably there's a

1477
01:06:20,088 --> 01:06:27,498
couple questions that I want to answer

1478
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:29,028
that one but a few Stream ago you said

1479
01:06:27,498 --> 01:06:31,818
you preferred to call functions through

1480
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:34,579
a macro and then forgot to explain why

1481
01:06:31,818 --> 01:06:36,759
oh well we haven't gotten there yet I

1482
01:06:34,579 --> 01:06:38,449
know which one you're thinking of I

1483
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:46,639
think I know which one you're thinking

1484
01:06:38,449 --> 01:06:50,588
of are you thinking of this one that age

1485
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:52,818
which size are you thinking of this guy

1486
01:06:50,588 --> 01:06:54,920
it's not that I didn't forget to explain

1487
01:06:52,818 --> 01:07:00,108
why it's that I I was intentionally

1488
01:06:54,920 --> 01:07:03,818
saying wait till later it's coming it's

1489
01:07:00,108 --> 01:07:03,818
good that way it will happen eventually

1490
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:11,220
why is the familiar moving left to right

1491
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:13,769
or did I miss something I think that's

1492
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:14,879
probably just bugs in our like we will

1493
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:16,500
clean that up in the render I think

1494
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,119
that's just a bug in that that stupid zi

1495
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,250
fudge thing I act in there that was just

1496
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:23,309
we were playing around I suspect that's

1497
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:25,409
probably just a messed up thing in our

1498
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:27,150
in our zi fudge so as we're doing the

1499
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:34,679
renderer I think that will get cleaned

1500
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:36,360
up why our computer coordinates upside

1501
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:39,569
down

1502
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:41,190
I believe I mean I guess I don't want to

1503
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:43,710
say that I know definitively why they're

1504
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:45,510
upside down but I mean here's why I

1505
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:49,740
always think of them as why I think

1506
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:52,800
they're upside down it's because you

1507
01:07:49,739 --> 01:08:00,229
know in the old days the way that things

1508
01:07:52,800 --> 01:08:00,230
worked was you had a cathode ray tube

1509
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:09,449
and the cathode ray tube is basically

1510
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,519
it's got like this vo this is before

1511
01:08:09,449 --> 01:08:14,069
LCDs right you don't see these around

1512
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:15,690
anymore almost no one makes them but old

1513
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:20,090
arcade cabinets would have them in there

1514
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:24,840
for example so here's your TV set right

1515
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:32,630
yeah that you're watching right here's

1516
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:32,630
like the dude drooling with big eyeballs

1517
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:47,469
sitting on some kind of a chair right he

1518
01:08:45,219 --> 01:08:49,658
is watching the television now

1519
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:51,939
the cathode ray tube the way that that

1520
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:54,818
works is there's like this screen right

1521
01:08:51,939 --> 01:08:57,669
this glass screen and it's coated with

1522
01:08:54,819 --> 01:09:01,869
phosphorous right so basically there's

1523
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:03,338
like these this this sort of glass this

1524
01:09:01,868 --> 01:09:04,899
this piece of glass that's coated with

1525
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:08,798
phosphorous and what the phosphorous is

1526
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:11,198
is its little RG and be like phosphorus

1527
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:12,729
coatings that when they are hit when

1528
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:15,759
they are excited when they when they get

1529
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:17,759
hit by you know when they're basically

1530
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:20,859
given some sort of electromagnetic

1531
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:24,130
charge there they give off call you know

1532
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:26,259
color there's an r1 on g1 and a b1 and

1533
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:28,359
so this cathode ray tube what it does is

1534
01:09:26,259 --> 01:09:29,380
it's it's basically I don't even really

1535
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:30,609
know how they work I believe it's

1536
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:32,409
magnetic

1537
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:35,679
basically what it can do is it can kind

1538
01:09:32,408 --> 01:09:37,289
of shoot that beam of energy at one of

1539
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,940
these at a time but it's just a beam and

1540
01:09:37,289 --> 01:09:41,859
so what it would do is it would shoot it

1541
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:44,858
and it would just scan it would go

1542
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:47,319
across right and and so the magnets

1543
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:49,329
would just be set to like to aim this

1544
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:51,940
thing across almost like you know like a

1545
01:09:49,329 --> 01:09:54,488
sprinkler system or a laser Floyd or

1546
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:55,599
something it would scan across lighting

1547
01:09:54,488 --> 01:09:58,839
up the phosphorous and they would

1548
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,820
modulate the intensity of that beam to

1549
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:03,850
change how bright each of the things was

1550
01:10:00,819 --> 01:10:05,079
on the screen right and really I

1551
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:06,219
shouldn't have introduced RGB yet

1552
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:07,389
because in the old days it was actually

1553
01:10:06,219 --> 01:10:08,679
black and white so really there just be

1554
01:10:07,389 --> 01:10:12,159
just some phosphorous but they

1555
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:14,020
eventually did our GMP it would then

1556
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:17,679
when it got to the end it would it would

1557
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:19,540
trace back and come here right and it

1558
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,340
wouldn't actually shoot any energy in

1559
01:10:19,539 --> 01:10:22,658
that phase because I didn't want to

1560
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,860
lighten up anything there and then it

1561
01:10:22,658 --> 01:10:27,849
would start again lighting up the next

1562
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:32,729
row and for reasons that I do not know

1563
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:36,310
you would have to ask an old TV

1564
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:38,169
engineering kind of guy they always

1565
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:40,389
started in the upper left scan to the

1566
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:42,130
right jumped back and then started in

1567
01:10:40,389 --> 01:10:45,979
the left again and scan to the right and

1568
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:50,630
down right and that's how it worked

1569
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:52,489
so when computer graphics came along it

1570
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:56,239
was not connecting to an LCD it was

1571
01:10:52,488 --> 01:10:58,428
connecting to one of these right so what

1572
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:03,049
you had to do was you had to drive the

1573
01:10:58,429 --> 01:11:05,300
signal of what intensity you wanted to

1574
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:09,380
send out the cathode ray tube for each

1575
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:11,599
point now the easiest way to do that is

1576
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:14,748
to just have memory in the computer

1577
01:11:11,599 --> 01:11:17,208
right the memory in the computer says

1578
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:20,630
what the intensity should be what that

1579
01:11:17,208 --> 01:11:25,399
means is the memory right is getting

1580
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:27,349
read out in that order as you go so the

1581
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:30,348
easiest thing to do was just to say like

1582
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:32,779
oh okay I'm pointing the first value in

1583
01:11:30,349 --> 01:11:35,900
this memory is going to be that first

1584
01:11:32,779 --> 01:11:37,819
pixel right so it just kind of is

1585
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:39,679
natural to say well okay in that case

1586
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:41,448
what we the way we store things is we

1587
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:43,699
store this pixel first then this pixel

1588
01:11:41,448 --> 01:11:45,138
second this pixel third right and we get

1589
01:11:43,698 --> 01:11:47,328
to the end we star the next one which

1590
01:11:45,139 --> 01:11:50,719
means that if I was talking about a

1591
01:11:47,328 --> 01:11:53,958
pointer to that thing Y will always be

1592
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:56,748
talking about going up to as I go up in

1593
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:59,389
Y I'm going down where it would be on

1594
01:11:56,748 --> 01:12:04,429
the screen right and as I go up in X I'm

1595
01:11:59,389 --> 01:12:09,349
going you know from left to right and so

1596
01:12:04,429 --> 01:12:12,920
you know I feel like and I can't say for

1597
01:12:09,349 --> 01:12:16,279
sure but I feel like really that's why

1598
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:17,989
it started that way if CRTs had gone the

1599
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:21,679
other direction I feel like we would

1600
01:12:17,988 --> 01:12:25,848
have had that that wouldn't have been

1601
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:27,408
the notion right so I don't know that's

1602
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:30,010
just my desk I don't know if you're sure

1603
01:12:27,408 --> 01:12:30,009
but that's my guess

1604
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:35,640
how important is it to know how to make

1605
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:38,559
a game engine versus simply using one

1606
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:40,660
and if you were used to use DirectX

1607
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,870
libraries how much would the code differ

1608
01:12:40,659 --> 01:12:46,599
uh well DirectX is really more of a

1609
01:12:43,869 --> 01:12:48,369
hardware interface kind of a thing so

1610
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,710
the code for our stuff wouldn't differ

1611
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:52,059
much at all the only thing is that we're

1612
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:54,069
doing we're doing a little bit software

1613
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:55,510
rendering stuff that'd be the only part

1614
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:58,359
that that wouldn't be there but you'll

1615
01:12:55,510 --> 01:13:00,820
see me use like OpenGL or something

1616
01:12:58,359 --> 01:13:01,809
later on I'll show be showing how to do

1617
01:13:00,819 --> 01:13:03,759
that and then you'll be able to you'll

1618
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:05,140
be able to see exactly that difference

1619
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,210
you'll be able to see the difference

1620
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:08,680
between the OpenGL path and the software

1621
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:10,630
rendering path you'll be able to look at

1622
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,760
those directly so we'll be covering that

1623
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:14,319
but in terms of how important it is to

1624
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:16,570
know how to make a game engine versus

1625
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:18,309
simply using one the answer is it

1626
01:13:16,569 --> 01:13:22,859
depends how much you how much you care

1627
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:25,210
about quality be how much you care about

1628
01:13:22,859 --> 01:13:29,710
differentiation and see how much you

1629
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:32,590
care about exploring new things right so

1630
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:35,350
let's start with quality one I think

1631
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:39,579
that people who don't know how to build

1632
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:42,160
a game engine when they go to use a game

1633
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:45,579
engine often produce lower quality

1634
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:48,519
results and the reason for that is

1635
01:13:45,579 --> 01:13:50,170
because they don't know everything

1636
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,660
that's going on and they don't super

1637
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:55,090
understand how the game engine works so

1638
01:13:52,659 --> 01:13:57,220
they aren't able to drive the quality

1639
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:58,960
level to where it should be when they

1640
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,980
use an engine because they really just

1641
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,539
don't have the depth of understanding

1642
01:13:59,979 --> 01:14:04,059
about the engines doing to be able to

1643
01:14:01,539 --> 01:14:06,100
handle situations that they want to be

1644
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,630
able to handle properly and I see this a

1645
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,620
lot in games when I'll play them you

1646
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:09,970
know like I'll play a game that was

1647
01:14:08,619 --> 01:14:11,409
written in unity or something and

1648
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:13,900
there's a bunch of stuff that's busted

1649
01:14:11,409 --> 01:14:16,329
and I know that it isn't unity that's

1650
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:18,069
busted I mean you could argue whether

1651
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:20,409
it's unity is busted or not but I know

1652
01:14:18,069 --> 01:14:22,029
that I could have gone and fixed unity

1653
01:14:20,409 --> 01:14:24,819
that that problem in unity let's say

1654
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:26,199
because it wasn't a thing that unity

1655
01:14:24,819 --> 01:14:27,519
forced you to do it was just how they

1656
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:29,349
were choosing hues it but they didn't

1657
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,240
know any better right because they

1658
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:32,680
didn't understand how unity works at a

1659
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:33,789
deeper level and they didn't understand

1660
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:37,060
what they would have to do to fix the

1661
01:14:33,789 --> 01:14:40,149
problem right and so I feel like if you

1662
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:42,550
care about quality as a game developer

1663
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:43,359
you really kind of have to know a lot

1664
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,400
about how

1665
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,689
work because you're never going to

1666
01:14:45,399 --> 01:14:49,359
actually be able to get high-quality

1667
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:52,509
results out of an engine without knowing

1668
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:54,939
a lot of that stuff and some people

1669
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:56,440
disagree with that and oftentimes the

1670
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:59,559
games that they point to I think are

1671
01:14:56,439 --> 01:15:01,599
local um in a number of areas that

1672
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:04,330
doesn't mean the games bad the game

1673
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,679
might be fantastic in fact there you

1674
01:15:04,329 --> 01:15:07,329
know are games that are absolutely

1675
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:09,760
fantastic that are written in like you

1676
01:15:07,329 --> 01:15:12,039
know flash or whatever with very little

1677
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,829
knowledge of how things work the game

1678
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:17,079
might be great but there's tons of stuff

1679
01:15:14,829 --> 01:15:19,658
that was low quality in there simply

1680
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:21,908
because it couldn't go to that level so

1681
01:15:19,658 --> 01:15:25,118
quality and how good a game is aren't

1682
01:15:21,908 --> 01:15:27,750
related it's sort of like saying you

1683
01:15:25,118 --> 01:15:31,420
know how do you like this TV show and

1684
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:33,658
talking about whether it was in whether

1685
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:37,300
the camera work was really good right

1686
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:40,420
there's quality there's lots of quality

1687
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:42,070
axes and some of them have nothing to do

1688
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:44,139
with how much you know about engines

1689
01:15:42,069 --> 01:15:47,859
line but some of them have a lot to do

1690
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:49,840
with it right and so I feel like if you

1691
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:52,089
care about quality a lot and you want to

1692
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,250
know you want to be sure that you can

1693
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:56,050
always do whatever you need to do to

1694
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:58,439
make sure that your game whatever it is

1695
01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:00,880
doesn't have any of those rough spots

1696
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:02,529
because you can go in and fix them and

1697
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,230
do what you need to do I think that's

1698
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:07,389
one of really compelling reason to know

1699
01:16:05,229 --> 01:16:09,279
engine stuff it doesn't mean you

1700
01:16:07,389 --> 01:16:10,989
shouldn't use an engine it may be that

1701
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:12,399
it's a very good decision to go use an

1702
01:16:10,988 --> 01:16:14,198
engine you should use unity you should

1703
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:16,539
use Unreal 4 or whatever like that may

1704
01:16:14,198 --> 01:16:18,309
be true for the game that you're making

1705
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:19,479
you might really want to use them

1706
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:21,310
because it'll save you a ton of time and

1707
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:24,250
it does the things you need to do but

1708
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:26,710
you want to still know how it worked you

1709
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:28,810
want to be able to modify it well you

1710
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:30,310
want to be able to understand why it is

1711
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:32,170
breaking when it is breaking or why it

1712
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:34,630
is slow when it is slow and fix it

1713
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:36,639
that's really important for achieving a

1714
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:38,440
high quality result in games and so

1715
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:40,000
that's the first thing and you have to

1716
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:41,829
decide how important that is to you you

1717
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,689
may not care about that you may be like

1718
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:45,609
low quality is fine I'm all about this

1719
01:16:43,689 --> 01:16:47,109
other aspects of game design and I don't

1720
01:16:45,609 --> 01:16:49,359
care about the quality if it if it looks

1721
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:51,399
lousy or if it's slow or stuttery or

1722
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:52,809
there's a loading screen that's 30

1723
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:54,759
minutes long I don't care about that

1724
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:57,130
it's not what I'm about that's cool too

1725
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,539
but I'm just pointing it out that if you

1726
01:16:57,130 --> 01:17:00,730
about those things and you want to do

1727
01:16:58,539 --> 01:17:02,738
all those things efficiently engines are

1728
01:17:00,729 --> 01:17:04,869
not firemen forget these days

1729
01:17:02,738 --> 01:17:07,658
unfortunately there's actually just a

1730
01:17:04,869 --> 01:17:09,069
lot of stuff you have to know to be able

1731
01:17:07,658 --> 01:17:11,888
to use them effectively there they're a

1732
01:17:09,069 --> 01:17:13,389
complicated tool that requires a lot of

1733
01:17:11,889 --> 01:17:14,920
knowledge to use effectively and so

1734
01:17:13,389 --> 01:17:20,050
understanding how an engine works is

1735
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:23,800
part of gaining that knowledge okay so

1736
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:26,170
think to again sort of depending on

1737
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:28,690
different differentiation so if you know

1738
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:31,569
how to write a game engine even if you

1739
01:17:28,689 --> 01:17:33,460
choose to use an engine because you can

1740
01:17:31,569 --> 01:17:34,899
write one you have the ability to mod

1741
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:37,539
that engine to do things nobody else can

1742
01:17:34,899 --> 01:17:38,559
do right or rather no other person who

1743
01:17:37,539 --> 01:17:41,109
doesn't know how to make a game engine

1744
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:43,239
could do so it's very easy to

1745
01:17:41,109 --> 01:17:45,908
differentiate yourself in your game if

1746
01:17:43,238 --> 01:17:47,349
you have those skills because you can do

1747
01:17:45,908 --> 01:17:48,879
things that other people who all they

1748
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:50,500
can do you know all they know how to do

1749
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,630
is like click check boxes or whatever

1750
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:55,929
could never do right they're never gonna

1751
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:58,239
be able to do a bunch of things that you

1752
01:17:55,929 --> 01:18:00,069
can do if you knew how an engine worked

1753
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:01,479
right that's pretty straightforward

1754
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:03,340
self-explanatory so if you don't care

1755
01:18:01,479 --> 01:18:04,658
about that if you're like no I just make

1756
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:06,190
games where you come just walk around a

1757
01:18:04,658 --> 01:18:09,369
3d space and that's what you know unreal

1758
01:18:06,189 --> 01:18:10,928
and unity do so we're good then you know

1759
01:18:09,369 --> 01:18:12,309
you're probably fine but if you have

1760
01:18:10,929 --> 01:18:13,929
specific things you might want to do

1761
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:15,880
that involve a little more deeper stuff

1762
01:18:13,929 --> 01:18:18,639
maybe like advanced time manipulation

1763
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:21,579
things or stuff like that right people

1764
01:18:18,639 --> 01:18:24,159
who can do that they can make that game

1765
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:25,899
and you can't because you just did

1766
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,859
there's no options for that in unity

1767
01:18:25,899 --> 01:18:28,779
you're unreal

1768
01:18:26,859 --> 01:18:30,908
that doesn't have that particular way

1769
01:18:28,779 --> 01:18:33,849
that you wanted to warp time or have it

1770
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:37,299
do something right so up that's it right

1771
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:42,190
you're you can't do it and they can and

1772
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:43,719
then the third reason is a different in

1773
01:18:42,189 --> 01:18:46,388
addition to the differentiation is

1774
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:49,600
exploring things that people haven't

1775
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:50,739
done before right so there's tons of

1776
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,579
things that the Unreal Engine 4 and

1777
01:18:50,738 --> 01:18:56,169
unity can't do they are a set of things

1778
01:18:54,579 --> 01:18:58,569
that we have not even conceived of yet

1779
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:59,770
potentially and then there's a set of

1780
01:18:58,569 --> 01:19:02,319
them that we have conceived of in that

1781
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:04,120
just they just don't do right if your

1782
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:06,369
game wants to be in one of those spaces

1783
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:07,479
you can't use those engines or you can't

1784
01:19:06,369 --> 01:19:09,099
use those engines without heavily

1785
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:10,209
modifying them and if you don't

1786
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,860
understand how to make

1787
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:14,020
you can't do that so again you can't

1788
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:15,488
really ever make those games and so in

1789
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:16,980
some sense you could think of it as if

1790
01:19:15,488 --> 01:19:19,569
you don't know how to make a game engine

1791
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:22,238
you will only ever be somebody who can

1792
01:19:19,569 --> 01:19:24,039
make games in the small space of games

1793
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:27,819
that we currently have carved out by

1794
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:29,890
those engines everything else you will

1795
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:32,859
have to wait for other people to make

1796
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:34,930
for you and you will have to hope that

1797
01:19:32,859 --> 01:19:36,729
they license whatever they make because

1798
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:40,210
you can never get out to that space

1799
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:42,039
because the engines don't do it right so

1800
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:43,689
taken together I just feel like if you

1801
01:19:42,039 --> 01:19:45,039
are a game developer it's incredibly

1802
01:19:43,689 --> 01:19:47,710
limiting to not know how to make an

1803
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:51,880
engine especially in this day and age

1804
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:54,390
when games haven't really defined all

1805
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:57,340
that they could be like we don't know

1806
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:59,050
every possible way a game can be like

1807
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:00,699
we're still coming up with new ways that

1808
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:03,010
games can be we're coming up with new

1809
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:04,659
genres even like you know there's a lot

1810
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:08,079
of progress in terms of defining what a

1811
01:20:04,659 --> 01:20:10,599
game is not being able to be a part of

1812
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:12,519
that because you just don't know how is

1813
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,320
very very limiting and it doesn't mean

1814
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:18,190
that you can't still make good games

1815
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:20,710
that are interesting in the known space

1816
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:22,809
of games but it does mean that you're

1817
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:24,340
not on the frontier and personally I

1818
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:27,550
feel like if the frontier is a way

1819
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:29,710
better place to be than just kind of

1820
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:32,020
with everyone else in in the known space

1821
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:34,380
so hopefully that's a pretty complete

1822
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,380
answer

1823
01:20:44,029 --> 01:20:51,090
no more questions ask me no more

1824
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:57,149
questions I will tell you no more lies

1825
01:20:51,090 --> 01:21:00,000
as they say all right well if there's no

1826
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:06,569
more questions there's no more handmade

1827
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:07,979
here oh all right well thank you

1828
01:21:06,569 --> 01:21:09,989
everyone for joining me for another

1829
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:13,379
episode of handmade hero where we almost

1830
01:21:09,989 --> 01:21:16,469
got through Basie's well we will try to

1831
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:18,150
do that tomorrow so that we can have our

1832
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:19,230
sort of rotation and scaling in there

1833
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:21,659
now of course we'll have to actually

1834
01:21:19,229 --> 01:21:23,609
start working on the rendering to do

1835
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:25,590
rotation scaling as well so that'll be a

1836
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:27,420
whole nother issue but just in terms of

1837
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:29,190
getting our stuff defined more cleanly

1838
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:33,600
we kind of have to work through this

1839
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:35,009
stuff so hopefully that will go smoothly

1840
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,120
tomorrow and I can do a little more

1841
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:38,670
whiteboard diagramming that we can

1842
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:41,430
implement it and that will set us up for

1843
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:42,659
for kind of some nice I feel like by

1844
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,760
Friday I'd like to have it so that the

1845
01:21:42,659 --> 01:21:46,590
specification of stuff is a little

1846
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,000
cleaner and it's not so weird about like

1847
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:49,529
when things are getting negated and

1848
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,279
meters to pixels and that sort of stuff

1849
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:54,329
so that's what I would like to do and

1850
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:57,449
that's what we'll continue doing

1851
01:21:54,329 --> 01:21:58,739
tomorrow so anyway thank you very much

1852
01:21:57,449 --> 01:22:00,750
for joining me it's a pleasure coding

1853
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:02,489
with you as always if you would like to

1854
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:05,579
follow along at home you can always peer

1855
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:07,739
to the game on handmade hero org you can

1856
01:22:05,579 --> 01:22:08,789
use the little pee order button it comes

1857
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:10,590
with the source code so you'll be able

1858
01:22:08,789 --> 01:22:11,729
to download it every night and follow

1859
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:12,480
along and just play around the stuff

1860
01:22:11,729 --> 01:22:14,729
that we've been playing around with

1861
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:16,559
which is fun and hopefully educational

1862
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:18,149
as well we also have forums we can ask

1863
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,470
questions you go to that site there's

1864
01:22:18,149 --> 01:22:21,449
also things like ports to Mac and Linux

1865
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:23,039
there's even a BitTorrent now where you

1866
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:24,929
can download high-res versions of the

1867
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:26,399
videos so that you can watch them

1868
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:28,050
without using YouTube that's kind of

1869
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,719
Handy there's stuff in there go check it

1870
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:31,920
out it's cool we have a patreon if you

1871
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:34,409
want to support the video series you

1872
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,760
could subscribe to that we have a tweet

1873
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:37,409
bot that tweets the schedule if you want

1874
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,270
to know when we're gonna be live so

1875
01:22:37,409 --> 01:22:40,710
that's pretty handy and of course we

1876
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:42,240
have an episode archive you can get to

1877
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:43,770
the YouTube one here and there's also an

1878
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:45,469
episode archives it's annotated out in

1879
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:49,440
the forum so check that out as well so

1880
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:51,810
yes I hope that you have I thought hope

1881
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:53,879
that you will have a lovely April Fool's

1882
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:56,580
Day tomorrow I know that the internet

1883
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:58,020
will be rife with April Fool wings so

1884
01:22:56,579 --> 01:23:00,630
hopefully that'll be good and hopefully

1885
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:01,860
no one plays a prank on you I know that

1886
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:03,029
I'm certainly hoping to and play a prank

1887
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:06,529
on me

1888
01:23:03,029 --> 01:23:09,779
and so we will see hopefully we will all

1889
01:23:06,529 --> 01:23:12,210
sort of come away unscathed from the

1890
01:23:09,779 --> 01:23:14,099
from the from the sort of the tomfoolery

1891
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:15,840
if you will the Tom April April

1892
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,740
tomfoolery so thanks very much for

1893
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,739
watching and I'll see you tomorrow
