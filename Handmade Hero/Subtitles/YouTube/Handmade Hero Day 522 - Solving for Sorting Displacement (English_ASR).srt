00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,569
hello everybody welcome to handmade Hero

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:10,439
show Rico to complete-game live on

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,539
stream for those of you who didn't stick

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:18,210
around past the end of the recording

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:22,559
yesterday one of our viewers who I don't

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,769
really remember if they had asked a

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:30,059
question before or not it's Benjamin on

8
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:35,390
the chat actually was like hey do you

9
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:37,769
think that the bug was related to not

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,469
having the bitmap loaded yet and I was

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,910
like I do think that the bug could be

12
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,370
very related to that and we quickly

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,078
looked and it totally is so the bug we

14
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:47,788
were looking for yesterday we think we

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,469
know what it is I didn't want to fix it

16
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,359
because I don't ever like to do anything

17
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,520
off stream so basically we just looked

18
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,890
to see if it was probably the case and

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,600
it almost certainly is so what I'd like

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,530
to do is just just take a quick second

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,618
show what the bug actually what we

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,859
thought it was and and then we can go

23
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:13,590
ahead and fix it since we don't really

24
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:16,469
have a way to repo it exactly we could

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,719
force it to repro but since we don't

26
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,609
have a way to really know exactly what

27
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,640
bug we were seeing last time we can't

28
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:25,799
guarantee that this is it but it seems

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,060
very likely so if you look at what was

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,490
happening here we do have this

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,950
run-through of these piece indexes for

32
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,750
every entity and for each one we store a

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,079
pointer to the bitmap that was

34
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,450
responsible for that piece index so

35
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,569
whichever one we end up drawing the

36
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,118
problem that we ended up with is that

37
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:48,359
that pointer that bitmap info pointer

38
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:53,069
here that we're getting that actually

39
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:56,069
only gets set inside the this particular

40
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:58,109
part of the routine right so you can see

41
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:00,750
that happening right here this is where

42
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:03,629
that that array gets filled out and the

43
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,420
problem is that we don't descend into

44
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:09,079
this part of the code unless the texture

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,680
handle we get back is actually valid

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,810
that's a huge problem for us because

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,379
that means we don't store this piece of

48
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,688
information back now there's no reason

49
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:25,199
that we can't do that and we should

50
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:27,780
write in other words this storage here

51
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,348
there's no reason it can't be done here

52
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,900
because this get bitmap info that will

53
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:36,959
work whether or not the bitmap is loaded

54
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:41,000
so if instead we were to just say oh

55
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,920
like do this right

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,530
get the thing always and write it back

57
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:50,009
always and then if you have a texture

58
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,848
handle by all means go to town that's

59
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:54,120
fine

60
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:56,638
right but what we don't want to do is

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,889
not actually process this piece of

62
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:05,730
information here right now instead of

63
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:10,919
doing that exactly what I'd like to do I

64
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:14,358
think is just move this this piece of it

65
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:17,729
for me this is a check down closer to

66
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:19,919
the rendering process because the

67
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,340
texture handle actually isn't used for

68
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,919
anything

69
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,289
and so what I'd rather do is say look

70
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,530
all of this stuff should really just

71
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:31,489
still happen and why don't we just save

72
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,438
this part right where we're actually

73
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:37,500
looking at the the texture handle here

74
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:39,269
why don't we only defer the rendering if

75
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,128
we can't get the texture handle because

76
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,549
all of this stuff is about constructing

77
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:46,739
the world properly right and we'd like

78
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,299
to be able to do that now one of the

79
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,340
problems this world dim from world

80
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,340
plight this takes the test texture

81
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,590
handle here and that's the only thing I

82
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,180
think that takes the texture handle but

83
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,729
I'm pretty sure I mean I could be wrong

84
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,129
but I'm pretty sure this texture width

85
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:05,419
and I think here there's really no

86
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:08,608
reason to actually do this this way

87
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:11,939
because that piece of information

88
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:18,389
actually is in the bitmap info as well

89
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:21,180
right so if you were to look at how

90
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:24,449
restoring our bitmaps you can see here

91
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,579
that we have the dimension information

92
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:28,310
both the original size that the thing

93
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:32,129
was

94
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:34,470
in like when we imported it

95
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:36,899
so before we like process scale it and

96
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,669
afterwards when we store it both of

97
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:50,519
those pieces of information are actually

98
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:52,859
available right so I'm pretty sure that

99
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,009
there's really no need for that texture

100
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,620
handle at all this texture handle could

101
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:01,889
instead be replaced with the HH a bitmap

102
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:05,459
pointer and that bitmap pointer would

103
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:07,829
give us everything we need so I'm gonna

104
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:12,019
argue that's what we should do because

105
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:15,300
again this is kind of part of my process

106
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:18,509
I tend to do this just in general I like

107
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,750
to separate streaming information from

108
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:24,389
non streaming information pretty

109
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,339
rigorously if I can and say look when a

110
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,199
game starts up it should have all of its

111
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:32,279
functional information just loaded if it

112
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,949
can and nowadays it's pretty rare for it

113
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,939
to be the case that you can't do that

114
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:38,550
you know you're usually talking about

115
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:43,709
something like 256 megabytes even for a

116
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:47,129
giant giant system for all of the

117
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:49,918
metadata you might need and so all the

118
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:51,870
like 30 gigabytes of extra data that you

119
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,939
need is all textures and vertex buffers

120
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,280
and stuff that stuff is all the

121
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,740
streaming stuff just stream that part in

122
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,649
but leave all of the connective tissue

123
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,379
always rezident why because the game can

124
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:06,750
keep running without it right without

125
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,610
that streaming stuff if it has all the

126
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,788
metadata it can always make the gameplay

127
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:15,449
happen every frame exactly as it should

128
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:17,699
and you can just do worse rendering or

129
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,439
you know something just flickers and

130
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,269
doesn't quite appear correctly or

131
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,430
something if your streaming can't keep

132
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:27,629
up but the game doesn't stutter do a

133
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:30,269
halt right and so I prefer to like have

134
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:32,490
it so that the anything that the game

135
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:36,478
needs to actually make decisions about

136
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:39,990
where stuff is or how it's doing what

137
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,979
it's doing I try to have that stuff

138
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,160
resident

139
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,900
much guaranteed and then usually all the

140
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,700
stuff that's streaming you can break

141
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,469
that down into stuff that doesn't ever

142
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,550
need to be looked at for decision-making

143
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:56,670
right most of the time not all the time

144
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,920
but a lot of the time you can and that's

145
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,439
just because there's a huge disparity in

146
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,939
size between the sorts of things that

147
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,680
are used for visuals and the sorts of

148
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:10,439
things that are used for gameplay just

149
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:12,240
usually right okay so in here where we

150
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,639
do world dim from world height what I

151
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,470
want to do is just do okay you know

152
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,939
maybe you pass me a bitmap info oh

153
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:22,260
that's actually an H H bitmap and what

154
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,149
we want to do there is be able to grab

155
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:28,829
that out and like I said this is

156
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:30,929
producing this change in sort of size so

157
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:34,289
we just the only thing we really need

158
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:36,900
here is the aspect ratio and so that's

159
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,580
what the original dimensions will tell

160
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:42,229
us it's telling us the aspect ratio of

161
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:46,560
the original image so the original dip

162
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:51,990
dimension one is the height right and

163
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:55,649
here we have info or exam

164
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:59,670
and the dim zero is gonna be the width

165
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:02,310
right and so if I redo real dim from

166
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:05,670
world height that way and say here is

167
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:09,720
the new function definition for this

168
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:11,699
thing that in theory should get me out

169
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,850
of the business of using that texture

170
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,139
handle right so now in here where we

171
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,970
were passing the texture handle before

172
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,569
we should be able to pass the bitmap

173
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:28,140
info instead and that's all we would

174
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:31,170
need I think okay so if that's actually

175
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,479
the case now my argument is that we have

176
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:36,000
potentially eliminated the bug that we

177
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,590
were seeing yesterday and in theory we

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,559
shouldn't have changed anything else

179
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,379
that's just in theory though we don't

180
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,839
actually know now that allows us to

181
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:47,610
maybe potentially possibly hopefully and

182
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,410
I guess we'll see in a second

183
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,730
get back to what we were trying to do

184
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:53,730
before and if you remember what we were

185
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:57,830
trying to do before was get this stuff

186
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:00,120
working where we are going to use the

187
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,170
we're gonna use the information about

188
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,929
where our sprites are to try and do some

189
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:08,509
improved snapping of points two points

190
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:11,039
right and we talked about that yesterday

191
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:12,179
so if you're not familiar with what

192
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,620
we're doing you want to watch at least

193
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:15,419
the beginning of yesterday's stream

194
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,720
where I talk about what we want to do

195
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:20,009
for alignment if that makes sense

196
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,509
so what I'd like to do now is just take

197
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:24,779
a look at when we're doing these bright

198
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:26,250
values for upper right and we we pull in

199
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,279
you know whatever we're doing for us

200
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:32,490
right here we know that this is centered

201
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,259
about zero zero right now so the min P

202
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:39,379
is telling us where we would place this

203
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:42,750
thing if we wanted zero zero to be the

204
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:45,480
if we wanted zero zero to be the

205
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,669
alignment point right so that's what min

206
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,300
P is basically telling us and then we

207
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:54,209
also at the same time because we have

208
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:57,079
gotten the the parent piece here we've

209
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:00,660
got this initial P this this right here

210
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,720
this initial P tells us the point that

211
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:04,439
we're trying to align with and this one

212
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,660
will

213
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,079
you know that's that's just accurate in

214
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:13,740
world space it's just where we want to

215
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:17,099
snap to right so what we want to do now

216
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:22,589
is figure out how to compute a location

217
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:24,420
for this new sprite that will match the

218
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:27,480
location that we're supposed to be

219
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:29,399
matching when viewed dead-on from the

220
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,379
camera and you can like I said go back

221
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,448
to yesterday's dream for an explanation

222
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:35,490
of what I mean by that but essentially

223
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:37,258
what I'm talking about is if we were to

224
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:41,549
look at when we start to set these

225
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:44,100
points now if I open up the point editor

226
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:46,500
here right you can see me tweaking like

227
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,278
where this this alignment thing is let

228
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:54,360
me turn off this top that head

229
00:10:50,278 --> 00:11:01,019
attachment there so if you look at where

230
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:02,610
this zoom on in there we go so if you

231
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,778
look at how these points are distributed

232
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:08,278
right you can see me moving it around

233
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:11,278
here what we want to do is say all right

234
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,899
that white point when we draw the white

235
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,120
point we're drawing there is the point

236
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,490
that's being input by the game and

237
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,360
saying this is the point you're supposed

238
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,639
to align to right these colors down here

239
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,159
tell us what the points are that we're

240
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,039
looking at so the red point is point

241
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:33,059
zero the green point is point one for us

242
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:36,719
to see and so what we want to do is make

243
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:39,028
something that snaps this red alignment

244
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,910
point here to this white point here

245
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:44,100
that's what we want to do and like I

246
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:46,588
said we want to do that such that if I

247
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,920
were looking at from this camera angle

248
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:52,980
exactly and you were right in the middle

249
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,769
of the view looking right down at it it

250
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,370
would snap now it's crucial to

251
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:02,100
understand that I mean only that

252
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:04,198
particular alignment of the camera and

253
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,449
the entity should we get the snapping

254
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:08,159
and like I said go back to yesterday's

255
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:10,258
stream if you want to know why in more

256
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:14,429
detail but the idea here is I want there

257
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:17,370
to be perspective shift as the things

258
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:19,979
move across or up and down on the screen

259
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,039
so I do not want this algorithm to

260
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:26,490
correct for the perspective shift that

261
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:29,909
happens around by Reese napping so I'm

262
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:32,720
intentionally we need our algorithm for

263
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:36,569
aligning these points to intentionally

264
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,560
only align them from one specific camera

265
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,670
angle and one specific camera angle only

266
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:44,159
that is where they should appear a line

267
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:45,779
and then anything off of that camera

268
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,199
angle they should become progressively

269
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:53,039
more unaligned as the perspective shift

270
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,600
pulls them apart okay so that's at least

271
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,909
what we're trying now that's our goal

272
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,750
right now to see if we can make that

273
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:03,389
happen

274
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:06,600
a little more specifically just without

275
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:09,289
any additional you know we want very

276
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,759
specifically to make sure that we're not

277
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:16,829
correcting too much and preventing

278
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:21,090
ourselves from from getting that nice

279
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:25,500
perspective shift that I want right okay

280
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:28,620
um so let's see now if I go over here

281
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,419
and look at how this is actually being

282
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,340
lined the game's still running over here

283
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:34,649
by the way I haven't turned it off or

284
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,360
anything but so if we take a look at how

285
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,819
these sprite values who are coming in

286
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,050
I'm gonna want to work out a diagram so

287
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,850
I'll probably flip over to Milton in a

288
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:43,979
second but if you look at how these are

289
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,930
working we get this back and what we

290
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,180
want to do is take this bright min P

291
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:50,759
that we received and we want to adjust

292
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:53,729
it for the alignment so the entire goal

293
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,100
of this process is to adjust that sprite

294
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,279
min P now there is something a little

295
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:02,970
confusing about what we're doing and I'm

296
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:06,659
not sure exactly how we're supposed to

297
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:11,460
deal with it it's a little bit under

298
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:13,529
specified right and the part that I'm

299
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:17,340
talking about is this piece offset here

300
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:18,750
so there's two choices that we have and

301
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,570
they're both probably wrong and that's

302
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,690
why I say we might need to like upgrade

303
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,060
the way that we're processing that but

304
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:30,600
the piece offset right now is used for

305
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,609
two separate things one thing it's used

306
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,050
for

307
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:40,230
offsetting something in space so for

308
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:42,240
example if we're saying that the head

309
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,159
attached to the body and we want the

310
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,320
head to be like up higher than the body

311
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:50,490
and Z right it's being used to do that

312
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,200
but then it's also being used to do

313
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,169
something totally separate which is to

314
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,800
provide secondary animation to the head

315
00:14:55,169 --> 00:15:03,629
as it bounces around right and so our

316
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:08,069
problem is I don't really know exactly

317
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:12,169
how that should be working with respect

318
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:15,329
to the alignment what I'm going to say

319
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:20,360
because it doesn't really matter but

320
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:23,819
what I'm going to say at the start is

321
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,669
let's say that the piece offset is added

322
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,730
after alignment so you align these two

323
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:33,389
points and then you offset the piece

324
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:36,000
from that alignment to its location so

325
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:37,860
offset can just break all the rules

326
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,139
it can do anything it wants so the

327
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,470
alignment happens first then the offset

328
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,120
happens right so I think that's what we

329
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,220
want to do the reason I think that's

330
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,740
what we want to do is because really

331
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,649
alignment is just for our own art

332
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,350
aesthetic purposes and so I think it's

333
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:57,089
sufficient to do it this way where we

334
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,250
just align a point and then say what

335
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:03,839
kind of displacement we want off of the

336
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:05,879
point I can't think of a reason why we

337
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,130
can't just do it that way although there

338
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:11,149
might be some reasons I'm not sure that

339
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:13,799
that that that we don't want to do that

340
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:16,320
the reason that I don't think it matters

341
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,448
is because let's suppose that we then

342
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,579
find that that's not sufficient and what

343
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:24,870
we would rather do is split into two

344
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:27,870
halves one half is there's the offset of

345
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,360
this piece and we want to take that we

346
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,519
want to do that before aligning right

347
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,379
and then the other one is secondary

348
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,879
animation that moves it around and

349
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:38,159
obviously we want to do that after

350
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:40,439
alignment it's trivial for us to just

351
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,360
split them right because we can always

352
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,980
just before we start processing mimpi

353
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:49,119
we can always stuff the align

354
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,399
the pre alignment offset in there do the

355
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:54,489
alignment exactly however we solved it

356
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:56,409
do it and then apply the post alignment

357
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:58,480
so we can it's freedom for us to split

358
00:16:56,409 --> 00:17:00,879
this later and shove one part of it in

359
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,350
earlier the process if we need to so I'm

360
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,318
gonna say right now let's just not worry

361
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:08,980
about that we'll let this happen at the

362
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:13,538
end of the process and then we'll look

363
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:17,470
later on right we can decide whether we

364
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:19,869
need to change up how that's working so

365
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,788
at the moment what we can see is this is

366
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:24,009
the part we then have to work with this

367
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:25,179
right here is sort of the stuff we were

368
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,970
doing that we found worked well for

369
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:31,149
sorting which is to say using the Y

370
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,710
displacement and this is us preventing

371
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:34,778
it from sinking down into the floor and

372
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,419
stuff this is the part that we want to

373
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:40,990
now want to look at more closely and we

374
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:43,299
need to figure out how we will compute

375
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,069
these values now hopefully this won't be

376
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:47,980
very complicated hopefully this is a

377
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:50,288
relatively simple piece of math for us

378
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,759
to do but we have to think about what it

379
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:53,048
actually should do first so we don't

380
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,359
actually know if it's simpler or not

381
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:56,769
we're about to find out after we sort of

382
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,219
state what our requirements for this

383
00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:09,599
particular thing are so here's day 5:22

384
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:12,759
and this is a line for default camera

385
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,500
okay so what we want to do like I said

386
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,940
let's take a look at a side view since

387
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,788
its easiest to understand what's going

388
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:22,840
on in that case I think let's draw the

389
00:18:18,788 --> 00:18:28,569
canonical wall plus floor right so this

390
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:31,178
is wall this right here is floor not

391
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:33,908
flour flour all right it's flour

392
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:42,870
apparently so it's like a it's a little

393
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:42,870
like sack of flour and it like poof's

394
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:58,339
all right it's great let's bake a

395
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:59,989
biscuit I'm chuffed to bits really I

396
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:02,479
didn't think I would make it past cake

397
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:05,179
week but I'm just I'm just

398
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:08,479
chuffed to bits all right so anyway here

399
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:10,219
we are in a line for default camera and

400
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:11,690
what I mean by that is there is some

401
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:14,330
default camera that's pointing right

402
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:17,058
down here like I said we're looking at

403
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:20,478
this from the side here's a wall here's

404
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:23,569
the flower and what we want to do is

405
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:25,129
create a sprite here that's going to

406
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:27,950
have the alignment information that I

407
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:29,838
want now we know for the first you know

408
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,278
just to start with is it's gonna be

409
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:35,269
something like the center point of the

410
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:39,909
floor what I'm going to do is I'm going

411
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:44,058
to I need right if I were to draw a line

412
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:45,739
through that point to the camera so I

413
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,808
don't know exactly how the camera is

414
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:49,278
actually pointing pretty downward right

415
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:51,558
so I do think it's something like this

416
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:54,548
but if I were to draw a line down

417
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:57,618
through that point like that there we go

418
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:59,960
so what we're talking about with a line

419
00:19:57,618 --> 00:20:01,878
point is we know we have a sprite now

420
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,719
that's got some point on it that we

421
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:08,058
computed as the align point right and

422
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:10,759
what we're saying is we want this point

423
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:14,058
to appear in the same location as that

424
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,889
point right so we're trying to figure

425
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:17,960
out where to place this sprite so that

426
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:20,718
this point and that point are on the

427
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,489
same line of the camera now what we were

428
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,409
doing before and this is why things were

429
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,879
sinking into the ground before we

430
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:30,080
started down the path of let's figure

431
00:20:25,878 --> 00:20:32,209
out how to do the correct placement so

432
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:37,278
before yesterday or before the I guess

433
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:38,598
before last Sunday we were just snapping

434
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:41,569
these points together in world space

435
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:43,158
right like that or something and that's

436
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:45,678
not gonna cut it because that's gonna

437
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,940
sink right into the floor right so what

438
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,320
we want to do instead is throughout work

439
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,379
replace this thing so that it will

440
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,658
properly look like we did that but not

441
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:56,388
sink into the floor so what we want to

442
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:58,669
do is say okay I want to figure out the

443
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:00,049
location of this point such that the

444
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:04,009
lowest point

445
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:05,930
the thing wherever that was right I want

446
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:08,569
the lowest point to stay constrained to

447
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:13,910
this plane but I want this point to end

448
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:16,519
up on this line right so it's free for

449
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,140
us to do one of those things right one

450
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,960
of those things takes almost no thought

451
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:26,810
at all we know what the lowest point on

452
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:30,110
this on this is right would be right

453
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:31,730
because literally we just have an x and

454
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:34,399
y axis and we're gonna draw it off of

455
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,470
that wherever we place the thing that's

456
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,960
the lowest point it can't go lower than

457
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,190
that right now

458
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,329
rotation is gonna change this so again

459
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,580
like I said we're gonna have to go

460
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:44,720
through this as a second pass hopefully

461
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:46,730
if we get through with this today we'll

462
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,110
start on that second pass right after to

463
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,579
make sure that we do some slightly

464
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:52,129
different stuff for rotation because

465
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:54,289
it's a little bit more complicated but

466
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,780
again take rotation out of the equation

467
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:58,069
for a second we would know what the

468
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:00,980
lowest point is it's just where we were

469
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:03,889
gonna draw in the first place right so

470
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,990
that is free to just say look wherever

471
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,120
this thing would have been whatever this

472
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:11,690
alignment point was we just make sure

473
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,159
that that Z is the same right and then

474
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,759
we know it's that's that's how high it

475
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:19,940
is so that's really pretty basic to move

476
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:21,890
this down to here that's fine so the

477
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,009
only real question we have to ask

478
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:28,310
ourselves is if we were to slide along

479
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:30,680
of the Z plane right and we don't have

480
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:32,509
to slide in X because X just works right

481
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,549
X setting the alignment point in X

482
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:37,970
matching the two alignment points in X

483
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:41,119
will just work because there is no need

484
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:43,819
to play with the Z bias there right Y is

485
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,199
the only thing that affects our Z bias X

486
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:47,950
doesn't because it's lateral on the

487
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,440
screen doesn't change the depth at all

488
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:53,180
so if we're gonna slide again and this

489
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,850
is in the y axis right because remember

490
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,460
Z is going up here so we're gonna slide

491
00:22:55,849 --> 00:23:00,349
in the y axis here's our camera again

492
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,110
right and let me draw that line coming

493
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:05,899
down so here's that let's say that's our

494
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:09,679
line here's our alignment point you know

495
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:12,560
here's the camera and we want that that

496
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,950
to line up right

497
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,919
so if we were to say alright let's place

498
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,710
this this thing on the ground right and

499
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,250
we know we've got a point somewhere on

500
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:28,630
this thing that we're gonna align all we

501
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:32,720
need to know is what would be the point

502
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:36,170
that we would place it at so this if we

503
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,640
were to make sure that this was on this

504
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:42,890
line right so we want to slide this

505
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,860
thing such that it ends up looking like

506
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:47,780
that we want to know this point the

507
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:50,000
thing that would place it such that the

508
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:51,799
alignment point will be in the same line

509
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,859
as the alignment point that we're

510
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:56,480
matching right the child point in the

511
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:59,539
parent point this is the child point

512
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,170
this is the parent point we need those

513
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:07,480
to appear in a line right and that's and

514
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:11,690
that's all right pretty straightforward

515
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:16,099
okay so there's a number of different

516
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:20,330
ways that we could imagine solving this

517
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:24,049
and they kind of correspond to two ways

518
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:25,909
of looking at this diagram one way of

519
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:27,919
solving this would be to say well we

520
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,410
know this line because we're making

521
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,269
we're saying that our default camera if

522
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,759
this thing we're placed in the center of

523
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:36,589
the screen the default camera pointing

524
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:38,420
up it's actually this is just you know

525
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:41,019
that's just the z-axis right

526
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:43,039
that's just the z-axis of the camera

527
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:46,190
that's what that is that you're pointing

528
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,389
down so we know what this line is we

529
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,240
don't have to solve for it we just have

530
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:54,440
it it's the z-axis so one thing we could

531
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,630
do is say look let's just say that we

532
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,519
align the alignment point with this

533
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:02,090
thing so we're gonna construct around

534
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:04,490
the z-axis how far down the z-axis would

535
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:11,119
we have to push before this hits the

536
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:13,579
plane right the other way to do it would

537
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,399
be to say let's place this at the

538
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:19,189
alignment point and figure out how far

539
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,180
we have to slide this way before we hit

540
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,769
this line now my intuition tells me and

541
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,920
that intuition is not particularly good

542
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:28,559
but

543
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,600
intuition suggests to me that that

544
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,769
pushing along this line is the easier

545
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,250
way to do it

546
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:37,049
probably but I would guess that probably

547
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,410
if you worked either one out they

548
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:41,909
probably come out to basically the same

549
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:46,550
meaning I don't think either one is

550
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:48,320
gonna be all that more complex right

551
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:53,490
that's just a guess

552
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:58,500
all right so let's again recap if we

553
00:25:53,490 --> 00:26:01,410
assume then that we know what this line

554
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:05,339
is because we know that it's the it's

555
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:07,620
the Z coordinate of this alignment point

556
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:13,279
so we don't have to do much to that

557
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:17,309
right so if what we want to know is

558
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:20,009
moving along this z axis where would we

559
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:23,819
have to put this thing such that this

560
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:28,650
was correctly at the the horizon now at

561
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:31,619
the that line well it really shouldn't

562
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:35,850
be very difficult because we know this

563
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:38,269
length right we know we know how high up

564
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:42,000
we actually need this thing to go right

565
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:44,849
because this point and this point we

566
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,309
already computed so if we subtract there

567
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:49,919
Z's we get like a height value that's

568
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:54,629
like how high this thing needs to go

569
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:57,630
right we also know this camera z-axis

570
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:02,820
right it's that that's the camera z-axis

571
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:05,370
so we know it's ratio of movement to its

572
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:09,839
unit right we know it's unit length this

573
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:12,209
way we know this right by just it's just

574
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:16,679
a dot product with the world's axis it's

575
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:18,960
just and that just gives us here's the z

576
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:23,490
axis here here's the camera z axis

577
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:27,390
camera z dot actual z axis right gives

578
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:30,539
us this and hey when you dot something

579
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:37,830
with the z axis that's like saying CX x

580
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:39,259
ZX plus cy x zy plus c z times z z don't

581
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:41,669
ask me why that Camozzi

582
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:46,529
right what do we know about the z-axis

583
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:51,600
it's X is zero its Y is zero and it's Z

584
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:54,000
is 1 so that is the value right so we

585
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:57,509
actually know that the Z coordinate of

586
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,650
the cameras z-axis is this amount right

587
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:04,410
and we know this amount so if we want to

588
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:07,160
push this thing up until it would be at

589
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:13,950
the height where it's low point right

590
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:16,440
would touch the ground they're not

591
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:21,779
particularly difficult just H over cz

592
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,940
done right so H over cz is the amount we

593
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:26,190
could call that t let's say is the

594
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,100
amount along this axis that I would have

595
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:31,529
to push in order you know again along

596
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:33,389
the camera z-axis to push this thing

597
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:35,549
from the alignment point to get it to

598
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,080
where it needs to be and so at that

599
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:41,789
point we're just looking at literally

600
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:43,529
this T times that camera access this you

601
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:47,039
know the alignment point you start here

602
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:51,960
alignment point plus teeth T C gets us

603
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:54,899
right there and we're done right so I

604
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,690
think this displacement is really all we

605
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,850
needed it's incredibly simple to compute

606
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,170
I didn't even have to solve for anything

607
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:03,629
it was literally just inspecting the

608
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,570
diagram was sufficient to give me

609
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,100
basically how I would make it I don't

610
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:10,829
see a lot of problems with that

611
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:13,469
it seems relatively stable and like I

612
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:15,539
said before it allows us we could do

613
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,019
whatever we wanted there if we want to

614
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:21,240
include some kind of a pre displacement

615
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:23,099
that would move this whole thing off of

616
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,799
the alignment point first we certainly

617
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:27,779
can right because this term right here

618
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,849
can have anything you want baked into it

619
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:33,869
so you know you can have alignment point

620
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:36,389
plus T times C plus offset right and

621
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:40,619
these things can do whatever they want

622
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:41,970
in that regard right and so the only

623
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:44,069
thing you have to do is figure out how

624
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,600
you want to compute H whether you want

625
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:47,069
it off of the original or off of a

626
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,389
displaced right and that's the only

627
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:51,629
thing that would change how this thing

628
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:55,860
would look is that computation of T

629
00:29:51,630 --> 00:30:00,210
right so we should be able to plus with

630
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:01,529
this however we want and it just doesn't

631
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,460
seem like it's gonna be that big of a

632
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:09,629
deal you know famous last words but I'm

633
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:11,429
fairly comfortable with that so when the

634
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,770
sprite values for upright things come

635
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:15,298
back let's just take a minute to assess

636
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:16,548
what and I'm gonna move it over here so

637
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,690
my head's not in the way a part of it

638
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,220
let's just take a minute to assess like

639
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,840
what do we actually have there and how

640
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,900
does like a correspond to the diagram

641
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,558
right well this initial P okay that's

642
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,690
good

643
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:29,038
this initial P here I don't know why I

644
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,200
keep going it there we go I was trying

645
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,240
to highlight that for you but the wiggle

646
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,950
went too far and went over there umm

647
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,990
this initial P right that's that

648
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,788
alignment point of the parent so that's

649
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:42,659
where we were starting that was this

650
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:47,099
right so that's where we want to move

651
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:50,120
out from then we've got the the child

652
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:52,558
point here we need that to find this

653
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:55,379
where the alarm point supposed to be we

654
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,839
need to find that height so how high up

655
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,880
off of the ground that's going to be so

656
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,069
how do we do that well this sprite

657
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,039
values for up right that's gonna give us

658
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,730
back a min P that effectively is that

659
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,579
height

660
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:11,400
so this sprite min P Z before we zeroed

661
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:13,048
it here that's right min P Z was the

662
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:20,130
height of the alignment point right

663
00:31:13,048 --> 00:31:23,970
because that was how we computed it see

664
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:27,600
here the min P is just hey let's step

665
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:29,610
backwards on the X&amp;Y along the XY axis

666
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,589
for the sprite and let's see where we

667
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:35,339
end up if we want to do our alignment

668
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:38,189
right so that means that the min P Z

669
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:40,288
right that Z displacement that's

670
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:43,110
actually the value we want now it's

671
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:45,569
going backwards right cuz it's it's so

672
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:47,369
that's the the negative essentially of

673
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:51,089
the height cuz it's gonna be going down

674
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:52,619
into the ground rather than up but it's

675
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:54,899
still the value we want it's just the

676
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:57,298
negative of the value we want right so

677
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,820
if we were to first say what's that H

678
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:02,730
value right well the H value is just

679
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:05,069
gonna be this so we already know we

680
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:10,019
already know what that is right

681
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:11,279
and again we know that cz this is pissed

682
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:15,329
me off okay there we go

683
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:18,750
we know that cz because again it's the

684
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:21,569
camera z-axis and I believe that's OB as

685
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,579
part of the render group actually I

686
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:25,769
could be wrong about that but I'm pretty

687
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:29,579
sure it is well actually you can see it

688
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:37,230
here we're getting that information like

689
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:39,240
this right so here's our camera Z so we

690
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:42,779
can get that trivially that camera

691
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:46,470
z-axis is just just grab out the value

692
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:49,410
right so that gives us the two things we

693
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:53,640
want that height and that's easy now

694
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:55,080
what's you know what's the the

695
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,330
degenerate condition here because you

696
00:32:55,079 --> 00:33:00,449
know watch what's gonna happen so that T

697
00:32:57,329 --> 00:33:03,269
value I said is H over cz that gives us

698
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:07,230
that ratio of push well notice that now

699
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:12,180
we've created a situation where we can

700
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:16,259
get unstable right as that cz approaches

701
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,820
zero this becomes an undefined value and

702
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:19,140
it will explode actually right it will

703
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:24,139
start getting higher and higher and then

704
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:27,540
and then go to an undefined value but

705
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:30,960
looking at this right as you can see how

706
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:32,819
its constructed the math usually doesn't

707
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,559
introduce synthetic things those are

708
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:36,599
usually real things that you're seeing

709
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,250
so what is the real thing that we're

710
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,949
seeing here well if you come back to the

711
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:44,039
diagram we're asking this to push this

712
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:46,140
thing up right to account for this much

713
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:49,769
height so that we don't interpenetrate

714
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:52,700
the ground right well if the camera was

715
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:56,430
all the way down here looking sideways

716
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:59,279
right there is then it would have to

717
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:02,130
push along this line and there is no

718
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,289
elevation so it could push along this

719
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:09,210
line for infinitely long and never get

720
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:11,250
any higher right make sense so that is

721
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,679
the math is telling us there's a

722
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,110
degenerate case and that's exactly

723
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,480
correct right now that degenerate case

724
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:20,730
is fine because our camera can't go down

725
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,369
they're right we don't let the camera do

726
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:26,510
that but that's exactly what that's

727
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:29,789
telling us right and we can go ahead and

728
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:32,300
you know make sure that we sort of

729
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:35,639
account for this right we can say look

730
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:38,250
you know we don't we don't even want you

731
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:41,878
to have entertain any situations that

732
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:43,039
are even close to this right where is

733
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:46,710
the actual there it is

734
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,929
so we can say look if the if the camera

735
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,309
is not in a reasonable position then

736
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:59,820
we're not going to go any further down

737
00:34:50,309 --> 00:35:01,380
this right so the Z has to be you know

738
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,570
it has to be kind of looking down like

739
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,190
this right and we don't allow the user

740
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:08,400
to move the camera at all but our

741
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:11,429
cutscene stuff may cut scenes the wrong

742
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,320
word but are like our camera movement

743
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:16,108
stuff that focuses on things in the

744
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,300
level or whatever it may do some flexing

745
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:20,130
so we don't want a hard code it we still

746
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,500
do want to look at this value because we

747
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:24,599
may allow it to vary we just don't ever

748
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,400
want it to get particularly low so it

749
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,900
should it should stay you know up in

750
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
that range where this value is gonna be

751
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:34,170
you know I mean that's probably even

752
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,449
reasonable but you know all right so you

753
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:38,039
know maybe I'll even leave it there just

754
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:40,500
to make just to be a real grouse about

755
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,568
it so we want to make sure you're fairly

756
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,539
elevated because that's the only way we

757
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:47,818
really allow this stuff to line up and

758
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:50,159
then we say okay let's make sure that

759
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:52,349
everything else falls into line assuming

760
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,608
that that's the case this is the T value

761
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:55,530
that we know that we actually needed

762
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:57,779
that T value is the thing that we would

763
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:01,019
have to displace to get these things to

764
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,510
line up properly and so now I think we

765
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:07,170
can actually just apply that alignment

766
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:09,720
and be done I think so meaning if now I

767
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,430
said look forget about this stuff that

768
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:13,828
was happening before what we're gonna do

769
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:16,409
instead is just apply the cameras z axis

770
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:19,740
on this proportion right pull that to

771
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:21,210
let it pull out by that amount and then

772
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:24,568
we're gonna apply whatever the

773
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:27,690
displacement is right now I'm gonna nerf

774
00:36:24,568 --> 00:36:31,610
that for now oh no that's correct sorry

775
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:33,139
this is the displacement right

776
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:34,820
so we're just gonna take whatever the

777
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:37,969
initial P was that's the alignment point

778
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:39,410
and we're gonna take that T camera Z and

779
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:42,019
that's gonna be the min P we're gonna

780
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:44,059
offset by that much and that should

781
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:48,139
should push us out I think that's

782
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:49,639
correct although actually that that is

783
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:52,159
actually correct but we want to set the

784
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:53,659
point to be exactly there so we don't

785
00:36:52,159 --> 00:37:06,319
want to add we want to actually make

786
00:36:53,659 --> 00:37:09,230
that work right is that right no that's

787
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,269
not right this was aligned around zero

788
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,920
zero so we still need to conclude that

789
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:17,900
offset for our alignment point so I

790
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,909
believe this is correct right yeah

791
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,400
so then we would apply this piece offset

792
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:24,279
I'm just not gonna do that yet right I

793
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,960
don't actually want that to happen yet

794
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,690
so I'm gonna compile this code and see

795
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,369
if this without the offset how we're

796
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:36,200
doing here right maybe maybe really

797
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:44,449
terrible we'll see uh so let me take a

798
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:52,369
look with why is there a second is that

799
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:57,549
a bug in our okay is that a bug in our

800
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:57,549
art pipeline if that got added

801
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:10,000
let me delete that I'm curious if we

802
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,290
have a bug because we never you know we

803
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,670
still have to do a bunch of debugging in

804
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,949
the art pipeline stuff and I'm just

805
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:17,530
curious if it adds points unnecessarily

806
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:19,739
there yeah so I'm not sure where that

807
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:23,800
came from

808
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:25,089
hmm so anyway here's the base of neck so

809
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,580
well you know what we can start by

810
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:31,480
looking at the alignment of this so

811
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:32,679
here's the the motion of this around and

812
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,449
you'll notice I'm getting really good

813
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:37,629
behavior there's nothing it's not inter

814
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:39,549
penetrating the ground at all right if I

815
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:42,400
leave it in a particular place and then

816
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:44,920
switch to the debug camera so that we

817
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,039
can kind of look in here at those points

818
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,110
that is just right on the money

819
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:54,909
look at that I mean that's just great

820
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:56,769
right so now if I go back here and say

821
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:59,559
let's turn back on the alignment for

822
00:38:56,769 --> 00:39:01,030
this guy for example so here's that

823
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:04,179
alignment point that I'm just moving

824
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:08,800
around on me then I'll look at the head

825
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:10,589
right let me add one of these here right

826
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,570
and then we'll sort of shift it around

827
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:19,570
okay so you can look and that's just

828
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:21,250
locked exactly to right so that seems

829
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:25,920
like resounding success

830
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:31,539
to me I mean that just seems great right

831
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:34,000
and yeah I got no complaints there so I

832
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:36,550
think that's really all we needed I

833
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,239
think that's very good so our only real

834
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:43,360
issue now is what to do about the

835
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:46,209
rotation now we have another decision we

836
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,340
can make that's free so we'll go do

837
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:50,829
rotation now but we have another

838
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:54,760
decision here that's effectively free

839
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:57,009
for us and I just don't know which way

840
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:02,800
we want to make it but effectively what

841
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:09,060
we need to know is when we apply this

842
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:13,420
offset when do we want it applied right

843
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:16,210
so let's suppose that I apply it now so

844
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,619
it just gets added after the fact

845
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,838
what that means is our alignment points

846
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:21,940
will no longer line up because we lined

847
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:25,088
them up and then we moved the thing

848
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:28,838
right so that offset is not taken into

849
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:30,789
account by the alignment so if we look

850
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:32,889
how these things are displaced now

851
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:34,960
whatever that piece offset is and again

852
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:37,389
that piece offset like I said is kind of

853
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,740
important because I want to you know be

854
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:42,429
able to have that secondary motion in

855
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:44,919
there right but that piece offset then

856
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:48,509
means that if I look at the alignment

857
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:51,070
points here in theory any amount of

858
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:53,020
alignment that may have happened there

859
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:55,240
would make it so that these would not

860
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:58,239
line up anymore I'm moving the head

861
00:40:55,239 --> 00:41:01,079
around here and looking at that green

862
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:07,348
alignment point and then looking back at

863
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:07,348
one of these there we go snap on there I

864
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:16,088
don't actually see it drawing the red

865
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:18,480
point anywhere is there a reason for

866
00:41:16,088 --> 00:41:18,480
that

867
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:30,689
oh do I have to be in debug camera mode

868
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:33,568
for that I guess I do I don't know why

869
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:37,679
oh it might have been click no I don't

870
00:41:33,568 --> 00:41:39,509
know why oh well maybe no you know I

871
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,789
have no idea why all right so anyway

872
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,950
there's that red point and there's the

873
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:47,099
green point do you see how they're not

874
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:49,500
aligned anymore right before they were

875
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:51,088
exact and I think we could probably even

876
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:56,838
make that a little bit clearer right if

877
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:56,838
I actually compile that down right

878
00:42:14,289 --> 00:42:20,920
there we go so right now those are exact

879
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,720
if I swap back and forth right they're

880
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,400
exactly aligned to each other and if I

881
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,139
put this on assuming that there is an

882
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,970
offset which I guess I don't know they

883
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:31,389
won't be exact anymore or they shouldn't

884
00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:36,339
be anyway right so if I go back to

885
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:42,339
alignment points here I have no idea why

886
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:44,950
that doesn't because the entities not

887
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,869
selected okay we got to do some cleanup

888
00:42:44,949 --> 00:42:52,899
on our UI for this editor it's it's

889
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:54,910
annoying all right so you actually can

890
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,309
see yes there is a displacement right it

891
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:59,289
moves a little bit not much but a little

892
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:07,239
bit and it's whatever that piece offset

893
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:10,029
amount is right I'm gonna go ahead and

894
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:11,649
say that I guess we don't really care it

895
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:13,510
looks fine with it just getting added in

896
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,650
I mean it was barely a difference anyway

897
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:22,720
even for the amount that we were using

898
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:26,380
right now so maybe that's just fine I

899
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:28,239
want to go into like ad player I want to

900
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:31,300
see how much displacement actually is

901
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,969
there if we look at adding the headpiece

902
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:37,720
on here you can see that headpiece being

903
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:45,519
added right here it doesn't really look

904
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:47,858
like there's very much Z there and maybe

905
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:49,900
there should be more right because there

906
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:53,289
maybe should be more exaggeration to the

907
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,460
separation between the two things so one

908
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:56,380
of the problems I guess that we would

909
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,960
have is we don't really know what kind

910
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:05,579
of stacking we want there

911
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:09,070
I don't know so if you assume that's

912
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:14,489
yeah if you assume that this is in

913
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:21,329
roughly in meters you know maybe this is

914
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:25,868
more should be more like that maybe

915
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:28,630
again kind of hard to say but you know

916
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:30,280
we need to decide on how far up those

917
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,920
things should be but you know there's

918
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,690
gonna be some number and again what that

919
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,230
number is really gonna determine for our

920
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:40,900
purposes is how much perspective shift

921
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:42,789
you get between these two elements right

922
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,730
and I like that perspective shift you

923
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:48,460
know I want that in there um so I think

924
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:50,170
that's all we really needed to do it

925
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,079
looks like we've got really good shape

926
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,818
there and you know the sorting seems

927
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,609
basically perfect now so everything's

928
00:44:54,818 --> 00:45:00,789
happy and fine and dandy and so really

929
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:06,338
what we want to do I think is we'd like

930
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:09,338
to go back in and get some rotating

931
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:11,409
elements in there so you know maybe make

932
00:45:09,338 --> 00:45:13,960
the head just spin around for no reason

933
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:16,690
and then we can go and make sure that

934
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,550
our our rotation works we the body is

935
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,990
doing shearing right now and we're not

936
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,480
getting much of an error from the

937
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:24,848
shearing but that's because the shearing

938
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,699
doesn't really deform the shape as much

939
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:30,160
in terms of where the high Z values are

940
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:33,699
as spinning it all the way around wood

941
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:37,809
right and so we have to kind of decide

942
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:41,019
what we think should be happening with

943
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:42,429
rotation and I don't know so it may be

944
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:44,230
that because we're aligning the

945
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:45,549
alignment points now which is good

946
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,949
because I mean they're called alignment

947
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:49,900
points or a reason because we're

948
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:52,149
aligning the alignment points I think

949
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,619
what we want to do is say well maybe

950
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,000
rotation can just be made to work

951
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:56,380
directly with the fact that those are

952
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,440
aligned and maybe it just doesn't matter

953
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,970
right because since they'll the

954
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,380
alignment points will align anyway then

955
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:04,659
it doesn't matter what rotation you did

956
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:08,200
it'll just work because we don't care

957
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:14,949
what the base point is anymore that may

958
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:17,710
actually be true right so I think if we

959
00:46:14,949 --> 00:46:20,529
look at what happens here this this

960
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:25,150
value is the only value we probably

961
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:27,290
would have to change meaning that each

962
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:29,660
value is

963
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:35,059
if you imagine the thing is spinning

964
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:37,699
around that H value is not necessarily

965
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:50,210
the point that needs to be pulled out of

966
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:52,759
the ground right and so that's really

967
00:46:50,210 --> 00:47:07,250
the part that I'm not sure what we want

968
00:46:52,760 --> 00:47:10,460
to do with yeah so here's what I'm

969
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,619
thinking I think what we want to do is

970
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,329
maybe make this H value directly

971
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:16,369
proportional to the sprite height

972
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:20,150
instead of actually looking at the min

973
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:24,739
PZ and the reason I say that is because

974
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:28,130
it for a sprite that spins around we're

975
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:29,869
gonna need to keep it a consistent

976
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:33,079
distance from the camera we don't want

977
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:35,239
it to do this so it may be that we need

978
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:39,190
to just say look based on the alignment

979
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:45,429
point we're gonna say that we use a

980
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:50,510
particular maximum value maybe based on

981
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:53,149
whatever the whatever the larger of the

982
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:56,780
two fractions is so if the alignment

983
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:59,360
point was 25% then we know the most you

984
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:02,180
could sink into the floor was the 75% if

985
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:05,870
you'd spun 180 degrees around with

986
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:08,599
rotation so we use that as the distance

987
00:48:05,869 --> 00:48:10,880
and it's whatis constant so we don't

988
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:12,980
care how you've rotated cuz again we as

989
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,930
you rotate we don't want to move you

990
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,420
like further you we don't want it to

991
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:19,309
pulse into the camera because we're

992
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,630
perspective you'll see it right if we

993
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:22,279
were orthographic you wouldn't be able

994
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:23,750
to tell how it was moving real it's

995
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,960
camera but what perspective you would

996
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:30,619
see it enlarge so I think we want to do

997
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,900
is compute a constant value for that and

998
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:35,109
and I think that would would do the

999
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,110
trick

1000
00:48:42,449 --> 00:48:48,039
that seems pretty good to me what I'd

1001
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,320
like to do first is just say look let's

1002
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:52,150
get some rotation in there so we can see

1003
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:56,769
you know doing this is gonna be

1004
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:59,079
pointless if we if we don't have some

1005
00:48:56,769 --> 00:49:02,409
idea of like what's actually happening

1006
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:05,380
so we need some way to get the entity

1007
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:08,259
spinning around I don't know if we have

1008
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:13,410
anything like that at all I looks like

1009
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:19,060
in the team movement stuff there's some

1010
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:27,789
you know there's some skewing but

1011
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:33,759
there's not it doesn't look to me like

1012
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:35,949
there's any any rotation actually where

1013
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,120
are we getting these x axis Y axis is

1014
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:44,039
from actually entity x-axis and a y-axis

1015
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,039
where are those getting set though

1016
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:57,230
I don't actually see anyone modifying

1017
00:49:55,519 --> 00:50:00,500
them in the movement code so I guess

1018
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:02,750
they're only being set up inside the

1019
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:12,800
brains maybe are they just being cold

1020
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:18,980
set can we do a little who is who set in

1021
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:24,350
those I mean cuz nobody nobody here is

1022
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:28,329
doing anything right and nobody here is

1023
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:28,329
doing anything so where is that

1024
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:46,370
what am I missing folks we must be

1025
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:48,500
setting something because if you look at

1026
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:50,539
what happens to the like we're

1027
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,550
definitely warping the axes I mean look

1028
00:50:50,539 --> 00:51:02,420
at look at that bottom in fact you know

1029
00:50:52,550 --> 00:51:06,320
if I turn off let's say in here

1030
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:07,760
I turn off the alignment points for the

1031
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,840
invasive neck right so we're just

1032
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:14,240
looking at this thing

1033
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:18,289
I mean look that's totally setting a

1034
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:20,899
that's totally setting a skew on the on

1035
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:27,829
the axes so someone's setting those axes

1036
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:31,730
right and if it's not in the brain where

1037
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:33,259
is it exactly because I would have

1038
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,630
thought it would have been in here

1039
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:42,010
somewhere where we would have set those

1040
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:46,750
axes up or you know back in the nd code

1041
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:49,370
but maybe it's using some kind of a like

1042
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:54,469
convenience function that's not in the

1043
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:55,730
place that I was looking let's see it's

1044
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:59,449
been a while since we ever looked at

1045
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:02,590
this code it's just kind of some I look

1046
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,589
that's a good to do right there

1047
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:18,279
I mean I'm not seeing I'm not seeing us

1048
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:34,429
deal with that anywhere in particular

1049
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:38,170
right ah okay so it is sitting the

1050
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:39,669
y-axis it's just not setting the x-axis

1051
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:43,190
my bad

1052
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:46,070
so here it is here's us setting that

1053
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:48,590
x-axis I'm sorry that y-axis that's

1054
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:49,970
what's that head Delta right is that's

1055
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:54,380
what's allowing us to kind of do that

1056
00:52:49,969 --> 00:52:59,659
that pointing there so I don't really

1057
00:52:54,380 --> 00:53:06,200
know of anybody else who's even touching

1058
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:09,589
this stuff you know oh well all right so

1059
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:16,759
if we wanted to make this thing spin

1060
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:18,800
around we probably could do that by I

1061
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:23,270
don't know how exactly we would want to

1062
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:27,830
do that but I could just have the t-bob

1063
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:29,719
value or something like that or a t-spin

1064
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:32,750
value that was just spending this thing

1065
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:36,019
around I don't have a lot of other ideas

1066
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:40,010
but basically all I'm saying is if

1067
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:43,579
instead of setting it this way we just

1068
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:46,310
had the head kind of do this sort of

1069
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:49,069
thing I don't know the only thing is the

1070
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:50,630
head is not really an entity right now I

1071
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:52,640
mean we sort of have some vestigial

1072
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:55,940
remains in there where it is but it's

1073
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:57,529
actually not being that it's not being

1074
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,579
processed as a separate entity that's

1075
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:05,000
not something that's actually happening

1076
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:07,069
right so yeah I do think that probably

1077
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,659
we want to fix the way we were doing

1078
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:10,070
this and I just don't know if I want to

1079
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:12,829
do it right now I think I'd rather just

1080
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:14,870
hack it in and then move to it a little

1081
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:18,019
later but what I'm gonna say is the

1082
00:54:14,869 --> 00:54:20,630
entity pieces thing I don't think worked

1083
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:22,969
out really well I don't love it I think

1084
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:24,450
probably what we should do instead is

1085
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:26,699
just have the notion that

1086
00:54:24,449 --> 00:54:28,469
you snap together so the heads identity

1087
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:32,129
the bodies identity the gloves identity

1088
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:33,509
and they all snap together right I think

1089
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:36,358
that's what we should have done and so I

1090
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:40,020
think I will do that as you know a

1091
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:41,358
separate pass maybe next weekend I just

1092
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:44,039
don't want to do it right now

1093
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:50,690
but anyway what I'd like to do is say

1094
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:50,690
okay let's go ahead and see if we can't

1095
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:55,588
just hack in something spinning here for

1096
00:54:53,849 --> 00:55:00,420
no good reason right

1097
00:54:55,588 --> 00:55:02,779
so inside like the inside the thing that

1098
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:06,500
draws I'm just gonna hack in like a

1099
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:11,280
hard-coded thing to to spin stuff around

1100
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:16,289
so inside the entity code maybe we'll

1101
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:20,339
just spin and I'll say that you know in

1102
00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:24,539
here this entity x-axis entity y-axis

1103
00:55:20,338 --> 00:55:25,769
part where we do axis to form I'm just

1104
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:30,599
gonna have these things spinning around

1105
00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:37,710
continuously so I don't know like here's

1106
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:42,119
a ridiculous thing this will just be

1107
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:48,530
some angle thing here and we'll put a DT

1108
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:48,530
on it and we'll just say like alright

1109
00:55:56,429 --> 00:56:06,460
this is actually right there let's say

1110
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:07,869
so we just accumulate that over time in

1111
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:21,940
here instead of these I'm going to say

1112
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:24,039
all right x-axis equals right something

1113
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:36,720
like this so we're just gonna produce

1114
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:36,719
like these two and actually well do this

1115
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,730
there we go so if I just say look give

1116
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:45,068
me the x-axis that's built off of that

1117
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:49,389
angle and then give me the perpendicular

1118
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:52,650
to that that should be sufficient I

1119
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:54,549
think so let me see if I run this now

1120
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:58,630
yeah you can kind of see everything's

1121
00:56:54,550 --> 00:57:00,190
just kind of spinning around right all

1122
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,329
right so first let's talk about the

1123
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:05,349
thing that I was saying you can actually

1124
00:57:01,329 --> 00:57:07,420
see it happening right so what's going

1125
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:09,280
on here well if we go to the debug

1126
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,599
camera you can actually see the way

1127
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,040
these things are pulsing in and out of

1128
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:14,200
the camera that's exactly what I was

1129
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:17,170
trying to say what happened why it's

1130
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:19,779
because that min P point is going up and

1131
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:23,369
down and up and down so it's not the

1132
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:27,040
lowest point on the sprite anymore right

1133
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:28,690
so that displacement really doesn't help

1134
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:32,500
give us the information that we want

1135
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:34,420
right and so what we'd rather do here is

1136
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:37,568
say all right we need something that's

1137
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:42,940
gonna be a more stable than that more

1138
00:57:37,568 --> 00:57:45,369
stable than the min P right and I don't

1139
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:47,858
know again like exactly how we want to

1140
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:50,500
compute that value but what I would say

1141
00:57:47,858 --> 00:57:53,650
is let's make it part of the sprite

1142
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:55,869
values right so in here where we've got

1143
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:58,900
like min P and then you know some other

1144
00:57:55,869 --> 00:58:01,690
stuff this Z bias here we don't need

1145
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:06,400
this so I'm gonna say that is gonna

1146
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:09,159
become the value right so this is going

1147
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,349
to be a Z displacement and

1148
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:13,538
gonna use that as a value that comes out

1149
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:14,710
of here so we're gonna say not being

1150
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:16,960
used min P we're going to use Z

1151
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:18,909
displacement and then when we compute

1152
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,510
these we're gonna actually compute that

1153
00:58:18,909 --> 00:58:24,429
as a separate value right and the way

1154
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:29,140
that I want to compute that value in

1155
00:58:24,429 --> 00:58:33,788
this case is I want to say look we want

1156
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:37,690
to know maybe without using the x and

1157
00:58:33,789 --> 00:58:41,530
y-axes here exactly the way that they

1158
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:43,150
were being used before we want to

1159
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:44,859
compute some stable value that's

1160
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:47,530
representative of the alignment point

1161
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:49,298
you know maybe and again I really don't

1162
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:51,130
know what the right way to compute this

1163
00:58:49,298 --> 00:58:53,889
is I don't think there is necessarily a

1164
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:55,720
right answer I just want something

1165
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:58,298
that's going to be stable so it doesn't

1166
00:58:55,719 --> 00:59:00,759
change as the thing rotates and that

1167
00:58:58,298 --> 00:59:03,369
roughly corresponds to aligning it if

1168
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,200
you weren't rotating it so if you

1169
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:07,240
weren't rotating it right so if you

1170
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:15,219
assume that this x axis and this Y axis

1171
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:18,519
we're coming in stable right then you

1172
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:21,788
can see what we would have been doing in

1173
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:26,588
that case this is the value we would

1174
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:31,450
want to compute right the align py times

1175
00:59:26,588 --> 00:59:35,500
the y axis Z right that's the value we

1176
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:37,269
would want this is not gonna be negative

1177
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,099
anymore because we don't need to do a

1178
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:41,469
double negation we're just gonna provide

1179
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:45,250
the D to the Z displacement that we

1180
00:59:41,469 --> 00:59:47,769
actually want and then what we want to

1181
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:51,630
do is say okay how would we compute this

1182
00:59:47,769 --> 00:59:56,829
value instead of doing it this way right

1183
00:59:51,630 --> 01:00:00,670
how would we compute this this value for

1184
00:59:56,829 --> 01:00:03,670
non rotation and so if we just use this

1185
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:05,740
in this one by itself that would avoid

1186
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:09,278
doing any rotation that was implied here

1187
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:16,028
so we can do is say well this axis would

1188
01:00:09,278 --> 01:00:19,690
have been this prior to rotation so if

1189
01:00:16,028 --> 01:00:22,980
all we want is the Z out of it then

1190
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,980
that's this

1191
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,919
so let's suppose we use that value that

1192
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:32,110
should now give us the same results when

1193
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,389
we're not rotating and when we are

1194
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:39,450
rotating we displace it the same amount

1195
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:46,599
right in theory anyway

1196
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:54,849
okay or not how is that how is that

1197
01:00:46,599 --> 01:01:02,099
possible the world didn't why the y-axis

1198
01:00:54,849 --> 01:01:06,519
H up okay

1199
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:09,069
not sure why I did that it helps if you

1200
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:10,809
actually set the value you said you were

1201
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:13,840
gonna set and not some totally different

1202
01:01:10,809 --> 01:01:14,409
value that's actually not at all what

1203
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,570
you wanted

1204
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:20,230
all right in theory this should be

1205
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:22,000
stable now and yeah it is right so now

1206
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:23,829
as these things spin around they should

1207
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,880
just spin around about their alignment

1208
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:31,569
point and so you know if I go in here

1209
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:33,309
and and I access the alignment point of

1210
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:37,120
one of these things you know like here's

1211
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:40,179
the alignment point of the head if I

1212
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,159
move it like that when it rotates it

1213
01:01:40,179 --> 01:01:44,710
should rotate about its alignment point

1214
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:50,230
which you can see it doing right you can

1215
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:52,420
see that right that it's it's rotating

1216
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:55,659
about this point and so wherever that

1217
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:58,809
point is on the sprite that's what it

1218
01:01:55,659 --> 01:01:59,500
would hate around and I think that's

1219
01:01:58,809 --> 01:02:03,309
what we want

1220
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:05,260
again we don't really have much in the

1221
01:02:03,309 --> 01:02:07,960
way of animation knowledge in the game

1222
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:10,420
at the moment we could have other things

1223
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,099
like separate alignment and pivot points

1224
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:16,269
if we want to it's very easy just a

1225
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:18,099
displacement that happens but at the

1226
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:20,769
moment we don't really have any reason

1227
01:02:18,099 --> 01:02:22,630
to believe we would really need that so

1228
01:02:20,769 --> 01:02:26,110
I think whatever the alignment point is

1229
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:29,230
for the time being is probably fine if

1230
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:31,240
we wanted a separate point that said

1231
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:33,400
where we would rotate around the way

1232
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:36,129
we'll do that is we'll just add a point

1233
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:41,260
in here and this will add

1234
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:43,000
one of these four pivot right and then

1235
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:45,340
we can have an alignment and a pivot

1236
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,079
point that operates separately again

1237
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:49,600
don't care about that at all right now

1238
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:51,989
so I think we're fine so that pretty

1239
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,730
much concludes what I wanted to do I

1240
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:58,359
think we crushed it to be honest with

1241
01:02:54,730 --> 01:03:00,219
you I think we crushed it that's just

1242
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,380
fantastic and everything looks great to

1243
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:06,579
me I'm gonna take out that ridiculous

1244
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:08,789
rotation nonsense because obviously we

1245
01:03:06,579 --> 01:03:12,579
don't actually want that to be happening

1246
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:14,409
that was just a test but now we should

1247
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:17,349
be able to go set those alignment points

1248
01:03:14,409 --> 01:03:20,920
and get back to just playing with the

1249
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:22,750
artists that's a little bit so if I now

1250
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,430
wanted to set the hero properly and we

1251
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:26,349
do have to get an art patch from Anna

1252
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:28,569
actually before the heroes actually

1253
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:31,449
correct because the head directions were

1254
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:34,570
wrong in the art file in fact you can

1255
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:35,619
kind of see that if I create look well

1256
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:38,170
let's go through and actually do them

1257
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:42,119
all I suppose and you can see what I

1258
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:44,440
mean so if I go in here and I select

1259
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:45,880
some of this stuff and actually start to

1260
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,829
set the alignment points oh you know

1261
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,420
what we could do here too let's actually

1262
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:53,199
make it so that if one of these is off

1263
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:59,190
it doesn't Shh it doesn't do the drawing

1264
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:59,189
right so that that code is

1265
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:18,609
here right no I'll be honest with it I

1266
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:20,690
don't remember where this is here it is

1267
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:24,680
so this thing here where it's like

1268
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:27,470
should draw a lineman point right so

1269
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:29,179
should draw a line point is is what

1270
01:04:27,469 --> 01:04:32,029
would cause these things to be drawn

1271
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:35,989
what I'd like to do is should draw a

1272
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:38,090
line point I want to make it so that we

1273
01:04:35,989 --> 01:04:39,229
won't descend into this code if should

1274
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:45,010
draw a line point for our alignment

1275
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:48,530
point is wrong so for example this

1276
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:57,440
should draw a line point here I'm gonna

1277
01:04:48,530 --> 01:05:00,170
wrap this like this and say we need two

1278
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:03,940
things we need like are we in debug mode

1279
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:03,940
and I don't really know

1280
01:05:10,469 --> 01:05:14,149
does anyone know if we have that

1281
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:35,109
there should hit test let's do that kind

1282
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:37,838
of crappy sorry about that

1283
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:41,170
we should probably improve this stuff a

1284
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:43,179
little bit but we'll get there so I mean

1285
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:46,240
here we're where I say look if I should

1286
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:49,989
if I'm in you know edit mode and this

1287
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:53,108
alignment point should be drawn or not

1288
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:55,868
let me just go grab whatever the parent

1289
01:05:53,108 --> 01:06:00,130
align not the parent align my alignment

1290
01:05:55,869 --> 01:06:04,650
point is what is it child align so child

1291
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:11,920
line child line child align child align

1292
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:14,670
this so this find the line here so that

1293
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:17,349
doesn't tell us which one it actually is

1294
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:21,220
but that's okay because I can obviously

1295
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:26,859
figure it out myself but so the child

1296
01:06:21,219 --> 01:06:28,118
align that we're drawing this one it

1297
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:31,000
looks like for some reason we don't

1298
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:33,119
actually have a you know a function for

1299
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,809
getting the index of an alignment point

1300
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:39,490
which we should you can see here we

1301
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:41,920
don't actually ever have a thing for

1302
01:06:39,489 --> 01:06:43,838
doing that math and we kind of should

1303
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:47,530
because it actually happens already

1304
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:50,858
inside the Jannetty at the end of the

1305
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:53,079
age and yeah so in here right people are

1306
01:06:50,858 --> 01:06:55,389
doing that nonsense but we don't

1307
01:06:53,079 --> 01:07:00,579
actually have a function for it like

1308
01:06:55,389 --> 01:07:01,750
this right well no I guess they're not I

1309
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:03,430
take it back that was doing it on the

1310
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:06,130
entity visible pieces not on the

1311
01:07:03,429 --> 01:07:09,818
alignment points it's sorry everyone

1312
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:12,099
not not really no not the case um so all

1313
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:14,440
right I won't chastise myself further

1314
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:15,970
I'll simply say that we do want that and

1315
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:21,250
what I want to do is have a thing that's

1316
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:23,889
like you know get aligned index and we'd

1317
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:29,099
say like here's the bitmap info in

1318
01:07:23,889 --> 01:07:29,098
question and here's the aligned point

1319
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:43,399
and it would just do like point - the

1320
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:44,930
line points right so just want something

1321
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,119
that's gonna give me back that index

1322
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:50,539
because we need to know what it actually

1323
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:53,449
is in this case so we need to say look

1324
01:07:50,539 --> 01:07:55,489
for the alignments on this guy like yeah

1325
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:59,109
are we supposed to draw that or not and

1326
01:07:55,489 --> 01:08:01,519
that's just my way of like hacking in

1327
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:08,690
well I'll show you what it's my way of

1328
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:17,989
hacking in but what is the problem there

1329
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:19,880
oh that's mm the word it again so the

1330
01:08:17,989 --> 01:08:21,858
problem is you know this doesn't return

1331
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:28,489
the P index and what you can see here is

1332
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:32,720
because this will go ahead and and do

1333
01:08:28,489 --> 01:08:35,829
like a synthetic one for you if it

1334
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,829
couldn't find it

1335
01:08:37,369 --> 01:08:41,019
[Music]

1336
01:08:46,048 --> 01:08:55,970
hmm so I really have two choices here

1337
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:59,060
but this shenanigans isn't going to work

1338
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:59,060
[Music]

1339
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:18,919
so if we have you know this then I could

1340
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:18,919
do this I guess that's what I'll do

1341
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:28,679
it's not my favorite solution but it's

1342
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:35,219
good enough for now and probably for

1343
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:37,440
always as well so in this case we would

1344
01:09:35,219 --> 01:09:41,789
say all right the point is this the

1345
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:46,649
index is this in this case we would say

1346
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:49,859
oh the index remains zero and we're

1347
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:54,058
going to do that we could set the index

1348
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:56,929
to some kind of like not found value you

1349
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:56,929
know something like

1350
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:16,440
don't know how I feel about that but we

1351
01:10:13,229 --> 01:10:18,419
certainly could so at that point we

1352
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:22,408
would actually do say Oh child align

1353
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:24,899
dots index now it's like a thing that we

1354
01:10:22,408 --> 01:10:27,029
do and then the people up here who were

1355
01:10:24,899 --> 01:10:28,619
doing child align this is actually going

1356
01:10:27,029 --> 01:10:31,800
to be a find align result and it will

1357
01:10:28,619 --> 01:10:33,929
take with it that piece of information

1358
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,300
so then we would be looking at something

1359
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:40,109
like that when you actually use

1360
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:42,239
something out of the child align as you

1361
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:51,289
kind of flow through the process there

1362
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:54,718
right that seems fine anyway there we go

1363
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:57,060
what else we got this one we don't need

1364
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,119
to remember so this can just do that and

1365
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:07,770
it doesn't matter I don't know what else

1366
01:11:00,119 --> 01:11:09,899
we got yeah so at that point I think we

1367
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:12,270
should be able to successfully turn

1368
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:16,710
things on and off maybe or I broke

1369
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:19,679
everything and it's horrible right so in

1370
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:22,050
here we've got this stuff in here I'm

1371
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:26,158
going to add to parent attachment and

1372
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:31,789
then it shows up if I turn it off it

1373
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:31,789
goes away like so

1374
01:11:33,969 --> 01:11:39,340
so the problem there all right this is

1375
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:40,229
not as good as I thought we're still a

1376
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:43,539
little screwed

1377
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:46,479
so the problem there is actually I want

1378
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:47,920
to do it on the parent so actually this

1379
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:50,738
was a lie

1380
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:54,250
by the way it's actually the parent

1381
01:11:50,738 --> 01:11:55,779
aligned that I want to mask out right so

1382
01:11:54,250 --> 01:12:00,779
I actually want to do should draw a line

1383
01:11:55,779 --> 01:12:00,779
point parent a line dot index right

1384
01:12:02,729 --> 01:12:13,329
that's actually what I'm supposed to be

1385
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:15,069
turning off so yeah I also probably only

1386
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:18,269
want to do this if this is the entity

1387
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:18,269
I'm actually looking at

1388
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:36,029
and I'll be honest I'm not sure how that

1389
01:12:28,739 --> 01:12:42,210
was happening right is that part of the

1390
01:12:36,029 --> 01:12:46,409
hit test function so I'm not sure how it

1391
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:48,210
was because this it's this dev ID here

1392
01:12:46,409 --> 01:12:52,199
right that's telling you that piece of

1393
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:55,980
information I don't know how we were

1394
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:58,289
doing that magic sauce I just don't

1395
01:12:55,979 --> 01:13:02,639
remember to make it so that should draw

1396
01:12:58,289 --> 01:13:04,859
a line point on the hit test was only

1397
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:14,010
telling you to draw stuff if you were

1398
01:13:04,859 --> 01:13:16,399
selected like I don't know how we were

1399
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:16,400
doing that

1400
01:13:23,389 --> 01:13:37,909
if highlighted should be here it's that

1401
01:13:34,779 --> 01:13:45,889
all right so this is actually what we

1402
01:13:37,908 --> 01:13:52,069
want to do that's better so if we're not

1403
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:54,560
highlighted we always draw if we are and

1404
01:13:52,069 --> 01:13:59,859
and let me just double check that that's

1405
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:03,610
for the whole that's for only this piece

1406
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:06,229
and that's not good either really

1407
01:14:03,609 --> 01:14:09,618
because we need to check to see whether

1408
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:26,509
our parent align point was turned off of

1409
01:14:09,618 --> 01:14:35,929
people downstream for us so we kind of

1410
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:38,389
need to do something like this to say

1411
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:40,429
look something in this stack was

1412
01:14:38,389 --> 01:14:47,810
highlighted so that's good enough for

1413
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:51,199
doing this checking right I guess that's

1414
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:52,639
what we would want to do and we also

1415
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:58,399
would have to do something where we

1416
01:14:52,639 --> 01:15:02,300
record that the fact that we were

1417
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:04,670
attached to the highlighted person I you

1418
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:07,639
know gosh if we really want to do this

1419
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:10,569
right it's pretty complicated it's

1420
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:10,569
actually this

1421
01:15:14,619 --> 01:15:20,779
right and this is gonna get worse too

1422
01:15:18,109 --> 01:15:22,639
because the entity itself is actually

1423
01:15:20,779 --> 01:15:26,840
the you know in the future we would be

1424
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:28,910
looking up into an entity potentially to

1425
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,619
do the snapping so we'd actually need to

1426
01:15:28,909 --> 01:15:32,479
look into the entity and say what's that

1427
01:15:30,619 --> 01:15:34,550
entity and highlighted and if it was we

1428
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:37,659
need to turn this thing off this is a

1429
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:37,659
this is a rough feature

1430
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:59,269
I have a better idea I think

1431
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:10,970
I'm gonna claim this is a better idea

1432
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:14,770
I'm gonna do all that it's gone it's

1433
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:14,770
over forget it never happened

1434
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:22,430
it's gone

1435
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:24,319
goodbye you didn't see it we're gonna

1436
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:32,840
erase this part of the video so that no

1437
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:37,909
one will ever know right

1438
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:41,560
all of it gone goodbye okay so all

1439
01:16:37,909 --> 01:16:41,559
that's gone here's what we're gonna do

1440
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:52,160
in the editor where we actually have

1441
01:16:45,829 --> 01:16:55,130
this edit stuff happening and we've got

1442
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:58,689
those alignment point buttons or

1443
01:16:55,130 --> 01:17:02,390
whatever right like this nonsense here

1444
01:16:58,689 --> 01:17:04,429
like this kind of crap right so this

1445
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:06,740
stuff where we're editing the alignment

1446
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:09,829
points I'm gonna have a thing that's

1447
01:17:06,739 --> 01:17:11,750
actually list a button right and inside

1448
01:17:09,829 --> 01:17:16,309
the editor we've got you know a button

1449
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:18,500
thing that's like draw a line point

1450
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:23,180
right here this thing I'm gonna have a

1451
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:26,510
like draw children or something or like

1452
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:29,750
yeah I don't know we're gonna have a

1453
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:34,699
draw children button and then what I'm

1454
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:36,859
gonna do is inside mmm

1455
01:17:34,699 --> 01:17:38,720
the alignment point thing I don't know

1456
01:17:36,859 --> 01:17:40,359
if I need to be in a section here I

1457
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:45,260
guess I do

1458
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:47,539
probably not sure how this stuff works

1459
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:52,250
really all right so in this section

1460
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:56,060
stuff it looks like yeah like right here

1461
01:17:52,250 --> 01:18:00,229
I can just do a button I can edit up a

1462
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:05,630
boolean right like this and so I can

1463
01:18:00,229 --> 01:18:08,869
just say look give me a boolean I it's a

1464
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:14,440
pointer to the draw children thing in

1465
01:18:08,869 --> 01:18:14,439
the editor so that's what I'm editing

1466
01:18:16,929 --> 01:18:34,340
that show children button is gonna like

1467
01:18:20,349 --> 01:18:35,900
okay is gonna let you toggle this and in

1468
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:37,639
here we can have a thing where you can

1469
01:18:35,899 --> 01:18:39,618
say like yeah

1470
01:18:37,639 --> 01:18:41,179
the should hit test thing and this

1471
01:18:39,618 --> 01:18:43,759
should draw a line point and all that

1472
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:45,289
nonsense so this stuff we can just have

1473
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,960
another one of those

1474
01:18:45,289 --> 01:18:50,118
that's like wherever they should draw

1475
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:52,069
children or sir draw line point part was

1476
01:18:50,118 --> 01:19:01,309
we're gonna put one of those for should

1477
01:18:52,069 --> 01:19:07,309
draw children and that's going to do in

1478
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:09,739
the hit test we're gonna have draw

1479
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:12,770
children set there and that's what it's

1480
01:19:09,738 --> 01:19:15,709
going to return now at the outset when

1481
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:18,230
we in it this stuff I assume there is an

1482
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:19,819
initialized editor yeah we're gonna set

1483
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:24,738
that to true because I so you want to

1484
01:19:19,819 --> 01:19:28,389
draw children by default so then inside

1485
01:19:24,738 --> 01:19:32,059
the entity what we can do here's my huge

1486
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:32,779
genius idea it's really smart and you're

1487
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:36,020
gonna love it

1488
01:19:32,779 --> 01:19:44,149
so when we actually go to get the bitmap

1489
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:47,619
info for the parents here the parent

1490
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:51,979
bitmap info is used for that alignment

1491
01:19:47,618 --> 01:19:56,420
I'm gonna go ahead and say that we have

1492
01:19:51,979 --> 01:20:02,388
some kind of a thing that's just like if

1493
01:19:56,420 --> 01:20:05,179
you didn't get that or yeah like if that

1494
01:20:02,389 --> 01:20:05,810
was set to zero then it just undoes it

1495
01:20:05,179 --> 01:20:10,489
or something

1496
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:12,230
or we set something in like the array

1497
01:20:10,488 --> 01:20:18,399
that says whether it should be drawn

1498
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:18,399
right like this

1499
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:39,308
and I'm saying so we could just say like

1500
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:41,050
look are we supposed to draw children of

1501
01:20:39,309 --> 01:20:45,369
this thing that we're looking at right

1502
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:48,639
now or not and then we'll just remember

1503
01:20:45,368 --> 01:20:51,998
that setting for whoever it was you and

1504
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:55,840
I mean I and I guess I don't actually

1505
01:20:51,998 --> 01:20:58,420
know oh I could even do this a little

1506
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:01,630
bit better I could even do this a little

1507
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:04,569
bit better if we did it this way dev ID

1508
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:07,630
from you 32s or whatever right so I just

1509
01:21:04,569 --> 01:21:12,658
did this and said okay what's the dev

1510
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:17,498
idea of my parent because it's that

1511
01:21:12,658 --> 01:21:19,839
right so if that's a parent I could just

1512
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:25,929
say oh it's visible if like should draw

1513
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:30,510
children excuse me for this parent div

1514
01:21:25,929 --> 01:21:33,729
ID it's true right that's even better

1515
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:35,139
yeah that's even better so then what I'd

1516
01:21:33,729 --> 01:21:37,150
say is okay there's a should draw

1517
01:21:35,139 --> 01:21:40,538
children thing on for that guy you're

1518
01:21:37,149 --> 01:21:42,399
not right whatever and so we passed the

1519
01:21:40,538 --> 01:21:45,009
hip test down and we say look tell us

1520
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:50,288
the visible thing for this if we end up

1521
01:21:45,010 --> 01:21:52,090
saying that that it's not visible we

1522
01:21:50,288 --> 01:21:55,509
just won't draw it then this draw

1523
01:21:52,090 --> 01:22:00,420
children is not that it's five children

1524
01:21:55,510 --> 01:22:00,420
for dev ID right

1525
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:14,630
and then what I do is say okay hmm hi

1526
01:22:12,229 --> 01:22:19,789
children for detta dev ID is just zero

1527
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:22,760
by default so we don't hide in fact that

1528
01:22:19,789 --> 01:22:28,869
that's probably just finally there an

1529
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:32,750
old dev ID I don't know if there is

1530
01:22:28,869 --> 01:22:34,309
excuse me I don't even know if I have to

1531
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:36,079
do anything for that so instead of

1532
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:39,230
having that we actually have a dev ID

1533
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:51,260
here and we have a dev ID that's like

1534
01:22:39,229 --> 01:22:53,779
you know hide children or dev ID or

1535
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:55,130
something like that well actually no you

1536
01:22:53,779 --> 01:23:03,859
know what I'm take it back let's leave

1537
01:22:55,130 --> 01:23:05,750
it this way right and so all I guess we

1538
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:10,039
really need to do is here and should

1539
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:13,760
draw children you pass the dev ID of the

1540
01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:21,680
parent ID right and then in slide should

1541
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:28,940
draw children we just say the result is

1542
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:34,240
should you draw the children or the hit

1543
01:23:28,939 --> 01:23:38,509
test editor highlight ID is not equal to

1544
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:42,019
whatever this was so you're giving me

1545
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:43,369
the person to check and I say if we're

1546
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:46,220
just supposed to draw children anyway

1547
01:23:43,369 --> 01:23:47,989
okay don't matter but if we're not

1548
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:49,970
supposed to draw children is this the

1549
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:53,689
person we're highlighting right that

1550
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:55,130
parent and if they are then don't now I

1551
01:23:53,689 --> 01:23:58,519
think I have to do an art equal there

1552
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:59,869
cuz cuz that's a there's no overlayer

1553
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:02,510
operator that so I think we just do an

1554
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:04,250
are equal and say look if these two

1555
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:07,940
things are not equal then we're good to

1556
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:10,399
go I think that's what we want let's see

1557
01:24:07,939 --> 01:24:12,049
what else we got here dev ID from

1558
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:16,759
pointer drug building can I turn blue

1559
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:23,239
into a void star that's a good point

1560
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:27,170
I agree with that point I think that's

1561
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:30,169
it so now if I draw in theory anyway

1562
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:31,788
and this is only a theory I at least

1563
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:33,649
have some slightly better human factors

1564
01:24:31,788 --> 01:24:35,538
on that particular part of it where is

1565
01:24:33,649 --> 01:24:38,808
if you're editing the alignment points

1566
01:24:35,538 --> 01:24:39,559
in this thing now and you've got your

1567
01:24:38,809 --> 01:24:41,929
you know you're looking at something

1568
01:24:39,559 --> 01:24:43,369
you're like I can't see anything

1569
01:24:41,929 --> 01:24:46,578
in theory we should be able to at this

1570
01:24:43,368 --> 01:24:50,319
switch to work now why mmm that was a

1571
01:24:46,578 --> 01:24:53,179
little weird so it started off negative

1572
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:54,738
but I'm not sure why did I screw

1573
01:24:53,179 --> 01:24:56,809
something up there because it should

1574
01:24:54,738 --> 01:25:00,098
have started off positive right oh did I

1575
01:24:56,809 --> 01:25:04,329
delete that probably deleted it sorry

1576
01:25:00,099 --> 01:25:04,328
let me read that

1577
01:25:17,109 --> 01:25:22,210
um so yeah all right so I think this is

1578
01:25:20,828 --> 01:25:23,558
now correct it took me a little while to

1579
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:26,078
figure out what the best way to do that

1580
01:25:23,559 --> 01:25:28,389
would be I think this is the best way or

1581
01:25:26,078 --> 01:25:30,609
at least it's a good way so we set the

1582
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:32,889
piece equal to visible we then say look

1583
01:25:30,609 --> 01:25:36,880
if the parent thing that I was supposed

1584
01:25:32,889 --> 01:25:39,460
to be talking about here if that thing

1585
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:41,710
should draw its children then I'm

1586
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:43,599
visible otherwise I'm not if I don't

1587
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:45,489
have a parent that I'm just always

1588
01:25:43,599 --> 01:25:49,119
visible right I don't have to worry

1589
01:25:45,488 --> 01:25:51,308
about it if it's visible I push the

1590
01:25:49,118 --> 01:25:53,019
sprite if it's not I don't that's pretty

1591
01:25:51,309 --> 01:25:54,279
straightforward and so now all we have

1592
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:58,270
to do is focus on answering this

1593
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:59,559
question properly from from there out so

1594
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:04,179
then we say okay

1595
01:25:59,559 --> 01:26:08,500
Who am I highlighting right so should a

1596
01:26:04,179 --> 01:26:10,989
line point right um sorry should draw

1597
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:13,779
children I think it's really or is it

1598
01:26:10,988 --> 01:26:15,609
one selecting so I'm not sure which one

1599
01:26:13,779 --> 01:26:19,389
of these is the one that I actually want

1600
01:26:15,609 --> 01:26:20,049
it could be this stuff too right like I

1601
01:26:19,389 --> 01:26:22,539
don't know

1602
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:23,800
so let me go remember quickly well

1603
01:26:22,539 --> 01:26:26,349
remember is the wrong word let me go

1604
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:28,779
look up who were actually showing in the

1605
01:26:26,349 --> 01:26:33,610
editor and that's the person that we

1606
01:26:28,779 --> 01:26:38,439
actually want to use so here's that part

1607
01:26:33,609 --> 01:26:45,279
of the editor and if we're doing a

1608
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:51,098
bitmap here we do get asset assets asset

1609
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:55,469
index here excuse me so that actually

1610
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:55,469
gets us back a particular asset

1611
01:26:55,979 --> 01:27:01,569
unfortunately that doesn't really give

1612
01:26:57,908 --> 01:27:03,638
us that's a little harder that doesn't

1613
01:27:01,569 --> 01:27:07,179
really give us what we would need to

1614
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:11,529
know for whether or not we would draw

1615
01:27:07,179 --> 01:27:14,039
children of that particular dude right

1616
01:27:11,529 --> 01:27:14,039
because

1617
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:31,620
because that's just keeping the asset

1618
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:37,019
it's not really saying which which dev

1619
01:27:31,619 --> 01:27:39,930
ID was captured there right so this

1620
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:48,780
active asset index let me see where

1621
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:51,420
that's but it looks like the highlight

1622
01:27:48,779 --> 01:27:53,639
ID is set to that so it does look like

1623
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:56,340
this is true right

1624
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:59,400
so should drop Children is saying if you

1625
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:01,409
should draw children or these two are

1626
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:03,539
not equal then you're okay

1627
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:05,099
that seems correct to me now of course

1628
01:28:03,539 --> 01:28:07,760
it didn't look like it worked so I guess

1629
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,760
it's not correct

1630
01:28:19,909 --> 01:28:24,349
so now we have to find out why but do

1631
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:28,210
you think that's fine for the way we're

1632
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:28,210
doing the editing there should just work

1633
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:36,800
all right so let's see if I'm selecting

1634
01:28:33,789 --> 01:28:38,840
this I don't know what I'm selecting

1635
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:44,810
here actually but all right so I'm

1636
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:47,060
selecting something I can kind of see

1637
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:51,050
what the problem probably is there right

1638
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:56,110
I'm selecting an entity but who knows

1639
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:56,110
which piece I was clicking on right

1640
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:07,690
like that will not change this one this

1641
01:29:05,829 --> 01:29:09,760
is just changing the asset index I'm

1642
01:29:07,689 --> 01:29:19,960
looking at but it's not gonna change

1643
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:21,670
yeah hmm so I think I can probably still

1644
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:28,079
do this but that's gonna be a little

1645
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:35,340
trickier I think what I would have to do

1646
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:38,399
is say for the asset index do I want to

1647
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,399
[Music]

1648
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:48,369
let's take a look at this for the asset

1649
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:50,859
index do I actually want to draw the

1650
01:29:48,369 --> 01:29:53,670
children of the asset index and you can

1651
01:29:50,859 --> 01:29:57,089
see that happening here right

1652
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:57,090
so you're saying

1653
01:30:09,569 --> 01:30:16,719
so sing for each of these when we do the

1654
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:18,880
update and rendered no but that should

1655
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:20,860
still work - I'm I think I'm missing

1656
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,109
something here because now that I look

1657
01:30:20,859 --> 01:30:27,539
at it you know where it's drawing that

1658
01:30:23,109 --> 01:30:30,719
those picah bulls across the top

1659
01:30:27,539 --> 01:30:30,720
[Music]

1660
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:45,430
that looked actually fine so here's the

1661
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:50,440
active group asset count and it goes

1662
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:53,289
through there and it's like set active

1663
01:30:50,439 --> 01:31:04,509
asset on this editable asset thing here

1664
01:30:53,289 --> 01:31:06,630
so there's the dev ID why doesn't that

1665
01:31:04,510 --> 01:31:06,630
work

1666
01:31:11,099 --> 01:31:19,469
if that's the dev ID and it's the dev ID

1667
01:31:14,198 --> 01:31:19,469
that's it's created right

1668
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:37,529
right here I don't know man

1669
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:42,369
probably map step it into that because I

1670
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:43,869
don't have a lot of ideas about whether

1671
01:31:42,369 --> 01:31:46,949
we've broken it it seems like this

1672
01:31:43,869 --> 01:31:51,369
should produce the same one right

1673
01:31:46,949 --> 01:31:53,649
whatever the parent piece is here and

1674
01:31:51,369 --> 01:31:56,680
we're just passing the Peace Index here

1675
01:31:53,649 --> 01:32:00,789
so that should match right and so when

1676
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:02,350
you're saying parent dev ID in here that

1677
01:32:00,789 --> 01:32:06,460
should tell me whether the things

1678
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:11,910
visible or not right and I'm not getting

1679
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:11,909
why that wouldn't be the case so like

1680
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:27,029
all of those dev IDs are tracked as far

1681
01:32:24,659 --> 01:32:28,649
as I can tell actually accurately and so

1682
01:32:27,029 --> 01:32:31,409
it should just be able to say look did

1683
01:32:28,649 --> 01:32:33,569
that parent is that parent the one that

1684
01:32:31,409 --> 01:32:35,489
you're focusing on right now and if it

1685
01:32:33,569 --> 01:32:36,059
is I only do it if I should draw the

1686
01:32:35,489 --> 01:32:37,829
children

1687
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:39,120
so let's we're gonna have to step it and

1688
01:32:37,829 --> 01:32:40,500
see I product you compiled a debug mode

1689
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:41,699
I'm not sure because we're gonna want to

1690
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:45,949
look at the actual code there pretty

1691
01:32:41,699 --> 01:32:48,779
carefully so if I select one of these

1692
01:32:45,949 --> 01:32:50,819
right that should actually be switching

1693
01:32:48,779 --> 01:32:52,380
to the actual dev ID it's not just the

1694
01:32:50,819 --> 01:32:55,699
asset it actually knows which one it is

1695
01:32:52,380 --> 01:33:01,529
and then if I turn off the show children

1696
01:32:55,699 --> 01:33:05,479
if that should actually have stopped

1697
01:33:01,529 --> 01:33:08,130
showing that particular anyone who was

1698
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:10,769
attached to this parent so the gloves

1699
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:14,430
should remain but the head should have

1700
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:16,110
disappeared right and I'm not I'm not

1701
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:18,960
seeing anything like that happen it's

1702
01:33:16,109 --> 01:33:22,500
not it doesn't even register that those

1703
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:30,300
two things it might be different so if I

1704
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:31,470
go to like good draw children just

1705
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:34,070
curious if that's ever even getting

1706
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:34,070
called here

1707
01:33:44,569 --> 01:33:51,849
so here's that it's an inline call

1708
01:33:58,119 --> 01:34:01,739
again with a disassembly

1709
01:34:07,038 --> 01:34:13,250
I'm not sure I'm gonna learn much from

1710
01:34:08,538 --> 01:34:25,908
this all right so if we switch to debug

1711
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:28,538
mode and SPECT let's see what's going on

1712
01:34:25,908 --> 01:34:32,348
in here so here's the should draw

1713
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:34,340
children call we're stepping in here and

1714
01:34:32,349 --> 01:34:35,569
not really going to look at anything too

1715
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:38,360
carefully here because we're not gonna

1716
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:41,389
set up for it yet but if we take a look

1717
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:44,569
at the editor draw children as one as we

1718
01:34:41,389 --> 01:34:47,809
would expect the active asset index and

1719
01:34:44,569 --> 01:34:49,670
the highlight ID these are not said

1720
01:34:47,809 --> 01:34:52,820
anything or shouldn't be right now right

1721
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:56,090
and they're not so this will always be

1722
01:34:52,819 --> 01:34:58,009
true and so let's actually you know real

1723
01:34:56,090 --> 01:35:02,679
quick just set ourselves up a situation

1724
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:06,889
where those things won't be true so if I

1725
01:35:02,679 --> 01:35:09,109
click on this and say let me see the HHA

1726
01:35:06,889 --> 01:35:12,889
is on it I'm sorry let me see the

1727
01:35:09,109 --> 01:35:18,399
alignment points I click on this and I

1728
01:35:12,889 --> 01:35:18,400
turn off the show children part like so

1729
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,050
there we go

1730
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:32,539
let me just also make a point for this

1731
01:35:30,329 --> 01:35:32,539
guy

1732
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:47,099
so in this case everything should be set

1733
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:49,630
up properly and of course we're not

1734
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:51,969
seeing anything happen if I set a

1735
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:54,039
breakpoint and should draw children what

1736
01:35:51,969 --> 01:35:56,590
I want to do now is is take a look at

1737
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:58,988
what when we check this and what the

1738
01:35:56,590 --> 01:36:02,409
highlight IDs are versus the ideas being

1739
01:35:58,988 --> 01:36:04,569
passed down so first things first I

1740
01:36:02,409 --> 01:36:08,469
guess should draw children I want to see

1741
01:36:04,569 --> 01:36:10,238
draw children be false it is right so

1742
01:36:08,469 --> 01:36:14,949
that's good and then what I want to do

1743
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:16,899
is say or a hit test editor highlight

1744
01:36:14,949 --> 01:36:19,840
IDE what is that

1745
01:36:16,899 --> 01:36:23,859
versus parent ID right because we've got

1746
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:26,770
two separate things here so looking

1747
01:36:23,859 --> 01:36:29,229
through one thing you can see that's

1748
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:33,700
actually kind of amusing here is pardon

1749
01:36:29,229 --> 01:36:35,619
I guess is not amusing at all so if you

1750
01:36:33,699 --> 01:36:39,099
take a look at these two values what you

1751
01:36:35,619 --> 01:36:43,119
can see here is actually these two are

1752
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:49,079
set to the same thing and these pieces

1753
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:49,079
here and I guess the reason for that

1754
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:54,009
well I guess I'm not sure the reason for

1755
01:36:51,909 --> 01:36:56,859
that is but these two things are set to

1756
01:36:54,010 --> 01:37:05,860
the same value whereas this part here is

1757
01:36:56,859 --> 01:37:07,479
set to actually a pointer into I assume

1758
01:37:05,859 --> 01:37:10,329
I don't actually know what that's trying

1759
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:12,069
to tell me but oh if those the two

1760
01:37:10,329 --> 01:37:19,390
separate u32 values that would break

1761
01:37:12,069 --> 01:37:23,109
into so this is set to something I'm not

1762
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:28,260
sure exactly what it is but this is set

1763
01:37:23,109 --> 01:37:28,259
to what looks like a pointer right

1764
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:42,270
so you can see the two values here I

1765
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:50,439
mean those look very pointer II right so

1766
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:52,449
I'm assuming these are unions right so

1767
01:37:50,439 --> 01:37:54,159
if you take a look at what these are

1768
01:37:52,449 --> 01:37:56,050
pointing to yet I don't really know if

1769
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:58,510
we go back and see how they're created

1770
01:37:56,050 --> 01:38:00,970
so you've got this entity ID dot value

1771
01:37:58,510 --> 01:38:03,880
right and it looks like that's just the

1772
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:05,260
entity number so these are both we're

1773
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,630
being we're asking about something

1774
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:12,220
that's in the same entity then the

1775
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:14,529
bitmap piece value I'll be honest not

1776
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:16,240
sure I understand how this is this dev

1777
01:38:14,529 --> 01:38:18,130
ID from you thirty twos is it's doing

1778
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:19,630
what it's doing because why would you

1779
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:22,470
have all this noise in there the bitmap

1780
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:29,680
piece is just a single value right like

1781
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:31,900
that parent piece is just zero so I'm

1782
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:33,880
not sure why dev ID from you three twos

1783
01:38:31,899 --> 01:38:39,039
is doing something so complicated as

1784
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:41,020
that so I may I may just back up one

1785
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:45,430
second and remind myself what how we

1786
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:50,860
were bundling these so dev ID from you

1787
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:55,090
thirty twos oh okay

1788
01:38:50,859 --> 01:38:57,039
so that right there is our culprit we

1789
01:38:55,090 --> 01:39:05,260
actually differentiate these by location

1790
01:38:57,039 --> 01:39:11,529
in the code and that's really all we

1791
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:17,739
need to know that would do it you know

1792
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:23,079
that's fine I don't mind what that

1793
01:39:17,739 --> 01:39:27,149
essentially means is that that dev ID

1794
01:39:23,079 --> 01:39:27,149
needs to kind of do this sort of thing

1795
01:39:37,529 --> 01:39:43,509
so what we want to do here is say look

1796
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:45,729
we know that we've got this dev ID we

1797
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:47,350
want these to be harmonized types so I'm

1798
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:50,199
just gonna say copy that you know have a

1799
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:52,150
thing that copies types so the same

1800
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:55,319
place that you would do dev ID from you

1801
01:39:52,149 --> 01:39:57,429
three twos right this same thing here I

1802
01:39:55,319 --> 01:40:06,399
would just say look I need to be able to

1803
01:39:57,430 --> 01:40:11,409
copy a type like so and then what it

1804
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:14,920
would do is this part here that's got to

1805
01:40:11,409 --> 01:40:16,059
be harmonized between the two because

1806
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:18,460
that was the differentiator for

1807
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:23,710
different types of these things so the

1808
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:25,960
from value comes out there it goes into

1809
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:28,270
the two value and that should do it

1810
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:30,970
I forgot that we differentiate these by

1811
01:40:28,270 --> 01:40:32,710
where they come from right and that's

1812
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:34,240
somewhat intentional like we because we

1813
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:36,310
want to be able to stuff random garbage

1814
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:37,899
in there and have it actually work so we

1815
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:40,900
want to be able to differentiate you

1816
01:40:37,899 --> 01:40:43,689
know the number zero and one are used as

1817
01:40:40,899 --> 01:40:44,589
actual IDs in lots of places we want to

1818
01:40:43,689 --> 01:40:49,629
be able to use a file name or

1819
01:40:44,590 --> 01:40:51,850
differentiate those two but we won't but

1820
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:54,010
sometimes we want to say oh I'm trying

1821
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:58,770
to refer to the same type as this other

1822
01:40:54,010 --> 01:41:01,510
fellow up here make that happen right

1823
01:40:58,770 --> 01:41:02,530
okay so I think that's probably all we

1824
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:03,850
were doing wrong because I was like we

1825
01:41:02,529 --> 01:41:05,019
weren't doing anything fancy so I was

1826
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:07,480
surprised that it wasn't working that's

1827
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:09,670
why we actually have an additional layer

1828
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:12,309
of differentiation in there that I'd

1829
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:13,659
forgotten about so if I go through here

1830
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:14,860
now and look at these alignment points

1831
01:41:13,659 --> 01:41:19,960
I'm thinking this will probably work

1832
01:41:14,859 --> 01:41:21,939
better or not I need double check that

1833
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:23,109
this guy actually is using alignment

1834
01:41:21,939 --> 01:41:27,000
which I don't actually know if they are

1835
01:41:23,109 --> 01:41:27,000
not add this in here

1836
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:39,460
well that was anticlimactic all right so

1837
01:41:38,439 --> 01:41:52,059
it's worse than that

1838
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:54,270
I guess so we're copying the type now so

1839
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:57,270
those two things should be the same

1840
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:57,270
right

1841
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:10,619
without a looks reasonable and then

1842
01:42:09,239 --> 01:42:12,539
we're asking should have shown yeah

1843
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:15,180
still don't know why that's busted let's

1844
01:42:12,539 --> 01:42:22,220
try one more time so if I create the

1845
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:25,740
same scenario again pick one of these

1846
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:28,320
select this guy through here and say

1847
01:42:25,739 --> 01:42:30,840
don't draw any of children now I go back

1848
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:35,759
here and set a breakpoint what am I

1849
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:38,039
looking at so here's a parent ID we've

1850
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:39,119
got this address of the string now at

1851
01:42:38,039 --> 01:42:43,970
least now we know what we're looking at

1852
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:46,470
there and here's the actual value of the

1853
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:50,250
entity number and the piece index

1854
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:52,530
okay we're looking at the highlighted ID

1855
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:56,609
here to say is this the particular

1856
01:42:52,529 --> 01:43:01,769
person who is being highlighted and it

1857
01:42:56,609 --> 01:43:09,539
is right so this should actually should

1858
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:11,460
draw children this is zero and this

1859
01:43:09,539 --> 01:43:15,319
should fail so this should actually

1860
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:15,319
return false right

1861
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:37,109
aren't those two things equal there's a

1862
01:43:27,399 --> 01:43:37,109
dot value zero so those are equal right

1863
01:43:37,469 --> 01:43:50,038
exactly the same a dot value one e dot

1864
01:43:43,448 --> 01:43:50,038
value one oops maybe I'm wrong

1865
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:01,010
they are slightly different

1866
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:16,670
so how is that possible that those

1867
01:44:13,939 --> 01:44:19,210
things could be off by a tiny amount

1868
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:19,210
like that

1869
01:44:30,248 --> 01:44:38,590
yep Wow I am just totally out to lunch

1870
01:44:35,319 --> 01:44:41,288
today so don't ask me why I thought this

1871
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:44,139
change would persist out of here

1872
01:44:41,288 --> 01:44:50,710
it ain't gonna right you would need to

1873
01:44:44,139 --> 01:44:53,319
do that slow morning huh we did great

1874
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:54,998
with our displacement code and then it

1875
01:44:53,319 --> 01:44:56,498
all kind of went off the rails this

1876
01:44:54,998 --> 01:45:01,179
should have taken like 10 seconds and we

1877
01:44:56,498 --> 01:45:02,710
totally screwed it up but oh well I'm

1878
01:45:01,179 --> 01:45:05,319
gonna say we finally got it this time

1879
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:07,448
right let's just this is go hog-wild

1880
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:09,248
it's compiled release mode and just say

1881
01:45:07,448 --> 01:45:12,939
it's gonna work right I have a good

1882
01:45:09,248 --> 01:45:15,788
feeling about this it says on solo so

1883
01:45:12,939 --> 01:45:18,728
anyway take a look here there we go

1884
01:45:15,788 --> 01:45:19,929
that's all we really wanted right and so

1885
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:23,170
that's that's exactly right

1886
01:45:19,929 --> 01:45:24,940
great okay while we're on that subject

1887
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:29,590
since we don't have a whole lot of time

1888
01:45:24,939 --> 01:45:32,259
right I want to fix this certainly

1889
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:35,590
that's nonsense that's going on here so

1890
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:38,639
when we have the camera motion it counts

1891
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:41,949
as a pic and I want to turn that off

1892
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:48,779
right so I'd like to have the camera

1893
01:45:41,948 --> 01:45:51,428
motion be something that's kind of like

1894
01:45:48,779 --> 01:45:52,719
where it understands that the camera

1895
01:45:51,429 --> 01:45:55,859
when you're doing stuff with the camera

1896
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:55,859
that you're not supposed to do stuff

1897
01:45:56,279 --> 01:46:04,328
with the editor it can be a happy thing

1898
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:08,109
I don't mind if it's hockey

1899
01:46:04,328 --> 01:46:09,969
it just has to not annoy me right and so

1900
01:46:08,109 --> 01:46:12,488
in here if we look at what's going on

1901
01:46:09,969 --> 01:46:17,679
you can see like the mouse up mouse down

1902
01:46:12,488 --> 01:46:19,268
transition index crap I think what I'd

1903
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:20,618
like to do here is say look just don't

1904
01:46:19,269 --> 01:46:21,960
process this with the alt keys down

1905
01:46:20,618 --> 01:46:24,998
because that means I'm using the camera

1906
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:33,149
right so what I might do here is say

1907
01:46:24,998 --> 01:46:36,840
okay this transition stuff let's just

1908
01:46:33,149 --> 01:46:36,839
let's just nerf it

1909
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:43,010
if the alts down and that way the camera

1910
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:49,880
code can just do its own thing we don't

1911
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:51,440
have to worry about it right again this

1912
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:53,750
is just improving the usability of it

1913
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:54,948
for my purposes now doesn't have to be

1914
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:57,979
professional or anything it just needs

1915
01:46:54,948 --> 01:46:59,359
to be usable for me and so like looking

1916
01:46:57,979 --> 01:47:01,189
at something like this what I want to do

1917
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:09,229
is be able to like go into the camera

1918
01:47:01,189 --> 01:47:10,569
mode here and now it's good right so now

1919
01:47:09,229 --> 01:47:12,109
we're not having any of that spurious

1920
01:47:10,569 --> 01:47:14,149
nonsense happen

1921
01:47:12,109 --> 01:47:17,529
we're staying locked into the Edit that

1922
01:47:14,149 --> 01:47:17,529
we wanted to do right

1923
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:34,429
all right so that's a much better

1924
01:47:31,729 --> 01:47:37,518
improve to last thing is this stuff also

1925
01:47:34,429 --> 01:47:40,190
sucks and we have like we've got the

1926
01:47:37,519 --> 01:47:43,340
ability to use the F keys now I think we

1927
01:47:40,189 --> 01:47:45,109
should just use them right so you know

1928
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:52,029
we could just make it so that you know

1929
01:47:45,109 --> 01:47:57,259
there's nothing there's the camera stuff

1930
01:47:52,029 --> 01:48:00,109
there's the the h of TS and and and that

1931
01:47:57,260 --> 01:48:04,099
and then this should just the alignment

1932
01:48:00,109 --> 01:48:07,998
point at it right if I hit f5 so we

1933
01:48:04,099 --> 01:48:12,319
should just like put put that at the

1934
01:48:07,998 --> 01:48:15,469
bottom of this and get rid of that one

1935
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:21,018
and then this can just be its own thing

1936
01:48:15,469 --> 01:48:23,689
right I think that's better right so

1937
01:48:21,019 --> 01:48:25,219
let's try and make that happen again and

1938
01:48:23,689 --> 01:48:27,408
that's just getting rid of just some

1939
01:48:25,219 --> 01:48:28,819
annoyances things that are just you know

1940
01:48:27,408 --> 01:48:31,279
making it more cumbersome to work with

1941
01:48:28,819 --> 01:48:32,389
than it should be I think we're almost

1942
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:33,768
out of time anyway so this is a good

1943
01:48:32,389 --> 01:48:36,849
time to just do a little bit of just a

1944
01:48:33,769 --> 01:48:40,289
little bit of clean-up on that front so

1945
01:48:36,849 --> 01:48:43,720
if I look through here

1946
01:48:40,289 --> 01:48:43,720
[Music]

1947
01:48:49,429 --> 01:49:09,618
this stuff is this stuff is for section

1948
01:49:05,488 --> 01:49:17,879
begin right you can see this section

1949
01:49:09,618 --> 01:49:20,788
info section bitmap editing yeah so I

1950
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:23,069
think the section thing I just will get

1951
01:49:20,788 --> 01:49:25,948
rid of right and then we'll just have a

1952
01:49:23,069 --> 01:49:30,090
couple different ones of this so maybe

1953
01:49:25,948 --> 01:49:34,038
it would just do like HHA editor or

1954
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:36,538
something like you know that and

1955
01:49:34,038 --> 01:49:39,059
everything that was gonna go on in here

1956
01:49:36,538 --> 01:49:42,078
I'm just gonna move out of there so the

1957
01:49:39,059 --> 01:49:46,860
section thing is not is not a thing

1958
01:49:42,078 --> 01:49:52,549
right like maybe that section should

1959
01:49:46,859 --> 01:49:52,549
just be an experiment that goes away so

1960
01:49:53,418 --> 01:50:00,738
this can now just be eliminated this

1961
01:50:02,599 --> 01:50:09,719
will be the info part and that can just

1962
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:12,689
go I think at the bottom so I'm I'm

1963
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:14,849
happy with that actually just going down

1964
01:50:12,689 --> 01:50:17,249
here right

1965
01:50:14,849 --> 01:50:20,429
it'll just append when whatever you're

1966
01:50:17,248 --> 01:50:23,519
looking at it'll just tell you I think

1967
01:50:20,429 --> 01:50:27,949
that's better so that will go away and

1968
01:50:23,519 --> 01:50:37,248
then this can just be deleted as well

1969
01:50:27,948 --> 01:50:37,248
right I think that's all we would need

1970
01:50:37,609 --> 01:50:43,288
so then inside the asset editor we just

1971
01:50:41,609 --> 01:50:45,889
have to know that there's now an

1972
01:50:43,288 --> 01:50:51,090
additional type which is like the HHA

1973
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:54,958
edit part of things as opposed to just

1974
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:56,069
the asset edit or not right and so that

1975
01:50:54,958 --> 01:50:58,319
was there was like a switch statement

1976
01:50:56,069 --> 01:50:59,639
for that where we were just saying like

1977
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:01,329
what kind of thing are we editing in

1978
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:03,279
here you see it here it's

1979
01:51:01,329 --> 01:51:08,109
like re-editing assets or ridding the

1980
01:51:03,279 --> 01:51:15,059
camera so I guess what I'd say here is

1981
01:51:08,109 --> 01:51:15,059
like that

1982
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:24,460
and then I just need to you know look at

1983
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:32,079
where that stuff is actually happening

1984
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:36,600
so if I go to yeah it looks like that

1985
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:41,769
stuff is here for the debug state and

1986
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:54,039
here for the rest of it so that would

1987
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:58,230
probably be like camera assets something

1988
01:51:54,039 --> 01:51:58,229
like that I guess

1989
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:10,330
so looking at how that's actually

1990
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:13,119
working here's where the f key press

1991
01:52:10,329 --> 01:52:18,180
stuff happens so in here we just say

1992
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:18,180
like editing HHA I guess

1993
01:52:31,819 --> 01:52:42,960
almost done all right

1994
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:51,420
I think that gives us everything we need

1995
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:52,739
there evening and this is just to make

1996
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:54,029
it so I don't have to fuss around with

1997
01:52:52,739 --> 01:52:57,809
it so much we can just get right into

1998
01:52:54,029 --> 01:53:01,829
what we want so that's nothing as f1 f2

1999
01:52:57,810 --> 01:53:02,580
gives us the camera information f3 gives

2000
01:53:01,829 --> 01:53:05,309
us

2001
01:53:02,579 --> 01:53:09,720
whatever you know we're looking at here

2002
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:16,410
right we can get rid of these now and

2003
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:18,570
then f4 was supposed to give us the HHA

2004
01:53:16,409 --> 01:53:21,439
but instead of switches to profile that

2005
01:53:18,569 --> 01:53:21,439
seems like a mistake

2006
01:53:30,819 --> 01:53:34,029
that's why

2007
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:47,630
I think that's everything the only thing

2008
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:51,289
I want to do is I want to get rid of

2009
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:53,210
that section picker I don't like it and

2010
01:53:51,289 --> 01:53:54,409
it just gets in the way now because now

2011
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:57,680
I can just do everything with the F keys

2012
01:53:54,409 --> 01:53:59,180
which is much better so I don't really

2013
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:00,710
remember exactly where that was

2014
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:02,920
happening but I suppose it's in here

2015
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:02,920
somewhere

2016
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:09,619
looks like there so let's just get rid

2017
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:14,060
of that so now I think we're just in a

2018
01:54:09,619 --> 01:54:16,369
better place that should pretty much

2019
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:24,530
give us something reasonable that we can

2020
01:54:16,369 --> 01:54:28,609
work with quickly yeah so here's our hht

2021
01:54:24,529 --> 01:54:30,769
stuff here's our asset edit so you know

2022
01:54:28,609 --> 01:54:33,639
we can now quickly get in there and pick

2023
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:35,510
everything that we want here's our

2024
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:37,130
camera which we don't really need that

2025
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:38,600
like cameras pretty solid right now so

2026
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:40,489
we don't really use that but you know we

2027
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,090
might want to play with us again in the

2028
01:54:40,489 --> 01:54:44,899
future

2029
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:50,060
add something more there but that seems

2030
01:54:44,899 --> 01:54:52,670
pretty good yeah it feels like these

2031
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:54,200
probably should be only if you're in the

2032
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:57,409
asset editor I mean they don't need to

2033
01:54:54,199 --> 01:55:01,179
be there for other things probably but I

2034
01:54:57,409 --> 01:55:01,180
don't know I'll leave them for now I

2035
01:55:06,279 --> 01:55:09,639
guess that's it

2036
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,890
so now we would really be back to just

2037
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:18,890
let's play with the art system a little

2038
01:55:15,890 --> 01:55:20,869
bit and let's get this stuff together so

2039
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:23,090
you know I would want to first of all

2040
01:55:20,869 --> 01:55:25,189
take a minute to get the hero looking

2041
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:29,110
roughly correct other than the fact that

2042
01:55:25,189 --> 01:55:31,189
the head in the actual assets is wrong

2043
01:55:29,109 --> 01:55:34,489
but it should be pretty straightforward

2044
01:55:31,189 --> 01:55:40,849
right so we know that we've got this

2045
01:55:34,489 --> 01:55:43,309
part here if I pick for example this I

2046
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:47,270
need to add two things to it right I've

2047
01:55:43,310 --> 01:55:48,740
got the one for the worlds and you know

2048
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:51,340
just looking at where that should be

2049
01:55:48,739 --> 01:55:54,579
I don't know it probably would be like

2050
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:54,579
something like that

2051
01:55:55,260 --> 01:56:00,369
just about like where it where it is

2052
01:55:58,270 --> 01:56:02,739
standing in the world I don't know it's

2053
01:56:00,368 --> 01:56:05,829
pretty hard it's pretty close to 5050

2054
01:56:02,738 --> 01:56:09,428
actually where it probably is standing

2055
01:56:05,829 --> 01:56:12,460
and then where the head is just looking

2056
01:56:09,429 --> 01:56:15,670
at that I'd say it's probably gonna

2057
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:19,948
attach like I know right there would be

2058
01:56:15,670 --> 01:56:22,840
where the base of the neck is right I

2059
01:56:19,948 --> 01:56:26,079
think that's about right

2060
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:28,539
looking at the the head piece now that's

2061
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:31,179
really only got this part we should get

2062
01:56:28,539 --> 01:56:32,439
hats in here soon there's some actually

2063
01:56:31,179 --> 01:56:36,039
in the file there right oops that's

2064
01:56:32,439 --> 01:56:37,809
two-parent and so yeah looking at where

2065
01:56:36,039 --> 01:56:41,460
that should be aligned it's probably

2066
01:56:37,810 --> 01:56:44,289
something like that I'm guessing right

2067
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:46,810
it seems about right

2068
01:56:44,289 --> 01:56:51,698
so then again yeah looking in here if I

2069
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:54,420
go ahead and add one of these on here I

2070
01:56:51,698 --> 01:56:56,618
don't know where that should be exactly

2071
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:58,179
but it's probably something like that

2072
01:56:56,618 --> 01:57:00,250
and then looking at where the head is

2073
01:56:58,179 --> 01:57:02,679
attached it's probably somewhere like

2074
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:05,920
there right looking at this particular

2075
01:57:02,679 --> 01:57:07,539
piece again this is gonna have to be

2076
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,949
edited a little bit but it's probably

2077
01:57:07,539 --> 01:57:11,738
because it's facing the wrong direction

2078
01:57:08,948 --> 01:57:14,259
should be facing leftward but the art

2079
01:57:11,738 --> 01:57:16,319
asset files have it flipped but it's

2080
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:21,340
probably something like that right and

2081
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:23,229
so if I keep going through here looking

2082
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:29,610
at that switch you can see it's a little

2083
01:57:23,229 --> 01:57:29,609
bit off probably so if I if I

2084
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:45,100
not sure who is more correct I'm not

2085
01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:48,670
sure who is more correct there but you

2086
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:57,340
can see it going a little bit off oops

2087
01:57:48,670 --> 01:58:00,480
that's the wrong one it probably should

2088
01:57:57,340 --> 01:58:06,220
be more like that it seems pretty dialed

2089
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:12,099
let's take a look at this one so that's

2090
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:14,770
not the right frame is it oh it is yeah

2091
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:16,950
turn off that that's show children thing

2092
01:58:14,770 --> 01:58:20,470
is very important I'm glad we added that

2093
01:58:16,949 --> 01:58:25,439
so yeah not sure where that should line

2094
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:25,440
up exactly but something like that

2095
01:58:50,738 --> 01:58:58,538
so probably something like that if I

2096
01:58:55,658 --> 01:59:02,158
turn on the head point there that's like

2097
01:58:58,538 --> 01:59:02,158
yeah probably then something like that

2098
01:59:03,359 --> 01:59:14,069
those green points are really far field

2099
01:59:06,309 --> 01:59:14,070
though which is a little weird

2100
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:24,520
oh I forgot I have undo keep thinking

2101
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:28,930
hey this is cool we made ourselves a

2102
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:33,730
partisan heaven do it does so I'm

2103
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:36,180
guessing it's more like that that looks

2104
01:59:33,729 --> 01:59:36,179
about right

2105
01:59:39,609 --> 01:59:43,049
and let's take a look at this guy

2106
01:59:46,369 --> 01:59:52,789
that's about right this one is basic

2107
01:59:49,399 --> 01:59:57,170
neck that's probably something like that

2108
01:59:52,789 --> 02:00:05,359
right all right

2109
01:59:57,170 --> 02:00:08,659
so now I want this to just have a two

2110
02:00:05,359 --> 02:00:11,000
parent on there so I don't know where

2111
02:00:08,659 --> 02:00:17,960
that would attach exactly but yeah

2112
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:27,770
probably somewhere like there and then

2113
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:30,500
four here yeah like more like that would

2114
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:33,190
be where the neck would be I guess and

2115
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:33,189
here

2116
02:00:46,229 --> 02:00:54,099
and so I think that's all the alignment

2117
02:00:49,319 --> 02:00:59,469
for that it's now correct so if I ask it

2118
02:00:54,100 --> 02:01:02,410
to save that I hopefully that's right

2119
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:03,699
now you know again bunch of work so now

2120
02:01:02,409 --> 02:01:06,090
we want to see you know does this

2121
02:01:03,699 --> 02:01:09,399
actually work I have no idea if it does

2122
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:10,989
so if I load it now are all those

2123
02:01:09,399 --> 02:01:15,719
remembered and they are all right so

2124
02:01:10,989 --> 02:01:15,719
that's good we're getting there

2125
02:01:15,729 --> 02:01:18,849
so that's pretty good you can see it

2126
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:20,500
looks like we're getting a little bit of

2127
02:01:18,850 --> 02:01:21,670
an of an inter penetration there so we

2128
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:26,710
may have to take a look at that

2129
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:30,880
alignment for when like that that

2130
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:33,189
shearing because we're using a fixed

2131
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:34,810
distance like I was saying before that

2132
02:01:33,189 --> 02:01:36,099
interpenetration for the shearing may be

2133
02:01:34,810 --> 02:01:43,270
a problem so you probably look at that

2134
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:49,990
as we go otherwise you have looking

2135
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:53,430
pretty good right we can put heads on

2136
02:01:49,989 --> 02:01:53,429
some of these fellows too now

2137
02:02:00,349 --> 02:02:04,309
I don't know why I can't is the reason

2138
02:02:02,838 --> 02:02:05,719
I'm not seeing in alignment point there

2139
02:02:04,309 --> 02:02:08,139
oh right because it only shows up in

2140
02:02:05,719 --> 02:02:08,139
debug

2141
02:02:17,689 --> 02:02:25,929
all right so the cat probably sits on

2142
02:02:22,729 --> 02:02:27,949
its base something like that

2143
02:02:25,929 --> 02:02:30,309
you know it's gonna be honest haunches

2144
02:02:27,948 --> 02:02:36,859
sort of right like this sort of thing

2145
02:02:30,309 --> 02:02:39,079
the base of neck is gonna be like there

2146
02:02:36,859 --> 02:02:42,408
it's got a really pronounced location

2147
02:02:39,078 --> 02:02:44,389
for that so that's pretty easy let's go

2148
02:02:42,408 --> 02:02:49,368
back to show children let's get the cat

2149
02:02:44,389 --> 02:02:54,949
head on there so that's gonna be like

2150
02:02:49,368 --> 02:02:59,319
their ish right and off we go

2151
02:02:54,948 --> 02:03:04,248
so our cat has a nice little set up now

2152
02:02:59,319 --> 02:03:05,118
I don't know what this dude is doing I

2153
02:03:04,248 --> 02:03:07,849
can't remember his name

2154
02:03:05,118 --> 02:03:09,639
it's like layered I think although the

2155
02:03:07,849 --> 02:03:11,809
bodies are generic now we don't actually

2156
02:03:09,639 --> 02:03:15,050
this is the body that originally went

2157
02:03:11,809 --> 02:03:19,998
with layered I think but we don't

2158
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:21,559
actually we're letting heads and bodies

2159
02:03:19,998 --> 02:03:22,668
be freely interchangeable now so it

2160
02:03:21,559 --> 02:03:27,800
doesn't actually matter whose body this

2161
02:03:22,668 --> 02:03:29,599
was originally um so there's the base of

2162
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:35,479
neck and that's not weird

2163
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:37,519
so case in point let's let's get that

2164
02:03:35,479 --> 02:03:40,699
set up properly I'm going to turn off

2165
02:03:37,519 --> 02:03:43,400
show children right there's our bases

2166
02:03:40,698 --> 02:03:47,118
neck they're back again let's figure out

2167
02:03:43,399 --> 02:03:52,388
where that head goes add that there and

2168
02:03:47,118 --> 02:03:52,389
put that to basically the right place

2169
02:03:54,578 --> 02:04:00,018
probably should keep it at this camera

2170
02:03:56,748 --> 02:04:01,668
angle when we're doing this looking here

2171
02:04:00,019 --> 02:04:04,489
yeah that's in the right place this is

2172
02:04:01,668 --> 02:04:09,578
not quite so it should be more like that

2173
02:04:04,488 --> 02:04:09,578
and I think that's right now

2174
02:04:16,738 --> 02:04:22,859
so you can see how much distance there

2175
02:04:20,819 --> 02:04:24,809
is movement there and it looks like it's

2176
02:04:22,859 --> 02:04:29,069
too much like it gets a little too

2177
02:04:24,810 --> 02:04:31,440
displaced from the body in that case now

2178
02:04:29,069 --> 02:04:32,670
we could there's a couple different ways

2179
02:04:31,439 --> 02:04:33,779
we could look at that but I think that

2180
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:36,480
just means that there's too much

2181
02:04:33,779 --> 02:04:39,689
displacement as far as the orphans are

2182
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:44,279
concerned with how much off of the body

2183
02:04:39,689 --> 02:04:46,559
they are right and the player I guess in

2184
02:04:44,279 --> 02:04:48,689
this case same thing right maybe I went

2185
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:51,989
a little bit too overboard on that cuz

2186
02:04:48,689 --> 02:04:53,699
you can kind of see for the head that's

2187
02:04:51,988 --> 02:04:56,309
case now part of that might just because

2188
02:04:53,699 --> 02:04:59,309
the heads are too small on these right

2189
02:04:56,310 --> 02:05:00,690
like that head looks too small compared

2190
02:04:59,310 --> 02:05:02,580
to like the politicize the player head

2191
02:05:00,689 --> 02:05:04,289
so it could be that we want those heads

2192
02:05:02,579 --> 02:05:05,909
to be bigger or maybe the bodies need to

2193
02:05:04,289 --> 02:05:08,159
be bigger as well right like it's hard

2194
02:05:05,909 --> 02:05:10,319
to say but again that's the kind of

2195
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:11,819
thing that we can tweak with now we got

2196
02:05:10,319 --> 02:05:14,369
a kind of side but like you can imagine

2197
02:05:11,819 --> 02:05:18,449
if we made that head bigger right it

2198
02:05:14,369 --> 02:05:19,680
might be different or if the attachment

2199
02:05:18,449 --> 02:05:20,909
point was placed a little bit

2200
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:24,900
differently right like if it's um more

2201
02:05:20,909 --> 02:05:27,539
like that so yeah let me see what ends

2202
02:05:24,899 --> 02:05:28,829
up happening there yeah it's just if the

2203
02:05:27,539 --> 02:05:36,449
displacement looks like it's gonna be a

2204
02:05:28,829 --> 02:05:37,619
little bit too much so I think that's

2205
02:05:36,449 --> 02:05:41,340
probably will something we'll have to

2206
02:05:37,619 --> 02:05:42,930
get into next time and I think that I

2207
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:44,760
probably do next time but it is it's

2208
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:49,260
getting really good I mean it's getting

2209
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:50,520
pretty close to right what that

2210
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:55,560
displacement is just a little too it too

2211
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:57,750
much too pronounced so have to tone it

2212
02:05:55,560 --> 02:06:01,200
down just a little bit just give it a

2213
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:03,710
little less Z Delta right and then I

2214
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:03,710
think we're fine

2215
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:11,399
all right QA

2216
02:06:28,069 --> 02:06:33,299
0l PBM says shouldn't body pieces

2217
02:06:30,979 --> 02:06:38,789
displacement be a function of camera

2218
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:42,449
distance and maybe angle distance no

2219
02:06:38,789 --> 02:06:46,590
angle yes and it is currently a function

2220
02:06:42,449 --> 02:06:50,130
of the angle that's actually exactly how

2221
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:52,260
we implemented it right but I am not

2222
02:06:50,130 --> 02:06:57,420
sure why the distance of the camera

2223
02:06:52,260 --> 02:07:01,860
would change how you want us place it I

2224
02:06:57,420 --> 02:07:04,859
there's really no reason why the far

2225
02:07:01,859 --> 02:07:08,059
onus of the camera should change the way

2226
02:07:04,859 --> 02:07:08,059
one's place it right

2227
02:07:47,889 --> 02:07:52,639
um we can't really do the gloves yet

2228
02:07:50,658 --> 02:07:55,189
because we need to actually put in code

2229
02:07:52,639 --> 02:07:59,569
for how the gloves are gonna float right

2230
02:07:55,189 --> 02:08:07,368
and so we kind of want to do that as a

2231
02:07:59,569 --> 02:08:11,750
separate thing no I'm saying we do want

2232
02:08:07,368 --> 02:08:14,868
to do hats because there actually are

2233
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:20,479
some hats in there right now and so we

2234
02:08:14,868 --> 02:08:23,269
should add hats as another thing to test

2235
02:08:20,479 --> 02:08:25,129
the alignment stuff right

2236
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:30,889
but again that's kind of more of

2237
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:32,210
something for a different day maybe

2238
02:08:30,889 --> 02:08:33,710
turned out letting quality bug mr.

2239
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:35,090
Vivaan reinvest your skin I think we're

2240
02:08:33,710 --> 02:08:39,020
actually gonna do is just fix the

2241
02:08:35,090 --> 02:08:40,310
lighting sometime soon what cracks a few

2242
02:08:39,020 --> 02:08:45,050
guys does Hammond here he is right now

2243
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:46,420
it just uses OpenGL it's the only one

2244
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:49,099
that use this right now

2245
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:50,750
and that was done because that was like

2246
02:08:49,099 --> 02:08:52,849
the most cross-platform thing I could

2247
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:57,889
use at the time so I thought it would

2248
02:08:52,849 --> 02:08:59,090
help people be able to like there's

2249
02:08:57,889 --> 02:09:02,539
people who try to follow along i like

2250
02:08:59,090 --> 02:09:04,489
mac and linux and stuff and it was you

2251
02:09:02,539 --> 02:09:06,109
know the easiest thing for I think

2252
02:09:04,488 --> 02:09:08,589
everyone to be able to use a little bit

2253
02:09:06,109 --> 02:09:08,589
of at least

2254
02:09:12,510 --> 02:09:18,070
no I think this is what the final final

2255
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:21,760
lighting will look like roughly I think

2256
02:09:18,069 --> 02:09:31,409
I'll just be faster right because it

2257
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:35,710
looks like what I want right you know

2258
02:09:31,409 --> 02:09:37,300
that is roughly what I want the only

2259
02:09:35,710 --> 02:09:40,480
thing we're not doing right now is we

2260
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:43,180
don't like the sprites and when I do the

2261
02:09:40,479 --> 02:09:44,468
improved lighting pass we will light the

2262
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:46,239
sprites with the same lights we're

2263
02:09:44,469 --> 02:09:49,449
lighting the same lighting we're using

2264
02:09:46,238 --> 02:09:50,709
for the world I'll probably be able to

2265
02:09:49,449 --> 02:09:55,300
take some more of the flicker out of it

2266
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:56,890
- in the final pass like hopefully but

2267
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:59,130
other than that no it's that's what it

2268
02:09:56,890 --> 02:09:59,130
looks like

2269
02:10:08,948 --> 02:10:12,609
I thought I'd respiratory I followed 15

2270
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:19,929
of your videos and I'm in a game dev

2271
02:10:12,609 --> 02:10:22,170
studio that's pretty quick which 15 nice

2272
02:10:19,929 --> 02:10:22,170
work

2273
02:10:34,989 --> 02:10:40,779
have you tried a Vulcan on any project

2274
02:10:37,210 --> 02:10:42,970
yet not I just don't think it's useful

2275
02:10:40,779 --> 02:10:44,500
so I have not put any more time to it

2276
02:10:42,970 --> 02:10:48,690
other than when I initially looked at it

2277
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:51,130
to determine that it wasn't good so I

2278
02:10:48,689 --> 02:10:53,649
probably will never look at it again I'm

2279
02:10:51,130 --> 02:10:55,150
guessing because like I said I don't see

2280
02:10:53,649 --> 02:11:04,179
I don't see it having a reason to exist

2281
02:10:55,149 --> 02:11:05,739
at the immediate moment well cause of

2282
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:08,590
the flickering in the lighting well it's

2283
02:11:05,739 --> 02:11:10,659
because we can't sample all of the rays

2284
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:12,489
so we basically have to just sample a

2285
02:11:10,659 --> 02:11:16,000
subset of how the lighting is is being

2286
02:11:12,489 --> 02:11:17,439
translated around and so that subset

2287
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:21,300
that we're picking changes every frame

2288
02:11:17,439 --> 02:11:21,299
and that's what leads to the flickering

2289
02:11:23,970 --> 02:11:28,449
the skewing when moving on why is only

2290
02:11:26,739 --> 02:11:32,559
applied to the body should the head also

2291
02:11:28,449 --> 02:11:34,630
be modified um I don't know again that's

2292
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:36,640
sort of something we can play with like

2293
02:11:34,630 --> 02:11:38,199
a little later on down the road when

2294
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:41,740
we're doing some more work with

2295
02:11:38,199 --> 02:11:45,359
animation sorts of things for right now

2296
02:11:41,739 --> 02:11:48,969
it seems fine to me

2297
02:11:45,359 --> 02:11:52,269
as it is I would like the head to be

2298
02:11:48,970 --> 02:11:55,920
bobbing which it's not at the moment so

2299
02:11:52,270 --> 02:11:55,920
we'd probably add that but yeah

2300
02:12:09,948 --> 02:12:21,609
it's like that's a bit using Monte Carlo

2301
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:25,100
integration yes in a sense it's using a

2302
02:12:21,609 --> 02:12:28,309
kind of a couple different things it's

2303
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:31,219
based on randomized sampling but it's

2304
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:34,640
it's highly stratified like so it's not

2305
02:12:31,219 --> 02:12:37,329
really Monte Carlo in the pure sense of

2306
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:39,619
the word I mean anything that that does

2307
02:12:37,329 --> 02:12:40,760
randomize sampling is kind of in the

2308
02:12:39,619 --> 02:12:43,779
Monte Carlo camp

2309
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:46,640
but we're fairly regularize there and

2310
02:12:43,779 --> 02:12:50,809
the other thing is we also smooth over

2311
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:52,460
time so we're also kind of not just a

2312
02:12:50,810 --> 02:12:55,520
straight you know you could write a

2313
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:56,659
straight Monte Carlo lighting thing that

2314
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:57,800
didn't do any of those things so we

2315
02:12:56,659 --> 02:13:01,909
don't do that

2316
02:12:57,800 --> 02:13:04,150
but but we are fundamentally doing that

2317
02:13:01,909 --> 02:13:04,149
yes

2318
02:13:13,519 --> 02:13:18,079
if they're a good article on camera in

2319
02:13:16,609 --> 02:13:20,569
the computer graphics field or video

2320
02:13:18,078 --> 02:13:23,799
games I'm really or I'm ready to learn

2321
02:13:20,569 --> 02:13:23,799
in detail about the camera

2322
02:13:38,158 --> 02:13:42,269
you know there might be

2323
02:14:14,039 --> 02:14:18,420
you're looking for this sort of stuff

2324
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:21,499
right

2325
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:21,498
[Music]

2326
02:14:39,550 --> 02:14:49,730
this is not particularly introductory so

2327
02:14:46,399 --> 02:14:52,299
I guess you know there's gonna be I

2328
02:14:49,729 --> 02:14:55,429
would chase around references in here

2329
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:55,430
[Music]

2330
02:15:11,630 --> 02:15:19,960
you know Mitchell Hanrahan Oh Don

2331
02:15:15,739 --> 02:15:22,099
Mitchell in fact who is a friend of mine

2332
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:26,649
he's the guy who taught me rate racing

2333
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:29,060
actually I mean advance rate racing

2334
02:15:26,649 --> 02:15:31,219
let's look let's look at what he had to

2335
02:15:29,060 --> 02:15:36,230
say and Pat Hanrahan obviously everyone

2336
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:40,190
knows who that hanhan is or I hope you

2337
02:15:36,229 --> 02:15:41,929
know who Batman is so this is a nice old

2338
02:15:40,189 --> 02:15:44,379
one realistic camera model for computer

2339
02:15:41,930 --> 02:15:44,380
graphics

2340
02:15:52,859 --> 02:15:56,089
this is looking good

2341
02:16:03,158 --> 02:16:09,729
this is looking good this this might be

2342
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:13,030
a good place to start they've got a lot

2343
02:16:09,729 --> 02:16:16,629
of stuff in here right so here you can

2344
02:16:13,029 --> 02:16:18,819
see them talking about like how the lens

2345
02:16:16,630 --> 02:16:21,429
aperture how the lights going through it

2346
02:16:18,819 --> 02:16:25,149
right and what it's doing and that's

2347
02:16:21,429 --> 02:16:29,619
really what we want to know right the

2348
02:16:25,149 --> 02:16:31,920
thin lens approximation is like kind of

2349
02:16:29,619 --> 02:16:33,099
the old-school way right the thick lens

2350
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:34,870
approximation

2351
02:16:33,099 --> 02:16:37,030
well thin lens is still better than

2352
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:40,570
pinhole camera but thick lenses

2353
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:43,210
approximation is like talking about

2354
02:16:40,569 --> 02:16:48,819
lenses that actually have some light

2355
02:16:43,209 --> 02:16:50,259
behavior inside them and so this might

2356
02:16:48,819 --> 02:16:52,420
be a good place to start I don't know I

2357
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:55,590
can only skim it from here but this

2358
02:16:52,420 --> 02:16:55,590
might be a good place to start

2359
02:16:59,888 --> 02:17:03,568
I also don't know if like

2360
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:32,040
for some reason I thought this book

2361
02:17:35,668 --> 02:17:52,439
was like made available for free

2362
02:17:39,799 --> 02:17:54,738
somewhere recently maybe I'm worried

2363
02:17:52,439 --> 02:17:54,738
about that

2364
02:18:03,138 --> 02:18:14,019
this is what I'm talking about you could

2365
02:18:11,629 --> 02:18:14,019
try this

2366
02:18:36,318 --> 02:18:43,189
here we go here's the thin lens model do

2367
02:18:40,379 --> 02:18:43,188
they get too thick lens

2368
02:18:50,870 --> 02:18:55,540
I hear ya

2369
02:19:01,239 --> 02:19:12,010
so this might be another place you could

2370
02:19:03,459 --> 02:19:13,750
try right here PB are booked org 320

2371
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:19,090
teen slash camera models that HTML

2372
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:20,590
camera under square miles a tional you

2373
02:19:19,090 --> 02:19:23,409
know your mileage may vary depends on

2374
02:19:20,590 --> 02:19:27,299
who you like to read right I find this

2375
02:19:23,409 --> 02:19:30,218
book I find isn't written it's in that

2376
02:19:27,299 --> 02:19:32,768
like literate programming style where

2377
02:19:30,218 --> 02:19:35,799
the code in the book are together I find

2378
02:19:32,769 --> 02:19:37,090
it really not great but it does have

2379
02:19:35,799 --> 02:19:41,619
like all the information kind of

2380
02:19:37,090 --> 02:19:43,120
collected in one place so I find it a

2381
02:19:41,620 --> 02:19:48,370
little hard to read but if you can get

2382
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:50,170
past that nonsense that that might be

2383
02:19:48,370 --> 02:19:59,380
something to think about

2384
02:19:50,170 --> 02:20:01,120
right I don't know if that helps my

2385
02:19:59,379 --> 02:20:02,920
regarding volcán I wonder why you don't

2386
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:04,210
think it's relevant well I think I've

2387
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:05,978
said this like a billion times though

2388
02:20:04,209 --> 02:20:07,299
it's not relevant because nobody's

2389
02:20:05,978 --> 02:20:09,369
platforms making it their priority

2390
02:20:07,299 --> 02:20:13,869
rendering system other than Android

2391
02:20:09,370 --> 02:20:17,560
right games are shipped on PC primarily

2392
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:19,180
and that's d3 d12 or D 3 D 11

2393
02:20:17,559 --> 02:20:24,000
that's what Microsoft pushes they don't

2394
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:29,020
push Vulcan right so that's the platform

2395
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:31,180
renderer there Mac I said nobody gets to

2396
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:33,280
do anything it's all metal right like

2397
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:35,500
everything's on top of metal and forget

2398
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:38,110
the rest of you right so they're not

2399
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:39,760
putting resources into Vulcan people

2400
02:20:38,110 --> 02:20:40,270
just have to make Vulcan work on Mac as

2401
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:41,770
best they can

2402
02:20:40,270 --> 02:20:43,390
right just like OpenGL or something so

2403
02:20:41,770 --> 02:20:47,710
it's metal is the thing that Apple said

2404
02:20:43,389 --> 02:20:50,349
is what we're doing right PlayStation 4

2405
02:20:47,709 --> 02:20:53,709
not Vulcan at all

2406
02:20:50,350 --> 02:20:56,440
has nothing to do with Vulcan right it's

2407
02:20:53,709 --> 02:20:58,779
you know the you know the ambi it sort

2408
02:20:56,440 --> 02:21:00,610
of more I mean it's vaguely related in

2409
02:20:58,780 --> 02:21:02,620
the SEC's fact that it's like the Andy

2410
02:21:00,610 --> 02:21:05,319
style stuff but it's it's the custom ps4

2411
02:21:02,620 --> 02:21:11,170
one the Xbox one definitely not right

2412
02:21:05,319 --> 02:21:12,549
that's d3 d12 style and then I guess

2413
02:21:11,170 --> 02:21:13,989
you're left with a Nintendo switch I

2414
02:21:12,549 --> 02:21:14,259
don't know what people tend to use on

2415
02:21:13,989 --> 02:21:16,959
that

2416
02:21:14,260 --> 02:21:18,760
but they have their own API obviously so

2417
02:21:16,959 --> 02:21:21,368
it's just like really for the types of

2418
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:23,109
games we talk about its ps4 Xbox one

2419
02:21:21,369 --> 02:21:25,390
maybe Nintendo switch maybe not

2420
02:21:23,109 --> 02:21:29,380
depending on how high horsepower you're

2421
02:21:25,389 --> 02:21:31,180
shooting and then PC and Mac Vulcan is

2422
02:21:29,379 --> 02:21:33,728
like nowhere to be found it's a

2423
02:21:31,180 --> 02:21:36,550
secondary like on top of compatibility

2424
02:21:33,728 --> 02:21:38,408
layer kind of thing at best so I have no

2425
02:21:36,549 --> 02:21:40,209
idea why you would use it right you're

2426
02:21:38,408 --> 02:21:46,328
you're not gonna ship that native on

2427
02:21:40,209 --> 02:21:50,889
whit on iOS or Mac you're gonna ship a

2428
02:21:46,328 --> 02:21:53,680
metal driver version and so why would

2429
02:21:50,889 --> 02:21:55,510
your second driver version be Vulcan

2430
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:58,380
when it could just be d3 d12 and you'd

2431
02:21:55,510 --> 02:22:01,059
be on Microsoft's native path right I

2432
02:21:58,379 --> 02:22:03,728
mean just it doesn't make any sense so I

2433
02:22:01,059 --> 02:22:06,158
really don't see Vulcan serves like no

2434
02:22:03,728 --> 02:22:08,170
purpose I don't know what you would use

2435
02:22:06,158 --> 02:22:12,309
it for it's it's just that it's just

2436
02:22:08,170 --> 02:22:14,078
clogging up the works right if vendors

2437
02:22:12,309 --> 02:22:15,969
decided that they're gonna get together

2438
02:22:14,078 --> 02:22:17,408
and that's good the primary API that

2439
02:22:15,969 --> 02:22:19,389
you're gonna use on these platforms is

2440
02:22:17,408 --> 02:22:21,368
going to be Vulcan great but that's not

2441
02:22:19,389 --> 02:22:22,959
what happened the OS vendors decided

2442
02:22:21,369 --> 02:22:25,390
that they're that they're api's are the

2443
02:22:22,959 --> 02:22:29,589
ones are gonna get used so that's what

2444
02:22:25,389 --> 02:22:30,639
happened if in the future people discard

2445
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:31,779
those and they say we're not gonna use

2446
02:22:30,639 --> 02:22:34,118
metal anymore we're gonna switch to

2447
02:22:31,779 --> 02:22:38,710
Vulcan then it becomes then it makes

2448
02:22:34,119 --> 02:22:45,699
sense right but that's just not nobody

2449
02:22:38,709 --> 02:22:47,368
did that right we're going to compose

2450
02:22:45,699 --> 02:22:50,199
specific particle effects of the editor

2451
02:22:47,369 --> 02:22:51,489
I don't know we could put parameters for

2452
02:22:50,199 --> 02:22:52,748
particles in there we haven't played

2453
02:22:51,488 --> 02:22:55,748
with particles much other than to make

2454
02:22:52,748 --> 02:22:57,789
sure that we could do them so we

2455
02:22:55,748 --> 02:23:01,930
probably do have to do that at some

2456
02:22:57,789 --> 02:23:03,850
point right whether or not we bother

2457
02:23:01,930 --> 02:23:06,748
making any editable things in there I'm

2458
02:23:03,850 --> 02:23:06,748
not sure but we might

2459
02:23:15,659 --> 02:23:23,129
all right we all done we all done here

2460
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:23,129
think rel about here

2461
02:23:55,148 --> 02:23:58,868
to us which is kind of pushing Vulcan

2462
02:23:57,129 --> 02:24:00,699
isn't it which is I guess kind of

2463
02:23:58,869 --> 02:24:02,709
similar to mobile programming yeah I

2464
02:24:00,699 --> 02:24:06,969
don't know what they're gonna do with

2465
02:24:02,709 --> 02:24:09,369
that like I said it's entirely possible

2466
02:24:06,968 --> 02:24:12,218
that in the future people could decide

2467
02:24:09,369 --> 02:24:13,899
to switch to it if like Microsoft

2468
02:24:12,218 --> 02:24:15,759
decided they don't want to maintain a

2469
02:24:13,898 --> 02:24:18,849
separate API anymore and they switched

2470
02:24:15,759 --> 02:24:21,009
to it or something right then it becomes

2471
02:24:18,850 --> 02:24:24,759
a compelling use case at the moment it's

2472
02:24:21,009 --> 02:24:26,020
just I just don't see the point you know

2473
02:24:24,759 --> 02:24:27,578
what you're doing with the graphics API

2474
02:24:26,020 --> 02:24:29,619
is you're trying to minimize the amount

2475
02:24:27,578 --> 02:24:32,318
of compatibility headaches that you have

2476
02:24:29,619 --> 02:24:33,759
and really the only way to minimize the

2477
02:24:32,318 --> 02:24:37,179
compatibility headaches that you have is

2478
02:24:33,759 --> 02:24:38,738
to use the OS vendors preferred API like

2479
02:24:37,179 --> 02:24:43,119
you just don't really have another

2480
02:24:38,738 --> 02:24:44,259
choice and so it's fine you something

2481
02:24:43,119 --> 02:24:46,270
like OpenGL or Vulcan for

2482
02:24:44,259 --> 02:24:48,789
experimentation or development purposes

2483
02:24:46,270 --> 02:24:50,588
or even on handmade hero we could have

2484
02:24:48,789 --> 02:24:52,389
decided to use it because it's an

2485
02:24:50,588 --> 02:24:54,699
educational stream but when you're

2486
02:24:52,388 --> 02:24:57,298
actually talking about what do you need

2487
02:24:54,699 --> 02:25:00,810
to do to ship the game you absolutely

2488
02:24:57,299 --> 02:25:03,159
don't want to use a different API

2489
02:25:00,809 --> 02:25:04,658
shipping a game on OpenGL is like

2490
02:25:03,158 --> 02:25:08,020
fraught with peril

2491
02:25:04,658 --> 02:25:11,020
you really want to not do that right you

2492
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:13,328
want to ship it on d3d and metal and the

2493
02:25:11,020 --> 02:25:16,119
same will be true a Vulcan i 100%

2494
02:25:13,328 --> 02:25:17,859
guarantee you you can do it it's just

2495
02:25:16,119 --> 02:25:20,049
you're creating a huge amount of extra

2496
02:25:17,859 --> 02:25:26,949
work for yourself for no real reason

2497
02:25:20,049 --> 02:25:29,259
right and so that's what I would say now

2498
02:25:26,949 --> 02:25:31,719
if in the future like I said if people

2499
02:25:29,259 --> 02:25:34,869
maybe get on board with it and so people

2500
02:25:31,718 --> 02:25:39,099
say okay we're gonna like support this

2501
02:25:34,869 --> 02:25:40,179
API as our platform native API that

2502
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:42,369
would be great

2503
02:25:40,179 --> 02:25:43,509
I wish Vulcan were a better API so we

2504
02:25:42,369 --> 02:25:46,029
could Center it as someone that wasn't

2505
02:25:43,509 --> 02:25:50,559
crappy but like hey at least at that

2506
02:25:46,029 --> 02:25:51,879
point it's fine because you know that

2507
02:25:50,559 --> 02:25:54,269
the compatibility headaches will go away

2508
02:25:51,879 --> 02:25:54,270
right

2509
02:25:58,011 --> 02:26:11,940
that's my opinion on anyway what it's

2510
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:13,860
about say struck name who's member name

2511
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:18,590
equals AB yeah that's a good that's a

2512
02:26:13,860 --> 02:26:18,590
good point that's a very very good point

2513
02:26:42,909 --> 02:26:47,500
yeah I would see a sue looking ahead to

2514
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:49,930
the future - I would say that the most

2515
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:52,299
likely scenario might actually be if

2516
02:26:49,930 --> 02:26:55,510
Microsoft were to adopt Wilkin they have

2517
02:26:52,299 --> 02:26:57,359
kind of been like more into the open

2518
02:26:55,510 --> 02:27:00,389
source and this sort of things lately

2519
02:26:57,360 --> 02:27:00,390
you know

2520
02:27:02,340 --> 02:27:12,309
so amusingly they may actually I could

2521
02:27:05,409 --> 02:27:13,898
see them doing it before um before Apple

2522
02:27:12,309 --> 02:27:14,799
these days which is kind of funny

2523
02:27:13,898 --> 02:27:17,769
because it used to be the other way

2524
02:27:14,799 --> 02:27:19,148
around right but I could see them doing

2525
02:27:17,770 --> 02:27:20,979
that saying like why are we maintaining

2526
02:27:19,148 --> 02:27:25,000
this separate API like when we're kind

2527
02:27:20,978 --> 02:27:27,959
of open source e these days and so that

2528
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:32,648
could happen I don't know

2529
02:27:27,959 --> 02:27:34,119
Mac like Apple seems really dedicated to

2530
02:27:32,648 --> 02:27:35,289
doing their own thing so I don't know

2531
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:40,689
what's gonna happen there

2532
02:27:35,290 --> 02:27:42,130
I really don't it's it's a mystery what

2533
02:27:40,689 --> 02:27:44,380
I can tell you is it sucks and we have

2534
02:27:42,129 --> 02:27:50,949
so many api's now we've got open jail

2535
02:27:44,379 --> 02:27:56,559
Vulcan metal D 3d custom ones on the

2536
02:27:50,950 --> 02:28:00,520
platforms and stuff right so yeah it's

2537
02:27:56,559 --> 02:28:01,959
dicey so a support really matter that

2538
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:03,670
much seems like actually GPU driver

2539
02:28:01,959 --> 02:28:06,699
vendors who have to curate yeah OS

2540
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:11,770
support matters tremendously it matters

2541
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:14,649
tremendously the the problem is that the

2542
02:28:11,770 --> 02:28:20,319
the operating system plays a huge role

2543
02:28:14,648 --> 02:28:22,180
in how those systems interact with

2544
02:28:20,319 --> 02:28:24,549
everything whether it's like you know

2545
02:28:22,180 --> 02:28:29,889
even things as basic as whether alt-tab

2546
02:28:24,549 --> 02:28:31,659
is working properly right and so you

2547
02:28:29,889 --> 02:28:35,699
really just don't want a position where

2548
02:28:31,659 --> 02:28:38,228
the OS vendor doesn't care about Vulcan

2549
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:40,090
they care about their own API and so

2550
02:28:38,228 --> 02:28:42,279
like multi-monitor doesn't suddenly work

2551
02:28:40,090 --> 02:28:44,728
properly with Vulcan right or you know

2552
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:47,229
all these other sorts of things right

2553
02:28:44,728 --> 02:28:53,438
and so you just really you really want

2554
02:28:47,228 --> 02:28:55,179
the OS vendor to to care about the the

2555
02:28:53,439 --> 02:28:57,729
graphics API that you choose to use you

2556
02:28:55,180 --> 02:29:02,979
really want that to be true

2557
02:28:57,729 --> 02:29:05,739
and you know I just I don't have a

2558
02:29:02,979 --> 02:29:11,170
crystal ball so I just don't know what's

2559
02:29:05,739 --> 02:29:12,670
gonna happen hasn't this have to use the

2560
02:29:11,170 --> 02:29:13,750
platform so VAP I think always been the

2561
02:29:12,670 --> 02:29:16,120
case for multi-platform console games

2562
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:19,899
yeah I mean it's nothing new for game

2563
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:20,980
development right it's nothing new I'm

2564
02:29:19,899 --> 02:29:27,129
just saying that's why just don't get

2565
02:29:20,979 --> 02:29:29,680
the point you know but that could change

2566
02:29:27,129 --> 02:29:32,680
and then it would become more

2567
02:29:29,681 --> 02:29:37,271
interesting API to to put time into

2568
02:29:32,681 --> 02:29:39,399
right as soon as a major platform vendor

2569
02:29:37,271 --> 02:29:42,851
actually said this is you know gonna be

2570
02:29:39,399 --> 02:29:46,869
our API now and maybe Microsoft could do

2571
02:29:42,851 --> 02:29:50,200
that then it becomes possible I it'll

2572
02:29:46,870 --> 02:29:52,630
still suck but at least there's a reason

2573
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:57,780
to use the thing that sucks instead of

2574
02:29:52,629 --> 02:29:57,779
just because well I don't know why

2575
02:30:06,341 --> 02:30:09,851
the next people care a lot about vogue

2576
02:30:07,899 --> 02:30:12,040
if that means thing it doesn't because

2577
02:30:09,851 --> 02:30:13,870
Linux like no one plays games on Linux

2578
02:30:12,040 --> 02:30:18,550
or I should say no one buys games on

2579
02:30:13,870 --> 02:30:20,921
Linux and they always say they do right

2580
02:30:18,550 --> 02:30:26,020
but then when you ship a Linux version

2581
02:30:20,921 --> 02:30:28,601
of your game literally nobody buys it so

2582
02:30:26,021 --> 02:30:30,489
there just isn't a reason to care like

2583
02:30:28,601 --> 02:30:32,980
Linux could be on anything the next

2584
02:30:30,489 --> 02:30:36,181
could could be on any API they wanted it

2585
02:30:32,979 --> 02:30:45,970
would not affect games at all right

2586
02:30:36,181 --> 02:30:46,360
which is unfortunate and it has not made

2587
02:30:45,970 --> 02:30:48,189
a dent

2588
02:30:46,360 --> 02:30:51,909
like literally nobody literally nobody

2589
02:30:48,190 --> 02:30:53,921
has ever been like oh wow that shipping

2590
02:30:51,909 --> 02:30:55,810
the Linux version of our game actually

2591
02:30:53,921 --> 02:30:59,950
paid enough money to be worth the

2592
02:30:55,810 --> 02:31:01,690
porting cost never happened right people

2593
02:30:59,950 --> 02:31:03,881
say it over and over and over again

2594
02:31:01,690 --> 02:31:08,261
every game studio that ever does that

2595
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:12,251
they're like wasn't worth it so that's

2596
02:31:08,261 --> 02:31:14,829
just the way it is and again that too

2597
02:31:12,251 --> 02:31:22,841
could change in any time but it just

2598
02:31:14,829 --> 02:31:24,159
hasn't so there you go and yeah like

2599
02:31:22,841 --> 02:31:25,780
people are saying even Mackeson whereas

2600
02:31:24,159 --> 02:31:28,390
most it's totally true Matt Goss is

2601
02:31:25,780 --> 02:31:30,280
really worth it to Matt Goss is less of

2602
02:31:28,390 --> 02:31:31,690
a concern though because iOS is often

2603
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:34,001
worth it for you depending on what

2604
02:31:31,690 --> 02:31:36,551
you're doing and so porting to metal

2605
02:31:34,001 --> 02:31:41,591
makes some sense because you have to do

2606
02:31:36,550 --> 02:31:44,880
that for iOS anyway so it's you know you

2607
02:31:41,591 --> 02:31:44,881
know it's kind of a different thing but

2608
02:31:58,591 --> 02:32:02,211
alright I'm gonna close it up

2609
02:32:09,819 --> 02:32:13,069
all right thanks everyone for joining

2610
02:32:12,021 --> 02:32:14,600
beforehand my here it's my pleasure

2611
02:32:13,069 --> 02:32:15,739
coding with you as always if you would

2612
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:17,059
like to following stories at home you

2613
02:32:15,739 --> 02:32:19,250
can always prepare the game at hand made

2614
02:32:17,059 --> 02:32:22,069
here org and it comes with a source code

2615
02:32:19,250 --> 02:32:23,540
so you can port it to Vulcan if you want

2616
02:32:22,069 --> 02:32:29,239
to actually you think some people have

2617
02:32:23,540 --> 02:32:30,860
already that's about it for today we

2618
02:32:29,239 --> 02:32:32,719
accomplish basically what we want - it

2619
02:32:30,860 --> 02:32:34,220
looks like the idea of using a fixed

2620
02:32:32,719 --> 02:32:35,750
distance isn't quite right because when

2621
02:32:34,219 --> 02:32:37,849
we do that skew you could see that we

2622
02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:40,521
were still interpenetrating to the

2623
02:32:37,850 --> 02:32:43,729
ground there so I don't know exactly

2624
02:32:40,521 --> 02:32:45,860
what we're gonna do - to fix that

2625
02:32:43,729 --> 02:32:48,920
problem we may have to still use an

2626
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:50,390
adaptive motion which has some issues

2627
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:53,690
for rotation and I'm not sure exactly

2628
02:32:50,389 --> 02:32:56,029
what we should take away from that but

2629
02:32:53,690 --> 02:32:57,050
we'll take a look at it but mostly we're

2630
02:32:56,030 --> 02:32:58,040
pretty much out of the woods on that

2631
02:32:57,049 --> 02:33:00,170
because we're getting some pretty nice

2632
02:32:58,040 --> 02:33:03,021
sorting in there now that's really only

2633
02:33:00,170 --> 02:33:07,700
for those skew vectors that we're really

2634
02:33:03,021 --> 02:33:09,350
having a problem so next week we won't

2635
02:33:07,700 --> 02:33:10,970
do any here oh we're doing a for code

2636
02:33:09,350 --> 02:33:14,420
Jam next week to finish up the for coder

2637
02:33:10,969 --> 02:33:16,340
mods so hopefully you'll stop by for

2638
02:33:14,420 --> 02:33:17,989
that that's not really a stream that's

2639
02:33:16,340 --> 02:33:19,521
just kind of like an all-day thing that

2640
02:33:17,989 --> 02:33:20,780
people come and go for so if you're

2641
02:33:19,521 --> 02:33:22,820
interested in that that'll be happening

2642
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:25,190
next weekend then after that we come

2643
02:33:22,819 --> 02:33:29,299
back the weekend after that's when we'll

2644
02:33:25,190 --> 02:33:31,940
be doing probably some just looking

2645
02:33:29,299 --> 02:33:35,090
through like okay how do we finish

2646
02:33:31,940 --> 02:33:38,090
getting items in to the a suppressor put

2647
02:33:35,090 --> 02:33:40,729
some sound input in there since now we

2648
02:33:38,090 --> 02:33:42,049
have a good place to list them that sort

2649
02:33:40,729 --> 02:33:46,399
of stuff so we can just want to go

2650
02:33:42,049 --> 02:33:47,479
through and and make a list of sort of

2651
02:33:46,399 --> 02:33:51,829
where we're going now because we're

2652
02:33:47,479 --> 02:33:54,649
getting pretty close to everything being

2653
02:33:51,829 --> 02:33:57,500
done it's got to take a look at what's

2654
02:33:54,649 --> 02:33:59,029
not in there right and at some point

2655
02:33:57,500 --> 02:34:01,579
we've got to decide to spend another few

2656
02:33:59,030 --> 02:34:03,470
weeks on lighting to get that really

2657
02:34:01,579 --> 02:34:05,719
straightened out and hammered out so

2658
02:34:03,469 --> 02:34:07,359
that's it we'll be back for some

2659
02:34:05,719 --> 02:34:09,109
pathfinding two weeks from now

2660
02:34:07,360 --> 02:34:13,220
pathfinding for the project not

2661
02:34:09,110 --> 02:34:14,900
pathfinding like AI and hope see some of

2662
02:34:13,219 --> 02:34:17,539
